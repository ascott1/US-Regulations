                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, May 1, 2001), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

any contract or agreement for sale or lease.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
2502-0243)

[45 FR 40479, June 13, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 31368, Aug. 6, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 1710.4  Exemptions--general.

    (a) The exemptions available under Secs. 1710.5 through 1710.16 are 
not applicable when the method of sale, lease or other disposition of 
land or an interest in land is adopted for the purpose of evasion of the 
Act.
    (b) With the exception of the sales or leases which are exempt under 
Sec. 1710.5, the anti-fraud provisions of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1703(a)(2)) 
apply to exempt transactions. The anti-fraud provisions make it unlawful 
for a developer or agent to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to:
    (1) Defraud;
    (2) To obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of 
a material fact, or

[[Page 9]]

    (3) To omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the 
statements made not misleading, with respect to any information 
pertinent to the lot or subdivision; or
    (4) To engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business 
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser.
    (c) The anti-fraud provisions of the Act require that certain 
representations be included in the contract in transactions which are 
not exempt under Sec. 1710.5. Specifically, the Act requires that if a 
developer or agent represents that roads, sewers, water, gas or electric 
service or recreational amenities will be provided or completed by the 
developer, the contract must stipulate that the services or amenities 
will be provided or completed. See Sec. 1715.15(f).
    (d) Eligibility for exemptions available under Secs. 1710.5 through 
1710.14 is self-determining. With the exception of the exemptions 
available under Secs. 1710.15 and 1710.16, a developer is not required 
to file notice with or obtain the approval of the Secretary in order to 
take advantage of an exemption. If a developer elects to take advantage 
of an exemption, the developer is responsible for maintaining records to 
demonstrate that the requirements of the exemption have been met.
    (e) A developer may present evidence, or otherwise discuss, in an 
informal hearing before the OILSR Administrator or designee, the 
Department's position on the jurisdiction or non-exempt status of a 
particular subdivision.

Sec. 1710.5  Statutory exemptions from the provisions of this chapter.

    A listing of the statutory exemptions is contained in 15 U.S.C. 
1703. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1703(a)(2), if the sale involves a 
condominium or multi-unit construction, a presale clause conditioning 
the sale of a unit on a certain percentage of sales of other units is 
permissible if it is legally binding on the parties and is for a period 
not to exceed 180 days. However, the 180-day provision cannot extend the 
2-year period for performance. The permissible 180 days is calculated 
from the date the first purchaser signs a sales contract in the project 
or, if a phased project, from the date the first purchaser signs the 
first sales contract in each phase.

    (a) The sale of lots is exempt from the registration requirements of 
the Act if, beginning with the first sale after June 20, 1980, no more 
than twelve lots in the subdivision are sold in the subsequent twelve-
month period. Thereafter, the sale of the first twelve lots is exempt

leased in the subdivision after June 20, 1980, are counted, whether or 
not the transactions are otherwise exempt. Sales or leases made prior to 
June 21, 1980, are not considered in determining eligibility for the 
exemption.
    (d) The sale must also comply with the anti-fraud provisions of 
Sec. 1710.4 (b) and (c) of this part.

Sec. 1710.10  Single-family residence exemption.

    (a) General. The sale of a lot which meets the requirements 
specified under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is exempt from 
the registration requirements of the Act.
    (b) Subdivision requirements. (1) The subdivision must meet all 
local codes and standards.
    (2) In the promotion of the subdivision there must be no offers, by 
direct mail or telephone solicitation, of gifts, trips, dinners or use 
of similar promotional techniques to induce prospective purchasers to 
visit the subdivision or to purchase a lot.
    (c) Lot requirements. (1) The lot must be located within a 
municipality or county where a unit of local government or the State 
specifies minimum standards in the following areas for the development 
of subdivision lots taking place within its boundaries:
    (i) Lot dimensions.
    (ii) Plat approval and recordation.
    (iii) Roads and access.
    (iv) Drainage.
    (v) Flooding.
    (vi) Water supply.
    (vii) Sewage disposal.
    (2) Each lot sold under the exemption must be either zoned for 
single-family residences or, in the absence of a zoning ordinance, 
limited exclusively by enforceable covenants or restrictions to single-
family residences. Manufactured homes, townhouses, and residences for 
one-to-four family use are considered single-family residences for 
purposes of this exemption provision.
    (3) The lot must be situated on a paved street or highway which has 
been built to standards established by the State or the unit of local 
government in which the subdivision is located. If the roads are to be 
public roads they must be acceptable to the unit of local government 
that will be responsible for maintenance. If the street or highway is 
not complete, the developer must post a bond or other surety acceptable 
to the municipality or county in the full amount of the cost of 
completing the street or highway to assure completion to local 
standards. For purposes of this exemption, paved means concrete or 
pavement with a bituminous surface that is impervious to water, protects 
the base and is durable under the traffic load and maintenance 
contemplated.
    (4) The unit of local government or a homeowners association must 
have accepted or be obligated to accept the responsibility for 
maintaining the street or highway upon which the lot is situated. In any 
case in which a homeowners association has accepted or is obligated to 
accept maintenance responsibility, the developer must, prior to signing 
of a contract or agreement to purchase, provide the purchaser with a 
good faith written estimate of the cost of carrying out the 
responsibility over the first ten years of ownership.
    (5) At the time of closing, potable water, sanitary sewage disposal, 
and electricity must be extended to the lot

[[Page 11]]

or the unit of local government must be obligated to install the 
facilities within 180 days following closing. For subdivisions which 
will not have a central water or sewage disposal system, there must be 
assurances that an adequate potable water supply is available year-round 
and that the lot is approved for the installation of a septic tank.
    (6) The contract of sale must require delivery within 180 days after 
the signing of the sales contract of a warranty deed, which at the time 
of delivery is free from monetary liens and encumbrances. If a warranty 
deed is not commonly used in the jurisdiction where the lot is located, 
a deed or grant which warrants that the seller has not conveyed the lot 
to another person may be delivered in lieu of a warranty deed. The deed 
or grant used must warrant that the lot is free from encumbrances made 
by the seller or any other person claiming by, through, or under the 
seller.
    (7) At the time of closing, a title insurance binder or title 
opinion reflecting the condition of title must be in existence and 
issued or presented to the purchaser showing that, subject only to 
exceptions which are approved in writing by the purchaser at the time of 
closing, marketable title to the lot is vested in the seller.
    (8) The purchaser or purchaser's spouse must make a personal, on-
the-lot inspection of the lot purchased prior to signing a contract or 
agreement to purchase.
    (d) The sale must also comply with the anti-fraud provisions of 
Sec. 1710.4 (b) and (c) of this part.

Sec. 1710.12  Intrastate exemption.

    (a) Eligibility requirements. The sale of a lot is exempt from the 
registration requirements of the Act if the following requirements are 
met:

[[Page 12]]

    (1) The sale of lots in the subdivision after December 20, 1979, is 
restricted solely to residents of the State in which the subdivision is 
located unless the sale is exempt under Sec. 1710.5, Sec. 1710.11 or 
Sec. 1710.13.
    (2) The purchaser or purchaser's spouse makes a personal on-the-lot 
inspection of the lot to be purchased before signing a contract.
    (3) Each contract--
    (i) Specifies the developer's and purchaser's responsibilities for 
providing and maintaining roads, water and sewer facilities and any 
existing or promised amenities;
    (ii) Contains a good faith estimate of the year in which the roads, 
water and sewer facilities and promised amenities will be completed; and
    (iii) Contains a non-waivable provision giving the purchaser the 
opportunity to revoke the contract until at least midnight of the 
seventh calendar day following the date the purchaser signed the 
contract. If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by 
operation of State law, that period becomes the Federal revocation 
period and the contract must reflect the requirements of the longer 
period.
    (4) The lot being sold is free and clear of all liens, encumbrances 
and adverse claims except the following:
    (i) Mortgages or deeds of trust which contain release provisions for 
the individual lot purchased if--
    (A) The contract of sale obligates the developer to deliver, within 
180 days, a warranty deed (or its equivalent under local law), which at 
the time of delivery is free from any monetary liens or encumbrances; 
and
    (B) The purchaser's payments are deposited in an escrow account 
independent of the developer until a deed is delivered.
    (ii) Liens which are subordinate to the leasehold interest and do 
not affect the lessee's right to use or enjoy the lot.
    (iii) Property reservations which are for the purpose of bringing 
public services to the land being developed, such as easements for water 
and sewer lines.
    (iv) Taxes or assessments which constitute liens before they are due 
and payable if imposed by a State or other public body having authority 
to assess and tax property or by a property owners' association.
    (v) Beneficial property restrictions that are mutually enforceable 
by the lot owners in the subdivision. Restrictions, whether separately 
recorded or incorporated into individual deeds, must be applied 
uniformly to every lot or group of lots. To be considered beneficial and 
enforceable, any restriction or covenant that imposes an assessment on 
lot owners must apply to the developer on the same basis as other lot 
owners. Developers who maintain control of a subdivision through a 
Property Owners' Association, Architectural Control Committee, 
restrictive covenant or otherwise, shall transfer such control to the 
lot owners no later than when the developer ceases to own a majority of 
total lots in, or planned for, the subdivision. Relinquishment of 
developer control shall require affirmative action, usually in the form 
of an election based upon one vote per lot.
    (vi) Reservations contained in United States land patents and 
similar Federal grants or reservations.
    (5) Prior to the sale the developer discloses in a written statement 
to the purchaser all qualifying liens, reservations, taxes, assessments 
and restrictions applicable to the lot purchased. The developer must 
obtain a written receipt from the purchaser acknowledging that the 
statement required by this subparagraph was delivered to the purchaser.
    (6) Prior to the sale the developer provides in a written statement 
good faith estimates of the cost to the purchaser of providing electric, 
water, sewer, gas and telephone service to the lot. The estimates for 
unsold lots must be updated every two years or more frequently if the 
developer has reason to believe that significant cost increases have 
occurred. The dates on which the estimates were made must be included in 
the statement. The developer must obtain a written receipt from the 
purchaser acknowledging that the statement required by this subparagraph 
was delivered to the purchaser.
    (b) Intrastate Exemption Statement. To satisfy the requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, an

[[Page 13]]

Intrastate Exemption Statement containing the information prescribed in 
each such paragraph shall be given to each purchaser. A State-approved 
disclosure document may be used to satisfy this requirement if all the 
information required by paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section is 
included in this disclosure. In such a case, the developer must obtain a 
written receipt from the purchaser and comply with all other 
requirements of the exemption. To be acceptable for purposes of the 
exemption, the statement(s) given to purchasers must contain neither 
advertising nor promotion on behalf of the developer or subdivision nor 
references to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A 
sample Intrastate Exemption Statement is included in the exemption 
guidelines.
    (c) The sale must also comply with the anti-fraud provisions of 
Sec. 1710.4 (b) and (c) of this part.

    (ii) Contains a good faith estimate of the year in which the roads, 
water and sewer facilities and promised amenities will be completed;
    (iii) Contains a nonwaivable provision giving the purchaser the

period and the contract must reflect the requirements of the longer

mortgages, deeds of trust, tax liens, mechanics' liens, or judgments.

by the lot owners in the subdivision. Restrictions, whether separately 
recorded or incorporated into individual deeds, must be applied 
uniformly to every lot or group of lots. To be considered beneficial and

lot owners must apply to the developer on the same basis as other lot 
owners. Developers who maintain

[[Page 14]]

control of a subdivision through a Property Owners' Association, 
Architectural Control Committee, restrictive covenants, or otherwise, 
shall transfer such control to the lot owners no later than when the 
developer ceases to own a majority of total lots in, or planned for, the 
subdivision. Relinquishment of developer control shall require 
affirmative action, usually in the form of an election based upon one 
vote per lot.
    (vi) Reservations contained in United States land patents and 
similar Federal grants or reservations.
    (7) Before the sale the developer gives a written MSA Exemption 
Statement to the purchaser and obtains a written receipt acknowledging

electric, water, sewer, gas and telephone service to the lot. The

increases have occurred. The dates on which the estimates were made must 
be included in the statement.
    (8) The developer executes and gives to the purchaser a written 
instrument designating a person within the State of residence of the 
purchaser as the developer's agent for service of process. The developer 
must also acknowledge in writing that it submits to the legal 
jurisdiction of the State in which the purchaser or lessee resides.
    (9) The developer executes a written affirmation for each sale made 
under this exemption. By January 31 of each year, the developer submits 
to the Secretary a copy of the executed affirmation for each sale made 
during the preceding calendar year or a master affirmation in which are 
listed all purchasers' names and addresses and the identity of the lots 
purchased. Individual affirmations must be available for the Secretary's

Sec. 1710.14  Regulatory exemptions.

    (a) Eligibility requirements. The following transactions are exempt 
from the registration requirements of the

[[Page 15]]

Act unless the Secretary has terminated the exemption in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) The sale of lots, each of which will be sold for less than $100, 
including closing costs, if the purchaser will not be required to 
purchase more than one lot.
    (2) The lease of lots for a term not to exceed five years if the 
terms of the lease do not obligate the lessee to renew.
    (3) The sale of lots to a person who is engaged in a bona fide land 
sales business.
    (4) The sale of a lot to a person who owns the contiguous lot which 
has a residential, commercial or industrial building on it.

    (6) The sale of a lot to a person who has leased and resided 
primarily on the lot for at least the year preceeding the sale.

that exemption from the registration requirements in a particular case 
is not in the public interest, the Secretary may, after issuing a notice 
and giving the respondent an opportunity to request a hearing within 
fifteen days of receipt of the notice, terminate eligiblity for 
exemption. The basis for issuing a notice may be the conduct of the 
developer or agent, such as unlawful conduct or insolvency, or adverse 
information about the lots or real estate that should be disclosed to 
the purchasers. Proceedings will be governed by Sec. 1720.238.
    (c) The sale must also comply with the anti-fraud provisions of

Likewise, the sale of lots in a site containing fewer than 100 lots,

or agreement, the contract or agreement of sale may be cancelled at your 
option for two years from the date of signing.


If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by operation 
of state or local law, that period becomes the Federal revocation period 
and the contract must reflect the requirement of the longer period 
rather than the seven days. The revocation provisions may not be limited 
or qualified in the contract or other document by requiring a specific 
type of notice or by requiring that notice be given at a specified 
place.
    (ii) Obligate the developer to deliver, within 180 days, a warranty 
deed (or its equivalent under local law) for the lot which at the time

the developer discloses in a written Lot Information Statement the name, 
address and telephone number of the local governmental agency or 
agencies from which information on permits or other requirements for 
water, sewer and electrical installations can be obtained. This 
Statement will also contain the name, address and telephone number of 
the suppliers which would or could provide the foregoing services.
    (10) The lot sale must comply with the anti-fraud provisions of 24 
CFR 1710.4 (b) and (c) and the sales practices and standards in 24 CFR

    (11) A written Lot Information Statement must be delivered to, and 
acknowledged by, each purchaser prior to his or her signing a contract 
or agreement of sale, and must contain the information shown in the 
format below. The Statement must be typed or printed in at least 10 
point font. A copy of the acknowledgement will be maintained by the 
developer for three years and will be made available to OILSR upon 
request. If the Statement is not delivered as required, the contract or 
agreement of sale may be revoked and a full refund paid, at the option 
of the purchaser, within two years of the signing date and the contract 
or agreement of sale will clearly provide this right.

                              Sample Format

    (Use of the following headings and first paragraph are mandatory.)

                        Lot Information Statement

            Important: Read Carefully Before Signing Anything

    The developer has obtained a regulatory exemption from registration 
under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act. One requirement of 
that exemption is that you must receive this Statement prior to the time 
you sign an agreement (contract) to purchase a lot.

                             Right to Cancel

    (Under this heading the developer is to state the specific 
rescission rights provided for in the contract pursuant to 
1710.15(b)(5)(i)).

                           Risk of Buying Land

    (Under this heading the developer is to list the following 
information:)
    There are certain risks in purchasing real estate that you should be 
aware of. The following are some of those risks:
    The future value of land is uncertain and dependent upon many 
factors. Do not expect all land to automatically increase in value.
    Any value which your lot may have will be affected if roads, 
utilities and/or amenities cannot be completed or maintained.
    Any development will likely have some impact on the surrounding 
environment. Development which adversely affects the environment may 
cause governmental agencies to impose restriction on the use of the 
land.
    In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must be 
met to assure that you receive proper title and that you will be able to 
use the land for its intended purpose. Since this purchase involves a

[[Page 17]]

major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek professional 
advice before you obligate yourself.
    If adequate provisions have not been made for maintenance of the 
roads or if the land is not served by publicly maintained roads, you may 
have to maintain the roads at your expense.
    If the land is not served by a central sewage system and/or water 
system, you should contact the local authorities to determine whether a 
permit will be given for an on-site sewage disposal system and/or well 
and whether there is an adequate supply of water. You should also become 
familiar with the requirements for, and the cost of, obtaining 
electrical service to the lot.

                          Developer Information

    (Under this heading the developer is to list the following 
information:)

Developer's Name:_______________________________________________________
Address:________________________________________________________________
Telephone Number:_______________________________________________________

                             Lot Information

    (Under this heading the developer is to list the following 
information:)

Lot Location:___________________________________________________________
    (Enter a statement disclosing all liens, reservations, taxes, 
assessments, easements and restrictions applicable to the lot. A copy of 
the restrictions may be attached in lieu of recitation.)

              Suppliers of Utilities and Issuers of Permits

    (Under this heading the developer is to list the name, address and 
phone number of the appropriate governmental agency or agencies, if any, 
that will provide information on permits or other requirements for 
water, sewer and electrical installations. The information will also 
contain the name, address and telephone number of the suppliers of such 
utilities which can provide information to the purchaser on costs and 
availability of such services. A chart similar to the one below may be 
used to supply this information.
    Listed below are contact points for determining permit requirements, 
if any, and to obtain information on approximate costs and availability 
for the listed services:

[[Page 18]]


    (2) This exemption will become effective upon issuance of an 
Exemption Order by the Secretary.
    (d) Annual Report. (1) By January 31 of each year the developer will 
send a report to the Secretary listing each site and its location 
available for a sale pursuant to the exemption during the preceding year 
and indicate the number of lot sales made in each site. The report will 
describe any changes in the information provided in the Request for the 
Multiple Site Subdivision Exemption or contain a statement that there 
are no changes.
    (2) The Annual Report must be accompanied by a filing fee of $100.
    (3) The Annual Report must be signed and dated by the developer, 
attesting to its completeness and accuracy.

receipt of notice from the Secretary will automatically terminate 
eligibility for the exemption as of the Report due date.
    (e) Termination. If, subsequent to the issuance of an Exemption

from the registration requirements in the particular case is not in the 
public interest, the Secretary may, after issuing a notice and giving 
the respondent an opportunity to request a hearing within fifteen days 
of receipt of the notice, terminate the exemption order. The basis for 
issuing a notice may be apparent omissions or misrepresentations in the 
documents submitted to the Secretary, the conduct of the developer or 
agent, such as unlawful conduct or insolvency, or adverse information 
about the real estate that should be disclosed to purchasers. 
Proceedings will be governed by 24 CFR 1720.238.

Sec. 1710.16  Regulatory exemption--determination required.

    (a) General. The Secretary may exempt from the registration 
requirements of the Act any subdivision or lots in a subdivision by 
issuing an order in writing if it is determined that registration is not 
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of purchasers on 
the basis of the small amount or limited character of the offering and 
the requirements contained in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Eligibility requirements. An exemption order may be issued at 
the discretion of the Secretary on the basis of the small amount or 
limited character of the offering if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The subdivision or sales substantially meet the requirements of 
one of the exemptions available under this chapter.

    (i) Specifies the developer's and purchaser's responsibilities for 
providing and maintaining roads, water and sewer facilities and any 
existing or promised amenities;
    (ii) Contains a good faith estimate of the year in which the roads, 
water and sewer facilities and promised amenities will be completed;
    (iii) Contains a non-waivable provision giving the purchaser the 
opportunity to revoke the contract until at least midnight of the 
seventh calendar day following the date the purchaser signed the 
contract. If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by 
operation of State law, that period becomes the Federal revocation 
period and the contract must reflect the requirements of the longer 
period.
    (iv) Contains a provision that obligates the developer to deliver to 
the purchaser within 180 days of the date the purchaser signed the sales 
contract, a warranty deed, or its equivalent under local law, which at 
the time of delivery is free from any monetary liens or encumbrances.
    (3) The purchaser or purchaser's spouse makes a personal on-the-lot 
inspection of the lot to be purchased before signing a contract.
    (4) The developer files a request for an exemption order and 
supporting documentation in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section and submits a filing fee of $500.00 in accordance with 
Sec. 1710.35(a) of this part. This fee is not refundable.

Sec. 1710.21  Effective dates.

    (a) General. The effective date of an initial, consolidated or 
amended Statement of Record is the 30th day after the filing of the 
latest amendatory material unless the Secretary notifies the developer 
in writing prior to such 30th day that:
    (1) The effective date has been suspended in accordance with 
Sec. 1710.45(a), or
    (2) An earlier effective date has been determined.
    (b) Suspension of effective date by developer. (1) A developer, or 
owner, may request that the effective date of its Statement of Record be 
suspended, provided there are no administrative proceedings pending 
against either of them at the time the request is submitted. The request 
must include any consolidations or amendments which have been made to 
the initial Statement of Record. Forms for this purpose will be 
furnished by the Secretary upon request.

[[Page 21]]

    (2) Upon acceptance by the Secretary, the effectiveness of the 
Statement of Record shall be suspended as of the date the request was

compliance with the Regulations which are in effect on the date of the 
amendments and the Secretary allows those amendments to become

<R05>
Sec. 1710.22  Statement of record--initial or consolidated.

    (a) Initial Statement of Record. (1) Except in the case of exempt 
transactions, an initial Statement of Record shall be filed, and an 
effective date issued, prior to selling or leasing any lot in a 
subdivision.
    (2) If a developer buys from another developer 100 or more lots from 
an existing registration, the new developer, or owner, may have to 
submit a new initial Statement of Record and receive an effective date 
covering the acquired lots prior to selling or leasing any of those 
lots.
    (3) Changes in principals due to a sale of stock in a corporation or 
changes in partners or joint venturers which are accomplished in 
accordance with the partnership or joint venture agreement but which do 
not cause a change in the title to the land in the subdivision may be 
submitted as an amendment.
    (4) Any initial Statement of Record must be accompanied by a fee, as 
specified in Sec. 1710.35(b), based upon the number of lots sought to be 
registered.
    (b) Consolidated Statement of Record. (1) If the developer intends 
to sell or lease additional lots as part of the same common promotional 
plan with lots already registered, a consolidated Statement of Record 
may be submitted for the additional lots. A fee, as specified in 
Sec. 1710.35(b) and based on the number of additional lots, must 
accompany the submission. The additional lots may not be sold or leased 
until a new effective date is issued.
    (2) If the additional lots are simply the result of a replatting of 
lots previously registered and enumerated in the Property Report and do 
not include any additional land, the change may be made by an amendment. 
However, the amendment must be accompanied by a fee, as specified in 
Sec. 1710.35(b), based on the number of additional lots.
    (c) Consolidated Statement of Record--Form. A consolidated Statement 
of Record shall contain:
    (1) Those pages of the Property Report portion and Additional 
Information and Documention portion which contain changes which have 
occurred since the last effective submission, and
    (2) A recapitulation or listing of each of the section headings, and 
subheadings if necessary, of the Additional Information and 
Documentation portion. Each item of the listing shall contain a 
statement as to whether or not any change is made in the section; 
whether any new or additional information is being submitted and, if 
documentation is incorporated by cross reference, the previous 
submission in which that documentation may be found, and
    (3) Documentation to support the additional lots (e.g., plat maps, 
topographic maps and general plan to reflect new lots, title 
information, permits for additional facilities, financial assurances of 
completion of additional facilities, financial statements) or updated or 
expanded documents in support of previous submissions, and
    (4) The affirmation required by Sec. 1710.219.

Pages having no changes and documents in previous submissions which 
apply equally to the additional lots may be incorporated by reference. 
However, the developer may, at its option, submit the entire format for 
an initial filing, including copies of previously submitted documents, 
to expedite the examination process.
    (d) Consolidated Statement of Record amends prior Statement of 
Record. A Consolidated Statement of Record shall contain all applicable 
information for all registered lots in the subdivision except those 
deleted pursuant to other provisions in these regulations. The resulting 
Property Report shall be used for all sales in the subdivision, except

[[Page 22]]

for those transactions which are exempt from the provisions of the Act 
or which have been granted an exempt status by the Secretary, unless the 
Secretary has specifically authorized the use of multiple Property 
Reports.
    (e) Initial Statement of Record--when prior approval to submit is 
required. In those subdivisions where there is a disparity between the 
lots already registered and those sought to be registered because of 
location, terrain, proposed use of the lots or the amenities to be 
furnished or available, the developer may present a resume of the 
differences and request the Secretary's permission to file a separate 
initial Statement of Record for the additional lots. Upon consideration 
of the facts submitted, the Secretary may allow such a procedure.
    (f) Lots which have been deleted from registration. Should the 
developer, for any reason, delete by amendment any registered lots from 
an effective Statement of Record, those lots must be reregistered by a 
consolidation and a new effective date issued, before they can be sold 
or leased. An appropriate fee must accompany the submission.
    (g) Lots sold to individual purchasers. It is not necessary to 
delete from the registration those lots which have been sold to 
individual purchasers for their own use.

Sec. 1710.45  Suspensions.

    (a) Suspension notice--prior to effective date. (1) If it appears to 
the Secretary that a Statement of Record or an amendment is on its face 
incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Secretary shall so 
advise the developer, by issuing a suspension notice, within a 
reasonable time after the filing of such materials but prior to the time 
the materials would otherwise be effective.
    (2) A suspension notice issued pursuant to this subsection shall 
suspend the effective date of the Statement of Record or the amendment. 
It shall continue in effect until 30 days, or such earlier date as the 
Secretary may determine, after the necessary amendments are submitted 
which correct all deficiencies cited in the notice.
    (3) Upon receipt of a suspension notice, the developer has 15 days 
in which to request a hearing. If a hearing is requested, it shall be 
held within 20 days of the receipt of the request by the Secretary.
    (b) Suspension orders--subsequent to effective date. (1) A notice of 
proceedings to suspend an effective Statement of Record may be issued to 
a developer if the Secretary has reasonable grounds to believe that an 
effective Statement of Record includes an untrue statement of a material 
fact, or omits a material fact required by the Act or rules and 
regulations, or omits a material fact which is necessary to make the 
statements therein not misleading. The Secretary may, after notice, and 
after opportunity for a hearing requested pursuant to Sec. 1720.220 
within 15 days of receipt of such notice, issue an order suspending the 
Statement of Record. In the event that a suspension order is issued, 
such order shall remain in effect until the developer has amended the 
Statement of Record or otherwise complied with the requirements of the 
order. When the developer has complied with the requirements of the 
order, the Secretary shall so declare and thereupon the suspension order 
shall cease to be effective.
    (2) If the Secretary undertakes an examination of a developer or its 
records to determine whether a suspension order should be issued, and 
the developer fails to cooperate with the Secretary or obstructs, or 
refuses to permit the Secretary to make such examination, the Secretary 
may issue an order suspending the Statement of Record. Such order shall 
remain in effect until the developer has complied with the requirements 
of the order. When the developer has complied with the requirements of 
the order, the Secretary shall so declare and thereupon the suspension 
order shall cease to be effective. In accordance with the procedure 
described in Sec. 1720.235, a hearing may be requested.
    (3) Upon receipt of an amendment to an effective Statement of 
Record, the Secretary may issue an order suspending the Statement of 
Record until

[[Page 24]]

the amendment becomes effective if the Secretary has reasonable grounds 
to believe that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest or for the protection of purchasers. In accordance with the 
procedure described in Sec. 1720.235, a hearing may be requested.
    (4) Suspension orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall 
operate to suspend the Statement of Record as of the date the order is 
either served on the developer or its registered agent or is delivered 
by certified or registered mail to the address of the developer or its 
authorized agent.

Sec. 1710.102  General instructions for completing the Statement of Record.

    (a) Paper and type. The Statement of Record shall be on good 
quality, unglazed white or pastel paper. Letter size paper, 
approximately 8 x 11 inches in size, will be used for the Property 
Report portion and legal size paper, approximately 8\1/2\ x 14 inches in 
size, will be used for the Additional Information and Documentation 
portion. Side margins shall be no less than 1 inch and no greater than 
1\1/2\ inches. Top and bottom margins shall be no less than 1

[[Page 25]]

inch. In the preparation of the charts to be included in the Property 
Report, the developer may vary from the above margin requirements or 
print the charts lengthwise on the required size paper if such measures 
are necessary to make the charts readable. The Statement of Record shall 
be prepared in an easily readable style of elite or pica or similar type 
of uniform font in blue, black or blueblack ink.
    (b) Numbering and dating. Each page of the Statement of Record as 
submitted to OILSR shall be numbered and shall include the date of 
typing or preparation in the lower right hand corner, except in the 
final printed version of the Property Report portion.
    (c) Signing. The Statement of Record shall be signed by the senior 
executive officer of the developer or a designated agent.
    (d) Printing. The Statement of Record and, insofar as practical, all 
papers and documents filed as a part thereof, shall be printed, 
lithographed, photocopied, typewritten or prepared by any similar 
process which, in the opinion of the Secretary, produces copies suitable 
for a permanent record. Irrespective of the process used, all copies of 
any such materials shall be clear and easily readable.
    (e) Headings, subheadings, captions, introductory paragraphs, 
warnings. Property Report subject ``headings'' are those descriptive 
introductory words which appear immediately after section numbers 
1710.106 through 1710.116 (e.g. Sec. 1710.108 has ``General 
Information'' and Sec. 1710.111 has ``Utilities''). Each such heading 
shall be printed in the Property Report in underlined capital letters 
and centered at the top of a new page. Section numbers shall not be 
printed in the Property Report. Property Report subheadings are those 
descriptive introductory words which appear in italics in the 
regulations at the beginning of paragraphs designated by paragraph 
letters (a), (b), (c) etc. An example of a subheading is ``water'' found 
immediately after the paragraph letter (a) in Sec. 1710.111. These 
subheadings will be printed in the Property Report only if they are 
relevant to the subject subdivision. If printed these subheadings shall 
be capitalized and shall begin at the left hand margin of the page. 
Property Report ``captions'' are those descriptive introductory words 
which appear in italics in the Regulations at the beginning of 
subparagraphs designated by numbers (1), (2), (3), etc. An example of 
such captions is ``Sales Contract and Delivery of Deed'' found 
immediately after the subparagraph number ``(1)'' in Sec. 1710.109 (b). 
These captions are to be printed in the Property Report only if they are 
applicable to the subject subdivision. If printed, these captions shall 
be centered on the page from the side margins, and shall have only the 
first letter of each word capitalized. Headings and subheadings will be 
used in the Property Report in accordance with the sample page appearing 
in Sec. 1710.102. Introductory paragraphs will follow headings if they 
are applicable and necessary for a readable entry into the subject 
matters, but note, the introductory paragraphs for ``Title to the 
Property and Land Use'' are to be used in every case as provided in 
Sec. 1710.109(a)(1). Subheadings and captions which do not apply to the 
subdivision should be omitted from the Property Report portion and 
answered ``not applicable'' in the Additional Information and 
Documentation portion, unless specifically required to be included 
elsewhere in these instructions. Warnings shall be printed substantially 
as they appear in the instructions in Secs. 1710.105 through 1710.118. 
They shall be printed in capital letters and enclosed in a box as shown 
on the sample page in Sec. 1710.102. The paragraphs in the Property 
Report portion need not be numbered.

                               Sample Page

                                  roads

    Here we discuss the roads that lead to the subdivision, those within 
the subdivision and the location of nearby communities.

ACCESS TO THE SUBDIVISION.

    County road 43 leads to the subdivision. It has two lanes and the 
width of the wearing surface is 22 feet. It's paved with a macadam 
surface.

    This road is maintained by Bottineau County with County funds. No 
improvements are planned at this time.

ACCESS WITHIN THE SUBDIVISION.

    The roads within the subdivision will be located on rights of way 
dedicated to the public.

    We are responsible for constructing the interior roads. There will 
be no additional cost to you for this construction.

    WE HAVE NOT SET ASIDE ANY FUNDS IN AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT OR 
MADE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSURE COMPLETION OF THE ROADS, 
SO THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE ROADS.

    At present, the roads are under construction and do not provide 
access to the lots in Units 2 and 3 during wet weather. The succeeding 
chart describes their present condition and estimated completion dates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Language style. All information given in the Property Report 
portion shall be stated in narrative form using plain, concise, everyday 
language which can be readily understood by purchasers who are 
unfamiliar with real estate transactions. Excessively long paragraphs 
should be avoided. Keep them as brief as possible. Use separate 
paragraphs for different points discussed. Disclose all pertinent facts. 
Potential consequences to a purchaser must be made clear even though not 
specifically asked for in the format and the instructions. In the 
Property Report the pronouns ``you'' and ``your'' shall generally be 
used in referring to

[[Page 27]]

the prospective purchaser and the pronouns ``we'', ``us'', and ``our'' 
shall generally be used in referring to the developer. The Secretary 
specifically reserves the right to require modification of the text when 
the narrative does not meet the standards of this section.
    (g) Format of the Additional Information and Documentation portion 
of the Statement of Record. The supporting information and documentation 
required by these regulations shall be identified by affixing a tab on 
the right side of the cover sheet of the required information or 
documentation and by identifying on the tab the section number of the 
Statement of Record instructions to which the information or 
documentation corresponds. This information or documentation shall then 
be placed immediately after the page(s) on which the section number and 
answers for that section appear. If the data in a document is applicable 
to more than one section of instructions, the developer may substitute 
as a document in the second case a statement incorporating the earlier 
document by reference. Deeds, title policies, subdivision plats or maps 
and other documentary information required to be contained in the 
Additional Information and Documentation portion of the Statement of 
Record need not be on the same size paper as the Statement of Record 
but, if larger, shall be folded to a size no larger than 8\1/2\  x  14 
inches. Supporting documents shall be inserted into the binding in such 
a manner as to permit them to be examined without the necessity of 
removing them from the binding. This may be accomplished by proper 
folding or through the use of envelopes.
    (h) Binding. The Statement of Record shall be bound with the 
Property Report portion on top, including any documents which may be 
required to be attached when delivered to the purchaser, followed by the 
Additional Information and Documentation portion.
    (i) Advertising and promotional material. No advertising, or 
promotional material or statements which are self-serving on behalf of 
the developer or owner may be included in the Statement of Record or 
resulting Property Report.
    (j) Additional information. (1) In addition to the information 
expressly required to be stated in the Statement of Record, there shall 
be added, and the Secretary may require, such further material 
information, documentation and certification as may be necessary in the 
public interest and for the protection of purchasers or necessary in 
order to make the statements not misleading in the light of 
circumstances under which they are made.
    (2) The instructions are not all inclusive. The developer shall 
include any other facts which would have a bearing upon the use by the 
purchaser of any of the facilities, services or amenities; which would 
cause or result in additional expenses to the purchaser; which would 
have an effect upon the use and enjoyment of the lot by the purchaser 
for the purpose for which it is sold or which would adversely affect the 
value of the lot.
    (k) Modification of format or content. The Secretary may require or 
permit modification to the content and format of the Property Report to 
include additional information, to modify or omit required information, 
or to change the sequence or position of information when such changes 
are deemed to be in the public interest or for the protection of 
purchasers.
    (l) Required documentation. Where the documentation required by the 
Statement of Record cannot be obtained, the Secretary may permit the 
best available alternative documentation to be substituted.
    (m) Final version of property report. On the date that a Statement 
of Record becomes effective, the Property Report portion shall become 
the Property Report for the subject subdivision. The version of the 
Property Report delivered to prospective lot purchasers shall be 
verbatim to that found effective by the Secretary and shall have no 
covers, pictures, emblems, logograms or identifying insignia other than 
as required by these regulations. It shall meet the same standards as to 
grade of paper, type size, margins, style and color of print as those 
set herein for the Statement of Record, except where required otherwise 
by these regulations. However, the date of typing or preparation of the 
pages and the OILSR number

[[Page 28]]

shall not appear in the final version. If the final version of the 
Property Report is commercially printed, or photocopied by a process 
which results in a commercial printing quality, and is bound on the left 
side, both sides of the pages may be used for printed material. If it is 
typed or photocopied by a process which does not result in a clear and 
legible product on both sides of the page or is bound at the top, 
printing shall be done on only one side of the page. Three copies of the 
final version of the Property Report, in the exact form in which it is 
delivered to prospective lot purchasers, shall be sent to this Office 
within 20 days of the date on which the Statement of Record, amendment, 
or consolidation is allowed to become effective by the Secretary. If a 
Property Report in a foreign language is used as required by 
Sec. 1715.25(g), three copies of that Property Report together with 
copies of the translated documents shall be furnished the Secretary 
within 20 days of the date on which the advertising is first used. A 
Property Report prepared pursuant to these regulations shall not be 
distributed to potential lot purchasers until after the Statement of 
Record of which it is a part or any amendment to that Statement of 
Record has been made effective by the Secretary.

Sec. 1710.103  Developer obligated improvements.

    (a) If the developer represents either orally or in writing that it 
will provide or complete roads or facilities for water, sewer, gas, 
electricity or recreational amenities, it must be contractually 
obligated to do so (see Sec. 1715.15(f)), and the obligation shall be 
clearly stated in the Property Report. While the developer may disclose 
relevant facts about completion, the obligation to complete cannot be 
conditioned, other than as provided for in Sec. 1715.15(f), and an 
estimated completion date (month and year) must be stated in the 
Property Report. However, a developer that has only tentative plans to 
complete may so state in the Property Report, provided that the 
statement clearly identifies conditions to which the completion of the 
facilities are subject and states that there are no guarantees the 
facilities will be completed.
    (b) If a party other than the developer is responsible for providing 
or completing roads or facilities for water, sewer, gas, electricity or 
recreational amenities, that entity shall be clearly identified in the 
Property Report under the categories described in Sec. 1710.110, 
Sec. 1710.111 or Sec. 1710.114, as applicable. A statement shall be 
included in the proper section of the Property Report that the developer 
is not responsible for providing or completing the facility or amenity 
an can give no assurance that it will be completed or available for use.

    The cover page of the Property Report shall be prepared in

    (a) The margins shall be at least 1 inch.
    (b) The next 3 inches shall contain a warning, centered, in \1/2\

which reads as follows:

            READ THIS PROPERTY REPORT BEFORE SIGNING ANYTHING

    (c) The remainder of the page shall contain the following paragraphs 
beginning \1/4\ inch below the last line of the warning:

    This Report is prepared and issued by the developer of this 
subdivision. It is not prepared or issued by the Federal Government.
    Federal law requires that you receive this Report prior to your 
signing a contract or agreement to buy or lease a lot in this 
subdivision. However, NO FEDERAL AGENCY HAS JUDGED THE MERITS OR VALUE, 
IF ANY, OF THIS PROPERTY.
    If you received this Report prior to signing a contract or 
agreement, you may cancel your contract or agreement by giving notice to 
the seller any time before midnight of the seventh day following the 
signing of the contract or agreement.
    If you did not receive this Report before you signed a contract or 
agreement, you may cancel the contract or agreement any

[[Page 29]]

time within two years from the date of signing.

Name of Developer_______________________________________________________
Date of This Report_____________________________________________________

    (d)(1) If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by 
operation of State law, that period becomes the Federal revocation 
period and the Cover Page must reflect the requirements of the longer 
period, rather than the seven days.
    (2)(i) If a deed is not delivered within 180 days of the signing of 
the contract or agreement of sale or unless certain provisions are 
included in the contract or agreement, the purchaser is entitled to 
cancel the contract within two years from the date of signing the 
contract or agreement.
    (ii) The deed must be a warranty deed, or where such a deed is not 
commonly used, a similar deed legally acceptable in the jurisdiction 
where the lot is located. The deed must be free and clear of liens and 
encumbrances.
    (iii) The contract provisions are:
    (A) A legally sufficient and recordable lot description; and
    (B) A provision that the seller will give the purchaser written 
notification of purchaser's default or breach of contract and the 
opportunity to have at least 20 days from the receipt of notice to 
correct the default or breach; and
    (C) A provision that, if the purchaser loses rights and interest in 
the lot because of the purchaser's default or breach of contract after 
15% of the purchase price, exclusive of interest, has been paid, the 
seller shall refund to the purchaser any amount which remains from the 
payments made after subtracting 15% of the purchase price, exlusive of 
interest, or the amount of the seller's actual damages, whichever is the 
greater.
    (iv) If a deed is not delivered within 180 days of the signing of 
the contract or if the necessary provisions are not included in the 
contract, the following statement shall be used in place of any other 
recision language:

    Under Federal law you may cancel your contract or agreement of sale 
any time within two years from the date of signing.

    (e) At the time of submission, the developer may indicate its 
intention to comply with the red printing by an illustration or by a 
statement to that effect.
    (f) The ``Date of This Report'' shall be the date on which the 
Secretary allows the Statement of Record to become effective and shall 
not be entered until the submission has become effective.

Sec. 1710.106  Table of contents.

    (a) The second page(s) shall consist of a Table of Contents which 
lists the headings in the Property Report, the major subheadings, if 
any, and the page on which they appear. For example, the entry for Title 
and Land Use would appear as follows:

Title and Land Use  Page 
Method of Sale
Encumbrances, Mortgages and Liens
Recording the Contract and Deed
Payments
Restrictions on the Use of Your Lot
Plat Maps, Zoning, Surveying, Permits and Environment

    (b) Use of ``You'' and ``We''. At the end of the Table of Contents 
insert the following remark:

    ``In this Property Report, the words ``you'' and ``your'' refer to 
the buyer. The words ``we'', ``us'' and ``our'' refer to the 
developer.''

Sec. 1710.107  Risks of buying land.

    (a) The next page shall be headed ``Risks of Buying Land'' and shall 
contain the paragraphs listed below. However, paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section may be omitted if all improvements have been completed or if no 
improvements are proposed.
    (1) The future value of any land is uncertain and dependent upon 
many factors. DO NOT expect all land to increase in value.
    (2) Any value which your lot may have will be affected if the roads, 
utilities and all proposed improvements are not completed.
    (3) Resale of your lot may be difficult or impossible, since you may 
face the competition of our own sales program

[[Page 30]]

and local real estate brokers may not be interested in listing your lot.
    (4) Any subdivision will have an impact on the surrounding 
environment. Whether or not the impact is adverse and the degree of 
impact, will depend on the location, size, planning and extent of 
development. Subdivisions which adversely affect the environment may 
cause governmental agencies to impose restrictions on the use of the 
land. Changes in plant and animal life, air and water quality and noise 
levels may affect your use and enjoyment of your lot and your ability to 
sell it.
    (5) In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must 
be met to assure that you receive proper title. Since this purchase 
involves a major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek 
professional advice before you obligate yourself.
    (b) Warnings. If the instructions or the Secretary require any 
warnings to be included in the Property Report portion, the following 
statement shall be added beneath the ``Risks of Buying Land'' under a 
heading ``Warnings'':

    ``Throughout this Property Report there are specific warnings 
concerning the developer, the subdivision or individual lots. Be sure to 
read all warnings carefully before signing any contract or agreement.''


Both the heading, ``Warnings'', and the statement shall be printed in 
capital letters and enclosed in a box.

Sec. 1710.108  General information.

    Insert and complete the following format:

    ``This Report covers ---- lots located in -------- County, (State). 
See Page ---- for a listing of these lots. It is estimated that this 
subdivision will eventually contain ------ lots.''
``The developer of this subdivision is:
_______________________________________________________________________
    (Developer's Name)

<R05>
Sec. 1710.109  Title to the property and land use.

    (a) General instructions. (1) Below the heading ``Title to the 
Property and Land Use'' insert the following introductory paragraphs:

    ``A person with legal title to property generally has the right to 
own, use and enjoy the property. A contract to buy a lot may give you 
possession but doesn't give you legal title. You won't have legal title 
until you receive a valid deed. A restriction or an encumbrance on your 
lot, or on the subdivision, could adversely affect your title.''
    ``Here we will discuss the sales contract you will sign and the deed 
you will receive. We will also provide you with information about any 
land use restrictions and encumbrances, mortgages, or liens affecting 
your lot and some important facts about payments, recording, and title 
insurance.''

    (2) Information to be provided. After the above introductory 
paragraphs provide the information required by the following 
instructions and questions. Follow a general form identical to the 
sample page printed in Sec. 1710.102.
    (b) Method of sale--(1) Sales contract and delivery of deed. (i) 
Will the buyer sign a purchase money or installment contract or similar 
instrument in connection with the purchase of the lot? When will a deed 
be delivered?
    (ii) If an installment contract is used, include the following, or 
substantially the same, language in the disclosure narrative under 
``Method of Sale'':

    ``If you fail to make your payments required by the contract, you 
may lose your lot and all monies paid.''

    (iii) If, at the time of a credit sale, the developer gives the 
buyer a deed to the lot, what type of security must the buyer give the 
seller?
    (iv) If the lots are to be sold on the basis of an installment 
contract, can the developer or the owner of the subdivision or their 
creditors encumber the lots under contract? If so, include the following 
warning in the disclosure narrative under the caption ``Sales contract 
and delivery of deed'':

    ``The (indicate subdivision developer, owner, or their creditors) 
can place a mortgage on or encumber the lots in this subdivision after 
they are under contract. This may cause you to lose your lot and any 
monies paid on it.''


[[Page 31]]


    (2) Type of deed. What type of deed will be used to convey title to 
lots in the subdivision?
    (3) Quitclaim deeds. If a quitclaim deed is to be given to lot 
purchasers insert the below warning, or a warning which is substantially 
the same, in the disclosure narrative below the caption ``Quitclaim 
Deeds''. This particular warning may be deleted at the direction of the 
Secretary if an acceptable attorney's opinion is submitted with the 
Statement of Record which indicates that a quitclaim deed has a meaning 
in the jurisdiction where the subdivision is located which is 
substantially contrary to the effect of this warning. This warning shall 
be phrased substantially as follows:

    ``The Quitclaim deed used to transfer title to lots in this 
subdivision gives you no assurance of ownership of your lot.''

    (4) Oil, gas, and mineral rights. If oil, gas or mineral rights have 
been reserved, insert the following statement or one substantially the 
same in the narrative answer under the caption ``oil, gas, and mineral 
rights'':

    ``The (indicate oil, gas, or mineral rights) to (state which lots) 
in this subdivision will not belong to the purchaser of those lots. The 
exercise of these rights could affect the use, enjoyment and value of 
your lot.''

    (c) Encumbrances, mortgages and liens--(1) In general. State whether 
any of the lots or common facilities which serve the subdivision, other 
than recreation facilities, are subject to a blanket encumbrance, 
mortgage or lien. If yes, identify the type of encumbrance (e.g. deed of 
trust, mortgage, mechanics liens), the holder of the lien, and the lots 
covered by the lien. If any blanket encumbrance, mortgage, or lien is 
not current in accordance with its terms, so indicate.
    (2) Release provisions. (i) Explain the effect of any release 
provisions of any blanket encumbrance, mortgage or lien and include the 
one of the following statements that pertains.
    (A) If the release clauses are not included in a recorded 
instrument, insert the following statement or one substantially the same 
in the disclosure narrative below the caption ``Release Provisions'':

    ``The release provisions for the (indicate all or particular lots) 
have not been recorded. Therefore, they may not be honored by subsequent 
holders of the mortgage. If they are not honored, you may not be able to 
obtain clear title to a lot covered by this mortgage until we have paid 
the mortgage in full, even if you have paid the full purchase price of 
the lot. If we should default on the mortgage prior to obtaining a 
release of your lot, you may lose your lot and all monies paid.''

    (B) If the developer or subdivision owner states that the release 
provisions are recorded and that the lot purchaser may pay the release 
price of the mortgage, the statement shall be supported by documentation 
supplied in Sec. 1710.209. If the purchaser may pay the release fee, 
state the amount of the release fee and inform the purchaser that the 
amount may be in addition to the contract payments unless there is a 
bona fide trust or escrow arrangement in which the purchaser's payments 
are set aside to pay the release price before any payments are made to 
the developer.
    (C)(1) If there are no provisions in the blanket encumbrance for 
release of an individual purchaser's lot from a blanket encumbrance, 
include the following warning or a warning substantially the same, in 
the disclosure narrative under the ``Release Provisions'' caption:

    ``The (state type of encumbrance) on (indicate all or particular 
lots) in this subdivision does not contain any provisions for the 
release of an individual lot when the full purchase price of the lot has 
been paid. Therefore, if your lot is subject to this (state type of 
encumbrance), you may not be able to obtain clear title to your lot 
until we have paid the (state type of encumbrance) in full, even though 
you may have received a deed and paid the full purchase price of the 
lot. If we should default on the (state type of encumbrance) prior to 
obtaining a release, you may lose your lot and all monies paid.''

    (2) If the provisions for release of individual lots from the 
blanket encumbrance may be exercised only by the developer insert the 
following statement, or one substantially the same, in the disclosure 
narrative under the ``Release Provisions'' caption:

    ``The release provisions in the (state the type of encumbrance) on 
(indicate all or particular lots) in this subdivision may be exercised 
only by us. Therefore, if we default on

[[Page 32]]

the (state type of encumbrance) before obtaining a release of your lot, 
you may lose your lot and any money you have paid for it.''

    (d) Recording the contract and deed--(1) Method or purpose of 
recording. (i) State what protection, if any, recording of deeds and 
contracts gives a lot purchaser in your jurisdiction.
    (ii) If the sales contract or deed may be recorded, so state. Also 
state whose responsibility it is to record the contract or deed.
    (iii) If the developer or subdivision owner will not have the sales 
contract officially acknowledged or if the applicable jurisdiction will 
not record sales contracts, state that sales contracts will not be 
recorded and why they will not be recorded.
    (iv) If at, or immediately after, the signing of a contract, the 
contract or a deed transfer to the buyer is not recorded by the 
developer or owner or if title to the lot is not otherwise transferred 
of record to a trust, or if other sufficient notice of transfer or sale 
is not placed of record, then the developer shall include the following, 
or substantially the same, warning in the disclosure narrative under the 
caption ``Method and Purpose of Recording'':

    ``Unless your contract or deed is recorded you may lose your lot 
through the claims of subsequent purchasers or subsequent creditors of 
anyone having an interest in the land''.


The reference to contracts shall be deleted from the above warning if 
the answer to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section indicates that 
recording of a contract in the subject jurisdiction does not protect the 
purchaser from claims of later purchasers or creditors of anyone having 
an interest in the land.

    (2) Title insurance. If the developer does not deliver a title 
insurance policy to the buyer, state that the purchaser should obtain an 
attorney's opinion of title or a title insurance policy which will 
describe the rights of ownership which are being acquired in the lot. 
Recommend that an appropriate professional should interpret the opinion 
or policy.
    (e) Payments--(1) Escrow. If purchasers' deposits, down payments, or 
installment payments are to be placed in a third party controlled escrow 
or similar account, describe the arrangement including the name and 
address of the escrow holder or similar person. If there is no such 
arrangement, insert the following statement in the disclosure narrative 
under the caption ``Escrow'':

    ``You may lose your (indicate deposit, down payment and/or 
installment payments) on your lot if we fail to deliver legal title to 
you as called for in the contract, because (they are/it is) not held in 
an escrow account which fully protects you.''


The questions regarding an escrow agreement or similar protection may be 
answered affirmatively only if the money is under the control of an 
independent third party, allowing a purchaser to receive a return of all 
money paid in the event of the developer's failure to convey title or 
the developer's default on any obligation which would otherwise result 
in the purchaser's loss of that money.
    (2) Prepayments. Explain any prepayment penalties or privileges in 
everyday language.
    (3) Default. What are the developer's or subdivision owners' 
remedies against a defaulted purchaser?
    (f) Restrictions on the use of your lot--(1) Restrictive covenants. 
(i) Have any restrictive covenants been recorded against the land in the 
subdivision? If so, do they contain items which require the purchaser to 
secure permissions, approvals or take any other action prior to using or 
disposing of his lot (e.g., architectural control, developer's right of 
first refusal, building deadlines, etc.)? If any of these or similar 
items are included, explain their meaning and effect upon the purchaser.
    (ii) If any restrictive covenants are to be used and if they have 
not been recorded, how will they be imposed? Include a statement to the 
effect that the restrictive covenants have not been recorded; that there 
is no assurance they will be applied uniformly; that they may be changed 
and that they may be difficult to enforce. If no restrictive covenants 
will be imposed, include a statement to the effect that, since there are 
no restrictive covenants on the use of the lots, they may be used

[[Page 33]]

for purposes which could adversely affect the use and enjoyment of 
surrounding lots.
    (iii) If there are restrictive covenants, whether recorded or 
unrecorded, the following statement shall be made: ``A complete copy of 
these restrictions is available upon request.''
    (2) Easements. (i) Are there easements which may have an effect on 
the purchaser's building or lot use plans (e.g., large drainage 
easements along lot lines, high voltage electric transmission lines, 
pipe lines or drainage easements which encroach upon the building area 
of the lot or inhibit its use)?
    (ii) Is the subdivision subject to any type of flood control or 
flowage easements?
    (iii) If the answer to either (2)(i) or (2)(ii) is in the 
affirmative, identify the affected lots and state the effect upon the 
use of the lots.
    (g) Plats, zoning, surveying, permits and environment--(1) Plats. 
(i) Have the subdivision plans and plats of specific units been approved 
by the regulatory authorities? If the approvals have not been obtained, 
include a warning to the effect that regulatory authorities have not 
approved the proposed plats; that they may require significant 
alterations before they will approve them and they may not allow the 
land to be used for the purpose for which it is being sold.
    (ii) Have plats covering the lots in this Report been recorded? If 
so, where are they recorded? If they have not been recorded, is the 
description of the lots given in this Report legally adequate for the 
conveyance of land in the jurisdiction where the subdivision is located? 
If it is not, include a statement to the effect that the description of 
the lots is not legally adequate for the conveyance of the lots and that 
it will not be until the plat is recorded.
    (2) Zoning. For what purpose may the lots be used (e.g., single 
family homes, camping, commercial)? Does this use conform to local 
zoning requirements and the restrictive covenants?
    (3) Surveying. Has each lot been surveyed and is each lot marked for 
identification? If not, and the purchaser is responsible for the 
expense, state the estimated cost.
    (4) Permits. Must the purchaser obtain a building permit before 
beginning construction on his lot? Where is the permit obtained? Are any 
other permits necessary to use the lot for the purpose for which it is 
sold or for construction in connection with its use?
    (5) Environment. Has there been any environmental impact study 
prepared which considers the effect of the subdivision on the 
environment? If a study has been prepared, summarize any adverse 
conclusions and refer the lot buyer to the proper State Clearinghouse 
for complete information. If a study has not been prepared, include a 
statement that ``No determination has been made as to the possible 
adverse effects the subdivision may have upon the environment and 
surrounding area.''

(If the developer does not know whether an environmental impact study 
has been prepared, or the name and location of the Office where any 
study made can be found, inquiry should be made to the State or Area 
Clearinghouse established under the authority of title IV of the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968.)

the purchaser, if any? Are any improvements contemplated? If so, when 
will they begin and when will they be completed? At whose expense?
    (b) Access within the subdivision. (1) How have legal and physical 
access by conventional automobile been or will they be, provided to the 
lots (e.g., road on recorded easement; right of way dedicated to the 
public; right of way dedicated to use of lot owners)?
    (2) Who is responsible for the road construction? Is there any 
construction cost to the purchaser? Is there any financial assurance of 
completion? If there is no financial assurance of completion, enter a 
warning to the effect that no funds have been set aside in an escrow or 
trust account and there are

[[Page 34]]

no other financial arrangements to assure completion of the roads.
    (3) How many lanes do the interior roads have? What is the estimated 
starting date of construction (month and year); the present percentage 
of construction now complete; the present surface; the estimated 
completion date (month and year) and what is the final surface to be? If 
there are separate units or sections in the subdivision which will have 
different completion dates or different surfaces, the following chart 
shall be used rather than a narrative paragraph.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Percentage of          Estimated
     Unit        Estimated starting    construction now     completion date       Present        Final surface
                 date (month/year)         complete           (month/year)        surface
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Who is responsible for road maintenance? If the roads are to be 
maintained by a public authority, a property owners' association or some 
other entity at some time in the future, who is responsible for their 
maintenance during the interim period? What is the cost to the purchaser 
during the interim period and after acceptance for permanent 
maintenance? Will they be maintained so as to provide access to the lots 
on a year round basis? If not, include a warning which informs the 
purchaser that access may not be available year round. Identify the 
months when access may not be available to lots. If there are no 
arrangements for maintenance, include a warning to the effect that 
purchasers are responsible for maintaining the roads and that, if 
maintenance is not performed, the roads may soon deteriorate and access 
may become difficult or impossible.
    (5) If estimated completion dates given in prior Statements of 
Record have not been met, state that previous dates have not been met 
and give the previous dates. Underline the answer. If the roads are 100 
percent completed, no dates are needed.
    (6) Complete the following chart by listing the county seat 
(identify) and at least two nearby communities.
    Include at least one community of significant size which offers 
general services.

estimated cost of construction and maintenance?


<R05>
Sec. 1710.111  Utilities.

    (a) Water. (1) How is water to be supplied to the individual lots 
(e.g., central system or individual wells)? Of the following items only 
those which apply to the subdivision need be included.
    (i) Individual system. (A) If water is to be supplied by an 
individual private well, cistern or other individual system, what are 
the total estimated costs of the system, including but not limited to, 
the costs of installation, storage, any treatment facilities and other 
necessary equipment?
    (B) If individual cisterns or similar storage tanks are to be used, 
state where water to fill them can be secured; the cost of the water, 
and its delivery costs for a supply sufficient to serve the monthly 
needs of a family of four living in a house on a year-round basis. 
Include a statement to the effect that water stored for extended periods 
tends to become stale and may acquire an unpleasant taste or odor.
    (C) If individual wells are to be used and if the sales contract 
contains no provisions for refund or exchange in the event a productive 
well cannot be installed, include a statement to the effect that there 
is no assurance a productive well can be installed and, if it cannot, no 
refund of the purchase price of the lot will be made.
    (D) If individual wells or individual cisterns are to be used, 
include a brief statement to the effect that the purity

[[Page 35]]

and chemical content of the water cannot be determined until each 
individual well or source of water is completed and tested.
    (E) If there have been no hydrological surveys in connection with 
the use of individual wells or sources of hauled water for cisterns, 
include a warning to the effect that there is no assurance of a 
sufficient supply of water for the anticipated population.
    (F) Is a permit required to install the individual system to be 
used? If so, from whom and where is the permit secured? State the cost 
of a permit.
    (ii) Central system. (A) If water is to be provided by a central 
system, who is the supplier? What is the supplier's address?
    (B) Will the water mains be extended in front of, or adjacent to, 
each lot? When will construction begin? What is the present percentage 
of completion of the water mains and central supply plant? When will 
service be available to the individual lots? If the central system is 
not complete and there are separate units or sections of the subdivision 
included in the Statement of Record which have different completion 
dates, then the starting date for construction (month and year), the 
percentage of construction now complete and the estimated service 
availability date (month and year) shall be set forth in the following 
chart form rather than in a narrative paragraph.

                                  Water
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Estimated        Percentage of      Estimated service
    Unit       starting date    construction now     availability date
             (month and year)       complete          (month and year)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) What is the present capacity of the central plant (i.e., how 
many connections can be supplied)? If the capacity is not sufficient to 
serve all lots in the Statement of Record and is to be expanded in 
phases, what is the time-table for each phase to be in service and what 
will trigger the beginning of the expansion for each phase? If an entity 
other than the developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer 
will supply the water for the central system; if the operation of that 
entity is supervised by a governmental agency and if that entity states 
it can supply the anticipated population of the development, then 
information as to the capacity of the plant and a hydrological survey is 
not necessary. If the entity does not indicate it can supply enough 
water for the anticipated population or if the capacity of any central 
system is not sufficient to serve all lots in the Statement of Record, 
include a warning which describes the limitations and sets forth the 
number of lots which can now be served.
    (D) Have there been any hydrological surveys to determine that a 
sufficient source of water is available to serve the anticipated 
population of the subdivision? Has the water in the central system been 
tested for purity and chemical content? If so, did the results show that 
the water meets all standards for a public water supply? If there have 
been no hydrological surveys showing a sufficient supply of water or no 
tests for purity and chemical content for the central system, include a 
warning to the effect that there is no assurance of a sufficient supply 
or that the water is drinkable.
    (E) Is there any financial assurance of completion of the central 
system and any future expansion? If not, include a warning to the effect 
that no funds have been set aside in an escrow or trust account nor have 
any other financial arrangements been made to assure completion of the 
water system.
    (F) If the developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer 
operates the central system, have all permits been obtained from the 
proper agencies for the construction, use and operation of the central 
system? If not, include a warning to the effect that the required 
permits, approvals or licenses for construction, operation or use of the 
water system have not been obtained, therefore there is no assurance the 
system can be constructed or used.
    (G) If previous completion dates given in prior Statements of Record 
have not been met, state that previous completion dates have not been 
met and give the previous dates. Underline the answer. If the central 
water system is 100 percent completed, no dates are needed.

[[Page 36]]

    (H) Is the purchaser to pay any construction costs, one-time 
connection fees, availability fees, special assessments or deposits for 
the central system? If so, what are the amounts? If not, state there are 
no charges other than use fees. If the purchaser will be responsible for 
construction costs of the water mains, state the cost to install the 
mains to the most remote lot covered by this report.
    (I) If a purchaser wishes to use a lot prior to the date central 
water is available to it, may the purchaser install an individual 
system? If so, include the information required for individual systems 
in Sec. 1710.111(a)(1)(i). Will the purchaser be required to discontinue 
use of any individual system and connect to the central system when 
service is available to the lot? If the purchaser is not required to 
connect to the central system, must any construction costs, connection 
fees, availability fees, special assessments or deposits in connection 
with the central system still be paid? If an individual system may not 
be installed, so state and indicate water will not be available until 
the central system is extended to the lot.
    (J) If connection to the system is voluntary and not all purchasers 
elect to use the system, will the cost to those who do use the system be 
increased? If so, include a statement to the effect that connection to 
the central system is voluntary and those who use the system may have to 
pay a disproportionate share of the cost of the system and its 
operation.
    (K) If the developer is to construct the system and will later turn 
it over to a property owners' association for operation and maintenance, 
state the estimated date and conditions of the conveyance and if it will 
be conveyed free and clear of any encumbrance. If there is a charge or 
if the association must assume an encumbrance, state the estimated 
amount of either and the terms for retirement of either obligation.
    (L) If the supplier of water is other than a governmental agency or 
an entity which is regulated and supervised by a governmental agency, 
state that neither the operation of the water system nor the rates are 
regulated by a public authority.
    (M) The following warning shall be included unless:
    (1) The central water system is owned and operated by the developer, 
or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer, or
    (2) The central water system is owned and operated by a governmental 
agency or by an entity which is regulated and supervised by a 
governmental agency.

    ``We do not own or operate the central water system so we cannot 
assure its continued availability for your use.''

    (b) Sewer. (1) What methods of sewage disposal are to be used (e.g., 
central system, comfort stations or individual on-site systems such as 
septic tanks, holding tanks, etc.) in the subdivision? Of the following 
items, only those which apply to the subdivision need be included.
    (i) Individual systems. (A) If individual systems are to be used, 
have the local authorities given general approval to the use of these 
systems in the subdivision or have they given specific approval for each 
lot?

Are permits necessary? From whom and where are they obtained? Must 
testing of the lot be done prior to the issuance of a permit? State the 
cost of a permit and the estimated costs of the system and any necessary 
tests.
    (B) If holding tanks are to be used, state whether pumping and 
hauling service is available and the estimated monthly costs of that 
service for a family of four living in a house on a year-round basis.
    (C) If each and every lot has not been approved for the use of an 
individual on-site system, include a warning to the effect that there is 
no assurance permits can be obtained for the installation and use of 
individual on-site systems. If the sales contract contains no provisions 
for refund or exchange in the event a permit cannot be obtained, include 
a statement to the effect that there is no assurance an individual on-
site system can be installed and, if it cannot, no refund of the 
purchase price of the lot will be made.
    (D) If no permit is required for the installation and use of 
individual on-site systems, explain whether this may have an effect upon 
the purchaser or

[[Page 37]]

the availability of construction or permanent financing.
    (E) If the developer has knowledge that permits for the installation 
of individual on-site systems have been denied; that there have been 
unsatisfactory percolation tests or that systems have not operated 
satisfactory in the subdivision, state the number of these rejections, 
unsatisfactory tests or operations.
    (ii) Comfort stations. (A) If comfort stations are to be used, how 
many lots will be served by each station? When will construction be 
started? When will the station or stations be completed and ready for 
use? Have the necessary permits been obtained for the construction and 
use of comfort stations? If the necessary permits have not been 
obtained, include a warning that the necessary permits, approvals or 
licenses have not been obtained for the construction and use of the 
comfort stations, therefore there is no assurance they can be 
constructed or used. If there are comfort stations located in different 
units and having different completion dates, the following chart shall 
be used to show the estimated construction starting date (month and 
year), the present percentage of completion and the date on which they 
will be used rather than a narrative paragraph.

                            Comfort Stations

Unit....................................................................
Estimated Starting Date (month-year)....................................
Percentage of Construction now complete.................................
Estimated Service Availability Date (month and year)....................

    (B) Who is to construct the comfort stations? Is there any financial 
assurance of their completion? If not, include a warning to the effect 
that no funds have been set aside in an escrow or trust account nor have 
any other financial arrangements been made to assure completion of the 
comfort stations and there is no assurance the facilities will be 
completed.
    (C) Who will be responsible for maintenance of the comfort stations? 
Is there any cost to the purchaser for construction, use or maintenance?
    (iii) Central system. (A) If a central sewage treatment and 
collection system is being installed, who is responsible for 
construction of the system? Will the sewer mains be installed in front 
of, or adjacent to, each lot? When will construction be started (month 
and year)? When will service be available (month and year)? Who will own 
and operate the system? Give the name and address of the entity.
    (B) What is the present percentage of completion and the present 
capacity of the system (i.e., number of connections which can be 
served)? If the present capacity is not sufficient to serve all lots in 
the Statement of Record and it is to be expanded in phases, what is the 
time-table for expansion and what will trigger that expansion? If the 
central system is not complete and there are separate units or sections 
of the subdivision which have different service availability dates, the 
following chart shall be used to show the construction starting date 
(month and year); the percentage of completion and service availability 
date (month and year) in each unit or section rather than a narrative 
paragraph.

                                  Sewer

Unit Estimated Starting Date (month/year)...............................
Percentage of Construction now complete.................................
Estimated Service Availability Date (month/year)........................


If sewage treatment facilities are to be supplied by an entity which is 
regulated by a governmental agency and which is not the developer or an 
affiliate or subsidiary of the developer and the entity has stated it 
can serve the anticipated population of the development, then 
information on capacity need not appear.
    (C) If the developer or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer 
operates the central system, have all necessary permits been obtained 
for the construction, operation and use of the the central system? Do 
these permits limit the number of connections or homes which the system 
may serve? If the permits have not been obtained, enter a warning to the 
effect that the necessary permits, approvals or licenses have not been 
obtained for the central sewage

[[Page 38]]

system; therefore there is no assurance that the system can be 
completed, operated or used.
    (D) If the system cannot now serve all lots included in the 
Statement of Record, either because the supplier of the service has not 
stated it can and will serve all lots or if construction has not reached 
a stage where all lots can be served or permits to serve all lots have 
not been obtained, include a warning which states that all lots cannot 
now be served; the number which can be served and the reason for the 
lack of capacity.
    (E) Will the purchaser pay any construction costs, special 
assessments, one time connection fees or availability fees? What are the 
amounts of these charges? If the purchaser is to pay construction costs 
of the sewer mains, state the cost of installation of the mains to the 
most remote lot in this Report.
    (F) If the purchaser wishes to use the lot prior to the date central 
sewer service is available, may the purchaser install an individual 
system? If so, include the information on individual systems required by 
Sec. 1710.111(b)(1)(i). Will the purchaser be required to discontinue 
use of the individual system and connect to the central system when 
service is available? If the purchaser is not required to connect to the 
central system, must the purchaser still pay any construction costs, 
connection fees, availability fees, or special assessments? If the 
purchaser may not install an individual system, so state and indicate 
service will not be available until the central system reaches the lot.
    (G) If connection to the system is voluntary and not all purchasers 
elect to use the system, will the cost to those who do use the system be 
increased? If so, include a statement to the effect that connection to 
the central system is voluntary and those who use the system may have to 
pay a disproportionate share of the cost of the system and its 
operation.
    (H) Is there any financial assurance of completion of the central 
system and any future expansion? If not, include a warning that no funds 
have been set aside in an escrow or trust account nor have any other 
financial arrangements been made to assure the completion of the central 
system; therefore there is no assurance that it will be completed.
    (I) If previous completion dates given in prior Statements of Record 
have not been met, state that previous dates have not been met and give 
the previous dates. Underline the answer. If the central sewage 
treatment and collection system are 100 percent completed, no dates are 
needed.
    (J) If the developer is to construct the system and will later turn 
it over to a property owners' association for operation and maintenance, 
state the date of the transfer and whether there will be any charge for 
the conveyance and if it will be conveyed free and clear of any 
encumbrance. If there is a charge or if the association must assume an 
encumbrance, state the estimated amount of either and the terms for 
retirement of either obligation.
    (K) If the owner or operator of the central sewer system is other 
than a governmental agency or an entity which is regulated and 
supervised by a governmental agency, state that neither the operation of 
the sewer system nor the rates are regulated by a public authority.
    (L) The following warning shall be included unless:
    (1) The central sewer system is owned and operated by the developer, 
or an affiliate or subsidiary of the developer, or
    (2) The central sewer system is owned and operated by a governmental 
agency or by an entity which is regulated and supervised by a 
governmental agency.

    ``We do not own or operate the central sewer system so we cannot 
assure its continued availability for your use.''

    (c) Electricity. (1) Who will provide electrical services to the 
subdivision?
    (2) Have primary electrical service lines been extended in front of, 
or adjacent to, all of the lots? If not, when (month and year) or under 
what conditions will construction begin and when will service be 
available? If they have not been installed, who is responsible for their 
construction?

If electrical service lines have not been extended in front of, or 
adjacent to, all

[[Page 39]]

lots and there are separate units or sections having different service 
availability dates, the following chart shall be used rather than a 
narrative paragraph.

                            Electric Service

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) If construction of the lines or service to the ultimate consumer 
is provided by an entity other than a publicly regulated utility, who 
provides, or will provide, the service? Who will be responsible for 
maintenance? What is the assurance of completion? If service is not 
provided by a publicly regulated utility, what charges or assessments 
will the purchaser pay?
    (4) If the primary service lines have not been extended in front of, 
or adjacent to each lot, will the purchaser be responsible for any 
construction costs? If so, what is the utility company's policy and 
charges for extension of primary lines? Based on that policy, what would 
be the cost to the purchaser for extending primary service to the most 
remote lot in this Report?
    (5) If electrical service will not be provided, what is an alternate 
source (e.g., generators, etc.) and what are the estimated costs?
    (6) If the lines are to be installed by some entity other than a 
publicly regulated utility and if there is no financial assurance of 
completion, include a warning to the effect that no funds have been set 
aside in an escrow or trust account nor have any other financial 
arrangements been made to assure construction of the electric lines.
    (d) Telephone. (1) Is telephone service now, or will it be, 
available? Who will furnish the service?
    (2) Have the service lines been extended in front of, or adjacent 
to, each of the lots? If not, when, and under what conditions, will 
construction be started and when will service be available (month and 
year)?
    (3) If the service lines have not been extended in front of, or 
adjacent to, each lot, will the purchaser be responsible for any 
construction costs? If so, what is the utility company's policy and 
charges for extension of service lines? Based on that policy, what would 
be the cost to the purchaser of extending service lines to the most 
remote lot in this Report?
    (e) Fuel or other energy source. (1) What fuel, or other energy 
source, will be available for heating, cooking, etc. in the subdivision? 
If other than electricity is to be used, describe the availability of 
the fuel or other energy source. Give the name and address of the 
supplier. If the fuel is natural gas, when will the mains be installed 
to the lots? What is the cost to the purchaser for installation fees and 
connection fees? If oil or propane gas will be used, include the cost of 
a storage tank.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Facility. Identify each recreational facility. Identify closely 
related facilities (e.g., swimming pool and bathhouse) separately only 
if their availability dates differ. If any recreational facility is not 
owned by the developer, insert a warning below the chart phrased 
substantially as follows:

    ``We do not own the (name of facility or facilities) so we can not 
assure its (their) continued availability.''

    (2) Percent complete. State the present percentage of completion of 
construction for each recreational facility.
    (3) Estimated date of start of construction. Insert the estimated 
date of the

[[Page 41]]

start of construction for the facility (month and year).
    (4) Estimated date available for use. If the construction of the 
facility is not complete or if it is not available to lot owners for its 
intended use, indicate the estimated date (month and year) that the 
facility will be available for use. If the ``estimated date available 
for use'' for any facility has been amended to delay it to a later date, 
indicate such delay in a statement immediately below the chart. 
Underline the response.

This statement shall include the name of the facility and the prior 
estimated availability date, and it shall be referenced to the 
appropriate facility listed on the chart by use of an asterisk or other 
appropriate symbol. If a facility is 100 percent completed and in use, 
no date is needed.
    (5) Financial assurance of completion. If the construction of the 
facility is not complete, state whether there is any financial assurance 
of completion. If none, state ``none''. If such exists, state the type 
of assurance (i.e. bond, escrow, or trust). If no documentation for such 
assurance has been provided in Sec. 1710.214 of the Statement of Record, 
then do not indicate such assurance on the chart, but in place of such 
assurance on the chart state ``none''.
    (6) Buyer's annual cost or assessments. State the lot buyer's annual 
cost or assessments for using the facility. These costs should include 
any applicable property owners' association assessment, and the 
developer's maintenance assessment. If the cost information is lengthy, 
you may use an asterisk or other appropriate symbol and include the cost 
information in a paragraph below the chart.
    (c) Information to be provided below the recreational facility chart 
and related warnings.
    (1) Constructing the facilities. If the facilities are not complete, 
indicate who is responsible for the construction of the facilities. 
Indicate whether the purchaser will be required to pay any of the cost 
of construction of these facilities (estimate and disclose such cost, if 
any).
    (2) Maintaining the facilities. Indicate who is responsible for the 
operation and maintenance of these facilities.
    (3) Facilities which will be leased to lot purchasers. If no 
facilities covered here will be leased to a Property Owners' Association 
or other lot owners in the subject subdivision, omit this caption and 
any information requested under it from the Property Report. If such 
leases exist or are anticipated, state which facilities are or will be 
leased and indicate the term of the lease. Also, state whether the lot 
owners will have an opportunity to terminate or ratify the lease after 
control of the Property Owners' Association is turned over to them. 
Indicate whether the owner of a recreational facility leased to the 
Property Owners' Association or other lot owners may encumber it and 
whether the holders of such encumbrances may acquire the leased 
facilities and not honor the lease. Indicate whether the lease payments 
may be increased on an escalating or other basis and what costs or 
expenses, if any, will be borne by the owner. State whether the lease 
can be assigned or sublet. State how the lease can be terminated.
    (4) Transfer of the facilities. If there are presently any liens or 
mortgages on any of these recreational facilities, describe such liens 
or mortgages. If the developer, or owner of the subdivision, their 
principals, or subsidiaries, intend to transfer the title of a listed 
recreational facility in the future, explain at what time, by what type 
of conveyance, and to whom such transfer will be made. Disclose any 
adverse effects on, or cost to, lot purchasers which may be caused by 
such transfer. If any facility is to be transferred to lot owners as a 
Property Owners' Association or otherwise, state whether the facility 
will be transferred free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. If 
not, state the amount of the encumbrance to be assumed and disclose any 
contractual conditions on such transfer which relate to lot purchasers.
    (5) Permits. If the necessary permits have not been obtained for the 
construction and/or use of the facilities, identify the facilities for 
which such permits have not been obtained and include the following 
statement, or one substantially the same, in the narrative under the 
caption ``Permits''.

    ``The (identify the permit or license) has not been obtained and 
therefore there is no

[[Page 42]]

assurance that the lot owners will be able to use the (identify the 
facility)''.

    (6) Who may use the facilities. Indicate who will be permitted to 
use the recreational facilities (e.g., lot owners, their guests, 
employees of developer, general public, etc.). If the general public 
will be permitted to use the facilities include the following statement

    (a) General topography. What is the general topography and the major 
physical characteristics of the land in the subdivision? State the 
percentage of the subdivision which is to remain as natural open space 
and as developed parkland. Are there any steep slopes, rock 
outcroppings, unstable or expansive soil conditions, etc., which will 
necessitate the use of special construction techniques to build on, or 
use, any lot in the subdivision? If so, identify the lots affected, and 
describe the techniques recommended. If any lots in the subdivision have 
a slope of 20%, or more, include a warning that ``Some lots in this 
subdivision have a slope of 20%, or more. This may affect the type and 
cost of construction.''

completion.
    (3) If there is no program or if the program has not been approved 
by the appropriate officials or if the program does not provide minimum 
protection, include a statement to the effect that the measures being 
taken may not be sufficient to prevent property damage or health and 
safety hazards. (A minimum program will usually provide for:
    (i) Temporary measures such as mulching and seeding of exposed areas 
and silt basins to trap sediments in runoff water, and
    (ii) Permanent measures such as sodding and seeding in areas of 
heavy grading or cut and fill along with the construction of diversion 
channels, ditches, outlet channels, waterway stabilizers and sediment 
control basins.)

traffic hazards, danger from fire or explosion or radiation hazards)? Is 
the developer aware of any proposed plans for construction which may 
create a nuisance or safety hazard or adversely affect the subdivision? 
If there are any existing hazards or if there is any proposed 
construction which will create a nuisance or hazard, describe the hazard 
or nuisance. If there are no existing or possible future hazards, state 
that there are none.
    (2) Is the area subject to natural hazards or has it been formally 
identified by any Federal, State or local agency as an area subject to 
the frequent occurrence of natural hazards (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes, 
earthquakes, mudslides, forest fires, brush fires, avalanches, flash 
flooding, etc.)? If the jurisdiction in which the subdivision is located 
has a rating system for fire hazard, state the rating assigned to the 
land in the subdivision and explain its meaning.
    (h) Climate. What are the average temperature ranges, summer and 
winter, for the area in which the subdivision is located (i.e., high, 
low and mean)? What is the average annual rainfall and snowfall?
    (i) Occupancy. How many homes are occupied on a full- or part-time

    ``Since membership in the association is voluntary, you may be 
required to pay a disproportionate share of the association costs or it 
may not be able to carry out its responsibilities.''

    (4) What are the functions and responsibilities of the association? 
Will the association hold architectural control over the subdivision?
    (5) Are there any functions or services that the developer now 
provides at no charge for which the association may be required to

assessments or fees be necessay to continue these functions or services?
    (6) Does the current level of assessments, fees, charges or other 
income provide the capability for the association to meet its present, 
or planned, financial obligations including operating costs, maintenance 
and repair costs and reserves for replacement? If not, how will any 
deficit be made up?
    (b) Taxes. (1) When will the purchaser's obligation to pay taxes

``We do not have any provision to allow you to exchange one lot for 
another'' or ``We do not have a program which assures that you will be 
able to exchange your lot for another.''
    (e) Unusual situations. This topic need appear only if one or more 
of the following cases apply to the subdivision, then only the

mortgage or otherwise encumber the leasehold? Will the lessee be 
permitted to remove any improvements which have been installed when the 
lease expires or is terminated?

remaining portions? Is the initial buyer responsible for any greater 
portion of the expense than his normal share until the remaining 
interests are sold? If the purchase of any of the portions is financed, 
will the default of one owner have any effect upon the remaining owners?

entitled to use? What is the approximate square footage the member is 
entitled to use? Are there different classes of membership? How are the 
different classes identified and what are the differences between them?
    (ii) If the member does not receive any interest in the title to the

Sec. 1710.209  Title and land use.

    (a) General information. (1) State whether the developer has 
reserved the right to exchange or withdraw lots after a purchaser has 
signed a sales contract (e.g., for prior sales, failure to pass credit 
check). If yes, indicate this authority and make reference to the 
applicable paragraph in the sales contract or other document.
    (2) State whether there is a provision giving purchasers an option 
to exchange lots. If yes, indicate this and make reference to the 
applicable paragraph in the sales contract or other document.
    (3) State whether the developer knows of any instruments not of 
record which, if recorded, would affect title to the subdivision. If 
yes, copies of these instruments shall be submitted, except that copies 
of unrecorded contracts for sales of lots in the subdivision need not be 
submitted.
    (4)(i) Identify the Federal, State and local agencies or similar 
organizations which have the authority to regulate or issue permits, 
approvals or licenses which may have a material effect on the 
developer's plans with respect to the proposed division of the land, and 
any existing or proposed facilities, common areas or improvements to the 
subdivision.
    (ii) Describe or identify the land or facilities affected; the 
permit, approval or license required; and indicate whether the permit, 
approval or license has been obtained by the developer.
    (iii) If no agency regulates the division of the land or issues any 
permits, approvals or licenses with respect to improvements, so state.
    (iv) Answers must specifically cover the areas of environmental 
protection; environmental impact statements; and construction, dredging, 
bulkheading, etc. that affect bodies of water within or around the 
subdivision. Also include licenses or permits required by water 
resources boards, pollution control

[[Page 50]]

boards, river basin commissions, conservation agencies or similar 
organizations.
    (5) State whether it is unlawful to sell lots prior to the final 
approval and recording of a plat map in the jurisdiction where the 
subdivision is located.
    (b) Title evidence. (1) Submit title evidence that specifically 
states the status of the legal and equitable title to the land 
comprising the lots covered by the Statement of Record and any common 
areas or facilities disclosed in the Property Report. Title evidence 
need not be submitted for those common areas and facilities which are 
not owned by the developer.
    (2) Acceptable title evidence shall be dated no earlier than 20 
business days preceding the date of the filing of the Statement of 
Record with the Secretary. Previously issued title evidence may be 
updated to the date referred to in the preceding sentence by 
endorsements or attorneys' opinions of title.
    (3) The developer shall amend the title evidence to reflect the 
change in status of title of any previously registered, reacquired lots 
unless their status is at least as marketable as they were when first 
offered for sale by the developer as registered lots.
    (c) Forms of acceptable title evidence. (1) An original or a copy of 
a signed owner's or mortgagee's policy of title insurance, title 
commitment, certificate of title or similar instrument issued by a title 
company authorized by law to issue such instruments in the state in 
which the subdivision is located. Title evidence that limits insurance 
or negligence liability to amounts less than the market value of the 
subject land at the time of its acquisition by the subdivision owner is 
not acceptable;
    (2) A legal opinion stating the condition of title, prepared and 
signed by an attorney at law experienced in the examination of titles 
and a member of the Bar in the state in which the property is located. 
The title opinion may be based on a Torrens land registration system 
certificate of title, or similar instrument, provided it meets all 
general title evidence requirements of this section and a copy of the 
registration certificate of title is submitted. Title opinions that 
limit negligence liability to amounts less than the market value of the 
subject land at the time of its acquisition by the subdivision owner are 
not acceptable.
    (d) Title searches. The required evidence of the status of title 
shall be based on a search of all public records which may contain 
documents affecting title to the land or the developer's ability to 
deliver marketable title. The search must cover a period which is 
required or generally considered adequate for insuring marketability of 
title in the jurisdiction in which the subdivision is located. Such 
search shall include an examination of at least the following documents:
    (1) The records of the recorder of deeds or similar authority;
    (2) U.S. Internal Revenue Liens;
    (3) The records of the circuit, probate, or other courts including 
Federal courts and bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings which have 
jurisdiction to affect the title to the land;
    (4) The tax records;
    (5) Financing statements filed pursuant to the Uniform Commercial 
Code or similar law. If it is held that the financing statements do not 
affect the title of the land, include a statement of the legal authority 
for that opinion.

This search may be accomplished through the use of a title insurance 
company title plant, the information in which is based on current 
searches of the appropriate and necessary documents, including as a 
minimum those listed immediately above. For any attorney's title opinion 
based on Torrens certificates of title, the title search need only go 
beyond the original time of registration of the certificate of title for 
those types of encumbrances which were not conclusively settled by the 
proceedings at the time of such registration. In such cases, the 
required statement shall clearly reflect the documents and periods 
searched.
    (e) Items to be included in the title evidence. The acceptable title 
evidence must include the following information, instruments and 
statements and need not be repeated or duplicated elsewhere in the 
Statement of Record.
    (1) A legal description of the land on which the lots, common areas, 
and facilities covered by the title evidence are located. This legal 
description shall

[[Page 51]]

be adequate for conveying land in the jurisdiction in which the 
subdivision is located. If this legal description is based on a recorded 
plat, the lot numbers, recording place, book name, book number, and page 
number shall be stated in the description. If this legal description is 
given by metes and bounds, the title evidence shall include or be 
accompanied by a certified statement of the preparer of the title 
evidence, a licensed attorney, or an engineer or surveyor, indicating 
that all subject lots, common areas, and common facilities are 
encompassed within the metes and bounds description in the evidence. If 
at any time after the submission of the legal description required 
above, the description of the subject land is changed or found to be in 
error, a correcting amendment shall be made to the Statement of Record.
    (2) The name of the person(s) or other legal entity(ies) holding fee 
title to the property described.
    (3) The name of any person(s) or other legal entity(ies) holding a 
leasehold estate or other interest of record in the property described.
    (4) A listing of any and all exceptions or objections to the title, 
estate or interest of the person(s) or legal entity(ies) referred to in 
paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, including any encumbrances, 
easements, covenants, conditions, reservations, limitations or 
restrictions of record. (Any reference to exceptions or objections to 
title shall include specific references to the instruments in the public 
records upon which they are based). When an objection or exception to 
title affects less than all of the property covered by this Statement of 
Record, the title evidence shall specifically note what portion of the 
property is so affected.
    (5) Copies of all instruments in the public records specifically 
referred to in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. (Abstracts of such 
instruments are acceptable if prepared by an attorney or professional or

company, together with interim statements if necessary, which comply

statements under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. For purposes of 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the Secretary will consider the 
aggregate sales prices of only the lots yet to be sold, and may consider 
whether any additions to the subdivisions or reacquisitions of lots 
already sold would be likely to cause the dollar limits to be exceeded.

subdivision has been reduced to less than $1,500,000.00, and that it 
will not exceed this amount through further additions to the subdivison, 
or through the reacquisition of lots already sold, and;
    (ii) The sales contract provides for delivery of a deed within 120 
days of the date of the contract which conveys title free and clear of 
any mortgage or lien or the developer files an Assurance of Title 
Agreement with OILSR, and;

account, or;
    (iv) The developer then qualifies for exception (e)(3)(iii) or 
(e)(3)(iv) above.
    (2) The Secretary may allow a developer, who has made sales prior to 
registration, to submit unaudited statements under the provisions of 
paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section. The developer must demonstrate to

statements would not be a detriment to the public interest or to the 
protection of purchasers.

    (a) As an integral part of the Statement of Record, the developer 
shall file with the Secretary an Annual Report of Activity on any 
initial or consolidated registration not under suspension. For this 
purpose, only one Annual Report of Activity will be expected for 
subdivisions on which developers have filed consolidations. For 
registrations certified by a State as provided for in Sec. 1710.500, a 
developer need file only one Annual Report of Activity for any 
registration for which the OILSR number is the same (alphabetic 
designators indicate that the registration has been treated as a 
consolidation).
    (b) The report shall be submitted within 30 days of the annual 
anniversary of the effective date of the initial Statement of Record.
    (c) The report shall contain the following information:
    (1) Subdivision name and address.
    (2) Developer's name, address and telephone number.
    (3) Agent's name, address and telephone number.
    (4) Interstate Land Sales Registration number.
    (5) The date on which the initial filing first became effective.
    (6) The number of registered lots, parcels or units which are unsold 
as of the date on which the report is due.
    (7) One of the following:
    (i) A statement that the developer is still engaged in land sales 
activity at the subject subdivision and that there

[[Page 59]]

have been no changes in material fact since the last effective date was 
issued which would require an amendment to the Statement of Record; or
    (ii) A statement that the developer is still engaged in land sales 
activity at the subject subdivision, that material changes have occurred 
since the last effective date, and that corrected pages to the Property 
Report portion or Additional Information and Documentation portion of 
the Statement accompany the report; or
    (iii) A statement that the developer is no longer engaged in land 
sales activity at the subject subdivision, together with the reason the 
developer is no longer selling (e.g., all lots sold to the public or the 
remaining lots sold to another developer, along with the date of sale 
and the new developer's name, address and telephone number). A request 
may be made that the Statement of Record be voluntarily suspended. The 
request should be submitted in duplicate and will become effective upon 
the counter-signature of the Secretary (or an authorized Designee) with 
the duplicate being returned to the developer.
    (8) The report shall be dated and shall be signed by the senior 
executive officer of the developer on a signature line above his typed 
name and title. The senior executive officer's acknowledgement shall be 
attested to or certified by a notary public or similar public official 
authorized to attest or certify acknowledgements in the jurisdiction in 
which the report is executed.
    (d) If the report indicates that there are 101 or more registered 
lots, parcels or units remaining for sale, the report shall be 
accompanied by an amendment fee in the amount and form prescribed in 
Sec. 1710.35.
    (e) Failure to submit the report when due shall be grounds for an 
action to suspend the effective Statement of Record.

     Subpart C--Certification of Substantially Equivalent State Law

    Authority: Sec. 1419, Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, 82 
Stat. 590, 598; 15 U.S.C. 1718; sec. 7(d), Dept. of Housing and Urban 
Development Act, 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

    Source: 45 FR 40491, June 13, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.500  General.

    (a) This subpart establishes procedures and criteria for certifying 
State land sale or lease disclosure programs and State land development 
standards programs. The purpose of State Certification is to lessen the 
administrative burden on the individual developer, arising where there 
are duplicative state and federal registration and disclosure 
requirements, without affecting the level of protection given to the 
individual purchaser or lessee. If the Secretary determines that a state 
has adopted and is effectively administering a program that gives 
purchasers and lessees the same level of protection given to them by the 
Federal Interstate Land Sales Registration Program, then the Secretary 
shall certify that state. Developers who accomplish an effective 
registration with a state in which the land is located after the 
Secretary has certified the state may satisfy the registration 
requirements of the Secretary by filing with the Secretary materials 
designated by agreement with certified states in lieu of the federal 
Statement of Record and Property Report.
    (b) A state that is certified by the Secretary shall be known as the 
situs certified state for all land located within its borders.
    (c) After a developer is effectively registered with the Secretary 
through a certified state, the Secretary has the same authority over 
that developer as the Secretary has over developers who file directly 
with the Secretary. This includes the authority to subpoena information 
and to examine, evaluate and suspend a developer's registration under 
sections 1407(d) and (e) of the Act and Sec. 1710.45(b)(1) and (b)(2) of 
these regulations.

[[Page 60]]

    (d) The prohibitions against the use of the Property Report 
contained in Sec. 1710.29 apply to state disclosure materials and 
substantive development standards. In addition, for purposes of this 
paragraph, references made to the Secretary, OILSR and the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development in Sec. 1710.29 will include a reference 
to the equivalent state officer or agency.
    (e) The Purchaser's Revocation Rights, Sales Practices and Standards 
rules contained in part 1715 of these regulations apply to developers 
who register with the Secretary through certified States. All of the 
rules in part 1715 apply, excepting the disclaimer statement in 
Sec. 1715.50(a) which is modified to read as follows:

    Obtain the Property Report or its equivalent, required by Federal 
and State law and read it before signing anything. No Federal or State 
agency has judged the merits or value, if any, of this property.

    (f) Developers are obliged to pay filing fees as set forth in 
Sec. 1710.35 of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.503  Notice of certification.

    (a) If the Secretary determines that a state qualifies for 
certification under Sec. 1710.501(a) or Sec. 1710.501(b), the Secretary 
shall so notify the state in writing. The state will be effectively 
certified under the section and as of the date specified in the notice.
    (b) If the Secretary determines that a state does not meet the 
standards for certification, the Secretary shall so notify the state in 
writing. The notice will specify particular changes in state law, 
regulations or administration that are needed to obtain certification. 
The Secretary shall not be bound in advance to certify a state that 
makes the suggested changes if other deficiencies become apparent at a 
later time.
    (c) The Secretary's final determination to accept or reject a 
State's Application for Certification of Land Sales Program shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (d) A state's certification will remain in effect until it is 
voluntarily suspended by the state or withdrawn by the Secretary. A 
state can voluntarily suspend its certification by notifying the 
Secretary in writing. The suspension will take effect as of the date and 
time specified in the notice to the Secretary, or upon receipt by the 
Secretary if no date is specified. The Secretary may withdraw 
certification as provided in Sec. 1710.505.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.504  Cooperation among certified states and between certified states and the Secretary.

    (a) By filing an Application for Certification of State Land Sales 
Program pursuant to Sec. 1710.502, a state agrees that, if it is 
certified by the Secretary, it will:
    (1) Accept for filing and allow to be distributed as the sole 
disclosure document, a disclosure document currently in effect in the 
situs certified state. Only those documents filed with the situs state 
after certification by the Secretary must automatically be accepted by 
other certified states;
    (2) Certify copies of all disclosure documents, amendments and 
consolidations filed with it by developers of land located within its 
borders for and as needed by developers required to submit certified 
copies to the Secretary and all other certified states. The 
certification shall indicate whether the documents are currently in 
effect. The certification should state as follows:

    The (indicate the State Department of Real Estate or other 
appropriate entity) has reviewed the attached materials and finds they 
are true copies of (1) the (indicate Property Report or other similar 
state accepted document or amendment to such document) for (indicate the 
name of the subdivision), made effective by the State of --------------
-- on ---------------- (give date) and still in effect; and (2) the 
supporting documentation upon which such (indicate the document or 
amendment) is based.
_______________________________________________________________________
Signature

    (3) Assist and cooperate with the Secretary and other certified 
states by requiring that developers of land within its borders amend 
disclosure documents if any change occurs in any representation of 
material fact required to be stated in the disclosure documents, 
including a change resulting from the developer's compliance with the 
requirements of the law in another certified state. The state shall 
require developers to send certified copies of the amended documents to 
the Secretary

[[Page 61]]

and requesting certified states. All amendments to such materials, which 
reflect changes in material facts regarding the subdivision, shall be 
submitted to the situs certified state authorities within 15 days of the 
date on which the developer knows, or should have known, of such change. 
Certified copies of the disclosure documents shall be submitted by the 
developer to the Secretary and the other certified states within 15 days 
after it becomes effective under the situs certified state laws.
    (4) Continue to effectively operate its Land Sales Program as that 
Program is described in the Application for Certification and as it was 
certified by the Secretary.
    (5) Assist and cooperate with the Secretary by monitoring the sales 
practices of developers registered with it directly or through another 
certified state, and by reporting to the Secretary any violations of the 
Act, including but not limited to the required contract provisions, 
revocation rights and anti-fraud provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1703, or the 
regulations.
    (b) A state required to accept the disclosure documents of another 
situs certified state pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may, 
in its discretion, require the developer to furnish it with copies 
certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (c) No state shall be prevented from establishing substantive or 
disclosure requirements which exceed the federal standard provided that 
such requirements are not in conflict with the Act or these regulations. 
For example, a certified state may impose additional disclosure 
requirements on developers of land located within its borders but may 
not impose additional disclosure requirements on developers whose 
disclosure documents it is required to accept pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. However, a certified state may impose additional 
nondisclosure requirements on out of state developers even though the 
developer is registered in the certified state in which the land is 
located.
    (d) After a developer is effectively registered with a certified 
state through a situs certified state, either or both certified states 
may exercise full enforcement authorities and powers over that developer 
according to applicable law and regulations.
    (e) The Secretary shall cooperate with the certified states by 
offering a forum for nonbinding arbitration of disputes between two or 
more certified States arising out of the State Certification Program.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.505  Withdrawal of State certification.

    (a) The Secretary shall periodically review the laws, regulations 
and administration thereof, of a certified state. If the Secretary finds 
that, taken as a whole, the laws, regulations or administration thereof, 
no longer meet the requirements of subpart C, then the Secretary may 
issue a notice to withdraw the certification of that state.
    (b) The notice of proceedings to withdraw a state's certification 
will be issued to the state by the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 1720.236. 
The Secretary may, after notice and after an opportunity for a hearing, 
pursuant to Sec. 1720.237, issue an order withdrawing certification.

In the event that a withdrawal order is issued, the order shall remain 
in effect until the state has amended its laws, regulations or the 
administration thereof or has otherwise complied with the requirements 
of the order. When the state has complied with the requirements of the 
order, the Secretary shall so declare and the withdrawal order shall 
cease to be effective.
    (c) Withdrawal orders issued pursuant to this subsection will be 
effective as of the date the order is received by the state. The 
withdrawal order shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (d) The rules of chapter IX of 24 CFR part 1720, subpart D will 
generally apply to hearings on withdrawal of a state's certification.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.506  State/Federal filing requirements.

    (a)(1) If the Secretary has certified a state under Sec. 1710.501, 
the Secretary shall accept for filing disclosure materials or other 
acceptable documents which have been approved by the certified state 
within which the subdivision is located. Only those filings made

[[Page 62]]

by the developer with the state after the state was certified by the 
Secretary shall be automatically accepted by the Secretary.
    (2) Retroactive application of the effectiveness of state's 
certification to a specified date may be granted on a state-by-state 
basis, where the Secretary determines that retroactive application will 
not result in automatic federal registration of any state filing that 
has not met the requirements of the certified state laws.
    (b) For a developer to be registered with the Secretary, the 
developer shall file with the Secretary a state certified copy of the 
Property Report or its equivalent, and any other documentation as 
stipulated in the Secretary's Notice of Certification to the state.
    (c) The documents and materials filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section will be automatically effective as the Federal Statement of 
Record and Property Report after these materials and the proper filing 
fee have been received by the Secretary.
    (d) The Secretary has authority pursuant to Sec. 1710.45(b)(1) and 
(b)(2) to suspend individual filings which fail to meet the requirements 
of the certified state's law or regulations or the standards in the 
certification agreement whether or not the state agency has initiated a 
similar action.
    (e)(1) State accepted materials filed with the Secretary pursuant to 
this section must be amended to reflect any amendment to such materials 
made effective by the state. All amendments to such materials must be 
submitted to the Secretary within 15 days after becoming effective under 
the applicable state laws. Amendments are automatically effective upon 
their receipt by the Secretary and the provisions of Sec. 1710.45(b)(1) 
and (2) apply to amendments filed under this section.
    (2) Amendments shall include or be accompanied by:
    (i) A letter from the developer giving a narrative statement fully 
explaining the purpose and significance of the amendment and referring 
to that section and page of the material which is being amended, and;
    (ii) A signed state acceptance certification substantially the same 
as that required by Sec. 1710.504(a)(2).
    (f) If a certified state suspends the registration of a particular 
subdivision for any reason, the subdivision's federal registration with 
the Secretary shall be automatically suspended as a result of the state 
action. No action need be taken by the Secretary to effect the 
suspension.
    (g) A state is certified only with regard to land located within the 
state borders. The Secretary is not required to accept filings which 
have been accepted by a certified state if the land which is the subject 
of the filing is not located within that certified state. For example, 
if State A is certified by the Secretary and State B is not, the 
Secretary is not required to accept filings from State B simply because 
State A accepts filings from State B.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.507  Effect of suspension or withdrawal of certification granted under Sec. 1710.501(a): Full disclosure requirement.

    (a) If a state certified under Sec. 1710.501(a) suspends its own 
certification or has its certification withdrawn under Sec. 1710.505, 
the Federal disclosure materials accepted and made effective by the 
Secretary, pursuant to Sec. 1710.506, prior to the suspension or 
withdrawal shall remain in effect unless otherwise suspended by the 
Secretary.
    (b) In the event that there is a change in a material fact with 
regard to a subdivision that remains registered under the provisions of 
paragraph (a), the developer shall file a new registration with the 
Secretary meeting the requirements of the then applicable Federal 
registration regulations. Modifications of the Federal format may be 
used as specified by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.508  Effect of suspension of certification granted under Sec. 1710.501(b): Sufficient protection requirement.

    (a) If a state certified under Sec. 1710.501(b) suspends its own 
certification or has its certification withdrawn under Sec. 1710.505, 
the effectiveness of the Federal disclosure materials accepted and made 
effective by the Secretary, pursuant to Sec. 1710.506, prior to the 
suspension or withdrawal shall terminate ninety (90) days after the 
notice

[[Page 63]]

of withdrawal order is published in the Federal Register as provided in 
Sec. 1710.505(c).
    (b) At the end of the ninety day period, or during the ninety day 
period in the event that there is a change in material fact with regard 
to a subdivision that remains registered under the provisions of 
paragraph (a), the developer shall file a new registration with the 
Secretary meeting the requirements of the then applicable Federal 
registration regulations. Modifications of the Federal format may be 
used as specified by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.552  Previously accepted state filings.

    (a) Materials filed with a state and accepted by the Secretary as a 
Statement of Record prior to January 1, 1981, pursuant to 24 CFR 
1710.52-59 (as published in the Federal Register on April 10, 1979) may 
continue in effect. However, developers must comply with the applicable 
amendments to the Federal Act and the regulations thereunder. In 
particular, see Secs. 1710.558 and 1710.559, which require that the 
Property Report and contracts or agreements contain notice of 
purchaser's revocation rights. In addition see Sec. 1715.15(f), which 
provides that it is unlawful to make any representations with regard to 
the developer's obligation to provide or complete roads, water, sewers, 
gas, electrical facilities or recreational amenities, unless the 
developer is obligated to do so in the contract.
    (b) If any such filing becomes inactive or suspended under the laws 
of the state, the registration with the Secretary shall be ineffective 
from that time.
    (c) Such Statement of Record may be suspended pursuant to 
Sec. 1710.45.
    (d) The Secretary may refuse to accept any particular filing under 
this section when it is determined that acceptance is not in the public 
interest.
    (e) The Secretary may require such changes, additional information, 
documents or certification as the Secretary determines to be reasonably 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1710.556  Previously accepted state filings--amendments and consolidations.

    (a) Amendments--(1) General requirements. State accepted materials, 
filed with the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 1710.552 shall be amended to 
reflect any amendment to such materials made effective by the state or 
any change of a material fact regarding the subdivision. All amendments 
to such materials, which reflect changes in material facts regarding the 
subdivision, shall be submitted to the state authorities within 15 days 
of the date on which the developer knows, or should have known, of such 
change and to the Secretary within 15 days after it becomes effective 
under the applicable State laws. However, such amendment shall not be 
effective as a Federal registration until the Secretary has determined 
that the amendment meets all applicable requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Amendments shall include or be accompanied by:
    (i) A letter from the developer giving a narrative statement fully 
explaining the purpose and significance of the amendment and referring 
to that section and page of the Statement of Record which is being 
amended, and;
    (ii) All amended pages of the state accepted materials filed with 
the Secretary. These pages shall be retyped with their amendments. Each 
such page shall have its date of preparation in the lower right hand 
corner, and;
    (iii) A signed state acceptance certification, and;
    (iv) The appropriate fees as indicated in Sec. 1710.35.
    (b) Consolidations--(1) When consolidations allowed. If lots are to 
be registered pursuant to Sec. 1710.552 which are in the same common 
promotional plan with other lots already registered with the Secretary, 
then new consolidated state accepted materials including such lots may 
be filed with the Secretary as a Statement of Record following the 
format of the previously accepted filing.
    (2) Consolidated Statements of Record shall include or be 
accompanied by:
    (i) State accepted consolidation materials which are also acceptable 
to the Secretary as a Statement of Record

[[Page 64]]

(state property report inclusive). These state accepted consolidation 
materials shall cover all lots previously registered in the common 
promotional plan except those deleted pursuant to other provisions in 
these regulations. These materials shall also include information and 
items required for state accepted materials filed as an initial 
registration Statement of Record, except that, supporting documentation 
in materials previously made effective by the Secretary for other lots 
in the subject common promotional plan may be incorporated by reference 
into the new consolidation materials submitted as a Statement of Record. 
However, such documentation may be incorporated by reference only if it 
is applicable to the new consolidated lots as well as to the previously 
registered lots.
    (ii) A signed state acceptance certification.
    (iii) The appropriate fees as indicated in Sec. 1710.35.
    (c) Effective date--State filing. The effective dates of state 
materials filed as amendments and consolidated Statements of Record 
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1710.21.

[45 FR 40491, June 13, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 31372, Aug. 6, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 1710.558  Previously accepted state filings--notice of revocation rights on property report cover page.

    (a)(1) The cover page on Property Reports for filings made with the 
Secretary pursuant to Sec. 1710.552 shall be prepared in accordance with 
Sec. 1710.105 and shall include the following paragraphs:

    ``If you received this Report prior to signing a contract or 
agreement, you may cancel your contract or agreement by giving notice to 
the seller anytime before midnight of the seventh day following the 
signing of the contract or agreement.
    ``If you did not receive this Report before you signed a contract or 
agreement, you may cancel the contract or agreement anytime within two 
years from the date of signing.''

    (2) If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by 
operation of State law, that period becomes the Federal revocation 
period and the Cover Page must reflect the longer period, rather than 
the seven days.
    (b)(1) If a deed is not delivered within 180 days of the signing of 
the contract or agreement of sale or unless certain provisions are 
included in the contract or agreement, the purchaser is entitled to 
cancel the contract within two years from the date of signing the 
contract or agreement.
    (2) The deed must be a warranty deed, or where such a deed is not 
commonly used, a similar deed legally acceptable in the jurisdiction 
where the lot is located. The deed must be free and clear of liens and 
encumbrances.
    (3) The contract provisions are:
    (i) A legally sufficient and recordable lot description, and;
    (ii) A provision that the seller will give the purchaser written 
notification of purchaser's default or breach of contract and the 
opportunity to remedy the default or breach within 20 days of the 
notice; and
    (iii) A provision that, if the purchaser loses rights and interest 
in the lot because of the purchaser's default or breach of contract 
after 15 percent of the purchase price, exclusive of interest, has been 
paid, the seller shall refund to the purchaser any amount which remains 
from the payments made after subtracting 15 percent of the purchase 
price, exclusive of interest, or the amount of the seller's actual 
damages, whichever is the greater.
    (4) If a deed is not delivered within 180 days of the signing of the 
contract or if the necessary provisions are not included in the 
contract, the following statement shall be used in place of any other 
rescision language:

    ``Under Federal law you may cancel your contract or agreement of 
sale any time within two years from the date of signing.''


<R05>
Sec. 1710.559  Previously accepted state filings--notice of revocation rights in contracts and agreements.

    (a)(1) All contracts or agreements, including promissory notes used 
in sale of lots for filings made with the Secretary pursuant to 
Sec. 1710.552, must contain the following language in boldface type 
(which must be distinguished from the type used for the rest of the 
contract) on the face or signature page above all signatures:


[[Page 65]]


    You have the option to cancel your contract or agreement of sale by 
notice to the seller until midnight of the seventh day following the 
signing of the contract or agreement.
    If you did not receive a Property Report prepared pursuant to the 
rules and regulations of the Office of Interstate Land Sales 
Registration, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 
advance of your signing the contract or agreement, this contract or 
agreement may be revoked at your option for two years from the date of 
signing.

    (2) If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by 
operation of State law or the Act, that period becomes the Federal 
revocation period and the contract or agreement must reflect the longer 
period, rather than the seven days. The language shall be consistent 
with that shown on the Cover Page (see Sec. 1710.558).
    (b) The above revocation provisions may not be limited or qualified 
in the contract or other document by requiring a specific type of notice 
or by requiring that notice be given at a specified place.

<R05>
Sec. 1715.1  General.

    The purpose of this subpart A is to elaborate on the revocation 
rights in 15 U.S.C. 1703, by enumerating certain conditions under which 
purchasers may exercise revocation rights. Generally, whenever 
revocation rights are available, they apply to promissory notes, as well 
as traditional agreements.

Sec. 1715.2  Revocation regardless of registration.

    All purchasers have the option to revoke a contract or lease with 
regard to a lot not exempt under Secs. 1710.5 through 1710.11 and 
1710.14 until midnight of the seventh day after the day that the 
purchaser signs a contract or lease. If a purchaser is entitled to a 
longer revocation period under State law, that period is deemed the 
Federal revocation period rather than the 7 days, and all contracts and 
agreements (including promissory notes) shall so state.

<R05>
Sec. 1715.4  Contract requirements and revocation.

    (a) In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1703(d)(3), the refund to the 
purchaser is calculated by subtracting from the amount described in 15 
U.S.C. 1703(d)(3)(B), the greater of:
    (1) Fifteen percent of the purchase or lease price of the lot 
(excluding interest owed) at the time of the default or breach of 
contract or agreement; or
    (2) The amount of damages incurred by the seller or lessor due to 
the default or breach of contract.
    (b) For the purposes of this section:
    Damages incurred by the seller or lessor means actual damages 
resulting from the default or breach, as determined by the law of the 
jurisdiction governing the contract. However, no damages may be 
specified in the contract or agreement, except a liquidated damages 
clause not exceeding 15 percent of the purchase price of the lot, 
excluding any interest owed.
    Purchase price means the cash sales price of the lot shown on the 
contract.

[[Page 66]]

    (c) The contractual requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1703(d) do not apply 
to the sale of a lot for which, within 180 days after the signing of the 
sales contract, the purchaser receives a warranty deed or, where 
warranty deeds are not commonly used, its equivalent under State law.

Sec. 1715.5  Reimbursement.

    If a purchaser exercises rights under 15 U.S.C. 1703(b), (c) or (d), 
but cannot reconvey the lot in substantially similar condition, the 
developer may subtract from the amount paid by the purchaser, and 
otherwise due to the purchaser under 15 U.S.C. 1703, any diminished 
value in the lot caused by the acts of the purchaser.

                Subpart B--Sales Practices and Standards


<R05>
Sec. 1715.10  General.

    Sales practices means any conduct or advertising by a developer or 
its agents to induce a person to buy or lease a lot. This subpart 
describes certain unlawful sales practices and provides standards to 
illustrate what other sales practices are considered misleading in light 
of certain circumstances in which they are made and within the context 
of the overall offer and sale or lease.


<R05>
Sec. 1715.15  Unlawful sales practices--statutory provisions.

    The statutory prohibitions against fraudulent or misleading sales 
practices are set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1703(a). With respect to the 
prohibitions against representing that certain facilities will be 
provided or completed unless there is a contractual obligation to do so 
by the developer:
    (a) The contractual covenant to provide or complete the services or 
amenities may be conditioned only upon grounds that are legally 
sufficient to establish impossibility of performance in the jurisdiction 
where the services or amenities are being provided or completed;
    (b) Contingencies such as acts of God, strikes, or material 
shortages are recognized as permissible to defer completion of services 
or amenities; and
    (c) In creating these contractual obligations developers have the 
option of incorporating by reference the Property Report in effect at 
the time of the sale or lease. If a developer chooses to incorporate the 
Property Report by reference, the effective date of the Property Report 
being incorporated by reference must be specified in the contract of 
sale or lease.

[61 FR 13598, Mar. 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1715.20  Unlawful sales practices--regulatory provisions.

    In selling, leasing or offering to sell or lease any lot in a 
subdivision it is an unlawful sales practice for any developer or agent, 
directly or indirectly, to:
    (a) Give the Property Report to a purchaser along with other 
materials when done in such a manner so as to conceal the Property 
Report from the purchaser.
    (b) Give a contract to a purchaser or encourage him to sign anything 
before delivery of the Property Report.
    (c) Refer to the Property Report or Offering Statement as anything 
other than a Property Report or Offering Statement.
    (d) Use any misleading practice, device or representation which 
would deny a purchaser any cancellation or refund rights or privileges 
granted the purchaser by the terms of a contract or any other document 
used by the developer as a sales inducement.
    (e) Refuse to deliver a Property Report to any person who exhibits 
an interest in buying or leasing a lot in the subdivision and requests a 
copy of the Property Report.
    (f) Use a Property Report, note, contract, deed or other document 
prepared in a language other than that in which the sales campaign is 
conducted, unless an accurate translation is attached to the document.
    (g) Deliberately fail to maintain a sufficient supply of restrictive 
covenants and financial statements or to deliver a copy to a purchaser 
upon request as required by Secs. 1710.109(f), 1710.112(d), 1710.209(g) 
and 1710.212(i).
    (h) Use, as a sales inducement, any representation that any lot has 
good

[[Page 67]]

investment potential or will increase in value unless it can be 
established, in writing, that:
    (1) Comparable lots or parcels in the subdivision have, in fact, 
been resold by their owners on the open market at a profit, or;
    (2) There is a factual basis for the represented future increase in 
value and the factual basis is certain, and;
    (3) The sales price of the offered lot does not already reflect the 
anticipated increase in value due to any promised facilities or 
amenities. The burden of establishing the relevancy of any comparable 
sales and the certainty of the factual basis of the increase in value 
shall rest upon the developer.
    (i) Represent a lot as a homesite or building lot unless:
    (1) Potable water is available at a reasonable cost;
    (2) The lot is suitable for a septic tank operation or there is 
reasonable assurance that the lot can be served by a central sewage 
system;
    (3) The lot is legally accessible; and
    (4) The lot is free from periodic flooding.


<R05>
Sec. 1715.25  Misleading sales practices.

    Generally, promotional statements or material will be judged on the 
basis of the affirmative representations contained therein and the 
reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, unless the contrary is 
affirmatively stated or appears in promotional material, or unless 
adequate safeguards have been provided by the seller to reasonably 
guarantee the occurrence of the thing inferred. For example, when a lot 
is represented as being sold by a warranty deed, the inference is that 
the seller can and will convey fee simple title free and clear of all 
liens, encumbrances, and defects except those which are disclosed in 
writing to the prospective purchaser prior to conveyance. The following 
advertising and promotional practices, while not all inclusive, are 
considered misleading, and are used to evaluate a developer's or agent's 
representations in determining possible violations of the Act or 
regulations. (In this section ``represent'' carries its common meaning.)
    (a) Proposed improvements. References to proposed improvements of 
any land unless it is clearly indicated that (1) the improvements are 
only proposed or (2) what the completion date is for the proposed 
improvement.
    (b) Off-premises representations. Representing scenes or proposed 
improvements other than those in the subdivision unless
    (1) It is clearly stated that the scenes or improvements are not 
related to the subdivision offered; or
    (2) In the case of drawings that the scenes or improvements are 
artists' renderings;
    (3) If the areas or improvements shown are available to purchasers, 
what the distance in road miles is to the scenes or improvements 
represented.
    (c) Land use representations. Representing uses to which the offered 
land can be put unless the land can be put to such use without 
unreasonable cost to the purchaser and unless no fact or circumstance 
exists which would prohibit the immediate use of the land for its 
represented use.
    (d) Use of ``road'' and ``street''. Using the words ``road'' or 
``street'' unless the type of road surface is disclosed. (All roads and 
streets shown on subdivision maps are presumed to be of an all-weather 
graded gravel quality or higher and are presumed to be traversable by 
conventional automobile under all normal weather conditions unless 
otherwise shown on the map.)
    (e) Road access and use. Representing the existence of a road 
easement or right-of-way unless the easement or right-of-way is 
dedicated to the public, to property owners or to the appropriate 
property owners association.
    (f) Waterfront property. References to waterfront property, unless 
the property being offered actually fronts on a body of water. 
Representations which refer to ``canal'' or ``canals'' must state the 
specific use to which such canal or canals can be put.
    (g) Maps and distances. (1) The use of maps to show proximity to 
other communities, unless the maps are drawn to scale and scale 
included, or the specific road mileage appears in easily readable print.
    (2) The use of the terms such as ``minutes away'', ``short 
distance'', ``only miles'', or ``near'' or similar

[[Page 68]]

terms to indicate distance unless the actual distance in road miles is 
used in conjunction with such terms. Road miles will be measured from 
the approximate geographical center of the subdivided lands to the 
approximate downtown or geographical center of the community.
    (h) Lot size. Representation of the size of a lot offered unless the 
lot size represented is exclusive of all easements to which the lot may 
be subject, except for those for providing utilities to the lot.
    (i) ``Free'' lots. Representing lots as ``free'' if the prospective 
purchaser is required to give any consideration whatsoever, offering 
lots for ``closing costs only'' when the closing costs are substantially 
more than customary, or when an additional lot must be purchased at a 
higher price.
    (j) Pre-development prices. References to pre-development sales at a 
lower price because the land has not yet been developed unless there are 
plans for development, and reasonable assurance is available that the 
plans will be completed.
    (k) False reports of lot sales. Repeatedly announcing that lots are 
being sold or to make repetitive announcements of the same lot being 
sold when in fact this is not the case.
    (l) Guaranteed refund. Use of the word ``guarantee'' or phrase 
``guaranteed refund'' or similar language implying a money-back 
guarantee unless the refund is unconditional.
    (m) Discount certificates. The use of discount certificates when in 
fact there is no actual price reduction or when a discount certificate 
is regularly used.
    (n) Lot exchanges. Representations regarding property exchange 
privileges unless any applicable conditions are clearly stated.
    (o) Resale program. Making any representation that implies that the 
developer or agent will resell or repurchase the property being offered 
at some future time unless the developer or agent has an ongoing program 
for doing so.
    (p) Symbols for conditions. The use of asterisks or any other 
reference symbol or oral parenthetical expression as a means of 
contradicting or substantially changing any previously made statement or 
as a means of obscuring material facts.
    (q) Proposed public facilities. References to a proposed public 
facility unless money has been budgeted for construction of the facility 
and is available to the public authority having the responsibility of 
construction, or unless disclosure of the existing facts concerning the 
public facility is made.
    (r) Non-profit or institutional name use. The use of names or trade 
styles which imply that the developer is a nonprofit research 
organization, public bureau, group, etc., when such is not the case.


<R05>
Sec. 1715.27  Fair housing.

    Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3601, et seq., 
and its implementing regulations and guidelines apply to land sales 
transactions to the extent warranted by the facts of the transaction.

[61 FR 13598, Mar. 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1715.30  Persons to whom subpart B is inapplicable.

    Newspaper or periodical publishers, job printers, broadcasters, or 
telecasters, or any of the employees thereof, are not subject to this 
subpart unless the publishers, printers, broadcasters, or telecasters--
    (a) Have actual knowledge of the falsity of the advertisement or
    (b) Have any interest in the subdivision advertised or
    (c) Also serve directly or indirectly as the advertising agent or 
agency for the developer.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Advertising Disclaimers


<R05>
Sec. 1715.50  Advertising disclaimers; subdivisions registered and effective with HUD.

    (a) The following disclaimer statement shall be displayed below the 
text of all printed material and literature used in connection with the 
sale or lease of lots in a subdivision for which an effective Statement 
or Record is on file with the Secretary. If the material or literature 
consists of more than one page, it shall appear at the bottom of

[[Page 69]]

the front page. The disclaimer statement shall be set in type of at 
least ten point font.

    Obtain the Property Report required by Federal law and read it 
before signing anything. No Federal agency has judged the merits or 
value, if any, of this property.

    (b) If the advertising is of a classified type; is not more than 
five inches long and not more than one column in print wide, the 
disclaimer statement may be set in type of at least six point font.
    (c) This disclaimer statement need not appear on billboards, on 
normal size matchbook folders or business cards which are used in 
advertising nor in advertising of a classified type which is less than 
one column in print wide and is less than five inches long.
    (d) A developer who is required by any state, or states, to display 
an advertising disclaimer in the same location, or one of equal 
prominence, as that of the federal disclaimer, may combine the wording 
of the disclaimers. All of the wording of the federal disclaimer must be 
included in the resulting combined disclaimer.

Proceedings, Room 10278, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Washington, DC 20410, an answer and three copies thereof signed by the 
respondent or attorney. Unless a different time is fixed by the 
Secretary, the filing of a motion for a more definite statement of the 
allegations shall alter the period of time in which to file an answer as 
follows:
    (1) If the motion is denied, the answer shall be filed within 15 
days after service of the denial.
    (2) If the motion is granted in whole or in part, the more definite 
statement of allegations shall be filed after service of the order 
granting the motion and the answer shall be filed within 15 days after 
service of the more definite statement of allegations.
    (b) If a notice or order is amended pursuant to Sec. 1720.255(a), 
the respondent shall have 15 days after service of the amended notice or 
order within which to file an answer.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.245  Content of answer.

    (a) An answer to a notice or order shall contain:

[[Page 80]]

    (1) Specific admission, denial or explanation of each fact alleged 
in the notice or, if the respondent is without knowledge thereof, a 
statement to that effect; and
    (2) A brief statement of the facts constituting each defense.
    (b) Allegations not answered in this manner shall be deemed 
admitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.250  Presumption of hearing request.

    When an answer to a suspension notice, a notice of proceedings, or a 
suspension order is timely filed but a respondent has failed 
specifically to request a hearing, the answer shall be deemed to 
constitute such a request.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.255  Amendments and supplemental pleadings.

    (a) Amendments. Prior to the receipt by the Docket Clerk for 
Administrative Proceedings of an answer to a notice or order, that 
notice or order may be amended as a matter of course. After the receipt 
of an answer, the administrative law judge may allow appropriate 
amendments to pleadings by motion whenever determination of a 
controversy on the merits will be facilitated thereby.
    (b) Variances of proof. When issues not raised by the pleadings but 
reasonably within the scope of the suspension notice or notice of 
proceedings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they 
shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the 
pleadings; and such amendments of the pleadings as may be necessary to 
make them conform to the evidence and to raise such issues shall be 
allowed at any time.
    (c) Supplemental pleadings. The administrative law judge may, upon 
reasonable notice and such terms as are just, permit service of a 
supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or events which have 
occurred since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented and 
which are relevant to any of the issues involved.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.260  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) Where it will expedite the proceeding, the administrative law 
judge may direct or allow the parties or their representatives to appear 
for a conference to consider:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
    (3) Stipulations and admissions of fact and the contents and 
authenticity of documents;
    (4) Expedition in the discovery and presentation of evidence;
    (5) Matters of which official or judicial notice will be taken; and
    (6) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly and expeditious 
disposition of the proceeding, including disclosure of the names of 
witnesses and of documents or other exhibits which will be introduced in 
evidence in the course of the proceeding.

Prior to the conference, the administrative law judge may direct or 
allow the parties or their representatives to file memoranda specifying 
the issues of law and fact to be considered.
    (b) If the circumstances are such that a conference is 
impracticable, the administrative law judge may require the parties to 
correspond for the purpose of accomplishing any of the objectives set 
forth in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.265  Reporting--prehearing conferences.

    Prehearing conferences shall be stenographically or mechanically 
reported; and the administrative law judge shall prepare and file for 
the record a written summary of the action taken at the conference, 
which shall incorporate any written agreements or stipulations made by 
the parties at the conference or as a result of the conference.

                                 Motions


<R05>
Sec. 1720.305  Motions--filing requirements.

    During the time a proceeding is before an administrative law judge, 
all motions therein shall be in writing; and, except as otherwise 
provided in this part, a copy of each motion shall be served on the 
other party or parties. Such motions shall be signed, addressed to, 
filed with and ruled upon by the administrative law judge. The 
provisions of this section need not apply

[[Page 81]]

to motions made during the course of a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.310  Answers to motions.

    Within 7 days after service of any written motion, an opposing party 
shall answer or shall be deemed to consent to the granting of the relief 
asked for in the motion. The moving party shall have no right to reply 
except as permitted by the administrative law judge or the appeals 
officer.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.315  Motion for more definite statement.

    When a respondent is unable to respond to the allegations in a 
suspension notice, a notice of proceedings, or a suspension order, 
because such allegations are vague, unclear or otherwise indefinite, 
motion may be made requesting a more definite statement of the 
allegations before filing an answer. Such motion shall indicate 
specifically in what manner the notice or order is indefinite or 
defective and shall be mailed or submitted to the Docket Clerk for 
Administrative Proceedings, Room 10278, Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, Washington, DC 20410, within five days after service of the 
notice or order.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.320  Motions for extension of time.

    As a matter of discretion, the administrative law judge or the 
appeals officer may waive the requirements of Sec. 1720.310 as to 
motions for extension of time, and may rule upon such motions ex parte. 
Extensions of time or continuances in any proceeding may be ordered on a 
motion by the administrative law judge or on the motion of either party 
for sufficient cause after the policy of the Secretary under 
Sec. 1720.125 has been considered.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.325  Motions for dismissal.

    (a) A motion to dismiss may be made at any time until and including 
the fifth day after the close of the case for the reception of evidence.
    (b) When a motion to dismiss, based upon alleged failure to 
establish a prima facie case, is made at the close of the evidence 
offered in support of the notice or order, the administrative law judge 
may defer ruling thereon until the close of the case for the reception 
of evidence.
    (c) When a motion to dismiss is granted so as to terminate entirely 
the proceeding before the administrative law judge, the administrative 
law judge shall file a decision in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1720.525. If such a motion is granted only as to some allegations 
or as to some respondents, the administrative law judge shall enter this 
partial determination on the record and take it into account in the 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.330  Motions to limit or quash.

    Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time 
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 5 days after 
the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the administrative law 
judge to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanying such application 
with a brief statement of the reasons therefor. The administrative law 
judge shall have the discretion of granting, denying or modifying said 
motion.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.335  Consolidation.

    When more than one proceeding involves a common question of law or 
fact, the administrative law judge may order a joint hearing of any or 
all of the matters in issue in the proceedings and may make such other 
orders concerning the proceedings as to avoid unnecessary costs or 
delay.

                         Discovery and Evidence


<R05>
Sec. 1720.405  Depositions and discovery.

    (a) At any time during the course of a proceeding, the 
administrative law judge may discretionally order the taking of a 
deposition and the production of documents by the deponent. Such order 
may be entered upon a showing that the deposition is necessary for the 
purpose of discovery or to preserve relevant evidence. Insofar as 
consistent with considerations of fairness and the requirements of due 
process and the rules of this subpart, a deposition shall not be ordered 
when it appears that it will result in undue burden to any other party 
or in undue delay of the proceeding. Depositions may be taken

[[Page 82]]

orally or upon written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories.
    (b) Any party desiring to take a deposition shall make application 
in writing to the administrative law judge setting forth the 
justification therefor and the time and place proposed for the taking of 
the deposition. The application shall include also the name and address 
of each proposed deponent and the subject matter concerning which each 
is expected to depose and shall be accompanied by an application for any 
subpoenas desired.
    (c) An order that the administrative law judge may issue for taking 
a deposition shall state the circumstances warranting its being taken, 
and shall designate the time and place and shall show the name and 
address of each person who is expected to appear and the subject matter 
with regard to which each is expected to depose. The time designated 
shall allow not less than 5 days from date of service of the order when 
the deposition is to be taken within the United States, and not less 
than 15 days when the deposition is to be taken elsewhere.
    (d) After an order is served for taking a deposition upon motion 
timely made by any party or by the person to be deposed and for good 
cause shown, the administrative law judge may determine the propriety of 
and issue any of the following orders:
    (1) That the deposition shall not be taken.
    (2) That it may be taken only at some designated place other than 
that stated in the order.
    (3) That it may be taken only on written interrogatories.
    (4) That certain matters shall not be inquired into.
    (5) That the examination shall be held with no one present except 
the parties to the action, their counsel and a person qualified in the 
designated place to administer oaths and affirmations.
    (e) The administrative law judge may make any other order which 
justice requires to protect the party or deponent from annoyance, 
embarrassment or oppression, or to prevent the unnecessary disclosure or 
publication of information contrary to the public interest and beyond 
the requirements of justice in the particular proceeding.
    (f) Each deponent shall be duly sworn, and any adverse party shall 
have the right to cross-examine. Objections to questions or documents 
shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon. 
The questions and the anwers, together with all objections made, but 
excluding argument or debate, shall be reduced to writing and certified 
by the person before whom the deposition was taken. Thereafter such 
person shall forward the deposition and one copy thereof to the party at 
whose instance the deposition was taken, and shall forward one copy 
thereof to the representative of each party who was present or 
represented at the taking of the deposition.
    (g) A deposition taken to preserve relevant evidence which any party 
intends to offer in evidence may be corrected in the manner provided by 
Sec. 1720.515. Any such deposition shall, in addition to the other 
required procedures, be read to or by the deponent and be subscribed by 
the deponent if the party intending to offer it in evidence so notifies 
the person before whom the deposition was taken. Subject to appropriate 
rulings on such objections to the questions and answers as were noted at 
the time the deposition was taken or as may be valid when it is offered, 
a deposition taken to preserve relevant evidence, or any part thereof, 
may be used or offered in evidence as against any party who was present 
or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice 
thereof if the administrative law judge finds any of the following:
    (1) That the deponent is dead.
    (2) That the deponent is out of the United States or is located at 
such a distance that attendance would be impractical, unless it appears 
that the absence of the deponent was procured by the party offering the 
deposition.
    (3) That the deponent is unable to attend or testify because of age, 
sickness, infirmity or imprisonment.
    (4) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the deponent by subpoena.

[[Page 83]]

    (5) That such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it 
desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the 
importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open 
hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.410  Subpoenas ad testificandum.

    Application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear 
and depose or testify at the taking of a deposition or at an 
adjudicative hearing shall be made to the administrative law judge who 
may issue such subpoena.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.415  Subpoenas duces tecum.

    (a) Application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to 
appear and depose or testify and to produce specific documents, papers, 
books, or other physical exhibits at the taking of a deposition, or at a 
prehearing conference, or at an adjudicative hearing shall be made in 
writing to the administrative law judge who may issue such subpoena and 
shall specify as exactly as possible the general relevancy of the 
material and the reasonableness of the scope of the subpoena.
    (b) Subpoenas duces tecum may be used by any party for purposes of 
discovery or for obtaining documents, papers, books, or other physical 
exhibits for use in evidence, or for both purposes. When used for 
discovery purposes a subpoena may require a person to produce and permit 
the inspection and copying of nonprivileged documents, papers, books, or 
other physical exhibits which constitute or contain evidence relevant to 
the subject matter involved and which are in the possession, custody or 
control of such person.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.420  Rulings on applications for compulsory process; appeals.

    (a) Applications for orders requiring the production of witnesses' 
statements pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1720.430, applications for 
orders requiring the taking of depositions pursuant to Sec. 1720.405 and 
applications for the issuance of subpoenas pursuant to Secs. 1720.410 
and 1720.415 may be made ex parte, and, if so made, such applications 
and the rulings thereon shall remain ex parte unless otherwise ordered 
by the administrative law judge. Such applications shall be ruled upon 
by the administrative law judge assigned to hear the case or, in the 
event that judge is not available, by another administrative law judge 
designated by the Secretary.
    (b) Appeals to an appeals officer from rulings denying applications 
within the scope of paragraph (a) of this section, or from rulings on 
motions to limit or quash process issued pursuant to such applications 
will be entertained by the appeals officer only upon a showing that the 
ruling complained of involves substantial rights and will materially 
affect the final decision, and that a determiniation of its correctness 
before conclusion of the hearing is essential to serve the interests of 
justice. Such appeals shall be made on the record, shall briefly state 
the grounds relied on and shall be filed within 5 days after notice of 
the ruling complained of. Appeals from denials of ex parte applications 
shall have annexed thereto copies of the applications and rulings 
involved. Any answer to such appeal shall not operate to suspend the 
hearing unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge or the 
appeals officer.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.425  Presentation and admission of evidence.

    (a) All witnesses at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence 
shall testify under oath or affirmation which shall be administered by 
the administrative law judge. Every party shall have the right to 
present such oral or documentary evidence and to conduct such cross-
examinations as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the 
facts. The administrative law judge shall receive relevant and material 
evidence, rule upon offers of proof and exclude all irrelevant, 
immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence.
    (b) Evidence shall not be excluded merely by application of 
technical rules governing its admissibility, competency, weight or 
foundation in the record; but evidence lacking any significant probative 
value, or substantially tending merely to confuse or extend the record, 
shall be excluded. The

[[Page 84]]

administrative law judge may allow arguments on the admissibility of 
evidence by analogy to the Federal Rules of Evidence currently 
applicable in the United States District Courts of the United States.
    (c) When offered evidence is excluded, the party offering the same 
shall be permitted to state on the record an offer of proof with respect 
thereto and rejected exhibits, adequately marked, shall on request of 
the party offering the same be retained in the record for purposes of 
review. Evidence may be received subject to deferred ruling on 
objections to its admissibility.
    (d) Objections to evidence shall be timely made and shall specify 
the particular ground of objection without argument except as argument 
may be expressly required by the administrative law judge. Formal 
exception to an adverse ruling is unnecessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.430  Production of witnesses' statements.

    After a witness called by the attorney for the Office of Interstate 
Land Sales Registration has given direct testimony in a hearing, any 
other party may request and obtain the production of any statement, or 
part thereof, of such witness pertaining to the witness' direct 
testimony in the possession of the Office of Interstate Land Sales 
Registration, subject, however, to the limitations applicable to the 
production of witnesses' statements under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 
3500.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.435  Official notice.

    Official notice may be taken of any material fact which might be 
judicially noticed by a District Court of the United States, any matter 
in the public official records of the Office of Interstate Land Sales 
Registration or any matter which is peculiarly within the knowledge of 
the administrative law judge. When any decision of an administrative law 
judge rests, in whole or in part, upon the taking of official notice of 
a material fact not appearing in evidence of record, opportunity to 
disprove such noticed fact shall be granted any party making timely 
request therefor.

                                Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 1720.505  Interlocutory review of administrative law judge's decision.

    (a) The appeals officer will not review a ruling of an 
administrative law judge prior to the appeals officer's consideration of 
the entire proceeding in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. 
Except as provided in Sec. 1720.140 an administrative law judge shall 
not certify a ruling for interlocutory review to an appeals officer 
unless a party so requests and the administrative law judge is of the 
opinion and finds either on the record or in writing that:
    (1) A subsequent reversal of the ruling would cause unusual delay or 
expense, taking into consideration the probability of such reversal, or
    (2) Substantial rights are at stake and the final decision might be 
materially affected.
    (b) The certification by the administrative law judge shall be in 
writing and shall specify the material relevant to the ruling involved. 
The appeals officer may decline to consider the ruling certified if the 
officer determines that interlocutory review is not warranted or 
appropriate under the circumstances. If the administrative law judge 
does not certify a matter, a party who had requested certification may 
apply to the appeals officer for review. An application for review shall 
be in writing and shall briefly state the grounds relied on and shall be 
filed within 2 days after notice of the ruling complained of. Review 
will not be granted unless the appeals officer concludes that the 
administrative law judge erred in failing to certify the matter. Unless 
otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge, the hearing shall 
continue whether or not such certification or application is made. 
Failure to request certification or to make such application will not 
waive the right to seek review of the ruling of the administrative law 
judge after the close of the hearing.

certificate of the reporter, for insertion in the official record.


<R05>
Sec. 1720.520  Proposed findings, conclusions, and order.

    The administrative law judge may fix a reasonable time, not to 
exceed 30 days after the close of the evidence, during which any party 
may file with the administrative law judge proposed findings of fact,

thereof. Such proposals shall be in writing, shall be served upon all 
parties and shall contain adequate references to the record and to 
authorities relied on. The record shall show the administrative law 
judge's ruling on each proposed finding and conclusion, except when the 
rule or order disposing of the proceeding otherwise informs the parties 
of the action taken thereon.


<R05>

within 30 days after the close of the taking of evidence in cases in 
which a hearing is held.
    (b) The decision shall be effective 10 days after service upon the

    (a) At any time prior to the filing of the decision, the 
administrative law judge may reopen the proceeding for the reception of 
further evidence.
    (b) The jurisdiction of the administrative law judge is terminated 
when the decision becomes effective unless and until the proceeding is 
remanded to the judge by the appeals officer or a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction. The administrative law judge may sua sponte or on motion 
of a party file corrections of clerical errors.

    (a) Upon appeal from or review of an administrative law judge's 
decision, the appeals officer will consider such parts of the record as 
are cited or as may be necessary to resolve the issues and, in addition,

remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the administrative 
law judge's decision. The appellate order shall set forth the reasons 
upon which the decision is based.
    (c) In those cases where the appeals officer believes that further 
information or additional arguments of the parties are needed as to the 
form and content of the rule or order to be issued, the appeals officer 
may withhold final decision pending the receipt of such additional 
information or argument under procedures specified.
    (d) The decision of the appeals officer shall be final 10 days after

<R05>
Sec. 2002.1  Scope of the part and applicability of other HUD regulations.

    (a) General. This part contains the regulations of the Office of 
Inspector General of HUD which implement the Freedom of Information Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552). It tells the public how to request records and 
information from the Office of Inspector General and explains the 
procedure to use if a request is denied. Requests for documents made by 
subpoena or other order are governed by procedures contained in part 
2004 of this chapter. In addition to the regulations in this part, the 
following provisions of part 15 of this title covering the production or 
disclosure of material or information apply (except as limited in 
paragraph (b) of this section) to the production or disclosure of 
material in the possession of the Office of Inspector General:

Sec.
15.1  Definitions.
15.3  Statement of policy.
15.11  Publication in the Federal Register.
15.12  Materials not published in the Federal Register.
15.31  Information Centers.
15.32  Information officers.
15.33  Material in Department Central Information Center.

    (b) Limited applicability of some sections of part 15. Sections 
15.12 and 15.33 of this title describe Department material generally 
available for public inspection and copying in one or more Department 
Information Centers. To the extent the Information Centers listed in 
Sec. 15.31 of this title maintain Office of Inspector General material 
of this type, part 15 applies and members of the public may seek 
assistance at these centers. A request for specific documents made under 
the Freedom of Information Act must be made using the procedures 
identified in this part 2002.
    (c) Use of the term ``Department.'' For purposes of this part, when 
the word Department is used in Secs. 15.12, 15.31, 15.32 and 15.33 of 
this title, the term means Department as defined in Sec. 15.1 of this 
title. When the word Department is used in Secs. 15.3 and 15.11 of this 
title, the terms means Office of Inspector General.
    (d) Request for declassification and release of classified material. 
Section 15.81 of this title contains the provisions for requesting 
declassification and release of declassified material.

[49 FR 11165, Mar. 26, 1984, as amended at 57 FR 2227, Jan. 21, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.3  Request for records.

    (a) A request for Office of Inspector General records may be made in 
person during normal business hours at any office where Office of 
Inspector General employees are permanently stationed. Although oral 
requests may be honored, a requester may be asked to submit the request 
in writing. A written request may be addressed to:
    (1) Any Office of Inspector General employee at any location where 
that employee is permanently stationed; or
    (2) The Office of Inspector General, Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, Washington, DC 20410.
    (b) Each request must reasonably describe the desired record 
including the name, subject matter, and number or date, where possible, 
so that the record

[[Page 92]]

may be identified and located. The request should include the name, 
address and telephone number of the requester. In order to enable the 
Office of Inspector General to comply with the time limitations set 
forth in Sec. 2002.17, both the envelope containing a written request 
and the letter itself should clearly indicate that the subject is a 
Freedom of Information Act request.
    (c) The request must be accompanied by the fee or an offer to pay 
the fee as determined in Sec. 2002.7. At its discretion, the Office of 
Inspector General may require advance payment in accordance with 
Sec. 2002.15.
    (d) Copies of available records will be made as promptly as 
possible. Copying service will be limited to not more than 10 copies of 
any single page. Records which are published or available for sale need 
not be reproduced.

[49 FR 11165, Mar. 26, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 37550 and 37552, Sept. 
27, 1988; 59 FR 14097, Mar. 25, 1994]]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.5  Records produced upon request when reasonably described.

    (a) When a request is made which reasonably describes a record of 
the Office of Inspector General (see Sec. 2002.3) which has been stored 
in the National Archives or other record center of the General Services 
Administration, the record will be requested by the Office of Inspector 
General if it otherwise would be available under this part.
    (b) Every effort will be made to make a record in use by the staff 
of the Office of Inspector General available when requested, and such 
availability will be deferred only to the extent necessary to avoid 
serious interference with the business of the Office of Inspector 
General.


<R05>
Sec. 2002.7  Fees.

    (a) Copies of records. HUD will charge $0.10 per page for copies of 
documents up to 11"  x  14". For copies prepared by computer, such as 
tapes or printouts, HUD will charge the actual costs, including operator 
time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods of 
reproduction or duplication, HUD will charge the actual direct costs of 
producing the document(s).
    (b) Manual searches for records. Whenever feasible, HUD will charge 
at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent) of the 
employee(s) making the search. However, where a homogeneous class of 
personnel is used exclusively in a search (e.g., all administrative/
clerical, or all professional/executive), HUD will charge $9.25 per hour 
for clercial time and $18.50 per hour for professional time. Charges for 
search time less than a full hour will be billed by five-minute (\1/12\ 
of one hour) segments.
    (c) Computer searches for records. HUD will charge at the actual 
direct cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of 
operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of 
operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records 
responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary 
approtionable to the search.
    (d) Contract services. HUD will contract with private sector sources 
to locate, reproduce and disseminate records in response to FOIA 
requests when that is the most efficent and least costly method. When 
doing so, however, HUD will ensure that the ultimate cost to the 
requester is no greater than it would be if HUD itself had performed 
these tasks. In no case will HUD contract out responsibilities which the 
FOIA provides that HUD alone may discharge, such as determining the 
applicability of an exemption, or determining whether to waive or reduce 
fees. HUD will ensure that when documents that would be responsive to a 
request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-
based fee schedule programs such as the National Technical Information 
Service, HUD will inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain 
records from those sources. Information provided routinely in the normal 
course of business will be provided at no charge.
    (e) Restrictions on assessing fees. With the exception of requesters 
seeking documents for commercial use, HUD will provide the first 100 
pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without 
charge. For non-commercial use requesters, HUD will not begin to assess 
fees until after HUD has provided the free search and reproduction.

[[Page 93]]

No charge will be assessed non-commercial use requesters when the search 
time and reproduction costs, over and above the free search time and 
reproduction allocation, totals no more than $5.00. For commercial use 
requesters, no charge will be assessed when the search time, 
reproduction and review costs total no more than $5.00. Search time in 
this context is based on manual search. To apply this term to searches 
made by computer, HUD will determine the hourly cost of operating the 
central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 
percent. When the cost of the search (including the operator time and 
the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the 
equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person 
performing the search, i.e., the operator, HUD will begin assessing 
charges for computer search.
    (f) Payment of fees. Payment of fees under this section and under 
Sec. 2002.11(a) shall be made in cash or by U.S. money order or by 
certified bank check payable to the Treasurer of the United States. The 
fees shall be sent to the organizational unit within HUD responding to 
the request.
    (g) Definitions. As used in this subpart:
    (1) Direct costs means those expenditures which HUD actually incurs 
in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial 
requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct 
costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work 
(the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to 
cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not 
included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, 
and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.
    (2) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. Such activity is 
distinguished from review of material in order to determine whether the 
material is exempt from disclosure.
    (3) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of 
paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable 
documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.
    (4) Review means the process of examining a document located in 
response to a request that is for a commerical use to determine whether 
any portion of it may be withheld, excising portions to be withheld and 
otherwise preparing the document for release. Review does not include 
time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the 
application of exemptions.

[53 FR 37550, Sept. 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.9  Fees to be charged--categories of requesters.

    There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use 
requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; 
representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. Specific 
levels of fees are prescribed for each of these categories:
    (a) Commercial use requesters. (1) HUD will assess charges which 
recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, 
and duplicating records sought for commercial use. Requesters must 
reasonably describe the records sought. Commercial use requesters are 
not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of 
reproduction of documents.
    (2) Commercial use refers to a request from or on behalf of one who 
seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, 
trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose 
behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly 
belongs in this category, HUD must determine the use to which a 
requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where HUD has 
reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the 
records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, 
HUD will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a 
specific category.
    (b) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters. (1) HUD will provide documents to educational and non-
commercial scientific institutions for the cost of reproduction

[[Page 94]]

alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for 
inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is 
being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, 
but are sought for furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an 
educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-
commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably 
describe the records sought.
    (2) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher 
education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (3) Non-commercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is referenced in 
Sec. 2002.9(a) and which is operated solely for the purpose of 
conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to 
promote any particular product or industry.
    (c) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. (1) HUD 
will provide documents to representatives of the news media for the cost 
of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. In 
reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting 
the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered 
to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requesters must reasonably 
describe the records sought.
    (2) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) 
who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the 
general public. Freelance journalists may be regarded as working for a 
news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting 
publication through that organization, even though not actually employed 
by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but HUD may 
also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this 
determination.
    (d) All other requesters. HUD will charge requesters who do not fit 
into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable 
direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive 
to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the 
first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. 
Requests from subjects for records about themselves filed in agencies' 
systems of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions 
of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction. 
Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.

[53 FR 37551, Sept. 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.11  Review of records, aggregating requests and waiving or reducing fees.

    (a) Review of records. Only requesters who are seeking documents for 
commercial use may be charged for time HUD spends reviewing records to 
determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may 
be assessed only for the initial review; i.e., the review undertaken the 
first time HUD analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a 
particular record or portion of a record. HUD will not charge for review 
at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied. 
However, records or portions of records withheld in full under an 
exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed 
again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously 
considered. The costs for such a subsequent review would be properly 
assessable. Review time will be assessed at the same rates established 
for search time in Sec. 2002.7.
    (b) Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests 
at the same time, each seeking portions of a

[[Page 95]]

document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When 
HUD reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting 
in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of 
requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, HUD may 
aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.
    (c) Waiving or reducing fees. HUD will furnish documents without 
charge or at reduced charge if disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government 
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The 
official authorized to grant access to records may waive or reduce the 
applicable fee where requested. The determination not to waive or reduce 
the fee will be subject to administrative review as provided in 
Sec. 2002.25 after the decision on the request for access has been made. 
Six factors shall be used in determining whether the requirements for a 
fee waiver or reduction are met. These factors are as follows:
    (1) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';
    (2) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities;
    (3) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';
    (4) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities;
    (5) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (6) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the 
identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, 
in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is 
``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''

[53 FR 37551, Sept. 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.13  Charges for interest and for unsuccessful searches; utilization of Debt Collection Act.

    (a) Charging interest. HUD will begin assessing interest charges on 
an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the 
billing was sent. A fee received by HUD, even if not processed, will 
suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate 
prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and will accrue from the 
date of the billing.
    (b) Charge for unsuccessful search. Ordinarily no charge for search 
time will be assessed when the records requested are not found or when 
the records located are withheld as exempt. However, if the requester 
has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been 
advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be 
withheld as exempt, fees shall be charged.
    (c) Use of Debt Collection Act of 1982. When a requester has failed 
to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the 
date of the billing), HUD may, under the authority of the Debt 
Collection Act and part 17, subpart C of this title, use consumer 
reporting agencies and collection agencies, where appropriate, to 
recover the indebtedness owed the Department.

[53 FR 37552, Sept. 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.15  Advance payments.

    (a) HUD may not require a requester to make an advance payment, 
i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, 
unless:
    (1) HUD estimates or determines that allowable charges that a 
requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, HUD 
will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory 
assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt 
payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to 
the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of 
payment; or

[[Page 96]]

    (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in 
a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), HUD 
may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any 
applicable interest as provided by Sec. 2002.13(a) or demonstrate that 
he has, in fact, paid the fees, and to make an advance payment of the 
full amount of the estimated fee before HUD begins to process a new 
request or a pending request from that requester.
    (b) When HUD acts under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, 
the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the 
FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 
working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus 
permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after HUD 
has received fee payments described above.
    (c) Where it is anticipated that either the duplication fee 
individually, the search fee individually, or a combination of the two 
exceeds $25.00 over and above the free search time and duplication 
costs, where applicable, and the requesting party has not indicated in 
advance a willingness to pay so high a fee, the requesting party shall 
be promptly informed of the amount of the anticipated fee or such 
portion thereof as can readily be estimated. The notification shall 
offer the requesting party the opportunity to confer with agency 
representatives for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to 
meet that party's needs at a reduced cost.

[53 FR 37552, Sept. 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.17  Time limitations.

    (a) Upon receipt of a request for records, the appropriate Assistant 
Inspector General or an appointed designee will determine within ten 
working days whether to grant the request. The Assistant Inspector 
General or designee will notify the requestor immediately in writing of 
the determination and the right of the person to request a review by the 
Inspector General of an adverse determination.
    (b) The time of receipt for processing a request for records 
purposes is the time it is received by the appropriate office for 
review. If a request is misdirected by the requester, the Office of 
Inspector General or Department official who receives the request will 
promptly refer it to the appropriate office and will advise the 
requester about the delayed time of receipt.
    (c) A determination with respect to a request for review by the 
Inspector General of HUD under Sec. 2002.25 will be made within 20 
working days after receipt and will be communicated immediately to the 
person requesting review.
    (d) If the Office of Inspector General grants the request for 
records, the records will be made available promptly to the requester.
    (e) In unusual circumstances as specified in this paragraph, and 
subject to the concurrence of any Assistant Inspector General or 
appointed designee, the time limits prescribed in either paragraph (a) 
or (c) of this section may be extended. Any extension will be in writing 
to the requester and will include reasons for the extension and the date 
on which the disposition of the request will be sent. No extension will 
be for more than ten working days. As used in this paragraph, unusual 
circumstances means (but only to the extent necessary to the proper 
processing of the particular request) that there is a need:
    (1) To search for and collect the requested records from field 
facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office 
processing the request; or
    (2) To search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous 
amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single 
request; or
    (3) For consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable 
speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the 
determination of the request or among two or more offices of the Office 
of Inspector General having a substantial interest in the subject matter 
of the request.

[[Page 97]]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.19  Authority to release records or copies.

    Any Assistant Inspector General or an appointed designee is 
authorized to release any record (or copy) pertaining to activities for 
which he or she has primary responsibility, unless disclosure is clearly 
inappropriate under this part. No authorized person may release records 
for which another officer has primary responsibility without the consent 
of the officer or his or her designee.

<R05>
Sec. 2002.21  Authority to deny requests for records and form of denial.

    (a) An Assistant Inspector General may deny a request for a record. 
Any denial will:
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) State simply the reasons for the denial;
    (3) State that review of the denial by the Inspector General of HUD 
may be requested;
    (4) Set forth the steps for obtaining review consistent with 
Sec. 2002.25; and
    (5) Be signed by the Assistant Inspector General responsible for the 
denial.
    (b) The classes of records authorized to be exempted from disclosure 
by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) are those which concern 
matters that are:
    (1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy; and
    (ii) Are in fact properly classified under the cited executive 
order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
HUD;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 
section 552b of title 5), provided that the statute either:
    (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in a 
manner that leaves no discretion on the issue; or
    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that are 
obtained from a person and are privileged or confidential;
    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not 
be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with 
HUD;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or 
authority, or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if the disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual;
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 
or
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (c) With regard to a request for commercial or financial 
information,

[[Page 98]]

predisclosure notification to business submitters is required by 
Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235) to afford the business 
submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of the requested 
information.
    (d) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided

Sec. 2002.23  Effect of denial of request.

<R05>
Sec. 2002.25  Administrative review.

    (a) Review is available only from a written denial of a request for 
a record issued under Sec. 2002.21 and only if a written request for 
review is filed within 30 days after issuance of the written denial.
    (b) A review may be initiated by mailing a request for review to the 
Inspector General of HUD, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 8256, Washington, DC 20410. Each request 
for review must contain the following:
    (1) A copy of the request, if in writing;
    (2) A copy of the written denial issued under Sec. 2002.21; and
    (3) A statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments advanced 
in support of disclosure of the original request for the record.

In order to enable the Inspector General of HUD to comply with the time 
limitations set forth in Sec. 2002.17, both the envelope containing the 
request for review and the letter itself should clearly indicate that 
the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request for review.
    (c) Review will be made promptly by the Inspector General of HUD on 
the basis of the written record described in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Before a denial, the Inspector General will obtain the 
concurrence of legal counsel for the Office of Inspector General.
    (d) The time of receipt for processing of a request for review 
purposes is the time it is received by the Inspector General of HUD. If 
a request is misdirected by the requester and is received by one other 
than the Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General or 
Department official who receives the request will forward it promptly to 
the Inspector General and will advise the requester about the delayed 
time of receipt.
    (e) The decision after review will be in writing, will constitute 
final agency action on the request, and, if the denial of the request 
for records is in full or in part upheld, the Inspector General will 
notify the person making the request of his or her right to seek 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).

    (a) General. This part contains the regulations of the Office of 
Inspector General (``OIG'') implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (5

[[Page 99]]

Inspector General has the responsibility for carrying out the 
requirements of the Privacy Act and for issuing internal OIG orders and 
directives in connection with the Privacy Act. These regulations apply 
to all records that are contained in systems of records maintained by 
the OIG and that are retrieved by an individuals's name or personal 
identifier.
    (b) Applicability of part 16. In addition to these regulations, the 
provisions of 24 CFR part 16 apply to the OIG, except that appendix A to 
part 16 is not applicable. The provisions of this part shall govern in 
the event of any conflict with the provisions of part 16.


<R05>
Sec. 2003.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    Department means the OIG, except that in the context of 
Secs. 16.1(d); 16.11(b) (1), (3), and (4); and 16.12(e), when those 
sections are incorporated by reference, the term means the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development.
    Privacy Act Officer means an Assistant Inspector General.
    Privacy Appeals Officer means the Inspector General.

[59 FR 14098, Mar. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 2003.3  Requests for records.

    (a) A request from an individual for an OIG record about that 
individual which is not contained in an OIG system of records will be 
considered to be a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and will be 
processed under 24 CFR part 2002.
    (b) A request from an individual for an OIG record about that 
individual which is contained in an OIG system of records will be 
processed under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA in order to ensure 
maximum access under both statutes. This practice will be undertaken 
regardless of how an individual characterizes the request.
    (1) The procedures for inquiries and requirements for access to 
records under the Privacy Act are more specifically set forth in 24 CFR 
part 16, except that appendix A to part 16 does not apply to the OIG.
    (2) An individual will not be required to state a reason or 
otherwise justify his or her request for access to a record.


<R05>
Sec. 2003.4  Officials to receive requests and inquiries.

    Officials to receive requests and inquiries for access to, or 
correction of, records in OIG systems of records are the Privacy Act 
Officers described in Sec. 2003.2 of this part. Written requests may be 
addressed to the appropriate Privacy Act Officer at: Office of Inspector 
General, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC 
20410.

[57 FR 62142, Dec. 29, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 14098, Mar. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 2003.5  Initial denial of access to records.

    (a) Access by an individual to a record about that individual which 
is contained in an OIG system of records will be denied only upon a 
determination by the Privacy Act Officer that:
    (1) The record was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil 
action or proceeding; or the record is subject to a Privacy Act 
exemption under Sec. 2003.8 or Sec. 2003.9 of this part; and
    (2) The record is also subject to a FOIA exemption under 
Sec. 2002.21(b) of this chapter.
    (b) If a request is partially denied, any portions of the responsive 
record that can be reasonably segregated will be provided to the 
individual after deletion of those portions determined to be exempt.
    (c) The provisions of 24 CFR 16.6(b) and 16.7, concerning 
notification of an initial denial of access and administrative review of 
the initial denial, apply to the OIG, except that:
    (1) The final determination of the Inspector General, as Privacy 
Appeals Officer for the OIG, will be in writing and will constitute 
final action of the Department on a request for access to a record in an 
OIG system of records; and
    (2) If the denial of the request is in whole or in part upheld, the 
final determination of the Inspector General will include notice of the 
right to judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 2003.6  Disclosure of a record to a person other than the individual to whom it pertains.

    (a) The OIG may disclose an individual's record to a person other 
than the

[[Page 100]]

individual to whom the record pertains in the following instances:
    (1) Upon written request by the individual, including authorization 
under 24 CFR 16.5(e);
    (2) With the prior written consent of the individual;
    (3) To a parent or legal guardian of the individual under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(h); or
    (4) When permitted by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) (1) through 
(12).
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 2003.7  Authority to make law enforcement-related requests for records maintained by other agencies.

    (a) The Inspector General is authorized by written delegation from 
the Secretary of HUD and under the Inspector General Act to make written 
requests under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7) for transfer of records maintained by 
other agencies which are necessary to carry out an authorized law 
enforcement activity under the Inspector General Act.
    (b) The Inspector General delegates the authority under paragraph 
(a) of this section to the following OIG officials:
    (1) Deputy Inspector General;
    (2) Assistant Inspector General for Audit;
    (3) Assistant Inspector General for Investigation; and
    (4) Assistant Inspector General for Management and Policy.
    (c) The officials listed in paragraph (b) of this section may not 
redelegate the authority described in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2003.8  General exemptions.

    (a) The systems of records entitled ``Investigative Files of the 
Office of Inspector General,'' ``Hotline Complaint Files of the Office 
of Inspector General,'' ``Name Indices System of the Office of Inspector 
General,'' and ``AutoInvestigation of the Office of Inspector General'' 
consist, in part, of information compiled by the OIG for the purpose of 
criminal law enforcement investigations. Therefore, to the extent that 
information in these systems falls within the scope of exemption (j)(2) 
of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), these systems of records are 
exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy 
Act, for the reasons stated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this 
section.
    (1) From subsection (c)(3), because release of an accounting of 
disclosures to an individual who is the subject of an investigation 
could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result 
in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of 
witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the 
investigation.
    (2) From subsection (d)(1), because release of investigative records 
to an individual who is the subject of an investigation could interfere 
with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal 
the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative 
techniques and procedures.
    (3) From subsection (d)(2), because amendment or correction of 
investigative records could interfere with pending or prospective law 
enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative 
and investigative burden by requiring the OIG to continuously retrograde 
its investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, 
relevance, timeliness and completeness.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to 
determine relevance or necessity of information in the early stages of 
an investigation. The value of such information is a question of 
judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected 
may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to 
an investigation. In addition, the OIG may obtain information concerning 
the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its 
jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the OIG 
should retain this information because it may aid in establishing 
patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law 
enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an 
investigation, information may be provided to the OIG which relates to 
matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but which 
may be pertinent

[[Page 101]]

to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information 
cannot readily be identified.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2), because in a law enforcement 
investigation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to 
the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject thereof. It is 
not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an investigation as a 
source for information which may implicate him or her in illegal 
activities. In addition, collecting information directly from the 
subject could seriously compromise an investigation by prematurely 
revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an 
opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential 
sources, in order to avoid apprehension.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3), because providing such notice to the 
subject of an investigation, or to other individual sources, could 
seriously compromise the investigation by prematurely revealing its 
nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, permit the subject to 
evade apprehension, or cause interference with undercover activities.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 2003.9  Specific exemptions.

    (a) The systems of records entitled ``Investigative Files of the 
Office of Inspector General,'' ``Hotline Complaint Files of the Office 
of Inspector General,'' ``Name Indices System of the Office of Inspector 
General,'' and ``AutoInvestigation of the Office of Inspector General'' 
consist, in part, of investigatory material compiled by the OIG for law 
enforcement purposes. Therefore, to the extent that information in these 
systems falls within the coverage of exemption (k)(2) of the Privacy 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), these systems of records are exempt from the 
requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the 
reasons stated in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) From subsection (c)(3), because release of an accounting of 
disclosures to an individual who is the subject of an investigation 
could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result 
in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of 
witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the 
investigation.
    (2) From subsection (d)(1), because release of investigative records 
to an individual who is the subject of an investigation could interfere 
with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal 
the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative 
techniques and procedures.
    (3) From subsection (d)(2), because amendment or correction of 
investigative records could interfere with pending or prospective law 
enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative 
and investigative burden by requiring the OIG to continuously retrograde 
its investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, 
relevance, timeliness and completeness.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to 
determine relevance or necessity of information in the early stages of 
an investigation. The value of such information is a question of 
judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected 
may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to 
an investigation. In addition, the OIG may obtain information concerning 
the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its 
jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the OIG 
should retain this information because it may aid in establishing 
patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law 
enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an 
investigation, information may be provided to the OIG which relates to 
matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but which 
may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. 
Such information cannot readily be identified.
    (b) The systems of records entitled ``Investigative Files of the 
Office of Inspector General,'' ``Hotline Complaint

[[Page 102]]

Files of the Office of Inspector General,'' ``Name Indices System of the 
Office of Inspector General,'' and ``Autoinvestigation of the Office of 
Inspector General'' consist in part of investigatory material compiled 
by the OIG for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or 
qualifications for Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the 
release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished 
information to the Government under an express promise that the identity 
of the source would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that 
information in these systems fall within the coverage of exemption 
(k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), these systems of records 
are exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(1), because release 
would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the 
Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the 
identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by 
sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.

    (a) Minimum requirements. The design and construction of a 
manufactured home shall conform with the provisions of this standard. 
Requirements for any size, weight, or quality of material modified by 
the terms of minimum, not less than, at least, and similar expressions 
are minimum standards. The manufacturer or installer may exceed these 
standards provided such deviation does not result in any inferior 
installation or defeat the purpose and intent of this standard.
    (b) Construction. All construction methods shall be in conformance 
with accepted engineering practices to insure durable, livable, and safe 
housing and shall demonstrate acceptable workmanship reflecting 
journeyman quality of work of the various trades.
    (c) Structural analysis. The strength and rigidity of the component 
parts and/or the integrated structure shall be determined by engineering 
analysis or by suitable load tests to simulate the actual loads and 
conditions of application that occur. (See subparts E and J.)
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) New materials and methods. (1) Any new material or method of 
construction not provided for in this standard and any material or 
method of questioned suitability proposed for use in the manufacture of 
the structure shall nevertheless conform in performance to the 
requirements of this standard.
    (2) Unless based on accepted engineering design for the use 
indicated, all new manufactured home materials, equipment, systems or 
methods of construction not provided for in this standard shall be 
subjected to the tests specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Allowable design stress. The design stresses of all materials 
shall conform to accepted engineering practice. The use of materials not 
certified as to strength or stress grade shall be limited to the minimum 
allowable stresses under accepted engineering practice.
    (g) Alternative test procedures. In the absence of recognized 
testing procedures either in these standards or the applicable 
provisions of those standards incorporated by reference, the 
manufacturer electing this option shall develop or cause to be developed 
testing procedures to demonstrate the structural properties and 
significant characteristics of the material, assembly, subassembly 
component or member. Such testing procedures shall become part of the 
manufacturer's approved design. (Refer to Sec. 3280.3.)
    (1) Testing procedures so developed shall be submitted to the 
Department for approval.
    (2) Upon notification of approval, the alternative test procedure is

<R05>
Sec. 3280.305  Structural design requirements.

    (a) General. Each manufactured home shall be designed and 
constructed as a completely integrated structure capable of sustaining 
the design load requirements of this standard, and shall be capable of 
transmitting these loads to stabilizing devices without exceeding the 
allowable stresses or deflections. Roof framing shall be securely 
fastened to wall framing, walls to floor structure, and floor structure 
to chassis to secure and maintain continuity between the floor and 
chassis, so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding as 
imposed by design loads in this part. Uncompressed finished flooring 
greater than 1/8 inch in thickness shall not extend beneath load-bearing 
walls that are fastened to the floor structure.
    (b) Design loads--(1) Design dead loads. Design dead loads shall be 
the actual dead load supported by the structural assembly under 
consideration.
    (2) Design live loads. The design live loads and wind and snow loads 
shall be as specified in this section and shall be considered to be 
uniformly distributed. The roof live load or snow load shall not be 
considered as acting simultaneously with the wind load and the roof live 
or snow load and floor live loads shall not be considered as resisting 
the overturning moment due to wind.
    (3) When engineering calculations are performed, allowable unit 
stresses may be increased as provided in the documents referenced in 
Sec. 3280.304 except as otherwise indicated in Secs. 3280.304(b)(1) and 
3280.306(a).
    (4) Whenever the roof slope does not exceed 20 degrees, the design 
horizontal wind loads required by Sec. 3280.305(c)(1) may be determined 
without including the vertical roof projection of the manufactured home. 
However, regardless of the roof slope of the manufactured home, the 
vertical roof projection shall be included when determining the wind 
loading for split level or clerestory-type roof systems.
    (c) Wind, snow, and roof loads--(1) Wind loads--design requirements. 
(i) Standard wind loads (Zone I). When a manufactured home is not 
designed to resist the wind loads for high wind areas (Zone II or Zone 
III) specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the manufactured 
home and each of its wind resisting parts and portions shall be designed 
for horizontal wind loads of not less than 15 psf and net uplift load of 
not less than 9 psf.
    (ii) Wind loads for high wind areas (Zone II and Zone III). When 
designed for high wind areas (Zone II and Zone III), the manufactured 
home, each of its wind resisting parts (including, but not limited to, 
shear walls, diaphragms, ridge beams, and their fastening and anchoring 
systems), and its components and cladding materials (including, but not 
limited to, roof trusses, wall studs, exterior sheathing, roofing and 
siding materials, exterior glazing, and their connections and fasteners) 
shall be designed by a Professional Engineer or Architect to resist:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
 
<SUP>1</SUP> The net horizontal drag of <plus-minus>39 PSF to be used in
  calculating Anchorage for Lateral and Vertical Stability and for the
  design of Main Wind Force Resisting Systems is based on a distribution
  of wind pressures of +0.8 or +24 PSF to the windward wall and -0.5 or
  15 PSF to the leeward wall.
<SUP>2</SUP> Horizontal drag pressures need not be applied to roof projections when
  the roof slope does not exceed 20 degrees.
<SUP>3</SUP> + sign would mean pressures are acting towards or on the structure; -
  sign means pressures are acting away from the structure; <plus-minus>
  sign means forces can act in either direction, towards or away from
  the structure.
<SUP>4</SUP> Design values in this ``Table'' are only applicable to roof slopes
  between 10 degrees (nominal 2/12 slope) and 30 degrees.
<SUP>5</SUP> The design uplift pressures are the same whether they are applied
  normal to the surface of the roof or to the horizontal projection of
  the roof.
<SUP>6</SUP> Shingle roof coverings that are secured with 6 fasteners per shingle
  through an underlayment which is cemented to a 3/8'' structural rated
  roof sheathing need not be evaluated for these design wind pressures.
<SUP>7</SUP> Structural rated roof sheathing that is at least 3/8'' in thickness,
  installed with the long dimension perpendicular to roof framing
  supports, and secured with fasteners at 4'' on center within 3'-0'' of
  each gable end or endwall if no overhang is provided and 6'' on center
  in all other areas, need not be evaluated for these design wind
  pressures.
<SUP>8</SUP> Exterior coverings that are secured at 6'' o.c. to a 3/8'' structural
  rated sheathing that is fastened to wall framing members at 6'' on
  center need not be evaluated for these design wind pressures.

    (2) Wind loads--zone designations. The Wind Zone and specific wind 
design load requirements are determined by the fastest basic wind speed 
(mph) within each Zone and the intended location, based on the Basic 
Wind Zone Map, as follows:
    (i) Wind Zone I. Wind Zone I consists of those areas on the Basic 
Wind Zone Map that are not identified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) or (iii)

South Zone....................................................        20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) For exposures in areas (mountainous or other) where snow or 
wind records or experience indicate significant differences from the 
loads stated above, the Department may establish more stringent 
requirements for homes known to be destined for such areas. For snow 
loads, such requirements are to be based on a roof snow load of 0.6 of 
the ground snow load for areas exposed to wind and a roof snow load of 
0.8 of the ground snow load for sheltered areas.
    (iii) Eaves and cornices shall be designed for a net uplift pressure 
of 2.5 times the design uplift wind pressure cited in 
Sec. 3280.305(c)(1)(i) for Wind Zone I, and for the design pressures 
cited in Sec. 3280.305(c)(1)(ii) for Wind Zones II and III.
    (4) Data plate requirements. The Data Plate posted in the 
manufactured home (see Sec. 3280.5) shall designate the wind and roof 
load zones or, if designed for higher loads, the actual design external 
snow and wind loads for which the home has been designed. The Data Plate 
shall include reproductions of the Load Zone Maps shown in this 
paragraph (c)(4), with any related information. The Load Zone Maps shall 
be not less than either 3\1/2\ in. by 2\1/4\ in., or one-half the size 
illustrated in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (d) Design load deflection. (1) When a structural assembly is 
subjected to total design live loads, the deflection for structural 
framing members shall not exceed the following (where L equals the clear 
span between supports or two times the length of a cantilever):


[[Page 128]]


Floor--L/240
Roof and ceiling--L/180
Headers, beams, and girders (vertical load)--L/180
Walls and partitions--L/180
    (2) The allowable eave or cornice deflection for uplift is to be 
measured at the design uplift load of 9 psf for Wind Zone I, and at the 
design uplift pressure cited in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for 
Wind Zones II and III. The allowable deflection shall be (2 x Lc)/180, 
where Lc is the measured horizontal eave projection from the wall.
    (e) Fastening of structural systems. (1) Roof framing shall be 
securely fastened to wall framing, walls to floor structure, and floor 
structure to chassis to secure and maintain continuity between the floor 
and chassis, so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding as 
specified in this part.
    (2) For Wind Zones II and III, roof trusses shall be secured to 
exterior wall framing members (studs), and exterior wall framing members 
(studs) shall be secured to floor framing members, with 26 gage minimum 
steel strapping or brackets or by a combination of 26 gage minimum steel 
strapping or brackets and structural rated wall sheathing that overlaps 
the roof and floor. Steel strapping or brackets shall be installed at a 
maximum spacing of 24" on center in Wind Zone II and at a maximum of 16" 
on center in Wind Zone III. The number and type of fasteners used to 
secure the steel straps or brackets or structural sheathing shall be 
capable of transferring all uplift forces between elements being joined.
    (f) Walls. The walls shall be of sufficient strength to withstand 
the load requirements as defined in Sec. 3280.305(c) of this part, 
without exceeding the deflections as specified in Sec. 3280.305(d). The 
connections between the bearing walls, floor, and roof framework members 
shall be fabricated in such a manner as to provide support for the 
material used to enclose the manufactured home and to provide for 
transfer of all lateral and vertical loads to the floor and chassis.
    (1) Except where substantiated by engineering analysis or tests, 
studs shall not be notched or drilled in the middle one-third of their 
length.
    (2) Interior walls and partitions shall be constructed with

Sec. 3280.306  Windstorm protection.

    (a) Provisions for support and anchoring systems. Each manufactured 
home shall have provisions for support/anchoring or foundation systems 
that, when properly designed and installed, will resist overturning and 
lateral movement (sliding) of the manufactured home as imposed by the 
respective design loads. For Wind Zone I, the design wind loads to be 
used for calculating resistance to overturning and lateral movement 
shall be the simultaneous application of the wind loads indicated in 
Sec. 3280.305(c)(1)(i), increased by a factor of 1.5. The 1.5 factor of 
safety for Wind Zone I is also to be applied simultaneously to both the 
vertical building projection, as horizontal wind load, and across the 
surface of the full roof structure, as uplift loading. For Wind Zones II 
and III, the resistance shall be determined by the simultaneous 
application of the horizontal drag and uplift wind loads, in accordance 
with Sec. 3280.305(c)(1)(ii). The basic allowable stresses of materials 
required to resist overturning and lateral movement shall not be 
increased in the design and proportioning of these members. No 
additional shape or location factors need to be applied in the design of 
the tiedown system. The dead load of the structure may be used to resist 
these wind loading effects in all Wind Zones.
    (1) The provisions of this section shall be followed and the support 
and anchoring systems shall be designed by a Registered Professional 
Engineer or Architect.
    (2) The manufacturer of each manufactured home is required to make 
provision for the support and anchoring systems but is not required to 
provide the anchoring equipment or stabilizing devices. When the 
manufacturer's installation instructions provide for the main frame 
structure to be used as the points for connection of diagonal ties, no 
specific connecting devices need be provided on the main frame 
structure.
    (b) Contents of instructions. (1) The manufacturer shall provide 
printed instructions with each manufactured home specifying the location 
and required capacity of stabilizing devices on which the design is 
based. The manufacturer shall provide drawings and specifications 
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect indicating 
at least one acceptable system of anchoring, including the details of 
required straps or cables, their end connections, and all other devices 
needed to transfer the wind loads from the manufactured home to an 
anchoring or foundation system.
    (2) For anchoring systems, the instructions shall indicate:
    (i) The minimum anchor capacity required;
    (ii) That anchors should be certified by a professional engineer, 
architect, or a nationally recognized testing laboratory as to their 
resistance, based on the maximum angle of diagonal tie and/or vertical 
tie loading (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and angle of anchor 
installation, and type of soil in which the anchor is to be installed;
    (iii) That ground anchors should be embedded below the frost line 
and be at

[[Page 131]]

least 12 inches above the water table; and
    (iv) That ground anchors should be installed to their full depth, 
and stabilizer plates should be installed to provide added resistance to 
overturning or sliding forces.
    (v) That anchoring equipment should be certified by a registered 
professional engineer or architect to resist these specified forces in 
accordance with testing procedures in ASTM Standard Specification D3953-
91, Standard Specification for Strapping, Flat Steel and Seals.
    (c) Design criteria. The provisions made for anchoring systems shall 
be based on the following design criteria for manufactured homes.
    (1) The minimum number of ties provided per side of each home shall 
resist design wind loads required in Sec. 3280.305(c)(1).
    (2) Ties shall be as evenly spaced as practicable along the length 
of the manufactured home, with not more than two (2) feet open-end 
spacing on each end.
    (3) Vertical ties or straps shall be positioned at studs. Where a 
vertical tie and a diagonal tie are located at the same place, both ties 
may be connected to a single anchor, provided that the anchor used is 
capable of carrying both loadings, simultaneously.
    (4) Add-on sections of expandable manufactured homes shall have 
provisions for vertical ties at the exposed ends.
    (d) Requirements for ties. Manufactured homes in Wind Zone I require 
only diagonal ties. These ties shall be placed along the main frame and 
below the outer side walls. All manufactured homes designed to be 
located in Wind Zones II and III shall have a vertical tie installed at 
each diagonal tie location.
    (e) Protection requirements. Protection shall be provided at sharp 
corners where the anchoring system requires the use of external straps 
or cables. Protection shall also be provided to minimize damage to 
siding by the cable or strap.
    (f) Anchoring equipment--load resistance. Anchoring equipment shall 
be capable of resisting an allowable working load equal to or exceeding 
3,150 pounds and shall be capable of withstanding a 50 percent overload 
(4,725 pounds total) without failure of either the anchoring equipment 
or the attachment point on the manufactured home.
    (g) Anchoring equipment--weatherization. Anchoring equipment exposed 
to weathering shall have a resistance to weather deterioration at least 
equivalent to that provided by a coating of zinc on steel of not less 
than 0.30 ounces per square foot of surface coated, and in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) Slit or cut edges of zinc-coated steel strapping do not need to 
be zinc coated.
    (2) Type 1, Finish B, Grade 1 steel strapping, 1-1/4 inches wide and 
0.035 inches in thickness, certified by a registered professional 
engineer or architect as conforming with ASTM Standard Specification 
D3953-91, Standard Specification for Strapping, Flat Steel, and Seals.

Sec. 3280.307  Resistance to elements and use.

    (a) Exterior coverings shall be of moisture and weather resistive 
materials attached with corrosion resistant fasteners to resist wind, 
snow and rain. Metal coverings and exposed metal structural members 
shall be of corrosion resistant materials or shall be protected to 
resist corrosion. All joints between portions of the exterior covering 
shall be designed, and assembled to protect against the infiltration of 
air and water, except for any designed ventilation of wall or roof 
cavity.
    (b) Joints between dissimilar materials and joints between exterior 
coverings and frames of openings shall be protected with a compatible 
sealant suitable to resist infiltration of air or water.
    (c) Where adjoining materials or assemblies of materials are of such 
nature that separation can occur due to expansion, contraction, wind 
loads or other loads induced by erection or transportation, sealants 
shall be of a type that maintains protection against infiltration or 
penetration by air, moisture or vermin.

parts per million (ppm) as measured by the air chamber test method 
specified in Sec. 3280.406.
    (2) Particleboard materials shall not emit formaldehyde in excess of 
0.3 ppm as measured by the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406.
    (b) Product certification and continuing qualification. All plywood 
and particleboard materials to be installed in manufactured homes which 
are bonded with a resin system or coated with a surface finish 
containing formaldehyde, other than an exclusively phenol-formaldehyde 
resin system or finish, shall be certified by a nationally recognized 
testing laboratory as complying with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) Separate certification shall be done for each plant where the 
particleboard is produced or where the plywood or particleboard is 
surface-finished.
    (2) To certify plywood or particleboard, the testing laboratory 
shall witness or conduct the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406 
on randomly selected panels initially and at least quarterly thereafter.
    (3) The testing laboratory must approve a written quality control 
plan for each plant where the particleboard is produced or finished or 
where the plywood is finished. The quality control plan must be designed 
to assure that all panels comply with paragraph (a) of this section. The 
plan must establish ongoing procedures to identify increases in the 
formaldehyde emission characteristics of the finished product resulting 
from the following changes in production.
    (i) In the case of plywood:
    (A) The facility where the unfinished panels are produced is 
changed;
    (B) The thickness of the panels is changed so that the panels are 
thinner; or
    (C) The grooving pattern on the panels is changed so that the 
grooves are deeper or closer together.
    (ii) In the case of particleboard:
    (A) The resin formulation is changed so that the formaldehyde-to-
urea ratio is increased;
    (B) The amount of formaldehyde resin used is increased; or
    (C) The press time is decreased.
    (iii) In the case of plywood or particleboard:
    (A) The finishing or top coat is changed and the new finishing or 
top coat has a greater formaldehyde content; or
    (B) The amount of finishing or top coat used on the panels is 
increased, provided that such finishing or top coat contains 
formaldehyde.
    (4) The testing laboratory shall periodically visit the plant to 
monitor quality control procedures to assure that all certified panels 
meet the standard.
    (5) To maintain its certification, plywood or particleboard must be 
tested by the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406 whenever one 
of the following events occurs:
    (i) In the case of particleboard, the resin formulation is changed 
so that the formaldehyde-to-urea ratio is increased; or
    (ii) In the case of particleboard or plywood, the finishing or top 
coat is changed and the new finishing or top coat contains formaldehyde; 
or
    (iii) In the case of particleboard or plywood, the testing 
laboratory determines that an air chamber test is necessary to assure 
that panels comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6) In the event that an air chamber test measures levels of 
formaldehyde from plywood or particleboard in excess of those permitted 
under paragraph (a) of this section, then the tested product's 
certification immediately lapses as of the date of production of the 
tested panels. No panel produced on the same date as the tested panels 
or on any day thereafter may be used or

[[Page 133]]

certified for use in manufactured homes.
    (i) Provided, however, that a new product certification may be 
obtained by testing randomly selected panels which were produced on any 
day following the date of production of the tested panels. If such 
panels pass the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406, then the 
plywood or particleboard produced on that day and subsequent days may be 
used and certified for use in manufactured homes.
    (ii) Provided further, that plywood or particleboard produced on the 
same day as the tested panels, and panels produced on subsequent days, 
if not certified pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, may be 
used in manufactured homes only under the following circumstances:
    (A) Each panel is treated with a scavenger, sealant, or other means 
of reducing formaldehyde emissions which does not adversely affect the 
structural quality of the product; and
    (B) Panels randomly selected from the treated panels are tested by 
and pass the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406.
    (c) Panel identification. Each plywood and particleboard panel to be 
installed in manufactured homes which is bonded or coated with a resin 
system containing formaldehyde, other than an exclusively phenol-
formaldehyde resin system, shall be stamped or labeled so as to identify 
the product manufacturer, date of production and/or lot number, and the 
testing laboratory certifying compliance with this section.
    (d) Treatment after certification. If certified plywood or 
particleboard subsequently is treated with paint, varnish, or any other 
substance containing formaldehyde, then the certification is no longer 
valid. In such a case, each stamp or label placed on the panels pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section must be obliterated. In addition, the 
treated panels may be recertified and reidentified in accordance with 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

Sec. 3280.309  Health Notice on formaldehyde emissions.

    (a) Each manufactured home shall have a Health Notice on 
formaldehyde emissions prominently displayed in a temporary manner in 
the kitchen (i.e., countertop or exposed cabinet face). The Notice shall 
read as follows:

                         Important Health Notice

    Some of the building materials used in this home emit formaldehyde. 
Eye, nose, and throat irritation, headache, nausea, and a variety of 
asthma-like symptoms, including shortness of breath, have been reported 
as a result of formaldehyde exposure. Elderly persons and young 
children, as well as anyone with a history of asthma, allergies, or lung 
problems, may be at greater risk. Research is continuing on the possible 
long-term effects of exposure to formaldehyde.
    Reduced ventilation resulting from energy efficiency standards may 
allow formaldehyde and other contaminants to accumulate in the indoor 
air. Additional ventilation to dilute the indoor air may be obtained 
from a passive or mechanical ventilation system offered by the 
manufacturer. Consult your dealer for information about the ventilation 
options offered with this home.
    High indoor temperatures and humidity raise formaldehyde levels. 
When a home is to be located in areas subject to extreme summer 
temperatures, an air-conditioning system can be used to control indoor 
temperature levels. Check the comfort cooling certificate to determine 
if this home has been equipped or designed for the installation of an 
air-conditioning system.
    If you have any questions regarding the health effects of 
formaldehyde, consult your doctor or local health department.

    (b) The Notice shall be legible and typed using letters at least \1/
4\ inch in size. The title shall be typed using letters at least \3/4\ 
inch in size.
    (c) The Notice shall not be removed by any party until the entire 
sales transaction has been completed (refer to part 3282--Manufactured 
Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations for provisions regarding a 
sales transaction).
    (d) A copy of the Notice shall be included in the Consumer Manual 
(refer to part 3283--Manufactured Home Consumer Manual Requirements).

Sec. 3280.401  Structural load tests.

    Every structural assembly tested shall be capable of meeting the 
Proof Load Test or the Ultimate Load Test as follows:
    (a) Proof load tests. Every structural assembly tested shall be 
capable of sustaining its dead load plus superimposed live loads equal 
to 1.75 times the required live loads for a period of 12 hours without 
failure. Tests shall be conducted with loads applied and deflections 
recorded in \1/4\ design live load increments at 10-minute intervals 
until 1.25 times design live load plus dead load has been reached. 
Additional load shall then be applied continuously until 1.75 times 
design live load plus dead load has been reached. Assembly failure shall 
be considered as design live load deflection (or residual deflection 
measured 12 hours after live load removal) which is greater than the 
limits set in Sec. 3280.305(d), rupture, fracture, or excessive 
yielding. An assembly to be tested shall be of the minimum quality of 
materials and workmanship of the production. Each test assembly, 
component or subassembly shall be identified as to type and quality or 
grade of material. All assemblies, components or subassemblies 
qualifying under this section shall be subject to a continuing 
qualification testing program acceptable to the Department.
    (b) Ultimate load tests. Ultimate load tests shall be performed on a 
minimum of three assemblies or components to generally evaluate the 
structural design. Every structural assembly or component tested shall 
be capable of sustaining its total dead load plus the design live load 
increased by a factor of safety of at least 2.5. A factor of safety 
greater than 2.5 shall be used when required by an applicable reference 
standard in Sec. 3280.304(b)(1). Tests shall be conducted with loads 
applied and deflections recorded in \1/4\ design live load increments at 
10-minute intervals until 1.25 times design live load plus dead load has 
been reached. Additional loading shall then be applied continuously 
until failure occurs or the total of the factor of safety times the 
design live load plus the dead load is reached. Assembly failure shall 
be considered as design live load deflection greater than the limits set 
in Sec. 3208.305(d), rupture, fracture, or excessive yielding. 
Assemblies to be tested shall be representative of average quality or 
materials and workmanship of the production. Each test assembly, 
component, or sub-assembly shall be identified as to type and quality or 
grade of material. All assemblies, components, or sub-assemblies 
qualifying under this section shall be subject to a periodic 
qualification testing program acceptable to the Department.

Sec. 3280.402  Test procedure for roof trusses.

    (a) Roof load tests. The following is an acceptable test procedure, 
consistent with the provisions of Sec. 3280.401, for roof trusses that 
are supported at the ends and support design loads. Where roof trusses 
act as support for other members, act as cantilevers, or support 
concentrated loads, they shall be tested accordingly.
    (b) General. Trusses may be tested in pairs or singly in a suitable 
test facility. When tested singly, simulated lateral support of the test 
assembly may be provided, but in no case shall this lateral support 
exceed that which is specified for the completed manufactured home. When 
tested in pairs, the trusses shall be spaced at the design spacing and 
shall be mounted on solid support accurately positioned to give the 
required clear span distance (L) as specified in the design. The top and 
bottom chords shall be braced and covered with the material, with 
connections or method of attachment, as specified by the completed 
manufactured home.
    (1) As an alternate test procedure, the top chord may be sheathed 
with \1/4\ inch by 12 inch plywood strips. The plywood strips shall be 
at least long enough to cover the top chords of the trusses at the 
designated design truss spacing. Adjacent plywood strips must be 
separated by at least \1/8\ inch. The plywood strip shall be nailed with 
4d nails or equivalent staples not closer than 8 inches on center along 
the top

[[Page 135]]

chord. The bottom chords of the adjacent trusses may be either:
    (i) Unbraced,
    (ii) Laterally braced together (not cross braced) with 1" x 2" 
stripping not closer than 24 inches on center nailed with only one 6d 
nail at each truss, or
    (iii) Covered with the material, with connections or methods of 
attachment, as specified for the completed manufactured home.
    (2) Truss deflections will be measured relative to a taut wire 
running over the support and weighted at the end to insure constant 
tension or other approved methods. Deflections will be measured at the 
two quarter points and at midspan. Loading shall be applied to the top 
chord through a suitable hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical system, 
masonry units, or weights to simulate design loads. Load units for 
uniformly distributed loads shall be separated so that arch action does 
not occur, and shall be spaced not greater than 12 inches on center so 
as to simulate uniform loading.
    (c) Nondestructive test procedure--(1) Dead load plus live load. (i) 
Noting figure A-1, measure and record initial elevation of the truss in 
test position at no load.

[[Page 136]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC17OC91.008

    (ii) Apply load units to the top chord of the truss equal to the 
full dead load of roof and ceiling. Measure and record deflections.
    (iii) Maintaining the dead load, add live load in approximate \1/4\ 
design live load increments. Measure the deflections after each loading 
increment.

[[Page 137]]

Apply incremental loads at a uniform rate such that approximately one-
half hour is required to establish the total design load condition. 
Measure and record the deflections five minutes after loads have been 
applied. The maximum deflection due to design live load (deflection 
measured in step (iii) minus step (ii)) shall not exceed L/180, where L 
is a clear span measured in the same units.
    (iv) Continue to load truss to dead load plus 1.75 times the design 
live load. Maintain this loading for 12 hours and inspect the truss for 
failure.
    (v) Remove the total superimposed live load. Trusses not recovering 
to at least the L/180 position within 12 hours shall be considered as 
failing.
    (2) Uplift loads. This test shall only be required for truss designs 
which may be critical under uplift load conditions.
    (i) Measure and record initial elevation of the truss in an inverted 
test position at no load. Bottom chord of the truss shall be mounted in 
the horizontal position.
    (ii) Apply the uplift load as stated in Sec. 3280.305(c) to the 
bottom chord of the truss. Measure and record the deflections 5 minutes 
after the load has been applied.
    (iii) Continue to load the truss to 1.75 times the design uplift 
load. Maintain this load for 3 hours and inspect the truss for failure.

design live load increments at 10-minute intervals until 1.25 times 
design live load plus dead load has been reached.
    (3) Additional loading shall then be applied continuously until 
failure occurs or the factor of safety times the design live load plus 
the dead load is reached.
    (4) Assembly failure shall be considered as design live load 
deflection greater than the limits set in Sec. 3280.305(d), rupture, 
fracture, or excessive yielding.
    (5) The assembly shall be capable of sustaining the dead load plus 
the applicable factor of safety times the design live load (the 
applicable factor of safety for wood trusses shall be taken as 2.50).
    (e) Trusses qualifying under the nondestructive test procedure. 
Tests Sec. 3208.402(c) (1) and (2) (when required), shall be subject to 
a continuing qualification testing program acceptable to the Department. 
Trusses qualifying under the destructive test procedures, Tests 
Sec. 3280.402 (c)(2) (when required), and (d), shall be subject to 
periodic tests only.

                      Subpart F--Thermal Protection


<R05>
Sec. 3280.501  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth the requirements for condensation control, 
air infiltration, thermal insulation and certification for heating and 
comfort cooling.


<R05>
Sec. 3280.502  Definitions.

    (a) The following definitions are applicable to subpart F only:
    (1) Pressure envelope means that primary air barrier surrounding the 
living space which serves to limit air leakage. In construction using 
ventilated cavities, the pressure envelope is the interior skin.
    (2) Thermal envelope area means the sum of the surface areas of 
outside walls, ceiling and floor, including all openings. The wall area 
is measured by

[[Page 141]]

multiplying outside wall lengths by the inside wall height from floor to 
ceiling. The floor and ceiling areas are considered as horizontal 
surfaces using exterior width and length.


<R05>
Sec. 3280.503  Materials.

    Materials used for insulation shall be of proven effectiveness and 
adequate durability to assure that required design conditions concerning 
thermal transmission are attained.

    (a) Ceiling vapor retarders. (1) In Uo Value Zones 2 and 3, ceilings 
shall have a vapor retarder with a permanence of not greater than 1 perm 
(as measured by ASTM E-96-93 Standard Test Methods for Water Vapor 
Transmission of Materials) installed on the living space side of the 
roof cavity.
    (2) For manufactured homes designed for Uo Value Zone 1, the vapor 
retarder may be omitted.
    (b) Exterior walls. (1) Exterior walls shall have a vapor barrier 
not greater than 1 perm (dry cup method) installed on the living space 
side of the wall, or
    (2) Unventilated wall cavities shall have an external covering and/
or sheathing which forms the pressure envelope. The covering and/or 
sheathing shall have a combined permeance of not less than 5.0 perms. In 
the absence of test data, combined permeance may be computed using the 
formula: P<INF>Total</INF>=(1/[(1/P<INF>1</INF>)+(1/P<INF>2</INF>)])

where P<INF>1</INF> and P<INF>2</INF> are the permeance values of the 
exterior covering and sheathing in perms.


Formed exterior siding applied in sections with joints not caulked or 
sealed shall not be considered to restrict water vapor transmission, or
    (3) Wall cavities shall be constructed so that ventilation is 
provided to dissipate any condensation occurring in these cavities.
    (c) Attic or roof ventilation. (1) Attic and roof cavities shall be 
vented in accordance with one of the following:
    (i) A minimum free ventilation area of not less than 1/300 of the 
attic or roof cavity floor area. At least 50 percent of the required 
free ventilation area shall be provided by ventilators located in the 
upper portion of the space to be ventilated. At least 40 percent shall 
be provided by eave, soffit or low gable vents. The location and spacing 
of the vent openings and ventilators shall provide cross-ventilation to 
the entire attic or roof cavity space. A clear air passage space having 
a minimum height of 1 inch shall be provided between the top of the 
insulation and the roof sheathing or roof covering. Baffles or other 
means shall be provided where needed to insure the 1 inch height of the 
clear air passage space is maintained.
    (ii) A mechanical attic or roof ventilation system may be installed 
instead of providing the free ventilation area when the mechanical 
system provides a minimum air change rate of 0.02 cubic feet per minute 
(cfm) per sq. ft. of attic floor area. Intake and exhaust vents shall be 
located so as to provide air movement throughout space.
    (2) Single section manufactured homes constructed with metal roofs 
and having no sheathing or underlayment installed, are not required to 
be provided with attic or roof cavity ventilation provided that the air 
leakage paths from the living space to the roof cavity created by 
electrical outlets, electrical junctions, electrical cable penetrations, 
plumbing penetrations, flue pipe penetrations and exhaust vent 
penetrations are sealed.
    (3) Parallel membrane roof section of a closed cell type 
construction are not required to be ventilated.
    (4) The vents provided for ventilating attics and roof cavities 
shall be designed to resist entry of rain and insects.

<R05>
Sec. 3280.505  Air infiltration.

    (a) Envelope air infiltration. The opaque envelope shall be designed 
and constructed to limit air infiltration to the living area of the 
home. Any design, material, method or combination thereof which 
accomplishes this goal may be used. The goal of the infiltration control 
criteria is to reduce heat loss/heat gain due to infiltration as much as 
possible without impinging on

[[Page 142]]

health and comfort and within the limits of reasonable economics.
    (1) Envelope penetrations. Plumbing, mechanical and electrical 
penetrations of the pressure envelope not exempted by this part, and 
installations of window and door frames shall be constructed or treated 
to limit air infiltration. Penetrations of the pressure envelope made by 
electrical equipment, other than distribution panel boards and cable and 
conduit penetrations, are exempt from this requirement. Cable 
penetrations through outlet boxes are considered exempt.
    (2) Joints between major envelope elements. Joints not designed to 
limit air infiltration between wall-to-wall, wall-to-ceiling and wall-
to-floor connections shall be caulked or otherwise sealed. When walls 
are constructed to form a pressure envelope on the outside of the wall 
cavity, they are deemed to meet this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 3280.506  Heat loss/heat gain.

    The manufactured home heat loss/heat gain shall be determined by 
methods outlined in Secs. 3280.508 and 3280.509. The Uo (Coefficient of 
heat transmission) value zone for which the manufactured home is 
acceptable and the lowest outdoor temperature to which the installed 
heating equipment will maintain a temperature of 70 F shall be certified 
as specified in Sec. 3280.510 of this subpart. The Uo value zone shall 
be determined from the map in figure 506.

Sec. 3280.507  Comfort heat gain.

    Information necessary to calculate the home cooling load shall be 
provided as specified in this part.
    (a) Transmission heat gains. Homes complying with this section shall 
meet the minimum heat loss transmission coefficients specified in 
Sec. 3280.506(a).


<R05>
Sec. 3280.508  Heat loss, heat gain and cooling load calculations.

    (a) Information, values and data necessary for heat loss and heat 
gain determinations shall be taken from the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook of 
Fundamentals, chapters 20 through 27. The following portions of those 
chapters are not applicable:

21.1  Steel Frame Construction
21.2  Masonry Construction
21.3  Floor Systems
21.14  Pipes
21.16  Tanks, Vessels and Equipment
21.17  Refrigerated Rooms and Buildings
22.15  Mechanical and Industrial Systems
23.13  Commercial Building Envelope Leakage
25.4  Calculation of Heat Loss from Crawl Spaces

    (b) The calculation of the manufactured home's transmission heat 
loss coefficient (Uo) shall be in accordance with the fundamental 
principals of the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and, at a 
minimum, shall address all the heat loss or heat gain considerations in 
a manner consistent with the calculation procedures provided in the 
document Overall U-values and Heating/Cooling Loads-Manufactured Homes--
February 1992-PNL 8006, HUD User No. 0005945.
    (c) Areas where the insulation does not fully cover a surface or is 
compressed shall be accounted for in the U-calculation (see 
Sec. 3280.506). The effect of framing on the U-value must be included in 
the Uo calculation. Other low-R-value heat-flow paths (``thermal 
shorts'') shall be explicitly accounted for in the calculation of the 
transmission heat loss coefficient if in the aggregate all types of low-
R-value paths amount to more than 1% of the total exterior surface area. 
Areas are considered low-R-value heat-flow paths if:
    (1) They separate conditioned and unconditioned space; and
    (2) They are not insulated to a level that is at least one-half the 
nominal insulation level of the surrounding building component.
    (d) High efficiency heating and cooling equipment credit. The 
calculated transmission heat loss coefficient (Uo) used for meeting the 
requirement in Sec. 3280.506(a) may be adjusted for heating and cooling 
equipment above that required by the National Appliance Energy 
Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA) by applying the following formula:

Uo adjusted = Uo standard x [1+(0.6) (heating efficiency increase 
    factor)+(cooling multiplier) (cooling efficiency increase factor)]

 where:
Uo standard = Maximum Uo for Uo Zone required by Sec. 3280.506(a)
Uo adjusted = Maximum Uo standard adjusted for high efficiency HVAC 
equipment
Heating efficiency increase factor = The increase factor in heating 
equipment efficiency measured by the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency 
(AFUE), or the Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) for heat 
pumps, above that required by NAECA (indicated as ``NAECA'' in formula). 
The formula is heating efficiency increase factor = AFUE (HSPF) home - 
AFUE (or HSPF) NAECA divided by AFUE (HSPF) NAECA.
Cooling efficiency increase factor = the increase factor in the cooling 
equipment efficiency measured by the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 
(SEER) above that required by NAECA.

[[Page 145]]

The formula being cooling equipment=SEER home--SEER NAECA divided by 
SEER NAECA.

    The cooling multiplier for the Uo Zone is from the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Uo zone                      Cooling multiplier (Cm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1........................................  0.60 (Florida only).
1........................................  0.20 (All other locations).
2........................................  0.07.
3........................................  0.03.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (e) U-values for any glazing (windows, skylights, and the glazed 
portions of any door) shall be based on tests using American 
Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) 1503.1-1988, Voluntary 
Test Method for Thermal Transmittance and Condensation Resistance of 
Windows, Doors and Glazed Wall Sections. In the absence of tests, 
manufacturers shall use the residential window U values contained in 
table 13 in chapter 27, the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. In the 
event that the classification of the window type is indeterminate, the 
manufacturer shall use the classification which gives the higher U 
value. For the purpose of calculating Uo values, storm windows shall be 
treated as an additional pane.
    (f) Annual energy used based compliance. As an alternative, homes 
may demonstrate compliance with the annual energy used implicit in the 
coefficient of heat transmission (Uo) requirement. The annual energy use 
determination must be based on generally accepted engineering practices. 
The general requirement is to demonstrate that the home seeking 
compliance approval has a projected annual energy use, including both 
heating and cooling, less than or equal to a similar ``base case'' home 
that meets the standard. The energy use for both homes must be 
calculated based on the same assumptions; including assuming the same 
dimensions for all boundaries between conditioned and unconditioned

Sec. 3280.509  Criteria in absence of specific data.

    In the absence of specific data, for purposes of heat-loss/gain 
calculation, the following criteria shall be used:
    (a) Infiltration heat loss. In the absence of measured infiltration 
heat loss data, the following formula shall be used to calculate heat 
loss due to infiltration and intermittently operated fans exhausting to 
the outdoors. The perimeter calculation shall be based on the dimensions 
of the pressure envelope.

Infiltration Heat-Loss=0.7 (T) (ft. of perimeter), BTU/hr.

where: T=70 minus the heating system capacity certification temperature 
stipulated in the Heating Certificate, in F.

    (b) Framing areas.


Wall.....................................  15 percent of wall area less
                                            windows and doors.
Floor and Ceiling........................  10 percent of the area.
 

    (c) Insulation compression. Insulation compressed to less than 
nominal thickness shall have its nominal R-values reduced for that area 
which is compressed in accordance with the following graph:

[[Page 146]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC17OC91.006


When insulation is installed over the framing members the thermal 
performance of the insulation is reduced due to compression at the 
framing members. The Resistance value of the insulation between the 
framing members is reduced by 12.5 percent for framing members 16" O.C., 
8.5 percent for framing members 24" O.C., and 4 percent for framing 
members 48" O.C.
    (d) Air supply ducts within floor cavity. Air supply ducts located 
within a floor cavity shall be assumed to be heating or cooling the 
floor cavity to living space temperatures unless the duct is 
structurally isolated by the framing system or thermally insulated from 
the rest of the floor cavity with a thermal insulation at least equal to 
R-4.
    (e) Air supply ducts within ceiling cavity. Where supply ducts are 
located in ceiling cavities, the influence of the duct on cavity 
temperatures shall be considered in calculating envelope heat loss or 
heat gain.
    (f) The supply duct loss (and/or heat gain where applicable--See 
Sec. 3280.511) shall be calculated using the actual duct surface area 
and the actual thickness of insulation between the duct and outside of 
the manufactured home. If there is an air space of at least \1/2\ inch 
between the duct and the insulation, heat loss/gain need not be 
calculated if the cavity in which the duct is located is assumed to be 
at living space temperature. The average temperature inside the supply 
duct, including ducts installed outside the manufactured home, shall be 
assumed to be 130 F for purposes of calculation of heat loss and 60 F 
for heat gain.
    (g) Return air cavities. Cavities used as return air plenums shall 
be considered to be at living space temperature.


<R05>

to the top of the highest vent opening. There shall be no evidence of 
leakage.
    (2) Air test. After all fixtures have been installed, the traps 
filled with water, and the remaining openings securely plugged, the 
entire system shall be subjected to a 2-inch (manometer) water column 
air pressure test. If the system loses pressure, leaks may be located 
with smoke pumped into the system, or with soap suds spread on the 
exterior of the piping (Bubble test).
    (3) Flood level test. The manufactured home shall be in a level 
position, all fixtures shall be connected, and the entire system shall 
be filled with water to the rim of the water closet bowl. (Tub and 
shower drains shall be plugged). After all trapped air has been 
released, the test shall be sustained for not less than 15 minutes 
without evidence of leaks. Then the system shall be unplugged and 
emptied. The waste piping above the level of the water closet bowl shall 
then be tested and show no indication of leakage when the high fixtures 
are filled with water and emptied simultaneously to obtain the maximum 
possible flow in the drain piping.
    (c) Fixture test. The plumbing fixtures and connections shall be 
subjected to a flow test by filling them with water and checking for 
leaks and retarded flow while they are being emptied.
    (d) Shower compartments. Shower compartments and receptors shall be 
tested for leaks prior to being covered by finish material. Each pan 
shall be filled with water to the top of the dam for not less than 15 
minutes without evidence of leakage.

Sec. 3280.811  Calculations.

    (a) The following method shall be employed in computing the supply 
cord and distribution-panelboard load for each feeder assembly for each 
manufactured home and shall be based on a 3-wire, 120/240 volt supply 
with 120 volt loads balanced between the two legs of the 3-wire system. 
The total load for determining power supply by this method is the 
summation of:
    (1) Lighting and small appliance load as calculated below:
    (i) Lighting volt-amperes: Length time width of manufactured home 
(outside dimensions exclusive of coupler) times 3 volt-amperes per 
square foot; e.g. Length  x  width  x  3=lighting volt-amperes.
    (ii) Small appliance volt-amperes: Number of circuits time 1,500 
volt-amperes for each 20-ampere appliance receptacle circuit (see 
definition of ``Appliance Portable'' with Note): e.g. Number of circuits 
 x  1,500=small appliance volt-amperes.
    (iii) Total volts-amperes: Lighting volts-amperes plus small 
appliance=total volt-amperes.
    (iv) First 3,000 total volts-amperes at 100 percent plus remainder 
at 35 percent=watts to be divided by 240

[[Page 193]]

volts to obtain current (amperes) per leg.
    (2) Nameplate amperes for motors and heater loads (exhaust fans, air 
conditioners, electric, gas, or oil heating). Omit smaller of air 
conditioning and heating except include blower motor if used as air 
conditioner evaporator motor. When an air conditioner is not installed 
and a 40-ampere power supply cord is provided, allow 15 amperes per leg 
for air conditioning.
    (3) 25 percent of current of largest motor in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) Total of nameplate amperes for: Disposal, dishwasher, water 
heater, clothes dryer, wall-mounted oven, cooking units. Where number of 
these appliances exceeds three, use 75 percent of total.
    (5) Derive amperes for free-standing range (as distinguished from 
separate ovens and cooking units) by dividing values below by 240 volts.

as amended at 47 FR 28093, June 29, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 3280.903  General requirements for designing the structure to withstand transportation shock and vibration.

    (a) The cumulative effect of highway transportation shock and 
vibration upon a manufactured home structure may result in incremental 
degradation of its designed performance in terms of providing a safe, 
healthy and durable dwelling. Therefore, the manufactured home shall be 
designed, in terms of its structural, plumbing, mechanical and 
electrical systems, to fully withstand such transportation forces during 
its intended life. (See Secs. 3280.303(c) and 3280.305(a)).
    (b) Particular attention shall be given to maintaining watertight 
integrity and conserving energy by assuring that structural components 
in the roof and walls (and their interfaces with vents, windows, doors, 
etc.) are capable of resisting highway shock and vibration forces during 
primary and subsequent secondary transportation moves.
    (c) In place of an engineering analysis, either of the following may 
be accepted:
    (1) Documented technical data of suitable highway tests which were 
conducted to simulate transportation loads and conditions; or
    (2) Acceptable documented evidence of actual transportation 
experience which meets the intent of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 3280.904  Specific requirements for designing the transportation system.

    (a) General. The entire system (frame, drawbar and coupling 
mechanism, running gear assembly, and lights) shall be designed and 
constructed as an integrated, balanced and durable unit which is safe 
and suitable for its specified use during the intended life of the 
manufactured home. In operation, the transportation system (supporting 
the manufactured home structure and its contents) shall effectively 
respond to the control of the braking, while traveling at applicable 
towing vehicle in terms of tracking and highway speeds and in normal 
highway traffic conditions.
    Note: While the majority of manufactured homes utilize a fabricated 
steel frame assembly, upon which the manufactured home structure is 
constructed, it is not the intent

[[Page 196]]

of this standard to limit innovation. Therefore, other concepts, such as 
integrating the frame function into the manufactured home structure, are 
acceptable provided that such design meets the intent and requirements 
of this part).
    (b) Specific requirements--(1) Drawbar. The drawbar shall be 
constructed of sufficient strength, rigidity and durability to safely 
withstand those dynamic forces experienced during highway 
transportation. It shall be securely fastened to the manufactured home 
frame by either a continuous weld or by bolting.
    (2) Coupling mechanism. The coupling mechanism (which is usually of 
the socket type) shall be securely fastened to the drawbar in such a 
manner as to assure safe and effective transfer of the maximum loads, 
including dynamic loads, between the manufactured home structure and the 
hitch-assembly of the towing vehicle. The coupling shall be equipped 
with a manually operated mechanism so adapted as to prevent 
disengagement of the unit while in operation. The coupling shall be so 
designed that it can be disconnected regardless of the angle of the 
manufactured home to the towing vehicle. With the manufactured home 
parked on level ground, the center of the socket of the coupler shall 
not be less than 20 inches nor more than 26 inches from ground level.
    (3) Chassis. The chassis, in conjunction with the manufactured home 
structure, shall be designed and constructed to effectively sustain the 
designed loads consisting of the dead load plus a minimum of 3 pounds 
per square foot floor load, (example: free-standing range, refrigerator, 
and loose furniture) and the superimposed dynamic load resulting from 
highway movement but shall not be required to exceed twice the dead 
load. The integrated design shall be capable of insuring rigidity and 
structural integrity of the complete manufactured home structure and to 
insure against deformation of structural or finish members during the 
intended life of the home.
    (4) Running gear assembly. (i) The running gear assembly, as part of 
the chassis, shall be designed to perform, as a balanced system, in 
order to effectively sustain the designed loads set forth in 
Sec. 3280.904(b)(3) and to provide for durable dependable safe mobility 
of the manufactured home. It shall be designed to accept shock and 
vibration, both from the highway and the towing vehicle and effectively 
dampen these forces so as to protect the manufactured home structure 
from damage and fatigue. Its components shall be designed to facilitate 
routine maintenance, inspection and replacement.
    (ii) Location of the running gear assembly shall be determined by 
documented engineering analysis, taking into account the gross weight 
(including all contents), total length of the manufactured home, the 
necessary coupling hitch weight, span distance, and turning radius. The 
coupling weight shall be not less than 12 percent nor more than 25 
percent of the gross weight.
    (5) Spring assemblies. Spring assemblies (springs, hangers, 
shackles, bushings and mounting bolts) shall be capable of withstanding 
all the design loads as outlined in Sec. 3280.904(b)(3) without 
exceeding maximum allowable stresses for design spring assembly life as 
recommended by the spring assembly manufacturer. The capacity of the 
spring system shall assure, that under maximum operating load 
conditions, sufficient clearance shall be maintained between the tire 
and manufactured home frame or structure to permit unimpeded wheel 
movement and for changing tires.
    (6) Axles. Axles, and their connecting hardware, shall be capable of 
withstanding all of the design loads outlined in Sec. 3280.904(b)(3) 
without exceeding maximum allowable stresses for design axle life as 
recommended by the axle manufacturer. The number of axles required to 
provide a safe tow and good ride characteristics shall be determined and 
documented by engineering analysis. Those alternatives listed in 
Sec. 3280.903(c) may be accepted in place of such an analysis.
    (7) Hubs and bearings. Hubs and bearings shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 3280.904(b)(3) and good engineering practice. Both of these 
components shall be accessible for inspection, routine maintenance and 
replacement of parts.

[[Page 197]]

    (8) Tires, wheels and rims. Tires, wheels and rims shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 3280.904(b)(3). Tires shall be selected for 
anticipated usage.
    (9) Brake assemblies. (i) The number, type, size and design of brake 
assemblies required to assist the towing vehicle in providing effective 
control and stopping of the manufactured home shall be determined and 
documented by engineering analysis. Those alternatives listed in 
Sec. 3280.903(c) may be accepted in place of such an analysis.
    (ii) Brakes on the towing vehicle and the manufactured home shall be 
capable of assuring that the maximum stopping distance from an initial 
velocity of 20 miles per hour does not exceed 40 feet (U.S. Department 
of Transportation Regulations).
    (10) Lights and associated wiring. Highway safety electrical lights 
and associated wiring shall conform to applicable Federal requirements 
in terms of location and performance. The manufacturer shall have the 
option of meeting this requirement by utilizing a temporary light/wiring 
harness provided by the manufactured home transportation carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.1  Scope and purpose.

    (a) The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety 
Standards Act of 1974 (title VI of Pub. L. 93-383, 88 Stat. 700, 42 
U.S.C. 5401, et seq.) (hereinafter referred to as the Act), requires the 
Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
establish Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards 
and to issue regulations to carry out the purpose of the Act. The 
standards promulgated pursuant to the Act appear at part 3280 of chapter 
XX of this title, and apply to all manufactured homes manufactured for 
sale to purchasers in the United States on or after the effective date 
of the standards (June 15, 1976). A manufactured home is manufactured on 
or after June 15, 1976, if it enters the first stage of production on or 
after that date.
    (b) The Secretary is also authorized by the Act to conduct 
inspections and investigations necessary to enforce the standards, to 
determine that a manufactured home fails to comply with an applicable 
standard or contains a defect or an imminent safety hazard, and to 
direct the manufacturer to furnish notification thereof, and in some 
cases, to remedy the defect or imminent safety hazard. The purpose of 
this part is to prescribe procedures for the implementation of these 
responsibilities of the Secretary under the Act through the use of 
private and State inspection organizations and cooperation with State 
manufactured home agencies. It is the policy of the Department to 
involve State agencies in the enforcement of the Federal manufactured

[[Page 199]]

home standards to the maximum extent possible consistent with the 
capabilities of such agencies and the public interest. The procedures 
for investigations and investigational proceedings are set forth in 24 
CFR part 3800.

Sec. 3282.11  Preemption and reciprocity.

    (a) No State manufactured home standard regarding manufactured home 
construction and safety which covers aspects of the manufactured home 
governed by the Federal standards shall be established or continue in 
effect with respect to manufactured homes subject to the Federal 
standards and these regulations unless it is identical to the Federal 
standards.
    (b) No State may require, as a condition of entry into or sale in 
the State, a manufactured home certified (by the application of the 
label required by Sec. 3282.362(c)(2)(i)) as in conformance with the 
Federal standards to be subject to State inspection to determine 
compliance with any standard covering any aspect of the manufactured 
home covered by the Federal standards. Nor may any State require that a 
State label be placed on the manufactured home certifying conformance to 
the Federal standard or an identical standard. Certain actions that 
States are permitted to take are set out in Sec. 3282.303.
    (c) States may participate in the enforcement of the Federal 
standards enforcement program under these regulations either as SAAs or 
PIAs or both. These regulations establish the exclusive system for 
enforcement of the Federal standards. No State may establish or keep in 
effect through a building code enforcement system or otherwise, 
procedures or requirements which constitute systems for enforcement of 
the Federal standards or of identical State standards which are outside 
the system established in these regulations or which go beyond this 
system to require remedial actions which are not required by the Act and 
these regulations. A State may establish or continue in force consumer 
protections, such as warranty or warranty performance requirements, 
which respond to individual consumer complaints and so do not constitute 
systems of enforcement of the Federal standards, regardless of whether 
the State qualifies as an SAA or PIA.
    (d) No State or locality may establish or enforce any rule or 
regulation or take any action that stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of 
Congress. The test of whether a State rule or action is valid or must 
give way is whether the State rule can be enforced or the action taken 
without impairing the Federal superintendence of the manufactured home 
industry as established by the Act.

manufactured home subject to the provisions of the National Manufactured 
Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act and is--
    (1) designed only for erection or installation on a site-built 
permanent foundation,
    (2) not designed to be moved once so erected or installed,

[[Page 205]]

    (3) designed and manufactured to comply with ---------------- (Here 
state which code included in paragraph (b)(3) of this section has been 
followed), and
    (4) to the manufacturer's knowledge is not intended to be used other 
than on a site-built permanent foundation.

    (d) This certification shall be affixed in a permanent manner near 
the electrical panel, on the inside of a kitchen cabinet door, or in any 
other readily accessible and visible location.
    (e) As part of this certification, the manufacturer shall identify 
each certified structure by a permanent serial number placed on the 
structure during the first stage of production. If the manufacturer also 
manufactures manufactured homes that are certified under Secs. 3282.205 
and 3282.362(c), the series of serial numbers for structures certified 
under this section shall be distinguishable on the structures and in the 
manufacturer's records from the series of serial numbers for the 
manufactured homes that are certified under Secs. 3282.205 and 
3282.362(c).
    (1) If a manufacturer wishes to certify a structure as a 
manufactured home under Secs. 3282.205 and 3282.362(c) after having 
applied a serial number identifying it as exempted under this section, 
the manufacturer may do so only with the written consent of the 
Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agency (IPIA) after thorough 
inspection of the structure by the IPIA at at least one stage of 
production and such removal or equipment, components, or materials as 
the IPIA may require to perform inspections to assure that the structure 
conforms to the Federal manufactured home standards. The manufacturer 
shall remove the original serial number and add the serial number 
required by Sec. 3280.6.
    (2) A manufacturer may not certify a structure under this section 
after having applied the manufactured home serial number under 
Sec. 3280.6.
    (f) All certifications made under this section are subject to 
investigation by the Secretary to determine their accuracy. If a 
certification is false or inaccurate, the certification for purposes of 
this section is invalid and the structures that have been or may be the 
subject of the certification are not excluded from the coverage of the 
Act, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, or 
these Regulations.
    (1) If the Secretary has information that a certification may be 
false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice of 
the nature of this information by certified mail and the procedure of 
this subparagraph will be followed.
    (i) The manufacturer must investigate this matter and report its 
findings in writing as to the validity of this information to the 
Secretary within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice.
    (ii) If a written report is received within the time prescribed in 
paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will review this 
report before determining whether a certification is false or 
inaccurate. If a report is not received within 15 days from the receipt 
of the Secretary's notice, the Secretary will make the determination on 
the basis of the information presented.
    (iii) If the Secretary determines that a certification is false or 
inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice and the 
reasons for this determination by certified mail.
    (2) The Secretary may seek civil and criminal penalties provided for 
in section 611 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 5410, if the party in question in 
the exercise of due care has reason to know that such certification is 
false or misleading as to any material fact.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.13  Voluntary certification.

    (a) The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for 
voluntary certification of non-conforming manufactured homes as required 
by 42 U.S.C. 5402(6) as amended by section 308(d)(B) of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1980.
    (b) Structures which meet all of the requirements of a manufactured 
home as set out in Sec. 3282.7(u), except the size requirements, shall 
be manufactured homes if the manufacturer files with the Secretary a 
certification in the following form:

    [Name of manufacturer and address where structures are to be 
manufactured] certifies that it intends to manufacture structures

[[Page 206]]

that meet all of the requirements of manufactured homes set forth at 42 
U.S.C. 5402(6) except the size requirements. Such structures are to be 
treated as manufactured homes for the purposes of the National 
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and 
the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Such structures will be 
built in conformance with the Standards. [Name of manufacturer] further 
certifies that if, at any time it manufactures structures which are not 
manufactured homes, it will identify each such structure by a permanent 
serial number placed on the structure during the first stage of 
production and that the series of serial numbers for such structures 
shall be distinguishable on the structures and in its records from the 
series of serial numbers used for manufactured homes.

    (c) Whenever a manufacturer which has filed a certification pursuant 
to Sec. 3282.13(b) produces structures which are not manufactured homes, 
it must identify each such structure by placing a permanent serial 
number on the structure during the first stage of production. The series 
of serial numbers placed on these structures shall be distinguishable on 
the structure and in the manufacturer's records from the series of 
serial numbers used for manufactured homes.
    (d) A manufacturer may certify a structure as a manufactured home 
after having applied a serial number identifying it as a structure which 
is not a manufactured home. To do so, the manufacturer must secure the 
written consent of the IPIA. This consent may only be given after a 
DAPIA has approved the manufacturer's design and quality assistance 
manual in accordance with Sec. 3282.361, and after the IPIA has 
thoroughly inspected the structure in at least one stage of production 
and after such removal of equipment, components or materials as the IPIA 
may require to assure that the structure conforms to the standards. 
After certification as a manufactured home has been approved, the 
manufacturer shall remove the original serial number and add the serial 
number required by Sec. 3280.6.
    (e) Once a manufacturer has certified under Sec. 3282.13(b) that it 
intends to build structures which are manufactured homes in all respects 
except size, the manufacturer must then, with respect to those 
structures, comply with all of the requirements of the Act and its 
regulations. The structures may not thereafter be exempted under any 
other section of these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.14  Alternative construction of manufactured homes.

    (a) Policy. In order to promote the purposes of the Act, the 
Department will permit the sale or lease of one or more manufactured 
homes not in compliance with the Standards under circumstances wherein 
no affirmative action is needed to protect the public interest. The 
Department encourages innovation and the use of new technology in 
manufactured homes. Accordingly, HUD will permit manufacturers to 
utilize new designs or techniques not in compliance with the Standards 
in cases:
    (1) Where a manufacturer proposes to utilize construction that would 
be prohibited by the Standards;
    (2) Where such construction would provide performance that is 
equivalent to or superior to that required by the Standards; and
    (3) Where (i) compliance with the Standards would be unreasonable 
because of the circumstances of the particular case, or (ii) the 
alternative construction would be for purposes of research, testing or 
development of new techniques or designs. If a request for alternative 
construction is submitted and the facts are consistent with these 
principles, the Secretary may issue a letter under paragraph (c) of this 
section stating that no action will be taken under the Act based upon 
specific failures to conform to the Standards or these regulations, 
provided that certain conditions are met. The issuance of a letter under 
paragraph (c) of this section will not affect any right that any 
purchaser may have under the Act or other applicable law and will not 
preclude any further agency action that may become necessary.
    (b) Request for alternative construction. A manufacturer may submit 
a request for alternative construction of a manufactured home. The 
request should be sent to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, Manufactured

[[Page 207]]

Housing Standards Division, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20410. The request must include:
    (1) A copy of the manufactured design or plan for each nonconforming 
model which a manufacturer plans to build;
    (2) An explanation of the manner in which the design fails to 
conform with the Standards, including a list of the specific standards 
involved;
    (3) An explanation of how the design will result in homes that 
provide the same level of performance, quality, durability and safety as 
would be provided under the Standards;
    (4) A copy of data adequate to support the request, including 
applicable test data, engineering calculations or certifications from 
nationally recognized laboratories;
    (5) An estimate of the maximum number of manufactured home units 
affected and the location, if known, to which the units will be shipped;
    (6) An indication of the period of time during which the 
manufacturer proposes to engage in the manufacture, sale or lease of the 
nonconforming homes;
    (7) A copy of the proposed notice to be provided to home purchasers;
    (8) A list of the names and addresses of any dealers that would be 
selling the nonconforming homes; and
    (9) A letter from the manufacturer's DAPIA indicating that the 
design(s) to which any nonconforming homes would be built meet the 
Standards in all other respects.
    (c) Issuance of the letter by the Secretary--(1) Contents of the 
letter. If the Secretary issues a letter in response to a request for 
alternative construction, the letter shall include the specific 
standards affected, an explanation of the proposed activity or design, 
an explanation of how the request is consistent with the objectives of 
the Act, and any conditions that the manufacturer must meet.
    (2) Letter sent to IPIA, DAPIA and SAA. The Secretary shall forward 
a copy of the letter to the manufacturer's IPIA and DAPIA along with a 
letter authorizing the DAPIA to approve plans containing the alternative 
construction, and authorizing the IPIA to permit use of the alternative 
construction, provided that the conditions set forth in the letter are 
met. The Secretary shall also forward a copy of the letter to the SAAs 
in the State of manufacture and the State(s) in which the homes are to 
be located, if known.
    (3) Alternative construction in additional models. In cases where 
the Secretary grants a letter under this paragraph that is not model-
specific, the Secretary may permit the manufacturer to include the 
alternative construction in additional models. In such cases, the DAPIA 
shall notify the Department of additional models that incorporate the 
alternative construction.
    (d) Revocation. The Secretary may revoke or amend a letter issued 
under paragraph (c) of this section at any time. Such revocation or 
amendment will be prospective only. Where manufacturers have requested 
alternative construction for research, testing or development such 
alternative construction may not achieve the anticipated results. 
Therefore, the Secretary may require a manufacturer to bring those homes 
into compliance with the standards if, after the alternative 
construction has been in use for a period of time specified by the 
Secretary, these homes are not, in the Secretary's judgment, providing 
the levels of safety, quality and durability which would have been 
provided had the homes been built in compliance with the Standards.
    (e) Notice to prospective purchasers. Manufacturers receiving 
letters under paragraph (c) of this section shall provide notice to 
prospective purchasers that the home does not conform to the Standards. 
Such notice shall be delivered to each prospective purchase before he or 
she enters into an agreement to purchase the home. The notice shall be 
in the following form or in such other form as may be approved by the 
Secretary:

                          Notice to Purchasers

    The Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued a letter 
to (Name of Manufacturer) concerning the homes in (location if known). 
As designed, the homes do not meet Federal Manufactured Home 
Construction and Safety Standards regarding (brief statement of 
manufacturer's nonconformance).

[[Page 208]]

    HUD has evaluated the alternative construction and believes that it 
provides an equivalent level of quality, durability and safety to that 
provided by the Standards.
    For further information about the specific Federal Standards 
involved, a copy of the letter issued pursuant to 24 CFR 3282.14(c) is 
available from this dealer or manufacturer upon request.

    (f) Serial numbers of homes constructed using alternative 
construction. Manufacturers shall provide the Department with the serial 
numbers assigned to each home produced in conformance with the letter 
issued under paragraph (c) of this section within 90 days of their date 
of manufacture. Each serial number shall include the letters ``AC'' to 
indicate that the homes was produced under alternative construction 
procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.54  Public information.

    (a) General. Subject to the provisions of 24 CFR part 15 covering 
the production or disclosure of material or information and the 
provisions of 24 CFR part 16 at 40 FR 39729 relating to the Privacy Act, 
and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section, the Secretary may make available to the public:
    (1) Any information which may indicate the existence of an imminent 
safety hazard, and
    (2) Any information which may indicate the failure of a manufactured 
home to comply with applicable manufactured home construction and safety 
standards, and
    (3) Such other information as the Secretary determines is necessary 
to carry out the Secretary's functions under the Act.
    (b) Protected information. Data and information submitted or 
otherwise provided to the Secretary or an agent of the Secretary or a 
PIA or SAA which fall within the definitions of a trade secret or 
confidential commercial or financial information are exempt from 
disclosure under this section, only if the party submitting or providing 
the information so requests under paragraph (c) of this section. 
However, the Secretary may disclose such information to any person 
requesting it after deletion of the portions which are exempt, or in 
such combined or summary form as does not disclose the portions which 
are exempt from disclosure or in its entirety in accordance with section 
614 of the Act, U.S.C. 5413.
    (c) Obtaining exemption. Any party submitting any information to the 
Secretary in any form under this part, or otherwise in relation to the 
program established by the Act shall, if the party desires the 
information to be exempt from disclosure, at the time of submittal of 
the information or at any time thereafter, request that the information 
or any part thereof be protected from disclosure. The request for 
nondisclosure shall include the basis for the request under the Act or 
other authority and complete justification supporting the claim that the 
material should be exempt from disclosure. The request should also 
include a statement of the information in such combined or summary form 
that alleged trade secrets or other protected information and the 
identity of the submitting party would not be disclosed. This request 
need not be made with respect to information which was submitted to the 
Secretary, an SAA or a PIA prior

[[Page 209]]

to the effective date of these regulations.
    (d) Request for information from PIAs or SAAs. Whenever a PIA or SAA 
receives requests for disclosure of information, it shall disclose the 
information unless the party from which the information was originally 
obtained has submitted to the PIA or SAA a request that the information 
not be disclosed under paragraph (c) of this section, except that the 
PIA or SAA shall be governed by the provisions of 24 CFR part 16 (40 FR 
39729) relating to the Privacy Act which may limit the disclosure of 
information. If a request for nondisclosure under paragraph (c) of this 
section has been received with respect to information whose disclosure 
is requested, the PIA or SAA shall refer the matter to the Secretary 
within 5 days of the request for disclosure. If a PIA or SAA receives a 
request for disclosure of information related to this program, which 
information was submitted to the PIA or SAA prior to the effective date 
of these regulations, the PIA or SAA shall refer the request for 
nondisclosure and required information to the Secretary.

               Subpart C--Rules and Rulemaking Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 3282.101  Generally.

    Procedures that apply to the formulation, issuance, amendment, and 
revocation of rules pursuant to the Act are governed by the Act, the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., and part 10 of this 
title, except that the Secretary shall respond to a petition for

petition.

[61 FR 10860, Mar. 15, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.111  Petitions for reconsideration of final rules.

    (a) Definition. A petition for reconsideration of a final rule 
issued by the Secretary is a request in writing from any interested 
person which must be received not later than 60 days after publication 
of the rule in the Federal Register. The petition shall state that it is 
a petition for reconsideration of a final rule, and shall contain an 
explanation as to why compliance with the rule is not practicable, is 
unreasonable, or is not in the public interest. If the petitioner 
requests the consideration of additional facts, the petitioner shall 
state the reason they were not presented to be treated as petitions for 
rulemaking.
    (b) Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration. The Secretary may 
grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration 
without further proceedings. The Secretary may issue a final decision on 
reconsideration without further proceeding, or may provide such 
opportunity to submit comments or information and data as the Secretary 
deems appropriate.
    (c) Unless the Secretary determines otherwise, the filing of a 
petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of the rule 
in question.
    (d) Any party seeking to challenge any rule or regulation issued 
under the Act, except orders issued under section 604 42 U.S.C. 5403, if 
the challenge is brought before the expiration of the 60 day period set 
out in paragraph (a) of this section, shall file a timely petition for 
reconsideration under this section prior to seeking any other remedy.

<R04>
  Subpart D--Informal and Formal Presentations of Views, Hearings and 
                             Investigations


<R05>
Sec. 3282.151  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets out procedures to be followed when an 
opportunity to present views provided for in the Act is requested by an 
appropriate party. Section 3282.152 provides for two types of procedures 
that may be followed, one informal and nonadversary, and one more formal 
and adversary. Section 3282.152 also sets out criteria to govern which 
type of procedure will be followed in particular cases.
    (b) The procedures of Sec. 3282.152 also apply to:
    (1) Proceedings held by the Secretary whenever the suspension or 
disqualification of a primary inspection agency, which has been granted 
final approval, is recommended under Sec. 3282.356 of these regulations, 
and
    (2) Resolution of disputes where an SAA or manufacturer disagrees 
with a determination of a DAPIA under Sec. 3282.361 that a manufactured 
home design does or does not conform to the standards or that a quality 
assurance manual is or is not adequate with a decision by an IPIA to red 
tag or not to red tag or to provide or not to provide a certification 
label for a manufactured home under Sec. 3282.362 when the IPIA believes 
that the manufactured home does or does not conform to the standards.
    (c) The procedures set out in Sec. 3282.152 shall also be followed 
whenever State Administrative Agencies hold Formal or Informal 
Presentations of Views under Sec. 3282.309.
    (d) To the extent that these regulations provide for Formal or 
Informal Presentations of Views for parties that would otherwise qualify 
for hearings under 24 CFR part 24, the procedures of 24 CFR part 24 
shall not be available and shall not apply.

[41 FR 19852, May 13, 1976, as amended at 51 FR 34467, Sept. 29, 1986; 
61 FR 10442, Mar. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.152  Procedures to present views and evidence.

    (a) Policy. All Formal and Informal Presentations of Views under 
this subpart shall be public, unless, for good cause, the Secretary 
determines it is in the public interest that a particular proceeding 
should be closed. If the Secretary determines that a proceeding should 
be closed, the Secretary shall state and make publicly available the 
basis for that determination.
    (b) Request. Upon receipt of a request to present views and evidence 
under the Act, the Secretary shall determine whether the proceeding will 
be a Formal or an Informal Presentation of Views, and shall issue a 
notice under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Notice. When the Secretary decides to conduct a Formal or an 
Informal Presentation of Views under this section, the Secretary shall 
provide notice as follows:
    (1) Except where the need for swift resolution of the question 
involved prohibits it, notice of a proceeding hereunder shall be 
published in the Federal Register at least 10 days prior to the date of 
the proceeding. In any case, notice shall be provided to interested 
persons to the maximum extent practicable. Direct notice shall be sent 
by certified mail to the parties involved in the hearing.
    (2) The notice, whether published or mailed, shall include a 
statement of the time, place and nature of the proceeding; reference to 
the authority under which the proceeding will be held; a statement of 
the subject matter of the proceeding, the parties and issues involved; 
and a statement of the manner in which interested persons shall be 
afforded the opportunity to participate in the hearing.
    (3) The notice shall designate the official who shall be the 
presiding officer for the proceedings and to whom all inquiries should 
be directed concerning such proceedings.
    (4) The notice shall state whether the proceeding shall be held in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f)--(Informal Presentation 
of Views) or paragraph (g)--(Formal Presentation of Views) of this 
section, except that when the Secretary makes the determinations 
provided for in sections 623 (d) and (f) of the Act, the requirements of 
paragraph (g) of this section shall apply. In determining whether the 
requirements of paragraph (f) or those of

[[Page 211]]

paragraph (g) of this section shall apply the Secretary shall consider 
the following:
    (i) The necessity for expeditious action;
    (ii) The risk of injury to affected members of the public;
    (iii) The economic consequences of the decisions to be rendered; and
    (iv) Such other factors as the Secretary determines are appropriate.
    (d) Department representative. If the Department is to be 
represented by Counsel, such representation shall be by a Department 
hearing attorney designated by the General Counsel.
    (e) Reporting and transcription. Oral proceedings shall be 
stenographically or mechanically reported and transcribed under the 
supervision of the presiding officer, unless the presiding officer and 
the parties otherwise agree, in which case a summary approved by the 
presiding officer shall be kept. The original transcript or summary 
shall be a part of the record and the sole official transcript, or 
summary. A copy of the transcript or summary shall be available to any 
person at a fee established by the Secretary, which fee the Secretary 
may waive in the public interest. Any information contained in the 
transcript or summary which would be exempt from required disclosure 
under Sec. 3282.54 of these regulations may be protected from disclosure 
if appropriate under that section upon a request for such protection 
under Sec. 3282.54(c).
    (f) Informal presentation of views. (1) An Informal Presentation of 
Views may be written or oral, and may include an opportunity for an oral 
presentation, whether requested or not, whenever the Secretary concludes 
that an oral presentation would be in the public interest, and so states 
in the notice. A presiding officer shall preside over all oral 
presentations held under this subsection. The purpose of any such 
presentation shall be to gather information to allow fully informed 
decision making. Informal Presentations of Views shall not be adversary 
proceedings. Oral presentations shall be conducted in an informal but 
orderly manner. The presiding officer shall have the duty and authority 
to conduct a fair proceeding, to take all necessary action to avoid 
delay, and to maintain order. In the absence of extraordinary 
circumstances, the presiding officer at an oral Informal Presentation of 
Views shall not require that testimony be given under an oath or 
affirmation, and shall not permit either cross-examination of witnesses 
by other witnesses or their representatives, or the presentation of 
rebuttal testimony by persons who have already testified. The rules of 
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not control the 
conduct of oral Informal Presentations of Views.
    (2) Within 10 days after an Informal Presentation of Views, the 
presiding officer shall refer to the Secretary all documentary evidence 
submitted, the transcript, if any, a summary of the issues involved and 
information presented in the Informal Presentation of Views and the 
presiding official's recommendations, with the rationale therefor. The 
presiding officer shall make any appropriate statements concerning the 
apparent veracity of witnesses or the validity of factual assertions 
which may be within the competence of the presiding officer. The 
Secretary shall issue a Final Determination concerning the matters at 
issue within 30 days of receipt of the presiding officer's summary. The 
Final Determination shall include:
    (i) A statement of findings, with specific references to principal 
supporting items of evidence in the record and conclusions, as well as 
the reasons or bases therefor, upon all of the material issues of fact, 
law, or discretion as presented on the record, and
    (ii) An appropriate order. Notice of the Final Determination shall 
be given in writing and transmitted by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, to all participants in the presentation of views. The Final 
Determination shall be conclusive, with respect to persons whose 
interests were represented.
    (g) Formal presentation of views. (1) A Formal Presentation of Views 
is an adversary proceeding and includes an opportunity for the oral 
presentation of evidence. All witnesses shall testify under oath or 
affirmation, which shall be administered by the presiding officer. 
Participants shall have the right to present such oral or documentary

[[Page 212]]

evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as the presiding officer 
determines is required for a full and true disclosure of facts. The 
presiding officer shall receive relevant and material evidence, rule 
upon offers of proof and exclude all irrelevant, immaterial or unduly 
repetitious evidence. However, the technicalities of the rules of 
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not control the 
conduct of a Formal Presentation of Views. The presiding officer shall 
take all necessary action to regulate the course of the Formal 
Presentation of Views to avoid delay and to maintain order. The 
presiding officer may exclude the attorney or witness from further 
participation in the particular Formal Presentation of Views and may 
render a decision adverse to the interests of the excluded party in his 
absence.
    (2) Decision. The presiding officer shall make and file an initial 
written decision on the matter in question. The decision shall be filed 
within 10 days after completion of the oral presentation. The decision 
shall include:
    (i) A statement of findings of fact, with specific references to 
principal supporting items of evidence in the record and conclusions, as 
well as the reasons or bases therefor, upon all of the material issues 
of law or discretion presented on the record, and
    (ii) An appropriate order.

The presiding officer's decision shall be final and shall constitute the 
Final Determination of the Secretary unless reversed or modified within 
30 days by the Secretary. Notice of the Final Determination shall be 
given in writing, and transmitted by registered or certified mail, 
return receipt requested, to all participants in the proceeding. The 
Final Determination shall be conclusive with respect to persons whose 
interests were represented.

    Subpart E--Manufacturer Inspection and Certification Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 3282.201  Scope and purpose.

    (a) This subpart sets out requirements which must be met by 
manufacturers of manufactured homes for sale to purchasers in the United 
States with respect to certification of manufactured home designs, 
inspection of designs, quality assurance programs, and manufactured home 
production, and certification of manufactured homes. Other than 
references and a general description of responsibilities, this subpart 
does not set out requirements with respect to remedial actions or 
reports which must be taken or filed under the Act and these 
regulations.
    (b) The purpose of this subpart is to require manufaacturers to 
participate in a system of design approvals and inspections which serve 
to assist them in assuring that manufactured homes which they 
manufacture will conform to Federal standards. Such approvals and 
inspections provide significant protection to the public by decreasing 
the number of manufactured homes with possible defects in them, and 
provide protection to manufacturers by reducing the number of instances 
in which costly remedial actions must be undertaken after manufactured 
homes are sold.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.202  Primary inspection agency contracts.

    Each manufacturer shall enter into a contract or other agreement 
with as many Design Inspection Primary Inspection Agencies (DAPIAs) as 
it wishes and with enough Production Inspection Primary Inspection 
Agencies (IPIAs) to provide IPIA services for each manufacturing plant 
as set out in this subpart and in subpart H of this part. In return for 
the services provided by the DAPIAs and IPIAs, each manufacturer shall 
pay such reasonable fees as are agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
the primary inspection agency or, in the case of a State acting as an 
exclusive IPIA under Sec. 3282.3 such fees as may be established by the 
State.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.203  DAPIA services.

    (a) Each manufacturer shall have each manufactured home design and 
each quality assurance manual which it intends to follow approved by a 
DAPIA under Sec. 3282.361. The manufacturer is free to choose which 
DAPIA will evaluate and approve its designs and quality assurance 
materials manufacturer may obtain design and quality assurance manual 
approval from a single DAPIA regardless of the number of plants in which 
the design and quality assurance manual will be followed. A manufacturer 
may also obtain approval for the same design and quality assurance 
manual from more than one DAPIA. The choice of which DAPIA or DAPIAs to 
employ is left to the manufacturer.
    (b) The manufacturer shall submit to the DAPIA such information as 
the DAPIA may require in order to carry out design approvals. This 
information shall, except where the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
DAPIA that it is not necessary, include the following:
    (1) Construction drawings and/or specifications showing structural 
details and layouts of frames, floors, walls and roofs, and chassis; 
material specifications, framing details, door locations, etc., for each 
floor plan proposed to be manufactured,

[[Page 214]]

    (2) Structural analysis and calculations, test data and/or other 
accepted engineering practices used by the manufacturer to validate the 
design,
    (3) Complete heat loss calculations for each significant variation 
of home design,
    (4) Floor plans showing room arrangement and sizes, window sizes, 
emergency exists and locations, locations of smoke detectors, fixed 
appliance range hoods, and other standards related aspects of the 
manufactured home that can be shown on the floor plans,
    (5) Diagrams of the fuel supply system, potable water system and 
drain, waste and vent systems. The diagrams shall specify the types of 
materials used, types of fittings and methods of installing required 
safety equipment,
    (6) Wiring diagrams, including circuit allocation of electrical load 
and branch circuit calculations, a table of the branch circuit 
protection provided, the type of wiring used, and wiring methods,
    (7) Details showing the design of air supply and return systems,
    (8) Details of chassis construction, components, connections and 
running gear including rating capacities of tires,
    (9) A list of fixed and portable appliances furnished with the 
manufactured home, including type of appliance, rating of appliance, and 
applicable minimum and maximum performance ratings and/or energy 
requirements,
    (10) Detailed manufacturer installation instructions including 
specifications and procedures for the erection and hook-up of the home 
at its permanent location, and
    (11) Reports of all tests that were run to validate the conformance 
of the design to the standards.
    (c) The manufacturer shall submit to the DAPIA such information as 
the DAPIA may require in order to carry out quality assurance manual 
approvals. At a minimum, this information shall include the quality 
assurance manual for which approval is sought. That manual shall include 
the manufacturer's quality assurance program, an organizational chart 
showing the accountability, by position, of the manufacturer's quality 
control personnel, a description of production tests and test equipment 
required for compliance with the standards, a station-by-station 
description of the manufacturing process, a list of quality control 
inspections required by the manufacturer at each station, and 
identification by title of each person who will be held accountable for 
each quality control inspection.
    (d) Manufacturers may be required to furnish supplementary 
information to the DAPIA if the design information or the quality 
assurance manual is not complete or if any information is not in 
accordance with accepted engineering practice.
    (e) When a manufacturer wishes to make a change in an approved 
design or quality assurance manual, the manufacturer shall obtain the 
approval of the DAPIA which approved the design or manual prior to 
production for sale. The procedures for obtaining such approval are set 
out in Sec. 3282.361.
    (f) The information to be submitted to a DAPIA under Sec. 3282.203 
(b) and (c) may be prepared by the manufacturer's staff or outside 
consultants, including other DAPIAs. However, a DAPIA may not perform 
design or quality assurance manual approvals for any manufacturer whose 
design or manual has been created or prepared in whole or in part by 
members of the DAPIA's organization or of any affiliated organization.
    (g) Each manufacturer shall maintain a copy of the drawings, 
specifications, and sketches from each approved design received from a 
DAPIA under Sec. 3282.361(b)(4) in each plant in which manufactured 
homes are being produced to the design. Each manufacturer shall also 
maintain in each manufacturing plant a copy of the approved quality 
assurance manual received from a DAPIA under Sec. 3282.361(c)(3) that is 
being followed in the plant. These materials shall be kept current and 
shall be readily accessible for use by the Secretary or other parties 
acting under these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.204  IPIA services.

    (a) Each manufacturer shall obtain the services of an IPIA as set 
out in Sec. 3282.362 for each manufacturing plant operated by the 
manufacturer.

[[Page 215]]

    (b) The manufacturer shall make available to the IPIA operating in 
each of its plants a copy of the drawings and specifications from the 
DAPIA approved design and the quality assurance manual for that plant, 
and the IPIA shall perform an initial factory inspection as set out in 
Sec. 3282.362(b). If the IPIA issues a deviation report after the 
initial factory inspection, the manufacturer shall make any corrections 
or adjustments which are necessary to conform with the DAPIA approved 
designs and manuals. After the corrections required by the deviation 
report are completed to the satisfaction of the IPIA, the IPIA shall 
issue the certification report as described in Sec. 3282.362(b)(2). In 
certain instances a DAPIA may provide the certification report. (See 
Sec. 3282.362) The manufacturer shall maintain a current copy of each 
certification report in the plant to which the certification report 
relates.
    (c) After the certification report has been signed by the IPIA, the 
manufacturer shall obtain labels from the IPIA and shall affix them to 
completed manufactured homes as set out in Sec. 3282.362(c)(2). During 
the initial factory certification, the IPIA may apply labels to 
manufactured homes which it knows to be in compliance with the standards 
if it is performing complete inspections of all phases of production of 
each manufactured home and the manufacturer authorizes it to apply 
labels.
    (d) During the course of production the manufacturer shall maintain 
a complete set of approved drawings, specifications, and approved design 
changes for the use of the IPIA's inspector and always available to that 
inspector when in the manufacturing plant.
    (e) If, during the course of production, an IPIA finds that a 
failure to conform to a standard exists in a manufactured home in 
production, the manufacturer shall correct the failure to confirm in any 
manufactured homes still in the factory and held by distributors or 
dealers and shall carry out remedial actions under Secs. 3282.404 and 
3282.405 with respect to any other manufactured homes which may contain 
the same failure to conform.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.205  Certification requirements.

    (a) Every manufacturer shall make a record of the serial number of 
each manufactured home produced, and a duly authorized representative of 
the manufacturer shall certify that each manufactured home has been 
constructed in accordance with the Federal standards. The manufacturer 
shall furnish a copy of that certification to the IPIA for the purpose 
of determining which manufactured homes are subject to the notification 
and correction requirements of subpart I of this part.
    (b) Every manufacturer of manufactured homes shall certify on the 
data plate as set out in Sec. 3280.5 of chapter XX of 24 CFR and 
Sec. 3282.362(c)(3) that the manufactured home is designed to comply 
with the Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards in 
force at the time of manufacture in addition to providing other 
information required to be completed on the data plate.
    (c) Every manufacturer of manufactured homes shall furnish to the 
dealer or distributor of each of its manufactured homes a certification 
that such manufactured home, to the best of the manufacturer's knowledge 
and belief, conforms to all applicable Federal construction and safety 
standards. This certification shall be in the form of the label provided 
by the IPIA under Sec. 3282.362(c)(2). The label shall be affixed only 
at the end of the last stage of production of the manufactured home.
    (d) The manufacturer shall apply a label required or allowed by the 
regulations in this part only to a manufactured home that the 
manufacturer knows by its inspections to be in compliance with the 
standards.

FR 10860, Mar. 15, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.206  Disagreement with IPIA or DAPIA.

    Whenever a manufacturer disagrees with a finding by a DAPIA or an 
IPIA acting in accordance with subpart H of this part, the manufacturer 
may request a Formal or Informal Presentation of Views as provided in 
Sec. 3282.152. The manufacturer shall not, however,

[[Page 216]]

produce manufactured homes pursuant to designs which have not been 
approved by a DAPIA or produce manufactured homes which the relevant 
IPIA believes not to conform to the standards unless and until:
    (a) The Secretary determines that the manufacturer is correct in 
believing the design of the manufactured home conforms to the standards; 
or
    (b) Extraordinary interim relief is granted under Sec. 3282.154; or
    (c) The DAPIA or IPIA otherwise resolves the disagreement.

[41 FR 19852, May 13, 1976, as amended at 51 FR 34468, Sept. 29, 1986; 
61 FR 10860, Mar. 15, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.207  Manufactured home consumer manual requirements.

    (a) The manufacturer shall provide a consumer manual with each 
manufactured home that enters the first stage of production on or after 
July 31, 1977, pursuant to section 617 of the National Manufactured 
Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, 42 U.S.C. 5416.
    (b) The manufacturer shall provide the consumer manual by placing a 
manual in each such manufactured home before the manufactured home 
leaves the manufacturing plant. The manual shall be placed in a 
conspicuous location in a manner likely to assure that it is not removed 
until the purchaser removes it.
    (c) If a manufacturer is informed that a purchaser did not receive a 
consumer manual, the manufacturer shall provide the appropriate manual 
to the purchaser within 30 days of being so informed.
    (d) No dealer or distributor may interfere with the distribution of 
the consumer manual. When necessary, the dealer or distributor shall 
take any appropriate steps to assure that the purchaser receives a 
consumer manual from the manufacturer.
    (e) If a consumer manual or a change or revision to a manual does 
not substantially comply with the guidelines issued by HUD, the 
manufacturer shall cease distribution of the consumer manual and shall 
provide a corrected manual for each manufactured home for which the 
inadequate or incorrect manual or revision was provided. A manual 
substantially complies with the guidelines if it presents current 
material on each of the subjects covered in the guidelines in sufficient 
detail to inform consumers about the operation, maintenance, and repair 
of the manufactured home. An updated copy of guidelines published in the 
Federal Register on March 15, 1996, can be obtained by contacting the 
Office of Manufactured Housing and Regulatory Functions, Department of

[50 FR 28398, July 12, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.211  Record of purchasers.

    (a) Information requirements for purchasers. (1) Every manufacturer 
of manufactured homes shall, for each manufactured home manufactured 
under the Federal standards, provide with the manufactured home a 
booklet containing at least 3 detachable cards as described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. On the front of the booklet, in bold faced type, 
shall be printed the following language:

    ``Keep this booklet with your manufactured home. Title VI of the 
Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 provides you with 
protection against certain construction and safety hazards in your 
manufactured home. To help assure your protection, the manufacturer of 
your manufactured home needs the information which these cards, when 
completed and mailed, will supply. If you bought your home from a 
dealer, please be sure that your dealer has completed and mailed a card 
for you. If you acquired your home from someone who is not a dealer, you 
should promptly fill out and send a card to the manufacturer. It is 
important that you keep this booklet and give it to any person who buys 
the manufactured home from you.''

    (2) The detachable cards shall contain blanks for the following 
information:
    (i) Name and address of the dealer or other person selling the 
manufactured home to the purchaser;
    (ii) Name and complete mailing address of the manufactured home 
purchaser;
    (iii) Address where the manufactured home will be located, if not 
the same as item (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Date of sale to the purchaser;

    (vii) Model and/or type designation of the manufactured home as 
provided by the manufacturer; and
    (viii) A designation of the zones for which the manufactured home is 
equipped, as set forth in Sec. 3280.305 in this title.

Additionally, the cards shall have the name and address of the 
manufacturer printed clearly on the reverse side and shall contain 
adequate postage or business reply privileges to ensure return to the 
manufacturer. The manufacturer shall have the responsibility for filing 
in the blanks on the cards for paragraphs (a)(2) (v), (vi), (vii), and 
(viii) of this section.
    (3) The manufacturer shall maintain all cards received so that the 
manufacturer has a readily accessible record of the current purchaser or 
owner and the current address of all manufactured homes manufactured by 
it for which a card has been received.


<R04>
           Subpart F--Dealer and Distributor Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 3282.251  Scope and purpose.

    (a) This subpart sets out the responsibilities which shall be met by 
distributors and dealers with respect to manufactured homes manufactured 
after the effective date of the standards for sale to purchasers in the 
United States. It prohibits the sale, lease, or offer for sale or lease 
of manufactured homes known by the distributor or dealer not to be in 
conformance with the standards, and it includes responsibilities for 
maintaining certain records and assisting in the gathering of certain 
information.
    (b) The purpose of this subpart is to inform distributors and 
dealers when

[[Page 218]]

they may sell manufactured homes, when they are prohibited from selling 
manufactured homes, and what they may do in order to prepare a 
manufactured home for sale if it is not in conformance with the 
standards.
    (c) For purposes of this part, any manufacturer or distributor who 
sells, leases, or offers for sale or lease a manufactured home to a 
purchaser shall be a dealer for purposes of that transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.252  Prohibition of sale.

    (a) No distributor or dealer shall make use of any means of 
transportation affecting interstate or foreign commerce or the mails to 
sell, lease, or offer for sale or lease in the United States any 
manufactured home manufactured on or after the effective date of an 
applicable standard unless:
    (1) There is affixed to the manufactured home a label certifying 
that the manufactured home conforms to applicable standards as required 
by Sec. 3282.205(c), and
    (2) The distributor or dealer, acting as a reasonable distributor or 
dealer, does not know that the manufactured home does not conform to any 
applicable standards.
    (b) This prohibition applies to any affected manufactured homes 
until the completion of the entire sales transaction. A sales 
transaction with a purchaser is considered completed when all the goods 
and services that the dealer agreed to provide at the time the contract 
was entered into have been provided. Completion of a retail sale will be 
at the time the dealer completes set-up of the manufactured home if the 
dealer has agreed to provide the set-up, or at the time the dealer 
delivers the home to a transporter, if the dealer has not agreed to 
transport or set up the manufactured home, or to the site if the dealer 
has not agreed to provide set-up.
    (c) This prohibition of sale does not apply to manufactured homes 
which are placed in production prior to the effective date of the 
standards, and it does not apply to ``used'' manufactured homes which 
are being sold or offered for sale after the first purchase in good 
faith for purposes other than the resale.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.253  Removal of prohibition of sale.

    (a) If a distributor or dealer has a manufactured home in its 
possession or a manufactured home with respect to which the sales 
transaction has not been completed, and the distributor or dealer, 
acting as a reasonable distributor or dealer, knows as a result of 
notification by the manufacturer or otherwise that the manufactured home 
contains a failure to conform or imminent safety hazard, the distributor 
or dealer may seek the remedies available to him under Sec. 3282.415.
    (b) When, in accordance with Sec. 3282.415, a manufacturer corrects 
a failure to conform to the applicable standard or an imminent safety 
hazard, the distributor or dealer, acting as a reasonable distributor or 
dealer, may accept the remedies provided by the manufacturer as having 
corrected the failure to conform or imminent safety hazard. The 
distributor or dealer, therefore, may sell, lease, or offer for sale or 
lease any manufactured home so corrected by the manufacturer.
    (c) When a distributor or dealer is authorized by a manufacturer to 
correct a failure to conform to the applicable standard or an imminent 
safety hazard and completes the correction in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions, the distributor or dealer may sell, or 
lease or offer for sale or lease the manufactured home in question, 
provided that the distributor or dealer, acting as a reasonable 
distributor or dealer knows that the manufactured home conforms to the 
standards. A distributor or dealer and a manufacturer, at the 
manufacturer's option, may agree in advance that the distributor or 
dealer is authorized to make such corrections as the manufacturer 
believes are within the expertise of the dealer.
    (d) If the corrections made under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section do not bring the manufactured home into conformance or correct 
the imminent safety hazard, the provisions of Sec. 3282.415 will 
continue in effect prior to completion of the sales transaction.

[[Page 219]]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.254  Distributor and dealer alterations.

    (a) If a distributor or dealer alters a manufactured home in such a 
way as to create an imminent safety hazard or to create a condition 
which causes a failure to conform with applicable Federal standards, the 
manufactured home affected may not be sold, leased, or offered for sale 
or lease.
    (b) After correction by the distributor or dealer of the failure to 
conform or imminent safety hazard, the corrected manufactured home may 
be sold, leased, or offered for sale or lease.
    (c) Distributors and dealers shall maintain complete records of all 
alterations made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.255  Completion of information card.

    (a) Whenever a distributor or dealer sells a manufactured home 
subject to the standards to a purchaser, the distributor or dealer shall 
fill out the card with information provided by the purchaser and shall 
send the card to the manufacturer. (See Sec. 3282.211.)
    (b) Whenever a distributor or dealer sells a manufactured home to an 
owner which was originally manufactured under the standards, the 
distributor or dealer shall similarly use one of the detachable cards 
which was originally provided with the manufactured home. If such a card 
is no longer available, the distributor or dealer shall obtain the 
information which the card would require and send it to the manufacturer 
of the manufactured home in an appropriate format.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.256  Distributor or dealer complaint handling.

    (a) When a distributor or dealer believes that a manufactured home 
in its possession which it has not yet sold to a purchaser contains an 
imminent safety hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance, the 
distributor or dealer shall refer the matter to the manufacturer for 
remedial action under Sec. 3282.415. If the distributor or dealer is not 
satisfied with the action taken by the manufacturer, it may refer the 
matter to the SAA in the state in which the manufactured home is 
located, or to the Secretary if there is no such SAA.
    (b) Where a distributor or dealer receives a consumer complaint or 
other information concerning a manufactured home sold by the distributor 
or dealer, indicating the possible existence of an imminent safety 
hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance in the manufactured 
home, the distributor or dealer shall refer the matter to the 
manufacturer.

that may be affected and the proposed repairs, and by providing for 
approval of corrective actions where appropriate under subpart I,
    (5) Provide for oversight by the SAA of:
    (i) Remedial actions carried out by manufacturers for which the SAA 
approved the plan for notification or correction under Sec. 3282.405, or 
Sec. 3282.407, or for which the SAA has waived formal notification under 
Sec. 3282.405 or Sec. 3282.407, and
    (ii) A manufacturer's handling of consumer complaints and other 
information under Sec. 3282.404 as to plants located within the State,
    (6) Provide for the setting of monitoring inspection fees in

<R05>
Sec. 3282.303  State plan--suggested provisions.

    The following are not required to be included in the State plan, but 
they are urged as necessary to provide full consumer protection and 
assurances of manufactured home safety:
    (a) Provision for monitoring of dealers' lots within the State for 
transit damage, seal tampering, and dealer performance generally,
    (b) Provision of approvals of all alterations made to certified 
manufactured homes by dealer in the State. Under this program, the State 
would assure that alterations did not result in the failure of the 
manufactured home to comply with the standards.
    (c) Provision for monitoring of the installation of manufactured 
homes set up in the State to assure that the homes are properly 
installed and, where necessary, tied down,
    (d) Provision for inspection of used manufactured homes and 
requirements under State authority that used manufactured homes meet a 
minimal level of safety and durability at the time of sale, and,
    (e) Provision for regulation of manufactured home transportation 
over the road to the extent that such regulation is not preempted by 
Federal authority.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.304  Inadequate State plan.

    If the Secretary determines that a State plan submitted under this 
subpart is not adequate, the designated State agency shall be informed 
of the additions and corrections required for approval. A revised State 
plan shall be submitted within 30 days of receipt of such determination. 
If the revised State plan is inadequate or if the State fails to 
resubmit within the 30 day period or otherwise indicates that it does

[[Page 222]]

not intend to change its State plan as submitted, the Secretary shall 
notify the designated State agency that the State plan is not approved 
and that it has a right to a hearing on the disapproval in accordance 
with subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.305  State plan approval.

    The Secretary's approval or conditional approval of a State plan 
Application shall qualify that State to perform the functions for which 
it has been approved.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.306  Withdrawal of State approval.

    The Secretary shall, on the basis of reports submitted by the State, 
and on the basis of HUD monitoring, make a continuing evaluation of the 
manner in which each State is carrying out its State plan and shall 
submit the reports of such evaluation to the appropriate committees of 
the Congress. Whenever the Secretary finds, after affording due notice 
and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subpart D of this part, 
that in the administration of the State program there is a failure to 
comply substantially with any provision of the State plan or that the 
State plan has become inadequate, the Secretary shall notify the State 
of withdrawal of approval or conditional approval of the State program. 
The State program shall cease to be in effect at such time as the 
Secretary may establish.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.307  Monitoring inspection fee establishment and distribution.

    (a) Each approved State shall establish a monitoring inspection fee 
in an amount required by the Secretary. This fee shall be an amount paid 
by each manufactured home manufacturer in the State for each 
transportable section of each manufactured housing unit produced by the 
manufacturer in that State. In non-approved and conditionally-approved 
States, the fee shall be set by the Secretary.
    (b) The monitoring inspection fee shall be paid by the manufacturer 
to the Secretary or to the Secretary's Agent, who shall distribute a 
portion of the fees collected from all manufactured home manufacturers 
among the approved and conditionally-approved States in accordance with 
an agreement between the Secretary and the States and based upon the 
following formula:
    (1) $9.00 of the monitoring inspection fee collected for each 
transportable section of each new manufactured housing unit that, after 
leaving the manufacturing plant, is first located on the premises of a 
dealer, distributor, or purchaser in that State; plus
    (2) $2.50 of the monitoring inspection fee collected for each 
transportable section of each new manufactured housing unit produced in 
a manufacturing plant in that State.
    (c) A portion of the monitoring inspection fee collected also shall 
be distributed by the Secretary or the Secretary's Agent based on the 
extent of participation of the State in the Joint Team Monitoring 
Program set out in Sec. 3282.308.
    (d) To assure that a State devotes adequate funds to carry out its 
State Plan, a State may impose an additional reasonable inspection fee 
to offset expenses incurred by that State in conducting inspections. 
Such fee shall not exceed that amount which is the difference between 
the amount of funds distributed to the State as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section and the amount necessary to cover the costs of 
inspections. Such fee shall be part of the State Plan pursuant to 
Sec. 3282.302(b) (11) and (12) and shall be subject to the approval of 
the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 3282.305.
    (e) The Secretary may establish by notice in the Federal Register a 
monitoring inspection fee which is to be paid by manufacturers for each 
transportable section of each manufactured housing unit manufactured in 
nonapproved and conditionally approved States as described in 
Sec. 3282.210. To determine the amount of the inspection fee to be paid 
for each transportable section of each manufactured home, the Secretary 
shall divide the (estimated) number of transportable sections of 
manufactured homes (based on recent industry production figures) into 
the anticipated aggregate cost of conducting the inspection program in 
the foreseeable feature. The time period selected for projecting the 
Department's inspection-related costs and

[[Page 223]]

number of transportable sections need not always be the same, but must 
be for a period of sufficient duration to provide for access to 
reasonable underlying data. To determine the aggregate cost of 
conducting the inspection program, the Secretary shall calculate the sum 
necessary to support:
    (1) Inspection-related activities of State Administrative Agencies;
    (2) Inspection-related activities performed by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development;
    (3) Inspection-related activities performed by monitoring inspection 
contractors;
    (4) Miscellaneous activities involving the performance of 
inspection-related activities by the Department, including on-site 
inspections on an ad hoc basis; and
    (5) Maintenance of adequate funds to offset short-term fluctuations 
in costs that do not warrant revising the fee under the authority of 
this section.
    (f) The Secretary may at any time revise the amount of the fees 
established under paragraph (a) or (e) of this section by placing a 
notice of the amount of the revised fee in the Federal Register.

Sec. 3282.308  State participation in monitoring of primary inspection agencies.

    (a) An SAA may provide personnel to participate in joint team 
monitoring of primary inspection agencies as set out in subpart J. If an 
SAA wishes to do so, it must include in its State plan a list of what 
personnel would be supplied for the teams, their qualifications, and how 
many person-years the State would supply. All personnel will be subject 
to approval by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent. A person-year is 
2,080 hours of work.
    (b) If an SAA wishes to monitor the performance of primary 
inspection agencies acting within the State, it must include in its 
State plan a description of how extensively, how often, and by whom this 
will be carried out. This monitoring shall be coordinated by the 
Secretary, or the Secretary's agent with monitoring carried out by joint 
monitoring teams, and in no event shall an SAA provide monitoring where 
the State is also acting as a primary inspection agency.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.309  Formal and informal presentations of views held by SAAs.

    (a) When an SAA is the appropriate agency to hold a Formal or 
Informal Presentation of Views under Sec. 3282.407 of subpart I, the SAA 
shall follow the procedures set out in Sec. Sec. 3282.152 and 3282.153, 
with the SAA acting as the Secretary otherwise would under that section. 
Where Sec. 3282.152 requires publication of notice in the Federal 
Register, the SAA shall, to the maximum extent possible, provide 
equivalent notice throughout the State by publication in the newspaper 
or newspapers having State-wide coverage or otherwise. The determination 
of whether to provide an Informal Presentation of Views under 
Sec. 3282.152(f), or a Formal Presentation of Views under 
Sec. 3282.152(g), is left to the SAA.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 3282.152(f)(2) and (g)(2) 
relating to the conclusive effect of a final determination, any party, 
in a proceeding held at an SAA under this section, including 
specifically the owners of affected manufactured homes, States in which 
affected manufactured homes are located, consumer groups representing 
affected owners and manufacturers (but limited to parties with similar 
substantial interest) may appeal to the Secretary in writing any Final 
Determination by an SAA which is adverse to the interest of that party. 
This appeal on the record shall be made within 30 days of the date on 
which the Final Determination was made by the SAA.

                 Subpart H--Primary Inspection Agencies


<R05>
Sec. 3282.351  General.

    (a) This subpart sets out the requirements which must be met by 
States or private organizations which wish to qualify as primary 
inspection agencies under these regulations. It also sets out the 
various functions which will be carried out by primary inspection 
agencies.

[[Page 224]]

    (b) There are four basic functions which are performed by primary 
inspection agencies:
    (1) Approval of the manufacturer's manufactured home design to 
assure that it is in compliance with the standard;
    (2) Approval of the manufacturer's quality control program to assure 
that it is compatible with the design;
    (3) Approval of the manufacturer's plant facility and manufacturing 
process to assure that the manufacturer can perform its approved quality 
control program and can produce manufactured homes in conformance with 
its approved design, and
    (4) Performance of ongoing inspections of the manufacturing process 
in each manufacturing plant to assure that the manufacturer is 
continuing to perform its approved quality control program and, with 
respect to those aspects of manufactured homes inspected, is continuing 
to produce manufactured homes in performance with its approved designs 
and in conformance with the standards (see Sec. 3282.362(c)(1)).
    (c) There are two types of primary inspection agencies which perform 
these functions:
    (1) Those which approve designs and quality control programs (Design 
Approval Primary Inspection Agencies--DAPIAs) and
    (2) Those which approve plants and perform ongoing inspections in 
the manufacturing plants (Production Inspection Primary Inspection 
Agencies--IPIAs).
    (d) States and private organizations whose submissions under this 
subpart are acceptable shall be granted provisional acceptance. Final 
acceptance shall be conditioned upon adequate performance, which will be 
determined through monitoring of the actions of the primary inspection 
agencies. Monitoring of all primary inspection agencies shall be carried 
out as set out in subpart J. HUD accepted agencies can perform DAPIA 
functions for any manufacturer in any State and IPIA functions in any 
State except those in which the State has been approved to act as the 
exclusive IPIA under Sec. 3282.352.
    (e) Primary inspection agencies approved under this subpart may 
contract with manufactured home manufacturers (see Sec. 3282.202) to 
provide the services set out in this subpart. Any PIA which charges fees 
which are excessive in relation to the services rendered shall be 
subject to disqualification under Sec. 3282.356.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.352  State exclusive IPIA functions.

    (a) Any State which has an approved State Administrative Agency may, 
if accepted as an IPIA, act as the exclusive IPIA within the State. A 
State which acts as an IPIA but is not approved as an SAA may not act as 
the exclusive IPIA in the State. A State which acts as an exclusive IPIA 
shall be staffed to provide IPIA services to all manufacturers within 
the state and may not charge unreasonable fees for those services.
    (b) States which wish to act as exclusive IPIAs shall apply for 
approval to do so in their State plan applications. They shall specify 
the fees they will charge for IPIA services and shall submit proposed 
fee revisions to the Secretary prior to instituting any change in fees. 
If at any time the Secretary finds that those fees are not commensurate 
with the fees generally being charged for similar services, the 
Secretary will withhold or revoke approval to act as an exclusive IPIA. 
States acting as DAPIAs and also as exclusive IPIAs shall establish 
separate fees for the two functions and shall specify what additional 
services (such as approval of design changes and full time inspections) 
these fees cover. As provided in Sec. 3282.302(b)(11), each State shall 
submit fee schedules for its activities and, where appropriate, the fees 
presently charged for DAPIA and IPIA services, and any fees charged for 
DAPIA and IPIA services during the preceding two calendar years.
    (c) A State's status as an exclusive IPIA shall commence upon 
approval of the State Plan Application and acceptance of the State's 
submission under Sec. 3282.355. Where a private organization accepted or 
provisionally accepted as an IPIA under this subpart H is operating in a 
manufacturing plant within the State on the date the State's status

[[Page 225]]

as an exclusive IPIA commences, the private organization may provide 
IPIA services in that plant for 90 days after that date.

services for which they will be charged.
    (c) A detailed description of how the submitting party intends to 
carry out all of the functions for which it wishes to be approved under 
this subpart, with appropriate cross-references to sections of this 
subpart, including examples and complete descriptions of all reports, 
tests, and evaluations which the party would be required to make. Where 
appropriate, later sections of this subpart identify particular items 
which must be included in the submission. The Secretary may request 
further detailed information, when appropriate.
    (d) A party wishing to be approved as a DAPIA shall submit a copy of 
a manufactured home design that it has approved (or if it has not 
approved a design, one that it has evaluated and a deviation report 
showing where the design is not in conformance with the standards) and a 
copy of a quality assurance manual that it has approved (or if it was 
not approved a manual, one that it has evaluated and a deviation report 
showing where the manual is inadequate).
    (e) A party wishing to be approved as an IPIA shall submit a copy of 
a certification report which it has prepared for a manufactured home 
plant or, if it has not prepared such a report, an evaluation of a 
manufacturing plant which it has inspected with a description of what 
changes shall be made before a certification report can be issued. A 
party that has not previously inspected manufactured homes may 
nevertheless be accepted on the basis of the qualifications of its 
personnel and its commitment to perform the required functions.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.354  Submittal of false information or refusal to submit information.

    The submittal of false information or the refusal to submit 
information required under this subpart may be sufficient cause for the 
Secretary to revoke or withhold acceptance.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.355  Submission acceptance.

    (a) A party whose submission is determined by the Department to be 
adequate shall be granted provisional acceptance until December 15, 
1976, or for a six month period from the date of such determination, 
whichever is later.
    (b) Final acceptance of a party to act as a primary inspection 
agency will be contingent upon adequate performance during the period of 
provisional acceptance as determined through monitoring carried out 
under subpart J and upon satisfactory acceptance under

[[Page 226]]

Sec. 3282.361(e) or Sec. 3282.362(e). Final acceptance shall be withheld 
if performance is inadequate.
    (c) Continued acceptance as a primary inspection agency shall be 
contingent upon continued adequacy of performance as determined through 
monitoring carried out under subpart J. If the Secretary determines that 
a primary inspection agency that has been granted final acceptance is 
performing inadequately, the Secretary shall suspend the acceptance, and 
the primary inspection agency shall be entitled to a Formal or Informal 
Presentation of Views as set out in subpart D of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.356  Disqualification and requalification of primary inspection agencies.

    (a) The Secretary, based on monitoring reports or on other reliable 
information, may determine that a primary inspection agency which has 
been accepted under this subpart is not adequately carrying out one or 
more of its required functions. In so determining, the Secretary shall 
consider the impact of disqualification on manufacturers and other 
affected parties and shall seek to assure that the manufacturing process 
is not disrupted unnecessarily. Whenever the Secretary disqualifies a 
primary inspection agency under this section, the primary inspection 
agency shall have a right to a Formal or Informal Presentation of Views 
under subpart D of this part.
    (b) Interested persons may petition the Secretary to disqualify a 
primary inspection agency under the provisions of Sec. 3282.156(b).
    (c) A primary inspection agency which has been disqualified under 
paragraph (a) may resubmit an application under Sec. 3282.353. The 
submission shall include a full explanation of how problems or 
inadequacies which resulted in disqualifications have been rectified and 
how the primary inspection agency shall assure that such problems shall 
not recur.
    (d) When appropriate, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
Register or otherwise make available to the public for comment a 
disqualified PIA's application for requalification, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 3282.54.
    (e) Both provisional and final acceptance of any IPIA (or DAPIA) 
automatically expires at the end of any period of one year during which 
it has not acted as an IPIA (or DAPIA). An IPIA (or DAPIA) has not acted 
as such unless it has actively performed its services as an IPIA (or 
DAPIA) for at least one manufacturer by which it has been selected. An 
IPIA (or DAPIA) whose acceptance has expired pursuant to this section 
may resubmit an application under Sec. 3282.353 in order to again be 
qualified as an IPIA (or DAPIA), when it can show a bona fide prospect 
of performing IPIA (or DAPIA) services.

Sec. 3282.360  PIA acceptance of product certification programs or listings.

    In determining whether products to be included in a manufactured 
home are acceptable under the standards set out in part 3280 of 24 CFR, 
all PIAs shall accept all product verification programs, labelings, and 
listings unless the PIA has reason to believe that a particular 
certification is not acceptable, in which case, the PIA shall so inform 
the Secretary and provide the Secretary with full documentation and 
information on which it bases its belief. Pending a determination by the 
Secretary, the PIA shall provisionally accept the certification. The 
Secretary's determination shall be binding on all PIAs.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.361  Design Approval Primary Inspection Agency (DAPIA).

    (a) General. (1) The DAPIA selected by a manufacturer under 
Sec. 3282.203 shall be responsible for evaluating all manufactured home 
designs submitted to it by the manufacturer and for assuring that they 
conform to the standards. It shall also be responsible for evaluating 
all quality control programs submitted to it by the manufacturer by 
reviewing the quality assurance manuals in which the programs are set 
out to assure that the manuals reflect programs which are compatible 
with the designs to be followed and which commit the manufacturer to 
make adequate inspections and tests of every part of every manufactured 
home produced.
    (2) A design or quality assurance manual approved by a DAPIA shall 
be accepted by all IPIAs acting under Sec. 3282.362 who deal with the 
design, quality assurance manual, or manufactured homes built to them, 
and by all other parties, as, respectively, being in conformance with 
the Federal standards or as providing for adequate quality control to 
assure conformance. However, each design and quality assurance manual is 
subject to review and verification by the Secretary or the Secretary's 
agent at any time.
    (b) Designs. (1) In evaluating designs for compliance with the 
standards, the DAPIA will not allow any deviations from accepted 
engineering practice standards for design calculations or any deviations 
from accepted test standards, except that the DAPIA, for good cause, may 
request the Secretary to accept innovations which are not yet accepted 
practices. Acceptances by the Secretary shall be published in the form 
of interpretative bulletins, where appropriate.
    (2) The DAPIA shall require the manufacturer to submit floor plans 
and specific information for each manufactured home design or variation 
which the DAPIA is to evaluate. It shall also require the submission of 
drawings, specifications, calculations, and test records of the 
structural, electrical and mechanical systems of each such manufactured 
home design or variation. The manufacturer need not supply duplicate 
information where systems are common to several floor plans. Each DAPIA 
shall develop and carry out procedures for evaluating original 
manufactured home designs by requiring manufacturers to submit necessary 
drawings and calculations and carry out such verifications and 
calculations as it deems necessary. Where compliance with the standards 
cannot be determined on the basis of drawings and calculations, the 
DAPIA shall require any necessary tests to be carried out at

[[Page 229]]

its own facility, at separate testing facilities or at the 
manufacturer's plant.
    (3) Design deviation report. After evaluating the manufacturer's 
design, the DAPIA shall furnish the manufacturer with a design deviation 
report which specifies in detail, item by item with appropriate 
citations to the standards, the specific deviations in the 
manufacturer's design which must be rectified in order to produce 
manufactured homes which comply with the standards. The design deviation 
report may acknowledge the possibility of alternative designs, tests, 
listings, and certifications and state the conditions under which they 
will be acceptable. The design deviation report shall, to the extent 
practicable, be complete for each design evaluated in order to avoid 
repeated rejections and additional costs to the manufacturer.
    (4) Design approval. The DAPIA shall signify approval of a design by 
placing its stamp of approval or authorized signature on each drawing 
and each sheet of test results. The DAPIA shall clearly cross-reference 
the calculations and test results to applicable drawings. The DAPIA may 
require the manufacturer to do the cross-referencing if it wishes. It 
shall indicate on each sheet how any deviations from the standards have 
been or shall be resolved. Within 5 days after approving a design, the 
DAPIA shall forward a copy of the design to the manufacturer and the 
Secretary or the Secretary's agent (prior to the effective date of the 
standards the latter copy shall go to the Secretary.)

The DAPIA shall maintain a complete up-to-date set of approved designs 
and design changes approved under paragraph (b)(5) of this section which 
it can duplicate and copies of which it can furnish to interested 
parties as needed when disputes arise.
    (5) Design change approval. The DAPIA shall also be responsible for 
approving all changes which a manufacturer wishes to make in a design 
approved by the DAPIA. In reviewing design changes, the DAPIA shall 
respond as quickly as possible to avoid disruption of the manufacturing 
process. Within 5 days after approving a design change, the DAPIA shall 
forward a copy of this change to the manufacturer and the Secretary or 
the Secretary's agent as set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section to 
be included in the design to which the change was made.
    (c) Quality assurance manuals. (1) In evaluating a quality assurance 
manual, the DAPIA shall identify any aspects of designs to be 
manufactured under the manual which require special quality control 
procedures. The DAPIA shall determine whether the manual under which a 
particular design is to be manufactured reflects those special 
procedures, and shall also determine whether the manuals which it 
evaluates provide for such inspections and testing of each manufactured 
home so that the manufacturer, by following the manual, can assure that 
each manufactured home it manufactures will conform to the standards. 
The manual shall, at a minimum, include the information set out in 
Sec. 3282.203(c).
    (2) Manual deviation report. After evaluating a manufacturer's 
quality assurance manual, the DAPIA shall furnish the manufacturer with 
a manual deviation report which specifies in detail any changes which a 
manufacturer must make in order for the quality assurance manual to be 
acceptable. The manual deviation report shall, to the extent 
practicable, be complete for each design in order to avoid repeated 
rejections and additional costs to the manufacturer.
    (3) Manual approval. The DAPIA shall signify approval of the 
manufacturer's quality assurance manual by placing its stamp of approval 
or authorized signature on the cover page of the manual. Within 5 days 
of approving a quality assurance manual, the DAPIA shall forward a copy 
of the quality assurance manual to the manufacturer and the Secretary or 
the Secretary's agent (prior to the effective date of the standards, the 
latter copy shall go to the Secretary). The DAPIA shall maintain a 
complete up-to-date set of approved manuals and manual changes approved 
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section which it can duplicate and copies 
of which it can furnish to interested parties as needed when disputes 
arise.
    (4) Manual change approval. Each change the manufacturer wishes to 
make in its quality assurance manual

[[Page 230]]

shall be approved by the DAPIA. Within 5 days after approving a manual 
change, the DAPIA shall forward a copy of the change to the manufacturer 
and the Secretary or the Secretary's agent as set out in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section to be included in the manual to which the change 
was made.
    (d) Requirements for full acceptance--DAPIA. (1) Before granting 
full acceptance to a DAPIA, the Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall 
review and evaluate at least one complete design and one quality 
assurance manual which has been approved by the DAPIA. These shall be 
designs and manuals approved to the Federal standards, and they shall be 
chosen at random from those approved by the DAPIA during the period of 
provisional acceptance.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that a design or quality assurance 
manual shows an inadequate level of performance, the Secretary or the 
Secretary's agent shall carry out further evaluations. If the Secretary 
finds the level of performance to be unacceptable, the Secretary shall 
not grant full acceptance. If full acceptance has not been granted by 
the end of the provisional acceptance period, provisional acceptance 
shall lapse unless the Secretary determines that the failure to obtain 
full acceptance resulted from the fact that the Secretary or her agent 
has not had adequate time in which to complete an evaluation.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.362  Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agencies (IPIAs).

    (a) General--(1) IPIA responsibilities. An IPIA selected by a 
manufacturer under Sec. 3282.204 to act in a particular manufacturing 
plant shall be responsible for assuring:
    (i) That the plant is capable of following the quality control 
procedures set out in the quality assurance manual to be followed in 
that plant;
    (ii) That the plant continues to follow the quality assurance 
manual;
    (iii) That any part of any manufactured home that it actually 
inspects conforms with the design, or where the design is not specific 
with respect to an aspect of the standards, to the standards;
    (iv) That whenever it finds a manufactured home in production which 
fails to conform to the design or where the design is not specific, to 
the standards, the failure to conform is corrected before the 
manufactured home leaves the manufacturing plant; and
    (v) That if a failure to conform to the design, or where the design 
is not specific, to the standards, is found in one manufactured home, 
all other homes still in the plant which the IPIA's records or the 
records of the manufacturer indicate might not conform to the design or 
to standards are inspected and, if necessary, brought up to the 
standards before they leave the plant.
    (2) No more than one IPIA shall operate in any one manufacturing 
plant, except that where a manufacturer decides to change from one IPIA 
to another, the two may operate in the plant simultaneously for a 
limited period of time to the extent necessary to assure a smooth 
transition.
    (b) Plant approval. (1) Each IPIA shall, with respect to each 
manufacturing plant for which it is responsible, evaluate the quality 
control procedures being followed by the manufacturer in the plant to 
determine whether those procedures are consistent with and fulfill the 
procedures set out in the DAPIA approved quality assurance manual being 
followed in the plant. As part of this evaluation, and prior to the 
issuance of any labels to the manufacturer, the IPIA shall make a 
complete inspection of the manufacture of at least one manufactured home 
through all of the operations in the manufacturer's plant. The purpose 
of this initial factory inspection is to determine whether the 
manufacturer is capable of producing manufactured homes in conformance 
with the approved design and, to the extent the design is not specific 
with respect to an aspect of the standards, with the standards and to 
determine whether the manufacturer's quality control procedures as set 
out in the quality assurance manual, plant equipment, and personnel, 
will assure that such conformance continues. This inspection should be 
made by one or

[[Page 231]]

more qualified engineers who have reviewed the approved design and by an 
inspector who has been carefully briefed by the engineers on the 
restrictive aspects of the design. The manufactured home shall be 
inspected to the approved design for the home except that where the 
design is not specific with respect to any aspect of the standards, the 
inspection shall be to the standards as to that aspect of the 
manufactured home. If the first manufactured home inspected fails to 
conform to the design or, with respect to any aspect of the standards 
not specifically covered by the design, to the standards, additional 
units shall be similarly inspected until the IPIA is satisfied that the 
manufacturer is conforming to the approved design, or where the design 
is not specific with respect to any aspect of the standards, to the 
standards and quality assurance manual.
    (2) Certification report. If, on the basis of the initial 
comprehensive factory inspection required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the IPIA determines that the manufacturer is performing 
adequately, the IPIA shall prepare and forward to the manufacturer, to 
HUD, and to HUD's agent a certification report as described in this 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The issuance of the certification 
report is a prerequisite to the commencement of production surveillance 
under paragraph (c) of this section in the plant for which the report is 
issued. At the time the certification report is issued, the IPIA may 
provide the manufacturer with a two to four week supply of labels to be 
applied to manufactured homes produced in the plant. The IPIA shall 
maintain a copy of each certification report which it issues.
    (3) The certification report shall include:
    (i) The name of the DAPIA which approved the manufacturer's design 
and quality assurance manual and the dates of those approvals,
    (ii) The names and titles of the IPIA engineers and inspectors who 
performed the initial comprehensive inspection,
    (iii) A full report of inspections made, serial numbers inspected, 
any failures to comply which were observed, corrective actions taken, 
and dates of inspections, and
    (iv) A certification that at least one manufactured home has been 
completely inspected in all phases of its production in the plant, that 
the manufacturer is performing in conformance with the approved designs 
and quality assurance manual and, to the extent the design is not 
specific with respect to any aspects of the standards, with the 
standards, and the IPIA is satisfied that the manufacturer can produce 
manufactured homes in conformance with the designs, and where the 
designs are not specific, with the standards on a continuing basis.
    (4) Inadequate manufacturer performance. Where an IPIA determines 
that the performance of a manufacturer is not yet adequate to justify 
the issuance of a certification report and labels to the manufacturer, 
the IPIA may label manufactured homes itself by using such of its 
personnel as it deems necessary to perform complete inspections of all 
phases of production of each manufactured home being produced and 
labeling only those determined after any necessary corrections to be in 
conformance with the design and, as appropriate, with the standards. 
This procedure shall continue until the IPIA determines that the 
manufacturer's performance is adequate to justify the issuance of a 
certification report.
    (c) Production surveillance. (1) After it has issued a certification 
report under paragraph (b) of this section, the IPIA shall carry out 
ongoing surveillance of the manufacturing process in the plant. The IPIA 
shall be responsible for conducting representative inspections to assure 
that the manufacturer is performing its quality control program pursuant 
to and consistent with its approved quality assurance manual and to 
assure that whatever part of a manufactured home is actually inspected 
by the IPIA is fully in conformance with the design and, as appropriate 
under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, with the standards before a 
label is issued for or placed on that manufactured home. The 
surveillance visits shall commence no later than that date on which the 
IPIA determines they must commence so that the IPIA can

[[Page 232]]

assure that every manufactured home to be produced after the effective 
date of the standards to which a label provided for in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section is affixed, is inspected in at least one stage of its 
production. The frequency of subsequent visits to the plant shall 
continue to be such that every manufactured home is inspected at some 
stage in its production. In the course of each visit, the IPIA shall 
make a complete inspection of every phase of production and of every 
visible part of every manufactured home which is at each stage of 
production. The inspection shall be made to the approved design except 
where the design is not specific with respect to an aspect of the 
standards, in which case the inspection of that aspect of the 
manufactured home shall be made to the standards. The IPIA shall assure 
that no label is placed on any manufactured home which it finds fails to 
conform with the approved design or, as appropriate, the standards in 
the course of these inspections and shall assure that no labels are 
placed on other manufactured homes still in the plant which may also not 
conform until those homes are inspected and if necessary corrected to 
the design or the standards. If an IPIA finds a manufactured home that 
fails to conform to the design, or as appropriate under paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section, to the standards, the IPIA may, in addition 
to withholding the label for the unit, proceed to red tag the home until 
the failure to conform is corrected. Only the IPIA is authorized to 
remove a red tag. When manufactured homes repeatedly fail to conform to 
the design, or as appropriate under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section, to the standards in the same assembly station or when there is 
evidence that the manufacturer is ignoring or not performing under its 
approved quality assurance manual, the IPIA shall increase the frequency 
of these inspections until it is satisfied that the manufacturer is 
performing to its approved quality assurance manual. Failure to perform 
to the approved manual justifies withholding labels until an adequate 
level of performance is attained. As part of its function of assuring 
quality control, the IPIA shall inspect materials in storage and test 
equipment used by the manufacturer at least once a month, and more 
frequently if unacceptable conditions are observed. With the prior 
approval of the Secretary, an IPIA may decrease the frequency of any 
inspections.
    (2) Labeling--(i) Labels required. (A) The IPIA shall continuously 
provide the manufacturer with a two- to four-week supply (at the 
convenience of the IPIA and the manufacturer) of the labels described in 
this subsection, except that no labels shall be issued for use when the 
IPIA is not present if the IPIA is not satisfied that the manufacturer 
can and is producing manufactured homes which conform to the design and, 
as appropriate, to the standards. Where necessary, the IPIA shall 
reclaim labels already given to the manufacturer. In no event shall the 
IPIA allow a label to be affixed to a manufactured home if the IPIA 
believes that the manufactured home fails to conform to the design, or, 
where the design is not specific with respect to an aspect of the 
standards, to the standards. Labels for such manufactured homes shall be 
provided only after the failure to conform has been remedied, or after 
the Secretary has determined that there is no failure to conform.
    (B) A permanent label shall be affixed to each transportable section 
of each manufactured home for sale or lease to a purchaser or lessor in 
the United States in such a manner that removal will damage the label so 
that it cannot be reused. This label is provided by the IPIA and is 
separate and distinct from the data plate that the manufacturer is 
required to provide under Sec. 3280.5.
    (C) The label shall read as follows:

    ``As evidenced by this label No. ABC 000 001, the manufacturer 
certifies to the best of the manufacturer's knowledge and belief that 
this manufactured home has been inspected in accordance with the 
requirements of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is 
constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home 
Construction and Safety Standards in effect on the date of manufacture. 
See data plate.''

    (D) The label shall be 2 in. by 4 in. in size and shall be 
permanently attached to the manufactured home by means of 4 blind 
rivets, drive screws, or other

[[Page 233]]

means that render it difficult to remove without defacing it. It shall 
be etched on .032 in. thick aluminum plate. The label number shall be 
etched or stamped with a 3 letter IPIA designation which the Secretary 
shall assign and a 6 digit number which the label supplier shall stamp 
sequentially on labels supplied to each IPIA.
    (E) The label shall be located at the tail-light end of each 
transportable section of the manufactured home approximately one foot up 
from the floor and one foot in from the road side, or as near that 
location on a permanent part of the exterior of the manufactured home as 
practicable. The roadside is the right side of the manufactured home 
when one views the manufactured home from the tow bar end of the 
manufactured home. It shall be applied to the manufactured home unit in 
the manufacturing plant by the manufacturer or the IPIA, as appropriate.
    (F) The label shall be provided to the manufacturer only by the 
IPIA. The IPIA shall provide the labels in sequentially numbered series. 
The IPIA may obtain labels from the Secretary or the Secretary's agent, 
or where the IPIA obtains the prior approval of the Secretary, from a 
label manufacturer. However, if the IPIA obtains labels directly from a 
label supplier, those labels must be sequentially numbered without any 
duplication of label numbers.
    (G) Whenever the IPIA determines that a manufactured home which has 
been labeled, but which has not yet been released by the manufacturer 
may not conform to the design or, as appropriate under paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section, to the standards, the IPIA by itself or 
through an agent shall red tag the manufactured home. Where the IPIA 
determines that a manufactured home which has been labeled and released 
by the manufacturer, but not yet sold to a purchaser (as described in 
Sec. 3282.252(b)) may not conform, the IPIA may, in its discretion, 
proceed to red tag the manufactured home. Only the IPIA is authorized to 
remove red tags, though it may do so through agents which it deems 
qualified to determine that the failure to conform has been corrected. 
Red tags may be removed when the IPIA is satisfied, through inspections, 
assurances from the manufacturer, or otherwise, that the affected homes 
conform.
    (H) Labels that are damaged, destroyed, or otherwise made illegible 
or removed shall be replaced by the IPIA, after determination that the 
manufactured home is in compliance with the standards, by a new label of 
a different serial number. The IPIA's labeling record shall be 
permanently marked with the number of the replacement label and a 
corresponding record of the replacement label.
    (ii) Label control. The labels used in each plant shall be under the 
direct control of the IPIA acting in that plant. Only the IPIA shall 
provide the labels to the manufacturer. The IPIA shall assure that the 
manufacturer does not use any other label to indicate conformance to the 
standards.
    (A) The IPIA shall be responsible for obtaining labels. Labels shall 
be obtained from HUD or its agent, or with the approval of the 
Secretary, from a label manufacturer. The labels shall meet the 
requirements of this section. Where the IPIA obtains labels directly 
from a label manufacturer, the IPIA shall be responsible for assuring 
that the label manufacturer does not provide labels directly to the 
manufacturer of manufactured homes. If the label manufacturer fails to 
supply correct labels or allows labels to be released to parties other 
than the IPIA, the IPIA shall cease dealing with the label manufacturer.
    (B) The labels shall be shipped to and stored by the IPIA's at a 
location which permits ready access to manufacturing plants under its 
surveillance. The labels shall be stored under strict security and 
inventory control. They shall be released only by the IPIA to the 
manufacturer under these regulations.
    (C) The IPIA shall be able to account for all labels which it has 
obtained through the date on which the manufactured home leaves the 
manufacturing plant, and it shall be able to identify the serial number 
of the manufactured home to which each particular label is affixed.

[[Page 234]]

    (D) The IPIA shall keep in its central record office a list of the 
serial numbers of labels issued from the label producer to the IPIA and 
by the IPIA to the manufacturing plant.
    (E) Failure to maintain control of labels through the date the 
manufactured home leaves the manufacturing plant and failure to keep 
adequate records of which label is on which manufactured home shall 
render the IPIA subject to disqualification under Sec. 3282.356.
    (3) Data plate. (i) The IPIA shall assure that each manufactured 
home produced in each manufacturing plant under its surveillance is 
supplied with a data plate which meets the requirements of this section 
and of Sec. 3280.5 of chapter XX of 24 CFR. The data plate shall be 
furnished by the manufacturer and affixed inside the manufactured home 
on or near the main electrical distribution panel. The data plate shall 
contain the following information:
    (A) The name and address of the manufacturing plant in which the 
manufactured home was manufactured,
    (B) The serial number and model designation of the unit and the date 
the unit was manufactured,
    (C) The statement ``This manufactured home is designed to comply 
with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in 
force at the time of manufacture.'',
    (D) A list of major factory-installed equipment including the 
manufacturer's name and the model designation of each appliance,
    (E) Reference to the roof load zone and wind load zone for which the 
home is designed and duplicates of the maps as set forth in 
Sec. 3280.305. This information may be combined with the heating/cooling 
certificate and insulation zone map required by Secs. 3280.510 and 
3280.511. The Wind Zone Map on the Data Plate shall also contain the 
statement:

    This home has not been designed for the higher wind pressures and 
anchoring provisions required for ocean/coastal areas and should not be 
located within 1500' of the coastline in Wind Zones II and III, unless 
the home and its anchoring and foundation system have been designed for 
the increased requirements specified for Exposure D in ANSI/ASCE 7-88.

    (F) The statement:

    This home has ____ has not ____ (appropriate blank to be checked by 
manufacturer) been equipped with storm shutters or other protective 
coverings for windows and exterior door openings. For homes designed to 
be located in Wind Zones II and III, which have not been provided with 
shutters or equivalent covering devices, it is strongly recommended that 
the home be made ready to be equipped with these devices in accordance 
with the method recommended in the manufacturers printed instructions.

    (G) The statement: ``Design Approval by'', followed by the name of 
the agency that approved the design.
    (ii) A copy of the data plate shall be furnished to the IPIA, and 
the IPIA shall keep a permanent record of the data plate as part of its 
labeling record so that the information is available during the life of 
the manufactured home in case the data plate in the manufactured home is 
defaced or destroyed.
    (d) Permanent records. The IPIA shall maintain the following records 
as appropriate:
    (1) Records of all labels issued, applied, removed, and replaced by 
label number, manufactured home serial number, manufactured home type, 
manufacturer's name, dealer destination, and copies of corresponding 
data plates.
    (2) Records of all manufactured homes which are red tagged, and the 
status of each home.
    (3) Records of all inspections made at each manufacturing plant on 
each manufactured home serial number, each failure to conform found, and 
the action taken in each case.
    (4) Records of all inspections made at other locations of 
manufactured homes identified by manufacturer and serial number, all 
manufactured homes believed to contain the same failure to conform, and 
the action taken in each case.

All records shall specify the precise section of the standard which is 
in question and contain a clear and concise explanation of the process 
by which the IPIA reached any conclusions. All records shall be 
traceable to specific manufactured home serial numbers and through the 
manufacturer's records to dealers and purchasers.

[[Page 235]]

    (e) Requirements for full acceptance--IPIA. (1) Before granting full 
acceptance to an IPIA, the Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall 
review and evaluate at least one certification report which has been 
prepared by the IPIA during the period of provisional acceptance. The 
Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall also review in depth the IPIA's 
administrative capabilities and otherwise review the IPIA's performance 
of its responsibilities under these regulations.
    (2) Where the Secretary determines on the basis of these reviews 
that an IPIA is not meeting an adequate level of performance, the 
Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall carry out further evaluations. 
If the Secretary finds the level of performance to be unacceptable, the 
Secretary shall not grant full acceptance. If full acceptance has not 
been granted by the end of the provisional acceptance period, 
provisional acceptance shall lapse unless the Secretary determines that 
the failure to obtain full acceptance resulted from the fact that the 
Secretary or the Secretary's agent has not had adequate time in which to 
complete an evaluation.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.363  Right of entry and inspection.

    Each primary inspection agency shall secure from each manufacturer 
and manufacturing plant under its surveillance an agreement that the 
Secretary, the State Administrative Agency and the primary inspection 
agency have the right to inspect the plant and its manufactured home 
inspection, labeling, and delivery records, and any of its manufactured 
homes in the hands of dealers or distributors at any reasonable time.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.364  Inspection responsibilities and coordination.

    All primary inspection agencies shall be responsible for acting as 
necessary under their contractual commitment with the manufacturer to 
determine whether alleged failures to conform to the standards may exist 
in manufactured homes produced under their surveillance and to determine 
the source of the problems. The DAPIA may be required to examine the 
designs in question or the quality assurance manual under which the 
manufactured homes were produced. The IPIA may be required to reexamine 
the quality control procedures which it has approved to determine if 
they conform to the quality assurance manual, and the IPIA shall have 
primary responsibility for inspecting actual units produced and, where 
necessary, for inspecting units released by the manufacturer. All 
primary inspection agencies acting with respect to particular 
manufacturer or plant shall act in close coordination so that all 
necessary functions are performed effectively and efficiently.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.365  Forwarding monitoring fee.

    The IPIA shall, whenever it provides labels to a manufacturer, 
obtain from the manufacturer the monitoring fee to be forwarded to the 
Secretary or the Secretary's agent as set out in Sec. 3282.210. If a 
manufacturer fails to provide the monitoring fee as required by 
Sec. 3282.210 to be forwarded by the IPIA under this section, the IPIA 
shall immediately inform the Secretary; or the Secretary's Agent.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.366  Notification and correction campaign responsibilities.

    (a) Both IPIAs and DAPIAs are responsible for assisting the 
Secretary or an SAA in identifying the class of manufactured homes that 
may have been affected where the Secretary or an SAA makes or is 
contemplating making a preliminary determination of imminent safety 
hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance under Sec. 3282.407 
with respect to manufactured homes for which the IPIA or DAPIA provided 
either plant inspection or design approval services.
    (b) The IPIA in each manufacturing plant is responsible for 
reviewing manufacturer determinations of the class of manufactured homes 
affected when the manufacturer is acting under Sec. 3282.404. The IPIA 
shall concur in the method used to determine the class of potentially 
affected manufactured homes or shall state why it finds the

[[Page 236]]

method to be inappropriate, inadequate or incorrect.

<R04>
       Subpart I--Consumer Complaint Handling and Remedial Actions

    Source: 42 FR 2580, Jan. 12, 1977, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.401  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to establish a system under which 
the protections of the Act are provided with a minimum of formality and 
delay, but in which the rights of all parties are protected.
    (b) This subpart sets out the procedures to be followed by 
manufacturers, State Administrative Agencies, primary inspection 
agencies, and the Secretary to assure that manufacturers provide 
notification and correction with respect to their manufactured homes as 
required by the Act. Notification and correction may be required to be 
provided with respect to manufactured homes that have been sold or 
otherwise released by the manufacturer to another party when the 
manufacturer, an SAA or the Secretary determines that an imminent safety 
hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance may exist in those 
manufactured homes as set out herein.
    (c) This subpart sets out the rights of dealers under section 613 of 
the Act, 42 U.S.C. 5412, to obtain remedies from manufacturers in 
certain circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.402  General principles.

    (a) Nothing in this subpart or in these regulations shall limit the 
rights of the purchaser under any contract or applicable law.
    (b) The liability of manufactured home manufacturers to provide 
remedial actions under this subpart is limited by the principle that 
manufacturers are not responsible for failures that occur in 
manufactured homes or components solely as the result of normal year and 
aging, gross and unforeseeable consumer abuse, or unforeseeable neglect 
of maintenance.
    (c) The extent of a manufacturer's responsibility for providing 
notification or correction depends upon the seriousness of problems for 
which the manufacturer is responsible under this subpart.
    (d) When manufacturers act under Sec. 3282.404 of these regulations, 
they will not be required to classify the problem that triggered their 
action as a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety 
hazard.
    (e) It is the policy of these regulations that all consumer 
complaints or other information indicating the possible existence of an 
imminent safety hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance should 
be referred to the manufacturer of the potentially affected manufactured 
homes as early as possible so that the manufacturer can begin to timely 
respond to the consumer and take any necessary remedial actions.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.403  Consumer complaint and information referral.

    When a consumer complaint or other information indicating the 
possible existence of a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or 
imminent safety hazard is received by a State Administrative Agency or 
the Secretary, the SAA or the Secretary shall forward the complaint or 
other information to the manufacturer of the manufactured home in 
question. The SAA or the Secretary shall, when it appears from the 
complaint or other information that more than one manufactured home may 
be involved, simultaneously send a copy of the complaint or other 
information to the SAA of the State where the manufactured home was 
manufactured or to the Secretary if there is no such SAA, and when it 
appears that an imminent safety hazard or serious defect may be 
involved, simultaneously send a copy to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.404  Notification pursuant to manufacturer's determination.

    (a) The manufacturer shall provide notification as set out in this 
subpart with respect to all manufactured homes produced by the 
manufacturer in which there exists or may exist an imminent safety 
hazard or serious defect. The manufacturer shall provide

[[Page 237]]

such notification with respect to manufactured homes produced by the 
manufacturer in which a defect exists or may exist if the manufacturer 
has information indicating that the defect may exist in a class of 
manufactured homes that is identifiable because the cause of the defect 
or defects actually known to the manufacturer is such that the same 
defect would probably have been systematically introduced into more than 
one manufactured home during the course of production. This information 
may include, but is not limited to, complaints that can be traced to the 
same cause, defects known to exist in supplies of components or parts, 
information related to the performance of a particular employee and 
information indicating a failure to follow quality control procedures 
with respect to a particular aspect of the manufactured home. A 
manufacturer is required to provide notification with respect to a 
noncompliance only after the issuance of a final determination under 
Sec. 3282.407.
    (b) Whenever the manufacturer receives from any source information 
that may indicate the existence of a problem in a manufactured home for 
which the manufacturer is responsible for providing notification under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer shall, as soon as 
possible, but not later than 20 days after receipt of the information, 
carry out any necessary investigations and inspections to determine and 
shall determine whether the manufacturer is responsible for providing 
notification under paragraph (a) of this section. The manufacturer shall 
maintain complete records of all such information and determinations in 
a form that will allow the Secretary or an SAA readily to discern who 
made the determination with respect to a particular piece of 
information, what the determination was, and the basis for the 
determination. Such records shall be kept for a minimum of five years 
from the date the manufacturer received the information. Consumer 
complaints or other information indicating the possible existence of 
noncompliances or defects received prior to the effective date of this 
section shall, for purposes of this subpart, be deemed to have been 
received on the date this section became effective.
    (c) If a manufacturer determines under paragraph (b) of this section 
that the manufacturer is responsible for providing notification under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer shall prepare a plan for 
notification as set out in Sec. 3282.409. Where the manufacturer is 
required to correct under Sec. 3282.406, the manufacturer shall include 
in the plan provision for correction of affected manufactured homes. The 
manufacturer shall, as soon as possible, but not later than 20 days 
after making the determination, submit the plan to one of the following, 
as appropriate:
    (1) Where the manufactured homes covered by the plan were all 
manufactured in one State, to the SAA of the State of manufacture;
    (2) Where the manufactured homes were manufactured in more than one 
State, to the Secretary; or
    (3) Where there is no appropriate SAA under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, to the Secretary.

However, Where only one manufactured home is involved, the manufacturer 
need not submit the plan if the manufacturer corrects the manufactured 
home within the 20 day period. The manufacturer shall maintain, in the 
plant where the manufactured home was manufactured, a complete record of 
the correction. The record shall describe briefly the facts of the case 
and state what corrective actions were taken, and it shall be maintained 
in a separate file in a form that will allow the Secretary or an SAA to 
review all such corrections.
    (d) Upon approval of the plan with any necessary changes, the 
manufacturer shall carry out the approved plan within the time limits 
stated in it.
    (e) In any case, the manufacturer may act prior to obtaining 
approval of the plan. However, such action is subject to review and 
disapproval by the SAA of the State where the manufactured home is 
located, the SAA of the State where the manufactured home was 
manufactured, or the Secretary, except to the extent that agreement to 
the correction is obtained as described in this paragraph. To be assured 
that the corrective action will be accepted,

[[Page 238]]

the manufacturer may obtain the agreement of either SAA or the Secretary 
that the corrective action is adequate before the correction is made 
regardless of whether a plan has been submitted under paragraph (c) of 
this section. If such an agreement is obtained, the correction shall be 
accepted as adequate by all SAAs and the Secretary if the correction is 
made as agreed to and any imminent safety hazard or serious defect is 
eliminated.
    (f) If the manufacturer wishes to obtain a waiver of the formal plan 
approval and notification requirements that would result from a 
determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer may 
act under this paragraph. The plan approval and notification 
requirements shall be waived by either the SAA or the Secretary that 
would otherwise review the plan under paragraph (c) of this section if:
    (1) The manufacturer, before the expiration of the time period 
determined under paragaraph (c) of this section, shows to the 
satisfaction of the SAA or the Secretary, through such documentation as 
the SAA or the Secretary may require, that:
    (i) The manufacturer has identified the class of possibly affected 
manufactured homes in accordance with Sec. 3282.409.
    (ii) The manufacturer will correct, at the manufacturer's expense, 
all affected manufactured homes in the class within 60 days of being 
informed that the request for waiver has been accepted; and
    (iii) The proposed repairs are adequate to remove the failure to 
conform or imminent safety hazard that gave rise to the determination 
under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) The manufacturer corrects all affected manufactured homes within 
60 days of being informed that the request for waiver has been accepted. 
The formal plan and notification requirements are waived pending final 
resolution of a waiver request under this paragraph (f) as of the date 
of such a request. If a waiver request is not accepted, the plan called 
for by paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted within 5 days 
after the manufacturer is notified that the request was not accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.405  SAA responsibilities.

    (a) As set out at Sec. 3282.302(b)(5), each SAA is responsible for 
overseeing the handling of consumer complaints by manufacturers within 
the state. As part of that responsibility, the SAA is required to 
monitor manufacturer compliance with this subpart, and particularly with 
Sec. 3282.404. This monitoring will be done primarily by periodically 
checking the records that manufacturers are required to keep under 
Sec. 3282.404(b).
    (b) If the SAA acting under paragraph (a) finds that a manufacturer 
has failed to comply with Sec. 3282.404, or if the SAA finds that the 
manufacturer has decided not to act under Sec. 3282.404(c) where the SAA 
believes the manufacturer is required to act, or if the manufacturer 
failed to fulfill the requirements of Sec. 3282.404(f) after requesting 
a waiver under that paragraph, the SAA shall make such preliminary 
determinations as it deems appropriate under Sec. 3282.407(b), except 
that if the affected manufactured homes were manufactured in more than 
one state or if it appears that the appropriate preliminary 
determination would be an imminent safety hazard or serious defect, the 
SAA shall refer the matter to the Secretary.
    (c) Where an SAA that is reviewing a plan under Sec. 3282.404(c) 
finds that the manufacturer is not acting reasonably in refusing to 
accept changes to a proposed plan, the SAA shall make such preliminary 
determinations as may be appropriate under Sec. 3282.407, except that 
where it appears that it would be appropriate to make a preliminary 
determination of imminent safety hazard or serious defect, the SAA shall 
refer the matter to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.406  Required manufacturer correction.

    A manufacturer required to furnish notification under Sec. 3282.404 
or Sec. 3282.407 shall correct, at its expense, any imminent safety 
hazard or serious defect that can be related to an error in design or 
assembly of the manufactured home by the manufacturer, including an 
error in design or assembly of any component or system incorporated in 
the manufactured home by the manufacturer.

[[Page 239]]


<R05>
Sec. 3282.407  Notification and correction pursuant to administrative determination.

    (a) Preliminary determinations. (1) Whenever the Secretary has 
information indicating the possible existence of an imminent safety 
hazard or serious defect in a manufactured home, the Secretary may issue 
a preliminary determination to that effect to the manufacturer.
    (2) Whenever the information referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section indicates that the manufacturer is required to correct the 
imminent safety hazard or serious defect under Sec. 3282.406, the 
Secretary may issue a preliminary determination to that effect to the 
manufacturer.
    (3) Whenever an SAA has information indicating that a defect or 
noncompliance may exist in a class of manufactured homes that is 
identifiable because the cause of the defect or noncompliance is such 
that the same defect or noncompliance would probably have been 
systematically introduced into more than one manufactured home during 
the course of production, and all manufactured homes in the class appear 
to have been manufactured in that State, the SAA may issue a preliminary 
determination of defect or noncompliance to the manufacturer. 
Information on which an SAA may base a conclusion that an appropriate 
class of manufactured homes exists may include, but is not limited to, 
complaints that can be traced to the same cause, defects known to exist 
in supplies of components or parts, information related to the 
performance of a particular employee, and information indicating a 
failure to follow quality control procedures with respect to a 
particular aspect of the manufactured home. If, during the course of 
these proceedings, evidence arises that indicates that manufactured 
homes in the same identifiable class were manufactured in more than one 
state, the SAA shall refer the matter to the Secretary. The Secretary 
may make a preliminary determination of noncompliance or defect where 
there is evidence that a noncompliance or defect may exist.
    (b) Notice and request for presentation of views and evidence. (1) 
Notice of the preliminary determination shall be sent by certified mail 
and shall include:
    (i) The factual basis for the determination and
    (ii) The identifying criteria of the manufactured homes known to be 
affected and those believed to be in the class of possibly affected 
manufactured homes.
    (2) The notice shall inform the manufacturer that the preliminary 
determination shall become final unless the manufacturer requests a 
hearing or presentation of views under subpart D of this part within 15 
days of receipt of a Notice of Preliminary Determination of serious 
defect, defect, or noncompliance, or within 5 days of receipt of a 
Notice of Preliminary Determination of imminent safety hazard.
    (3) Promptly upon receipt of a manufacturer's request, a Formal or 
an Informal Presentation of Views shall be held in accordance with 
Sec. 3282.152.
    (4) Parties may propose in writing, at any time, offers of 
settlement which shall be submitted to and considered by the Secretary 
or the SAA that issued the Notice of Preliminary Determination. If 
determined to be appropriate, the party making the offer may be given an 
opportunity to make an oral presentation in support of such offer. If an 
offer of settlement is rejected, the party making the offer shall be so 
notified and the offer shall be deemed withdrawn and shall not 
constitute a part of the record in the proceeding. Final acceptance by 
the Secretary or an SAA of any offer to settlement shall automatically 
terminate any proceedings related thereto.
    (c) Final determinations. (1) If the manufacturer fails to respond 
to the notice of preliminary determination within the time period 
established in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or if the SAA or the 
Secretary decides that the views and evidence presented by the 
manufacturer or others are insufficient to rebut the preliminary 
determination, the SAA or the Secretary, as appropriate, shall make a 
final determination that an imminent safety hazard, serious defect, 
defect, or noncompliance exists. In the event of a final determination 
that an imminent safety hazard, serious defect, defect or noncompliance 
exists, the SAA or the

[[Page 240]]

Secretary shall issue an order directing the manufacturer to furnish 
notification. If the Secretary makes a final determination that the 
manufacturer is required to correct, the Secretary shall issue an order 
directing the manufacturer to provide correction.
    (2) Appeals. When an SAA has made a final determination that a 
defect or noncompliance exists, the manufacturer may, within 10 days 
after receipt of the notice of such final determination, appeal to the 
Secretary under Sec. 3282.309.
    (d) Where a preliminary determination of defect or noncompliance has 
been issued, the manufacturer may, at any time during the proceedings 
called for in this section or after the issuance of a Final 
Determination and Order, request a waiver of the formal notification 
requirements. The manufacturer may request such a waiver from the SAA 
that is handling the proceedings, or if the Secretary is handling the 
proceedings, from the Secretary. When requesting such a waiver, the 
manufacturer shall certify and provide assurances that:
    (1) The manufacturer has identified the class of possibly affected 
manufactured homes in accordance with Sec. 3282.409;
    (2) The manufacturer will correct, at the manufacturer's expense, 
all affected manufactured homes in the class within a time period 
specified by the SAA or the Secretary but not later than 60 days after 
being informed of the acceptance of the request for waiver or issuance 
of the Final Determination, whichever is later; and
    (3) The proposed repairs are adequate to remove the failure to 
conform or imminent safety hazard that gave rise to the issuance of the 
Preliminary Determination.

The SAA or the Secretary may grant the request for waiver if the 
manufacturer agrees under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to an offer 
of settlement that includes an order that embodies the assurances made 
by the manufacturer.

<R05>
Sec. 3282.408  Reimbursement for prior correction by owner.

    A manufacturer that is required to correct under Sec. 3282.406 or 
that decides to correct and obtain a waiver under Sec. 3282.404(f) or 
Sec. 3282.407(d) shall provide reimbursement for reasonable cost of 
correction to any owner of an affected manufactured home who chose to 
make the correction before the manufacturer did so.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.409  Manufacturer's plan for notification and correction.

    (a) This section sets out the requirements that shall be met by 
manufacturers in preparing plans they are required to submit under 
Sec. 3282.404(c). The underlying requirement is that the plan show how 
the manufacturer will fulfill its responsibilities with respect to 
notification and correction that arise under this subpart I.
    (b) The plan shall include a copy of the proposed notice that meets 
the requirements of Sec. 3282.410.
    (c) The plan shall identify, by serial number and other appropriate 
identifying criteria, all manufactured homes with respect to which 
notification is to be provided. The class of manufactured homes with 
respect to which notification shall be provided and which shall be 
covered by the plan is that class of homes that was or is suspected of 
having been affected by the cause of an imminent safety hazard or 
failure to conform. The class is identifiable to the extent that the 
cause of the imminent safety hazard or failure to conform is such that 
it would probably have been systematically introduced into the 
manufactured homes in the class during the course of production. In 
determining the extent of such a class, the manufacturer may rely either 
upon information that positively identifies the extent of the class or 
upon information that indicates what manufactured homes were not 
affected by the same cause, thereby identifying the class by excluding 
those manufactured homes. Methods that may be used in determining the 
extent of the class of manufactured homes include, but are not limited 
to:
    (1) Inspection of manufactured homes produced before and after the 
manufactured homes known to be affected;

[[Page 241]]

    (2) Inspection of manufacturer quality control records to determine 
whether quality control procedures were followed;
    (3) Inspection of IPIA records to determine whether the imminent 
safety hazard or failure to conform was either detected or specifically 
found not to exist in some manufactured homes;
    (4) Inspection of the design of the manufactured home in question to 
determine whether the imminent safety hazard or failure to conform 
resulted from the design itself;
    (5) Identification of the cause as relating to a particular employee 
or process that was employed for a known period of time or in producing 
the manufactured homes manufactured during that time;
    (6) Inspection of records relating to components supplied by other 
parties and known to contain or suspected of containing imminent safety 
hazards or failures to conform.

The class of manufactured homes identified by these methods may include 
only manufactured homes actually affected by the imminent safety hazard 
or failure to conform if the manufacturer can identify the precise 
manufactured homes. If it is not possible to identify the precise 
manufactured homes, the class shall include manufactured homes suspected 
of containing the imminent safety hazard or failure to conform because 
the evidence shows that they may have been affected.
    (d) The plan shall include a statement by the IPIA operating in each 
plant in which manufactured homes in question were produced. In this 
statement, the IPIA shall concur in the methods used by the manufacturer 
to determine the class of potentially affected manufactured homes or 
state why it believes the methods to have been inappropriate, 
inadequate, or incorrect.
    (e) The plan shall include a deadline for completion of all 
notifications and corrections.
    (f) The plan shall provide for notification to be accomplished:
    (1) By certified mail or other more expeditious means to the dealers 
or distributors of such manufacturer to whom such manufactured home was 
delivered. Where a serious defect or imminent safety hazard is involved, 
notification shall be sent by certified mail if it is mailed; and
    (2) By certified mail to the first purchaser of each manufactured 
home in the class of manufactured homes set out in the plan under 
paragraph (c) of this section, and to any subsequent owner to whom any 
warranty provided by the manufacturer or required by Federal, State or 
local law on such manufactured home has been transferred, to the extent 
feasible, except that notification need not be sent to any person known 
by the manufacturer not to own the manufactured home in question if the 
manufacturer has a record of a subsequent owner of the manufactured 
home; and
    (3) By certified mail to any other person who is a registered owner 
of each manufactured home containing the imminent safety hazard, serious 
defect, defect, or noncompliance and whose name has been ascertained 
pursuant to Sec. 3282.211.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.410  Contents of notice.

    Except as otherwise agreed by the Secretary or the SAA reviewing the 
plan under Sec. 3282.404(c), the notification to be sent by the 
manufacturer shall include the following:
    (a) An opening statement: ``This notice is sent to you in accordance 
with the requirments of the National Manufactured Housing Construction 
and Safety Standards Act.''
    (b) Except where the manufacturer is acting under Sec. 3282.404, the 
following statement, as appropriate: ``(Manufacturer's name or the 
Secretary, or the appropriate SAA)'' has determined that:
    (1) An imminent safety hazard may exist in (identifying criteria of 
manufactured home).
    (2) A serious defect may exist in (identifying criteria of 
manufactured home).
    (3) A defect may exist in (identifying criteria of manufactured 
home).
    (4) (Identifying criteria of manufactured home) may not comply with 
an applicable ``Federal Home Construction or Safety Standard.''

[[Page 242]]

    (c) A clear description of the imminent safety hazard, serious 
defect, defect, or noncompliance which shall include:
    (1) The location of the imminent safety hazard, serious defect, 
defect, or noncompliance in the manufactured home;
    (2) A description of any hazards, malfunctions, deterioration or 
other consequences which may result from the imminent safety hazard, 
serious defect, defect, or noncompliance;
    (3) A statement of the conditions which may cause such consequences 
to arise; and
    (4) Precautions, if any, that the owner should take to reduce the 
chance that the consequences will arise before the manufactured home is 
repaired.
    (d) An evaluation of the risk to manufactured home occupants' safety 
and the durability of the manufactured home reasonably related to such 
imminent safety hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance, 
including:
    (1) The type of injury which may occur to occupants of the 
manufactured home; and
    (2) Whether there will be any warning that a dangerous occurrence 
may take place and what that warning would be, and any signs which the 
owner might see, hear, smell, or feel which might indicate danger or 
deterioration of the manufactured home as a result of the imminent 
safety hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance.
    (e) If the manufacturer will correct the manufactured home under 
this subpart or otherwise, a statement that the manufacturer will 
correct the manufactured home.
    (f) A statement in accordance with whichever of the following is 
appropriate:
    (1) Where the manufacturer will correct the manufactured home at no 
cost to the owner, the statement shall indicate how and when the 
correction will be done, how long the correction will take, and any 
other information that may be helpful to the owner.
    (2) When the manufacturer does not bear the cost of repair, the 
notification shall include a detailed description of all parts and 
materials needed to make the correction, a description of all steps to 
be followed in making the correction including appropriate 
illustrations, and an estimate of the cost of the purchaser or owner of 
the correction.
    (g) A statement informing the owner that the owner may submit a 
complaint to the Secretary if the owner believes that:
    (1) The notification or the remedy described therein is inadequate; 
or
    (2) The manufacturer has failed or is unable to remedy the problem 
in accordance with his notification; or
    (3) The manufacturer has failed or is unable to remedy within a 
reasonable time after the owner's first attempt to obtain remedy.
    (h) A statement that any actions taken by the manufacturer under the 
Act in no way limit the rights of the owner or any other person under 
any contract or other applicable law and that the owner may have further 
rights under contract or other applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.411  Time for implementation.

    (a) The manufacturer shall complete implementation of the plan for 
correction approved under Sec. 3282.404(d) on or before the deadline 
established in the plan as required by Sec. 3282.409(e). The deadline 
shall allow a reasonable amount of time to complete the plan, taking 
into account the seriousness of the problem, the number of manufactured 
homes involved, the immediacy of any risk, and the difficulty of 
completing the action. The seriousness and immediacy of any risk shall 
be given greater weight than other considerations. If a manufacturer is 
required to correct an imminent safety hazard or serious defect under 
Sec. 3282.406, the deadline shall be no later than 60 days after 
approval of the plan.
    (b) The manufacturer shall complete the implementation of any 
notifications and corrections being carried out under an order of an SAA 
or the Secretary under Sec. 3282.407(c) on or before the deadline 
established in the order. In establishing each deadline, an SAA or the 
Secretary shall allow a reasonable time to complete all notifications 
and corrections, taking into account the seriousness of the imminent 
safety hazard, serious defect, defect or noncompliance, the number of 
manufactured homes involved, the location of

[[Page 243]]

the homes, and the extent of correction required, except that in no case 
shall the time allowed exceed the following limits:
    (1) In the case of a Final Determination of imminent safety hazard, 
30 days after the issuance of the Final Determination.
    (2) In the case of a Final Determination of serious defect, defect 
or noncompliance, 60 days after the issuance of the Final Determination.
    (c) An SAA that approved a plan or is handling a proceeding or the 
Secretary may grant an extension of the deadlines included in a plan or 
order if the manufacturer requests such an extension in writing and 
shows good cause for the extension, and the SAA or the Secretary is 
satisfied that the extension is justified in the public interest. When 
the Secretary grants an extension, the Secretary shall notify the 
manufacturer and shall publish notice of such extension in the Federal 
Register. When an SAA grants an extension, the SAA shall notify the 
manufacturer, and forward to the Secretary a draft notice of the 
extension to be published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.412  Completion of remedial actions and report.

    (a) Where a manufacturer is required to provide notification under 
this subpart, the manufacturer shall maintain in its files for five 
years from the date the notification campaign is completed a copy of the 
notice sent and a complete list of the people and their addresses. The 
files referred to in this section shall be organized such that each 
notification and correction campaign can be readily identified and 
reviewed by an SAA or the Secretary.
    (b) Where a manufacturer is required to provide correction under 
Sec. 3282.406 or where the manufacturer otherwise corrects under 
Sec. 3282.404(f) or Sec. 3282.407(d), the manufacturer shall maintain in 
its files, for five years from the date the correction campaign is 
completed, one of the following, as appropriate, for each manufactured 
home involved.
    (1) Where the correction is made, a certification by the 
manufacturer that the repair was made to satisfy completely the 
standards in effect at the time the manufactured home was manufactured 
and that any imminent safety hazard has been eliminated, or
    (2) Where the owner refuses to allow the manufacturer to repair the 
home, a certification by the manufacturer that the owner has been 
informed of the problem which may exist in the manufactured home, that 
the owner has been informed of any risk to safety or durability of the 
manufactured home which may result from the problem, and that an attempt 
has been made to repair the problems only to have the owner refuse the 
repair.
    (c) If any actions taken under this subpart are not adequate under 
the approved plan or an order of the Secretary or an SAA, the 
manufacturer may be required to provide additional notifications or 
corrections to satisfy the plan or order.
    (d) If, in the course of making corrections under any of the 
provisions of this subpart, the manufacturer creates an imminent safety 
hazard or serious defect, the manufacturer shall correct the imminent 
safety hazard or serious defect under Sec. 3282.406.
    (e) The manufacturer shall, within 30 days after the deadline for 
completing any notifications and, where required, corrections, under an 
approved plan or under an order of an SAA or the Secretary, or any 
corrections required to obtain a waiver under Sec. 3282.404(f) or 
Sec. 3282.407(d), provide a complete report of the action taken to the 
SAA or the Secretary that approved the plan under Sec. 3282.404(d), 
granted the waiver, or issued the order under Sec. 3282.407(c), and to 
any other SAA or the Secretary that forwarded a relevant complaint or 
information to the manufacturer under Sec. 3282.403.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.413  Replacement or repurchase of manufactured home from purchaser.

    (a) Whenever an imminent safety hazard or serious defect which must 
be corrected by the manufacturer at his expense under Sec. 3282.407 
cannot be repaired within 60 days in accordance with section 615(i) of 
the Act, the Secretary may require:
    (1) That the manufactured home be replaced by the manufacturer with 
a manufactured home substantially equal in size, equipment, and quality,

[[Page 244]]

and either new or in the same condition the defective manufactured home 
would have been in at the time of discovery of the imminent safety 
hazard or serious defect had the imminent safety hazard or serious 
defect not existed; or
    (2) That the manufacturer take possession of the manufactured home 
and refund the purchase price in full, less a reasonable allowance for 
depreciation based on actual use if the home has been in the possession 
of the owner for more than one year. Such depreciation shall be based 
upon an appraisal system approved by the Secretary, and shall not take 
into account damage or deterioration resulting from the imminent safety 
hazard or serious defect.
    (b) In determining whether to order replacement or refund by the 
manufacturer, the Secretary shall consider:
    (1) The threat of injury or death to manufactured home occupants;
    (2) Any costs and inconvenience to manufactured home owners which 
will result from the lack of adequate repair within the specified 
period;
    (3) The expense to the manufacturer;
    (4) Any obligations imposed on the manufacturer under contract or 
other applicable law of which the Secretary has knowledge; and
    (5) Any other relevant factors which may be brought to the attention 
of the Secretary.
    (c) In those situations where, under contract or other applicable 
law, the owner has the right of election between replacement and refund, 
the manufacturer shall inform the owner of such right of election and 
shall inform the Secretary of the election, if any, by the owner.
    (d) This section applies where an attempted correction of an 
imminent safety hazard or serious defect relieves the safety problem but 
does not bring the home in conformity to the standards.
    (e) Where replacement or refund by the manufacturer is ordered under 
this section, it shall be carried out within 30 days of the Secretary's 
order to replace the manufactured home or refund the purchase price 
unless the Secretary, for good cause shown, grants an extension of time 
for implementation of such order and publishes notice of extension in 
the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.414  Manufactured homes in the hands of dealers and distributors.

    (a) The manufacturer is responsible for correcting any failures to 
conform and imminent safety hazards which exist in manufactured homes 
which have been sold or otherwise released to a distributor or dealer 
but which have not yet been sold to a purchaser. This responsibility 
generally does not extend to failures to conform or imminent safety 
hazards that result solely from transit damage that occurs after the 
manufactured home leaves the control of the manufacturer, unless such 
transit damage is reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer when the 
home is released by the manufacturer. This section sets out the 
procedures to be followed by dealers and distributors for handling 
manufactured homes in such cases. Regardless of whether the manufacturer 
is responsible for repairing a manufactured home, no dealer or 
distributor may sell a manufactured home if it contains a failure to 
conform or an imminent safety hazard.
    (b) Whenever a dealer or distributor finds a problem in a 
manufactured home which the manufacturer is responsible for correcting 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the dealer or distributor shall 
contact the manufacturer, provide full information concerning the 
problem, and request appropriate action by the manufacturer in accord 
with paragraph (c) of this section. Where the manufacturer agrees to 
correct, the manufacturer shall maintain a complete record of its 
actions. Where the manufacturer authorizes the dealer to make the 
necessary corrections on a reimbursable basis, the dealer or distributor 
shall maintain a complete record of its actions. Agreement by the 
manufacturer to correct or to authorize corrections on a reimbursable 
basis under this paragraph constitutes a determination of the Secretary 
for purposes of section 613(b) of the Act with respect to judicial 
review of the amount which the manufacturer agrees to reimburse the 
dealer or distributor for corrections.
    (c) Upon a final determination by the Secretary or a State 
Administration

[[Page 245]]

Agency under Sec. 3282.407, or upon a determination by a court of 
competent jurisdiction that a manufactured home fails to conform to the 
standard or contains an imminent safety hazard after such manufactured 
home is sold or otherwise released by a manufacturer to a distributor or 
a dealer and prior to the sale of such manufactured home by such 
distributor or dealer to a purchaser, the manufacturer shall have the 
option to either:
    (1) Immediately furnish, at the manufacturer's expense, to the 
purchasing distributor or dealer the required conforming part or parts 
or equipment for installation by the distributor or dealer on or in such 
manufactured home, and the manufacturer shall reimburse such distributor 
or dealer for the reasonable value of such installation plus a 
reasonable reimbursement of not less than one per centum per month of 
the manufacturer's or distributor's selling price prorated from the date 
of receipt by certified mail of notice of noncompliance to the date such 
manufactured home is brought into compliance with the standards, so long 
as the distributor or dealer proceeds with reasonable diligence with the 
installation after the part or component is received; or
    (2) Immediately repurchase, at the manufacturer's expense, such 
manufactured home from such distributor or dealer at the price paid by 
such distributor or dealer, plus all transportation charges involved and 
a reasonable reimbursement of not less than one per centum per month of 
such price paid prorated from the date of receipt by certified mail of 
notice of the imminent safety hazard, serious defect, defect or 
noncompliance to the distributor. The value of such reasonable 
reimbursements as specified in this paragraph shall be fixed by mutual 
agreement of the parties or by a court in an action brought under 
section 613(b) of the Act.
    (d) This section shall not apply to any manufactured home purchased 
by a dealer or distributor which has been leased by such dealer or 
distributor to a tenant for purposes other than resale. In that instance 
the dealer or distributor has the remedies available to a purchaser 
under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.415  Notices, bulletins and other communications.

    Each manufacturer shall, at the time of dispatch, furnish to the 
Secretary a true or representative copy of all notices, bulletins, and 
other written communications to the dealers or distributors of such 
manufacturer or purchasers or owners of manufactured homes of such 
manufacturers regarding any serious defect or imminent safety hazard 
which may exist in any such manufactured homes produced by such 
manufacturer. Manufacturers shall keep complete records of all other 
communications with dealers, owners, and purchasers regarding 
noncompliances, and defects.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.416  Supervision of notification and correction actions.

    (a) The IPIA in each manufacturing plant shall be responsible for 
assuring that notifications are sent to all owners, purchasers, dealers, 
or distributors of whom the manufacturer has knowledge under 
Sec. 3282.211 or otherwise as required by these regulations, and the 
IFIA shall be responsible for assuring that the required corrections are 
carried out by auditing the certificates required by Sec. 3282.412.
    (b) The SAA or Secretary to which the report required by 
Sec. 3282.412(e) is sent shall be responsible for assuring through 
oversight that remedial actions described in the report have been 
carried out as described in the report.
    (c) The SAA of the state in which an affected manufactured home is 
located may inspect that manufactured home to determine whether any 
required correction is carried out to the approved plan or, if there is 
no plan, to the standards or other approval obtained by the 
manufacturer.


<R04>
          Subpart J--Monitoring of Primary Inspection Agencies


<R05>
Sec. 3282.451  General.

    The actions of all primary inspection agencies accepted under 
subpart H shall be monitored by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent 
to determine whether the PIAs are fulfilling their responsibilities 
under these regulations. This monitoring shall be carried

[[Page 246]]

out primarily through joint monitoring teams made up of personnel 
supplied by SAAs and by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent. 
Monitoring parties shall make recommendations to the Secretary with 
respect to final acceptance of PIAs under Secs. 3282.361(e) and 
3282.362(e), continued acceptance, and disqualification or 
requalification under Sec. 3282.356, and with respect to any changes 
which PIAs should make in their operations in order to continue to be 
approved. Based on this monitoring, the Secretary shall determine 
whether PIAs should continue to be approved under these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.452  Participation in monitoring.

    (a) Joint monitoring teams. (1) The Secretary or the Secretary's 
agent shall develop and coordinate joint monitoring teams which shall be 
made up of qualified personnel provided by SAAs and by the Secretary or 
the Secretary's agent. The Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall 
determine whether personnel are qualified based on education or 
experience.
    (2) The joint monitoring teams will operate generally on a regional 
basis. To the extent possible, the teams shall be so scheduled that 
personnel provided by an SAA will be monitoring operations in 
manufactured home plants from which manufactured homes are shipped into 
their State.
    (3) Personnel from an SAA shall not participate on joint monitoring 
teams operating within their State.
    (4) States are encouraged but not required to participate on joint 
monitoring teams.
    (b) State monitoring. A State may carry out monitoring of IPIA 
functions at plant facilities within the State if the State is not 
acting as an IPIA. Where a State wishes to carry out monitoring 
activities it shall do so in coordination with the Secretary and the 
Secretary's agent. To the extent that the State is performing adequate 
monitoring, the frequency of the joint team monitoring may be reduced to 
one visit per year consistent with the requirements of Sec. 3282.453.
    (c) Review of staff capability. The monitoring party shall review 
the capability of the PIA's staff to perform the functions it is 
required to perform.
    (d) Review of interpretations. The monitoring party shall review all 
records of interpretations of the standards made by the PIA to determine 
whether they are consistent and to determine whether there are any 
conflicts which should be referred to the Secretary for determination.
    (e) DAPIA. Monitoring parties shall review on a random basis at 
least 10 percent of the design and quality assurance manual approvals 
made by each DAPIA in each year.
    (f) IPIA. The monitoring parties shall assure that the IPIAs are 
carrying out all of the functions for which they have been accepted. In 
particular, they shall assure that the manufacturing process is as 
stated in the certification reports, that the IPIAs are carrying out the 
required number of inspections, that inspections are effective, and that 
the IPIAs are maintaining complete label control as required by 
Sec. 3282.362. A monitoring team shall monitor the IPIA's office 
procedures, files, and label control and the monitoring team shall send 
copies of its report to the Secretary or the Secretary's agent, which 
shall send copies to all monitoring teams which monitor the operations 
of the subject IPIA.
    (g) Remedial actions. The monitoring parties shall review the 
remedial action records of the manufacturers and of the primary 
inspection agencies closely to determine whether the primary inspection 
agencies have been carrying out their responsibilities with respect to 
remedial actions.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.453  Frequency and extent of monitoring.

    (a) The actions of all primary inspection agencies shall be 
monitored at a frequency adequate to assure that they are performing 
consistently and fulfilling their responsibilities under these 
regulations. Every aspect of the primary inspection agencies' 
performance shall be monitored.
    (b) Frequency of monitoring. The performance of each primary 
inspection agency shall be monitored during its period of provisional 
acceptance by a complete review of its records and, in the case of IPAs, 
by a complete inspection of the operations of at least one

[[Page 247]]

manufacturing plant which it has approved or in which it is operating. 
After the initial inspection, the performance of each primary inspection 
agency shall be monitored four times per year, except that the number of 
monitoring visits may be decreased to a minimum of one per year if the 
performance of the primary inspection agency is deemed by the Secretary 
or the Secretary's agent to be superior, and it may be increased as 
necessary if performance is suspect. There shall be a minimum of one 
review per year of the records of each primary inspection agency, and 
there shall be more reviews as needed.


<R04>
                    Subpart K--Departmental Oversight


<R05>
Sec. 3282.501  General.

    The Secretary shall oversee the performance of SAAs, the Secretary's 
agent, and primary inspection agencies as follows:
    (a) The Secretary shall review SAA reports to ensure that States are 
taking appropriate actions with regard to the enforcement of the 
standards and with respect to the functions for which they are approved 
under these regulations.
    (b) The Secretary shall review monitoring reports submitted by the 
Secretary's agent to determine that it is performing in accordance with 
the contract between it and the Secretary.
    (c) The Secretary shall review monitoring reports to determine 
whether PIAs are fulfilling their responsibilities under these 
regulations.
    (d) The Secretary shall make random visits for the purpose of 
overseeing the activities of SAAs and the Secretary's agent.
    (e) The Secretary shall take such other actions to oversee the 
system established by these regulations as it deems appropriate.
    (f) All records maintained by all parties acting under these 
regulations with respect to those actions shall be available to the 
Secretary, the Secretary's agent, and where appropriate, SAAs and PIAs 
for review at any reasonable time.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.502  Departmental implementation.

    To the extent that SAAs or any parties contracting with the 
Secretary do not perform functions called for under these regulations, 
those functions shall be carried out by the Secretary with its own 
personnel or through other appropriate parties.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.503  Determinations and hearings.

    The Secretary shall make all the determinations and hold such 
hearings as are required by these regulations, and the Secretary shall 
resolve all disputes arising under these regulations.


<R04>
              Subpart L--Manufacturer, IPIA and SAA Reports


<R05>
Sec. 3282.551  Scope and purpose.

    This subpart describes the reports which shall be submitted by 
manufacturers, PIAs and SAAs as part of the system of enforcement 
established under these regulations. Additional reports described in 
subpart I are required when corrective actions are taken under that 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.552  Manufacturer reports for joint monitoring fees.

    For each month, the manufacturer shall submit to the IPIA in each of 
its manufacturing plants a report that includes the serial numbers of 
each manufactured home manufactured at that plant during that preceding 
month, and the State of first location, after leaving the manufacturing 
plant, of such manufactured homes. The State of first location for the 
purpose of this report is the State of the premises of the distributor, 
dealer or purchaser to whom the manufactured home is first shipped. The 
report for each month shall be submitted by the tenth day of the 
following month.


<R05>
Sec. 3282.553  IPIA reports.

    Each IPIA shall submit by the twentieth day of each month to each 
SAA, or if no SAA to the Secretary, in each state where it is engaged in

<R05>
Sec. 3500.1  Designation.

    This part may be referred to as Regulation X.


<R05>
Sec. 3500.2  Definitions.

    (a) Statutory terms. All terms defined in RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602) are 
used in accordance with their statutory meaning unless otherwise defined 
in paragraph (b) of this section or elsewhere in this part.
    (b) Other terms. As used in this part:
    Application means the submission of a borrower's financial 
information in anticipation of a credit decision, whether written or 
computer-generated, relating to a federally related mortgage loan. If 
the submission does not state or identify a specific property, the 
submission is an application for a pre-qualification and not an 
application for a federally related mortgage loan under this part. The 
subsequent addition of an identified property to the submission converts 
the submission to

[[Page 249]]

an application for a federally related mortgage loan.
    Business day means a day on which the offices of the business entity 
are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of the entity's 
business functions.
    Dealer means, in the case of property improvement loans, a seller, 
contractor, or supplier of goods or services. In the case of 
manufactured home loans, ``dealer'' means one who engages in the 
business of manufactured home retail sales.
    Dealer loan or dealer consumer credit contract means, generally, any 
arrangement in which a dealer assists the borrower in obtaining a 
federally related mortgage loan from the funding lender and then assigns 
the dealer's legal interests to the funding lender and receives the net 
proceeds of the loan. The funding lender is the lender for the purposes 
of the disclosure requirements of this part. If a dealer is a 
``creditor'' as defined under the definition of ``federally related 
mortgage loan'' in this part, the dealer is the lender for purposes of 
this part.
    Effective date of transfer is defined in section 6(i)(1) of RESPA 
(12 U.S.C. 2605(i)(1)). In the case of a home equity conversion mortgage 
or reverse mortgage as referenced in this section, the effective date of 
transfer is the transfer date agreed upon by the transferee servicer and 
the transferor servicer.
    Federally related mortgage loan or mortgage loan means as follows:
    (1) Any loan (other than temporary financing, such as a construction 
loan):
    (i) That is secured by a first or subordinate lien on residential 
real property, including a refinancing of any secured loan on 
residential real property upon which there is either:
    (A) Located or, following settlement, will be constructed using 
proceeds of the loan, a structure or structures designed principally for 
occupancy of from one to four families (including individual units of 
condominiums and cooperatives and including any related interests, such 
as a share in the cooperative or right to occupancy of the unit); or
    (B) Located or, following settlement, will be placed using proceeds 
of the loan, a manufactured home; and
    (ii) For which one of the following paragraphs applies. The loan:
    (A) Is made in whole or in part by any lender that is either 
regulated by or whose deposits or accounts are insured by any agency of 
the Federal Government;
    (B) Is made in whole or in part, or is insured, guaranteed, 
supplemented, or assisted in any way:
    (1) By the Secretary or any other officer or agency of the Federal 
Government; or
    (2) Under or in connection with a housing or urban development 
program administered by the Secretary or a housing or related program 
administered by any other officer or agency of the Federal Government;
    (C) Is intended to be sold by the originating lender to the Federal 
National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage 
Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or its 
successors), or a financial institution from which the loan is to be 
purchased by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or its 
successors);
    (D) Is made in whole or in part by a ``creditor'', as defined in 
section 103(f) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 
1602(f)), that makes or invests in residential real estate loans 
aggregating more than $1,000,000 per year. For purposes of this 
definition, the term ``creditor'' does not include any agency or 
instrumentality of any State, and the term ``residential real estate 
loan'' means any loan secured by residential real property, including 
single-family and multifamily residential property;
    (E) Is originated either by a dealer or, if the obligation is to be 
assigned to any maker of mortgage loans specified in paragraphs (1)(ii) 
(A) through (D) of this definition, by a mortgage broker; or
    (F) Is the subject of a home equity conversion mortgage, also 
frequently called a ``reverse mortgage,'' issued by any maker of 
mortgage loans specified in paragraphs (1)(ii) (A) through (D) of this 
definition.
    (2) Any installment sales contract, land contract, or contract for 
deed on otherwise qualifying residential property is a federally related 
mortgage

[[Page 250]]

loan if the contract is funded in whole or in part by proceeds of a loan 
made by any maker of mortgage loans specified in paragraphs (1)(ii) (A) 
through (D) of this definition.
    (3) If the residential real property securing a mortgage loan is not 
located in a State, the loan is not a federally related mortgage loan.
    Good faith estimate means an estimate, prepared in accordance with 
section 5 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2604), of charges that a borrower is 
likely to incur in connection with a settlement.
    HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement (also HUD-1 or HUD-1A) means 
the statement that is prescribed by the Secretary in this part for 
setting forth settlement charges in connection with either the purchase 
or the refinancing (or other subordinate lien transaction) of 1- to 4-
family residential property.
    Lender means, generally, the secured creditor or creditors named in 
the debt obligation and document creating the lien. For loans originated 
by a mortgage broker that closes a federally related mortgage loan in 
its own name in a table funding transaction, the lender is the person to 
whom the obligation is initially assigned at or after settlement. A 
lender, in connection with dealer loans, is the lender to whom the loan 
is assigned, unless the dealer meets the definition of creditor as 
defined under ``federally related mortgage loan'' in this section. See 
also Sec. 3500.5(b)(7), secondary market transactions.
    Managerial employee means an employee of a settlement service 
provider who does not routinely deal directly with consumers, and who 
either hires, directs, assigns, promotes, or rewards other employees or 
independent contractors, or is in a position to formulate, determine, or 
influence the policies of the employer. Neither the term ``managerial 
employee'' nor the term ``employee'' includes independent contractors, 
but a managerial employee may hold a real estate brokerage or agency 
license.
    Manufactured home is defined in Sec. 3280.2 of this title.
    Mortgage broker means a person (not an employee or exclusive agent 
of a lender) who brings a borrower and lender together to obtain a 
federally related mortgage loan, and who renders services as described 
in the definition of ``settlement services'' in this section. A loan 
correspondent approved under Sec. 202.8 of this title for Federal 
Housing Administration programs is a mortgage broker for purposes of 
this part.
    Mortgaged property means the real property that is security for the 
federally related mortgage loan.
    Person is defined in section 3(5) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602(5)).
    Public Guidance Documents means documents that HUD has published in 
the Federal Register, and that it may amend from time-to-time by 
publication in the Federal Register. These documents are also available 
from HUD at the address indicated in 24 CFR 3500.3.
    Refinancing means a transaction in which an existing obligation that 
was subject to a secured lien on residential real property is satisfied 
and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower and 
with the same or a new lender. The following shall not be treated as a 
refinancing, even when the existing obligation is satisfied and replaced 
by a new obligation with the same lender (this definition of 
``refinancing'' as to transactions with the same lender is similar to 
Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.20(a)):
    (1) A renewal of a single payment obligation with no change in the 
original terms;
    (2) A reduction in the annual percentage rate as computed under the 
Truth in Lending Act with a corresponding change in the payment 
schedule;
    (3) An agreement involving a court proceeding;
    (4) A workout agreement, in which a change in the payment schedule 
or change in collateral requirements is agreed to as a result of the 
consumer's default or delinquency, unless the rate is increased or the 
new amount financed exceeds the unpaid balance plus earned finance 
charges and premiums for continuation of allowable insurance; and
    (5) The renewal of optional insurance purchased by the consumer that 
is added to an existing transaction, if disclosures relating to the 
initial purchase were provided.

[[Page 251]]

    Regulation Z means the regulations issued by the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 226) to implement the Federal 
Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and includes the 
Commentary on Regulation Z.
    Required use means a situation in which a person must use a 
particular provider of a settlement service in order to have access to 
some distinct service or property, and the person will pay for the 
settlement service of the particular provider or will pay a charge 
attributable, in whole or in part, to the settlement service. However, 
the offering of a package (or combination of settlement services) or the 
offering of discounts or rebates to consumers for the purchase of 
multiple settlement services does not constitute a required use. Any 
package or discount must be optional to the purchaser. The discount must 
be a true discount below the prices that are otherwise generally 
available, and must not be made up by higher costs elsewhere in the 
settlement process.
    RESPA means the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 
U.S.C. 2601 et seq.
    Servicer means the person responsible for the servicing of a 
mortgage loan (including the person who makes or holds a mortgage loan 
if such person also services the mortgage loan). The term does not 
include:
    (1) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the 
Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), in connection with assets acquired, 
assigned, sold, or transferred pursuant to section 13(c) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act or as receiver or conservator of an insured 
depository institution; and
    (2) The Federal National Mortgage Corporation (FNMA); the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac); the RTC; the FDIC; HUD, 
including the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) (including cases in which a 
mortgage insured under the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) 
is assigned to HUD); the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA); 
the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 (FmHA); and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in any case 
in which the assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing of the 
mortgage loan is preceded by termination of the contract for servicing 
the loan for cause, commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the 
servicer, or commencement of proceedings by the FDIC or RTC for 
conservatorship or receivership of the servicer (or an entity by which 
the servicer is owned or controlled).
    Servicing means receiving any scheduled periodic payments from a 
borrower pursuant to the terms of any mortgage loan, including amounts 
for escrow accounts under section 10 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2609), and 
making the payments to the owner of the loan or other third parties of 
principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the 
amounts received from the borrower as may be required pursuant to the 
terms of the mortgage servicing loan documents or servicing contract. In 
the case of a home equity conversion mortgage or reverse mortgage as 
referenced in this section, servicing includes making payments to the 
borrower.
    Settlement means the process of executing legally binding documents 
regarding a lien on property that is subject to a federally related 
mortgage loan. This process may also be called ``closing'' or ``escrow'' 
in different jurisdictions.
    Settlement service means any service provided in connection with a 
prospective or actual settlement, including, but not limited to, any one 
or more of the following:
    (1) Origination of a federally related mortgage loan (including, but 
not limited to, the taking of loan applications, loan processing, and 
the underwriting and funding of such loans);
    (2) Rendering of services by a mortgage broker (including 
counseling, taking of applications, obtaining verifications and 
appraisals, and other loan processing and origination services, and 
communicating with the borrower and lender);
    (3) Provision of any services related to the origination, processing 
or funding of a federally related mortgage loan;

[[Page 252]]

    (4) Provision of title services, including title searches, title 
examinations, abstract preparation, insurability determinations, and the 
issuance of title commitments and title insurance policies;
    (5) Rendering of services by an attorney;
    (6) Preparation of documents, including notarization, delivery, and 
recordation;
    (7) Rendering of credit reports and appraisals;
    (8) Rendering of inspections, including inspections required by 
applicable law or any inspections required by the sales contract or 
mortgage documents prior to transfer of title;
    (9) Conducting of settlement by a settlement agent and any related 
services;
    (10) Provision of services involving mortgage insurance;
    (11) Provision of services involving hazard, flood, or other 
casualty insurance or homeowner's warranties;
    (12) Provision of services involving mortgage life, disability, or 
similar insurance designed to pay a mortgage loan upon disability or 
death of a borrower, but only if such insurance is required by the 
lender as a condition of the loan;
    (13) Provision of services involving real property taxes or any 
other assessments or charges on the real property;
    (14) Rendering of services by a real estate agent or real estate 
broker; and
    (15) Provision of any other services for which a settlement service 
provider requires a borrower or seller to pay.
    Special information booklet means the booklet prepared by the 
Secretary pursuant to section 5 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2604) to help 
persons understand the nature and costs of settlement services. The 
Secretary publishes the form of the special information booklet in the 
Federal Register. The Secretary may issue or approve additional booklets 
or alternative booklets by publication of a Notice in the Federal 
Register.
    State means any State of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or 
possession of the United States.
    Table funding means a settlement at which a loan is funded by a 
contemporaneous advance of loan funds and an assignment of the loan to 
the person advancing the funds. A table-funded transaction is not a 
secondary market transaction (see Sec. 3500.5(b)(7)).
    Title company means any institution, or its duly authorized agent, 
that is qualified to issue title insurance.

Sec. 3500.3  Questions or suggestions from public and copies of public guidance documents.

    Any questions or suggestions from the public regarding RESPA, or 
requests for copies of HUD Public Guidance Documents, should be directed 
to the Director, Office of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 
20410-8000, rather than to HUD field offices. Legal questions may be 
directed to the Assistant General Counsel, GSE/RESPA Division, at this 
address.


<R05>
Sec. 3500.4  Reliance upon rule, regulation or interpretation by HUD.

    (a) Rule, regulation or interpretation. (1) For purposes of sections 
19 (a) and (b) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2617 (a) and (b)) only the following 
constitute a rule, regulation or interpretation of the Secretary:
    (i) All provisions, including appendices, of this part. Any other 
document referred to in this part is not incorporated in this part 
unless it is specifically set out in this part;
    (ii) Any other document that is published in the Federal Register by 
the Secretary and states that it is an ``interpretation,'' 
``interpretive rule,'' ``commentary,'' or a ``statement of policy'' for 
purposes of section 19(a) of RESPA. Such documents will be prepared by 
HUD staff and counsel. Such documents may be revoked or amended by a 
subsequent document published in the Federal Register by the Secretary.

[[Page 253]]

    (2) A ``rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the 
Secretary'' for purposes of section 19(b) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2617(b)) 
shall not include the special information booklet prescribed by the 
Secretary or any other statement or issuance, whether oral or written, 
by an officer or representative of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD), letter or memorandum by the Secretary, General 
Counsel, any Assistant Secretary or other officer or employee of HUD, 
preamble to a regulation or other issuance of HUD, Public Guidance 
Document, report to Congress, pleading, affidavit or other document in 
litigation, pamphlet, handbook, guide, telegraphic communication, 
explanation, instructions to forms, speech or other material of any 
nature which is not specifically included in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) Unofficial interpretations; staff discretion. In response to 
requests for interpretation of matters not adequately covered by this 
part or by an official interpretation issued under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section, unofficial staff interpretations may be provided at the 
discretion of HUD staff or counsel. Written requests for such 
interpretations should be directed to the address indicated in 
Sec. 3500.3. Such interpretations provide no protection under section 
19(b) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2617(b)). Ordinarily, staff or counsel will 
not issue unofficial interpretations on matters adequately covered by 
this part or by official interpretations or commentaries issued under 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (c) All informal counsel's opinions and staff interpretations issued 
before November 2, 1992, were withdrawn as of that date. Courts and 
administrative agencies, however, may use previous opinions to determine 
the validity of conduct under the previous Regulation X.


<R05>
Sec. 3500.5  Coverage of RESPA.

    (a) Applicability. RESPA and this part apply to all federally 
related mortgage loans, except for the exemptions provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (b) Exemptions. (1) A loan on property of 25 acres or more.
    (2) Business purpose loans. An extension of credit primarily for a 
business, commercial, or agricultural purpose, as defined by Regulation 
Z, 12 CFR 226.3(a)(1). Persons may rely on Regulation Z in determining 
whether the exemption applies.
    (3) Temporary financing. Temporary financing, such as a construction 
loan. The exemption for temporary financing does not apply to a loan 
made to finance construction of 1- to 4-family residential property if 
the loan is used as, or may be converted to, permanent financing by the 
same lender or is used to finance transfer of title to the first user. 
If a lender issues a commitment for permanent financing, with or without 
conditions, the loan is covered by this part. Any construction loan for 
new or rehabilitated 1- to 4-family residential property, other than a 
loan to a bona fide builder (a person who regularly constructs 1- to 4-
family residential structures for sale or lease), is subject to this 
part if its term is for two years or more. A ``bridge loan'' or ``swing 
loan'' in which a lender takes a security interest in otherwise covered 
1- to 4-family residential property is not covered by RESPA and this 
part.
    (4) Vacant land. Any loan secured by vacant or unimproved property, 
unless within two years from the date of the settlement of the loan, a 
structure or a manufactured home will be constructed or placed on the 
real property using the loan proceeds. If a loan for a structure or 
manufactured home to be placed on vacant or unimproved property will be 
secured by a lien on that property, the transaction is covered by this 
part.
    (5) Assumption without lender approval. Any assumption in which the 
lender does not have the right expressly to approve a subsequent person 
as the borrower on an existing federally related mortgage loan. Any 
assumption in which the lender's permission is both required and 
obtained is covered by RESPA and this part, whether or not the lender 
charges a fee for the assumption.
    (6) Loan conversions. Any conversion of a federally related mortgage 
loan to different terms that are consistent with provisions of the 
original mortgage instrument, as long as a new note

[[Page 254]]

is not required, even if the lender charges an additional fee for the 
conversion.
    (7) Secondary market transactions. A bona fide transfer of a loan 
obligation in the secondary market is not covered by RESPA and this 
part, except as set forth in section 6 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2605) and 
Sec. 3500.21. In determining what constitutes a bona fide transfer, HUD 
will consider the real source of funding and the real interest of the 
funding lender. Mortgage broker transactions that are table-funded are 
not secondary market transactions. Neither the creation of a dealer loan 
or dealer consumer credit contract, nor the first assignment of such 
loan or contract to a lender, is a secondary market transaction (see 
Sec. 3500.2.)

[61 FR 13233, Mar. 26, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 58475, Nov. 15, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 3500.6  Special information booklet at time of loan application.

    (a) Lender to provide special information booklet. Subject to the 
exceptions set forth in this paragraph, the lender shall provide a copy 
of the special information booklet to a person from whom the lender 
receives, or for whom the lender prepares, a written application for a 
federally related mortgage loan. When two or more persons apply together 
for a loan, the lender is in compliance if the lender provides a copy of 
the booklet to one of the persons applying.
    (1) The lender shall provide the special information booklet by 
delivering it or placing it in the mail to the applicant not later than 
three business days (as that term is defined in Sec. 3500.2) after the 
application is received or prepared. However, if the lender denies the 
borrower's application for credit before the end of the three-business-
day period, then the lender need not provide the booklet to the 
borrower. If a borrower uses a mortgage broker, the mortgage broker 
shall distribute the special information booklet and the lender need not 
do so. The intent of this provision is that the applicant receive the 
special information booklet at the earliest possible date.
    (2) In the case of a federally related mortgage loan involving an 
open-ended credit plan, as defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(20) of Regulation Z 
(12 CFR), a lender or mortgage broker that provides the borrower with a 
copy of the brochure entitled ``When Your Home is On the Line: What You 
Should Know About Home Equity Lines of Credit'', or any successor 
brochure issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
is deemed to be in compliance with this section.
    (3) In the categories of transactions set forth at the end of this 
paragraph, the lender or mortgage broker does not have to provide the 
booklet to the borrower. Under the authority of section 19(a) of RESPA 
(12 U.S.C. 2617(a)), the Secretary may issue a revised or separate 
special information booklet that deals with these transactions, or the 
Secretary may chose to endorse the forms or booklets of other Federal 
agencies. In such an event, the requirements for delivery by lenders and 
the availability of the booklet or alternate materials for these 
transactions will be set forth in a Notice in the Federal Register. This 
paragraph shall apply to the following transactions:
    (i) Refinancing transactions;
    (ii) Closed-end loans, as defined in 12 CFR 226.2(a)(10) of 
Regulation Z, when the lender takes a subordinate lien;
    (iii) Reverse mortgages; and
    (iv) Any other federally related mortgage loan whose purpose is not 
the purchase of a 1- to 4-family residential property.
    (b) Revision. The Secretary may from time to time revise the special 
information booklet by publishing a notice in the Federal Register.
    (c) Reproduction. The special information booklet may be reproduced 
in any form, provided that no change is made other than as provided 
under paragraph (d) of this section. The special information booklet may 
not be made a part of a larger document for purposes of distribution 
under RESPA and this section. Any color, size and quality of paper, type 
of print, and method of reproduction may be used so long as the booklet 
is clearly legible.
    (d) Permissible changes. (1) No changes to, deletions from, or 
additions to the special information booklet currently prescribed by the 
Secretary shall be made other than those specified in this paragraph (d) 
or any others approved in

[[Page 255]]

writing by the Secretary. A request to the Secretary for approval of any 
changes shall be submitted in writing to the address indicated in 
Sec. 3500.3, stating the reasons why the applicant believes such 
changes, deletions or additions are necessary.
    (2) The cover of the booklet may be in any form and may contain any 
drawings, pictures or artwork, provided that the words ``settlement 
costs'' are used in the title. Names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
the lender or others and similar information may appear on the cover, 
but no discussion of the matters covered in the booklet shall appear on 
the cover.
    (3) The special information booklet may be translated into languages 
other than English.


<R05>
Sec. 3500.7  Good faith estimate.

    (a) Lender to provide. Except as provided in this paragraph (a) or 
paragraph (f) of this section, the lender shall provide all applicants 
for a federally related mortgage loan with a good faith estimate of the 
amount of or range of charges for the specific settlement services the 
borrower is likely to incur in connection with the settlement. The 
lender shall provide the good faith estimate required under this section 
(a suggested format is set forth in appendix C of this part) either by 
delivering the good faith estimate or by placing it in the mail to the 
loan applicant, not later than three business days after the application 
is received or prepared.
    (1) If the lender denies the application for a federally related 
mortgage loan before the end of the three-business-day period, the 
lender need not provide the denied borrower with a good faith estimate.
    (2) For ``no cost'' or ``no point'' loans, the charges to be shown 
on the good faith estimate include any payments to be made to affiliated 
or independent settlement service providers. These payments should be 
shown as P.O.C. (Paid Outside of Closing) on the Good Faith Estimate and 
the HUD-1 or HUD-1A.
    (3) In the case of dealer loans, the lender is responsible for 
provision of the good faith estimate, either directly or by the dealer.
    (4) If a mortgage broker is the exclusive agent of the lender, 
either the lender or the mortgage broker shall provide the good faith 
estimate within three business days after the mortgage broker receives 
or prepares the application.
    (b) Mortgage broker to provide. In the event an application is 
received by a mortgage broker who is not an exclusive agent of the 
lender, the mortgage broker must provide a good faith estimate within 
three days of receiving a loan application based on his or her knowledge 
of the range of costs (a suggested format is set forth in appendix C of 
this part). As long as the mortgage broker has provided the good faith 
estimate, the funding lender is not required to provide an additional 
good faith estimate, but the funding lender is responsible for 
ascertaining that the good faith estimate has been delivered. If the 
application for mortgage credit is denied before the end of the three-
business-day period, the mortgage broker need not provide the denied 
borrower with a good faith estimate.
    (c) Content of good faith estimate. A good faith estimate consists 
of an estimate, as a dollar amount or range, of each charge which:
    (1) Will be listed in section L of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A in accordance 
with the instructions set forth in appendix A to this part; and
    (2) That the borrower will normally pay or incur at or before 
settlement based upon common practice in the locality of the mortgaged 
property. Each such estimate must be made in good faith and bear a 
reasonable relationship to the charge a borrower is likely to be 
required to pay at settlement, and must be based upon experience in the 
locality of the mortgaged property. As to each charge with respect to 
which the lender requires a particular settlement service provider to be 
used, the lender shall make its estimate based upon the lender's 
knowledge of the amounts charged by such provider.
    (d) Form of good faith estimate. A suggested good faith estimate 
form is set forth in appendix C to this part and is in compliance with 
the requirements of the Act except for any additional requirements of 
paragraph (e) of this section. The good faith estimate may be

[[Page 256]]

provided together with disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act, 
15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., so long as all required material for the good 
faith estimate is grouped together. The lender may include additional 
relevant information, such as the name/signature of the applicant and 
loan officer, date, and information identifying the loan application and 
property, as long as the form remains clear and concise and the 
additional information is not more prominent than the required material.
    (e) Particular providers required by lender. (1) If the lender 
requires the use (see Sec. 3500.2, ``required use'') of a particular 
provider of a settlement service, other than the lender's own employees, 
and also requires the borrower to pay any portion of the cost of such 
service, then the good faith estimate must:
    (i) Clearly state that use of the particular provider is required 
and that the estimate is based on the charges of the designated 
provider;
    (ii) Give the name, address, and telephone number of each provider; 
and
    (iii) Describe the nature of any relationship between each such 
provider and the lender. Plain English references to the relationship 
should be utilized, e.g., ``X is a depositor of the lender,'' ``X is a 
borrower from the lender,'' ``X has performed 60% of the lender's 
settlements in the past year.'' (The lender is not required to keep 
detailed records of the percentages of use. Similar language, such as 
``X was used [regularly] [frequently] in our settlements the past year'' 
is also sufficient for the purposes of this paragraph.) In the event 
that more than one relationship exists, each should be disclosed.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a 
``relationship'' exists if:
    (i) The provider is an associate of the lender, as that term is 
defined in 12 U.S.C. 2602(8);
    (ii) Within the last 12 months, the provider has maintained an 
account with the lender or had an outstanding loan or credit arrangement 
with the lender; or
    (iii) The lender has repeatedly used or required borrowers to use 
the services of the provider within the last 12 months.
    (3) Except for a provider that is the lender's chosen attorney, 
credit reporting agency, or appraiser, if the lender is in an affiliated 
business relationship (see Sec. 3500.15) with a provider, the lender may 
not require the use of that provider.
    (4) If the lender maintains a controlled list of required providers 
(five or more for each discrete service) or relies on a list maintained 
by others, and at the time of application the lender has not yet decided 
which provider will be selected from that list, then the lender may 
satisfy the requirements of this section if the lender:
    (i) Provides the borrower with a written statement that the lender 
will require a particular provider from a lender-controlled or -approved 
list; and
    (ii) Provides the borrower in the Good Faith Estimate the range of 
costs for the required provider(s), and provides the name of the 
specific provider and the actual cost on the HUD-1 or HUD-1A.
    (f) Open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) under Truth in 
Lending Act. In the case of a federally related mortgage loan involving 
an open-end line of credit (home-equity plan) covered under the Truth in 
Lending Act and Regulation Z, a lender or mortgage broker that provides 
the borrower with the disclosures required by 12 CFR 226.5b of 
Regulation Z at the time the borrower applies for such loan shall be 
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section.

Sec. 3500.8  Use of HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statements.

    (a) Use by settlement agent. The settlement agent shall use the HUD-
1 settlement statement in every settlement involving a federally related 
mortgage loan in which there is a borrower and a seller. For 
transactions in which there is a borrower and no seller, such as 
refinancing loans or subordinate lien loans, the HUD-1 may be utilized 
by using the borrower's side of the HUD-1 statement. Alternatively, the 
form HUD-1A may be used for these transactions. Either the HUD-1 or the 
HUD-

[[Page 257]]

1A, as appropriate, shall be used for every RESPA-covered transaction, 
unless its use is specifically exempted, but the HUD-1 or HUD-1A may be 
modified as permitted under this part. The use of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A is 
exempted for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) covered by the 
Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.
    (b) Charges to be stated. The settlement agent shall complete the 
HUD-1 or HUD-1A in accordance with the instructions set forth in 
appendix A to this part.
    (c) Aggregate accounting at settlement. (1) After itemizing 
individual deposits in the 1000 series using single-item accounting, the 
servicer shall make an adjustment based on aggregate accounting. This 
adjustment equals the difference in the deposit required under aggregate 
accounting and the sum of the deposits required under single-item 
accounting. The computation steps for both accounting methods are set 
out in Sec. 3500.17(d). The adjustment will always be a negative number 
or zero (-0-). The settlement agent shall enter the aggregate adjustment 
amount on a final line in the 1000 series of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A 
statement.
    (2) During the phase-in period, as defined in Sec. 3500.17(b), an 
alternative procedure is available. The settlement agent may initially 
calculate the 1000 series deposits for the HUD-1 and HUD-1A settlement 
statement using single-item analysis with only a one-month cushion 
(unless the mortgage loan documents indicate a smaller amount). In the 
escrow account analysis conducted within 45 days of settlement, however, 
the servicer shall adjust the escrow account to reflect the aggregate 
accounting balance. Appendix E to this part sets out examples of 
aggregate analysis. Appendix A to this part contains instructions for 
completing the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statements using an aggregate 
analysis adjustment and the alternative process during the phase-in 
period.

Sec. 3500.9  Reproduction of settlement statements.

    (a) Permissible changes--HUD-1. The following changes and insertions 
are permitted when the HUD-1 settlement statement is reproduced:
    (1) The person reproducing the HUD-1 may insert its business name 
and logotype in section A and may rearrange, but not delete, the other 
information that appears in section A.
    (2) The name, address, and other information regarding the lender 
and settlement agent may be printed in sections F and H, respectively.
    (3) Reproduction of the HUD-1 must conform to the terminology, 
sequence, and numbering of line items as presented in lines 100-1400. 
However, blank lines or items listed in lines 100-1400 that are not used 
locally or in connection with mortgages by the lender may be deleted, 
except for the following: Lines 100, 120, 200, 220, 300, 301, 302, 303, 
400, 420, 500, 520, 600, 601, 602, 603, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 
1300, and 1400. The form may be shortened correspondingly. The number of 
a deleted item shall not be used for a substitute or new item, but the 
number of a blank space on the HUD-1 may be used for a substitute or new 
item.
    (4) Charges not listed on the HUD-1, but that are customary locally 
or pursuant to the lender's practice, may be inserted in blank spaces. 
Where existing blank spaces on the HUD-1 are insufficient, additional 
lines and spaces may be added and numbered in sequence with spaces on 
the HUD-1.
    (5) The following variations in layout and format are within the 
discretion of persons reproducing the HUD-1 and do not require prior HUD 
approval: size of pages; tint or color of pages; size and style of type 
or print; vertical spacing between lines or provision for additional 
horizontal space on lines (for example, to provide sufficient space for 
recording time periods used in prorations); printing of the HUD-1 
contents on separate pages, on the front and back of a single page, or 
on one continuous page; use of multicopy tear-out sets; printing on 
rolls for computer purposes; reorganization of sections B through I, 
when necessary to accommodate computer printing; and manner of placement 
of the HUD number, but

not the OMB approval number, neither of which may be deleted. The 
designation of the expiration date of the OMB number may be deleted. Any 
changes in the HUD number or OMB approval number may be announced by 
notice in the Federal Register, rather than by amendment of this part.
    (6) The borrower's information and the seller's information may be 
provided on separate pages.
    (7) Signature lines may be added.
    (8) The HUD-1 may be translated into languages other than English.
    (9) An additional page may be attached to the HUD-1 for the purpose 
of including customary recitals and information used locally in real 
estate settlements; for example, breakdown of payoff figures, a 
breakdown of the borrower's total monthly mortgage payments, check 
disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable 
special stipulations between buyer and seller, and the date funds are 
transferred. If space permits, such information may be added at the end 
of the HUD-1.
    (10) As required by HUD/FHA in FHA-insured loans.
    (11) As allowed by Sec. 3500.17, relating to an initial escrow 
account statement.
    (b) Permissible changes--HUD-1A. The changes and insertions on the 
HUD-1 permitted under paragraph (a) of this section are also permitted 
when the HUD-1A settlement statement is reproduced, except the changes 
described in paragraphs (a)(3) and (6) of this section.
    (c) Written approval. Any other deviation in the HUD-1 or HUD-1A 
forms is permissible only upon receipt of written approval of the 
Secretary. A request to the Secretary for approval shall be submitted in 
writing to the address indicated in Sec. 3500.3 and shall state the 
reasons why the applicant believes such deviation is needed. The 
prescribed form(s) must be used until approval is received.

Sec. 3500.10  One-day advance inspection of HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement; delivery; recordkeeping.

    (a) Inspection one day prior to settlement upon request by the 
borrower. The settlement agent shall permit the borrower to inspect the 
HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement, completed to set forth those items 
that are known to the settlement agent at the time of inspection, during 
the business day immediately preceding settlement. Items related only to 
the seller's transaction may be omitted from the HUD-1.
    (b) Delivery. The settlement agent shall provide a completed HUD-1 
or HUD-1A to the borrower, the seller (if there is one), the lender (if 
the lender is not the settlement agent), and/or their agents. When the 
borrower's and seller's copies of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A differ as 
permitted by the instructions in appendix A to this part, both copies 
shall be provided to the lender (if the lender is not the settlement 
agent). The settlement agent shall deliver the completed HUD-1 or HUD-1A 
at or before the settlement, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section.
    (c) Waiver. The borrower may waive the right to delivery of the 
completed HUD-1 or HUD-1A no later than at settlement by executing a 
written waiver at or before settlement. In such case, the completed HUD-
1 or HUD-1A shall be mailed or delivered to the borrower, seller, and 
lender (if the lender is not the settlement agent) as soon as 
practicable after settlement.
    (d) Exempt transactions. When the borrower or the borrower's agent 
does not attend the settlement, or when the settlement agent does not 
conduct a meeting of the parties for that purpose, the transaction shall 
be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, except that the HUD-1 or HUD-1A shall be mailed or delivered as 
soon as practicable after settlement.
    (e) Recordkeeping. The lender shall retain each completed HUD-1 or 
HUD-1A and related documents for five years after settlement, unless the 
lender disposes of its interest in the mortgage and does not service the 
mortgage. In that case, the lender shall provide its copy of the HUD-1 
or HUD-1A to the owner or servicer of the mortgage as a part of the 
transfer of the loan file. Such owner or servicer shall retain the HUD-1 
or HUD-1A for the remainder of the five-year period. The Secretary

[[Page 259]]

shall have the right to inspect or require copies of records covered by 
this paragraph (e).

Sec. 3500.11  Mailing.

    The provisions of this part requiring or permitting mailing of 
documents shall be deemed to be satisfied by placing the document in the 
mail (whether or not received by the addressee) addressed to the 
addresses stated in the loan application or in other information 
submitted to or obtained by the lender at the time of loan application 
or submitted or obtained by the lender or settlement agent, except that 
a revised address shall be used where the lender or settlement agent has 
been expressly informed in writing of a change in address.

Sec. 3500.12  No fee.

    No fee shall be imposed or charge made upon any other person, as a 
part of settlement costs or otherwise, by a lender in connection with a 
federally related mortgage loan made by it (or a loan for the purchase 
of a manufactured home), or by a servicer (as that term is defined under 
12 U.S.C. 2605(i)(2)) for or on account of the preparation and 
distribution of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement, escrow account 
statements required pursuant to section 10 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2609), or 
statements required by the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.

Sec. 3500.13  Relation to State laws.

    (a) State laws that are inconsistent with RESPA or this part are 
preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. However, RESPA and these 
regulations do not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to 
their provisions from complying with the laws of any State with respect 
to settlement practices, except to the extent of the inconsistency.
    (b) Upon request by any person, the Secretary is authorized to 
determine if inconsistencies with State law exist; in doing so, the 
Secretary shall consult with appropriate Federal agencies.
    (1) The Secretary may not determine that a State law or regulation 
is inconsistent with any provision of RESPA or this part, if the 
Secretary determines that such law or regulation gives greater 
protection to the consumer.
    (2) In determining whether provisions of State law or regulations 
concerning affiliated business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA 
or this part, the Secretary may not construe those provisions that 
impose more stringent limitations on affiliated business arrangements as 
inconsistent with RESPA so long as they give more protection to 
consumers and/or competition.
    (c) Any person may request the Secretary to determine whether an 
inconsistency exists by submitting to the address indicated in 
Sec. 3500.3, a copy of the State law in question, any other law or 
judicial or administrative opinion that implements, interprets or 
applies the relevant provision, and an explanation of the possible 
inconsistency. A determination by the Secretary that an inconsistency 
with State law exists will be made by publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register. ``Law'' as used in this section includes regulations 
and any enactment which has the force and effect of law and is issued by 
a State or any political subdivision of a State.
    (d) A specific preemption of conflicting State laws regarding 
notices and disclosures of mortgage servicing transfers is set forth in 
Sec. 3500.21(h).

<R05>
Sec. 3500.14  Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.

    (a) Section 8 violation. Any violation of this section is a 
violation of section 8 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607) and is subject to 
enforcement as such under Sec. 3500.19.
    (b) No referral fees. No person shall give and no person shall 
accept any fee, kickback or other thing of value pursuant to any 
agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to 
or part of a settlement service involving a federally related mortgage 
loan shall be referred to any person. Any referral of a settlement 
service is not a compensable service, except as set forth in 
Sec. 3500.14(g)(1). A

[[Page 260]]

company may not pay any other company or the employees of any other 
company for the referral of settlement service business.
    (c) No split of charges except for actual services performed. No 
person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or 
percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a 
settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a 
federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually 
performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are 
performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee 
and violates this section. The source of the payment does not determine 
whether or not a service is compensable. Nor may the prohibitions of 
this part be avoided by creating an arrangement wherein the purchaser of 
services splits the fee.
    (d) Thing of value. This term is broadly defined in section 3(2) of 
RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602(2)). It includes, without limitation, monies, 
things, discounts, salaries, commissions, fees, duplicate payments of a 
charge, stock, dividends, distributions of partnership profits, 
franchise royalties, credits representing monies that may be paid at a 
future date, the opportunity to participate in a money-making program, 
retained or increased earnings, increased equity in a parent or 
subsidiary entity, special bank deposits or accounts, special or unusual 
banking terms, services of all types at special or free rates, sales or 
rentals at special prices or rates, lease or rental payments based in 
whole or in part on the amount of business referred, trips and payment 
of another person's expenses, or reduction in credit against an existing 
obligation. The term ``payment'' is used throughout Secs. 3500.14 and 
3500.15 as synonymous with the giving or receiving any ``thing of 
value'' and does not require transfer of money.
    (e) Agreement or understanding. An agreement or understanding for 
the referral of business incident to or part of a settlement service 
need not be written or verbalized but may be established by a practice, 
pattern or course of conduct. When a thing of value is received 
repeatedly and is connected in any way with the volume or value of the 
business referred, the receipt of the thing of value is evidence that it 
is made pursuant to an agreement or understanding for the referral of 
business.
    (f) Referral. (1) A referral includes any oral or written action 
directed to a person which has the effect of affirmatively influencing 
the selection by any person of a provider of a settlement service or 
business incident to or part of a settlement service when such person 
will pay for such settlement service or business incident thereto or pay 
a charge attributable in whole or in part to such settlement service or 
business.
    (2) A referral also occurs whenever a person paying for a settlement 
service or business incident thereto is required to use (see 
Sec. 3500.2, ``required use'') a particular provider of a settlement 
service or business incident thereto.
    (g) Fees, salaries, compensation, or other payments. (1) Section 8 
of RESPA permits:
    (i) A payment to an attorney at law for services actually rendered;
    (ii) A payment by a title company to its duly appointed agent for 
services actually performed in the issuance of a policy of title 
insurance;
    (iii) A payment by a lender to its duly appointed agent or 
contractor for services actually performed in the origination, 
processing, or funding of a loan;
    (iv) A payment to any person of a bona fide salary or compensation 
or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for 
services actually performed;
    (v) A payment pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral 
arrangements or agreements between real estate agents and real estate 
brokers. (The statutory exemption restated in this paragraph refers only 
to fee divisions within real estate brokerage arrangements when all 
parties are acting in a real estate brokerage capacity, and has no 
applicability to any fee arrangements between real estate brokers and 
mortgage brokers or between mortgage brokers.);
    (vi) Normal promotional and educational activities that are not 
conditioned on the referral of business and

[[Page 261]]

that do not involve the defraying of expenses that otherwise would be 
incurred by persons in a position to refer settlement services or 
business incident thereto; or
    (vii) An employer's payment to its own employees for any referral 
activities.
    (2) The Department may investigate high prices to see if they are 
the result of a referral fee or a split of a fee. If the payment of a 
thing of value bears no reasonable relationship to the market value of 
the goods or services provided, then the excess is not for services or 
goods actually performed or provided. These facts may be used as 
evidence of a violation of section 8 and may serve as a basis for a 
RESPA investigation. High prices standing alone are not proof of a RESPA 
violation. The value of a referral (i.e., the value of any additional 
business obtained thereby) is not to be taken into account in 
determining whether the payment exceeds the reasonable value of such 
goods, facilities or services. The fact that the transfer of the thing 
of value does not result in an increase in any charge made by the person 
giving the thing of value is irrelevant in determining whether the act 
is prohibited.
    (3) Multiple services. When a person in a position to refer 
settlement service business, such as an attorney, mortgage lender, real 
estate broker or agent, or developer or builder, receives a payment for 
providing additional settlement services as part of a real estate 
transaction, such payment must be for services that are actual, 
necessary and distinct from the primary services provided by such 
person. For example, for an attorney of the buyer or seller to receive 
compensation as a title agent, the attorney must perform core title 
agent services (for which liability arises) separate from attorney 
services, including the evaluation of the title search to determine the 
insurability of the title, the clearance of underwriting objections, the 
actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the title 
insurance company, and, where customary, issuance of the title 
commitment, and the conducting of the title search and closing.
    (h) Recordkeeping. Any documents provided pursuant to this section 
shall be retained for five (5) years from the date of execution.
    (i) Appendix B of this part. Illustrations in appendix B of this 
part demonstrate some of the requirements of this section.

    (g) Exemptions for fees, salaries, compensation, or other payments. 
(1) The following are permissible:
    (i) A payment to an attorney at law for services actually rendered;
    (ii) A payment by a title company to its duly appointed agent for 
services actually performed in the issuance of a policy of title 
insurance;
    (iii) A payment by a lender to its duly appointed agent or 
contractor for services actually performed in the origination, 
processing, or funding of a loan;
    (iv) A payment to any person of a bona fide salary or compensation 
or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for 
services actually performed;
    (v) A payment pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral 
arrangements or agreements between real estate agents and real estate 
brokers. (The statutory exemption restated in this paragraph refers only 
to fee divisions within real estate brokerage arrangements when all 
parties are acting in a real estate brokerage capacity, and has no 
applicability to any fee arrangements between real estate brokers and 
mortgage brokers or between mortgage brokers.)
    (vi) Normal promotional and educational activities that are not 
conditioned on the referral of business and do not involve the defraying 
of expenses that otherwise would be

incurred by persons in a position to refer settlement services or 
business incident thereto;
    (vii) A payment by an employer to its own bona fide employee for 
generating business for that employer;
    (viii) In a controlled business arrangement, a payment by an 
employer of a bonus to a managerial employee based on criteria relating 
to performance (such as profitability, capture rate, or other 
thresholds) of a business entity in the controlled business arrangement. 
However, the amount of such bonus may not be calculated as a multiple of 
the number or value of referrals of settlement service business to a 
business entity in a controlled business arrangement; and
    (ix)(A) A payment by an employer to its bona fide employee for the 
referral of settlement service business to a settlement service provider 
that has an affiliate relationship with the employer or in which the 
employer has a direct or beneficial ownership interest of more than 1 
percent, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The employee does not perform settlement services in any 
transaction; and
    (2) Before the referral, the employee provides to the person being 
referred a written disclosure in the format of the Controlled Business 
Arrangement Disclosure Statement, set forth in appendix D to this part.
    (B) For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(ix), the marketing of a 
settlement service or product of an affiliated entity, including the 
collection and conveyance of information or the taking of an application 
or order for an affiliated entity, does not constitute the performance 
of a settlement service. Under this paragraph (g)(1)(ix), marketing of a 
settlement service or product may include incidental communications with 
the consumer after the application or order, such as providing the 
consumer with information about the status of an application or order; 
marketing shall not include serving as the ongoing point of contact for 
coordinating the delivery and provision of settlement services.

<R05>
Sec. 3500.15  Affiliated business arrangements.

    (a) General. An affiliated business arrangement is defined in 
section 3(7) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602(7)).
    (b) Violation and exemption. An affiliated business arrangement is 
not a violation of section 8 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607) and of 
Sec. 3500.14 if the conditions set forth in this section are satisfied. 
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to the extent it is 
inconsistent with section 8(c)(4)(A) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607(c)(4)(A)).
    (1) The person making each referral has provided to each person 
whose business is referred a written disclosure, in the format of the 
Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in 
appendix D of this part, of the nature of the relationship (explaining 
the ownership and financial interest) between the provider of settlement 
services (or business incident thereto) and the person making the 
referral and of an estimated charge or range of charges generally made 
by such provider (which describes the charge using the same terminology, 
as far as practical, as section L of the HUD-1 settlement statement). 
The disclosures must be provided on a separate piece of paper no later 
than the time of each referral or, if the lender requires use of a 
particular provider, the time of loan application, except that:
    (i) Where a lender makes the referral to a borrower, the condition 
contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be satisfied at the 
time that the good faith estimate or a statement under Sec. 3500.7(d) is 
provided; and
    (ii) Whenever an attorney or law firm requires a client to use a 
particular title insurance agent, the attorney or law firm shall provide 
the disclosures no later than the time the attorney or law firm is 
engaged by the client. Failure to comply with the disclosure 
requirements of this section may be overcome if the person making a 
referral can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that procedures 
reasonably adopted to result in compliance with these conditions have 
been maintained and that any failure to comply with these conditions was 
unintentional and the result of a bona fide error. An error of legal 
judgment with respect to a person's obligations under RESPA is not a 
bona fide error. Administrative and judicial interpretations of section 
130(c) of the Truth in Lending Act shall not be binding interpretations 
of the preceding sentence or section 8(d)(3) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 
2607(d)(3)).
    (2) No person making a referral has required (as defined in 
Sec. 3500.2, ``required use'') any person to use any particular provider 
of settlement services

[[Page 263]]

or business incident thereto, except if such person is a lender, for 
requiring a buyer, borrower or seller to pay for the services of an 
attorney, credit reporting agency, or real estate appraiser chosen by 
the lender to represent the lender's interest in a real estate 
transaction, or except if such person is an attorney or law firm for 
arranging for issuance of a title insurance policy for a client, 
directly as agent or through a separate corporate title insurance agency 
that may be operated as an adjunct to the law practice of the attorney 
or law firm, as part of representation of that client in a real estate 
transaction.
    (3) The only thing of value that is received from the arrangement 
other than payments listed in Sec. 3500.14(g) is a return on an 
ownership interest or franchise relationship.
    (i) In an affiliated business arrangement:
    (A) Bona fide dividends, and capital or equity distributions, 
related to ownership interest or franchise relationship, between 
entities in an affiliate relationship, are permissible; and
    (B) Bona fide business loans, advances, and capital or equity 
contributions between entities in an affiliate relationship (in any 
direction), are not prohibited--so long as they are for ordinary 
business purposes and are not fees for the referral of settlement 
service business or unearned fees.
    (ii) A return on an ownership interest does not include:
    (A) Any payment which has as a basis of calculation no apparent 
business motive other than distinguishing among recipients of payments 
on the basis of the amount of their actual, estimated or anticipated 
referrals;
    (B) Any payment which varies according to the relative amount of 
referrals by the different recipients of similar payments; or
    (C) A payment based on an ownership, partnership or joint venture 
share which has been adjusted on the basis of previous relative 
referrals by recipients of similar payments.
    (iii) Neither the mere labelling of a thing of value, nor the fact 
that it may be calculated pursuant to a corporate or partnership 
organizational document or a franchise agreement, will determine whether 
it is a bona fide return on an ownership interest or franchise 
relationship. Whether a thing of value is such a return will be 
determined by analyzing facts and circumstances on a case by case basis.
    (iv) A return on franchise relationship may be a payment to or from 
a franchisee but it does not include any payment which is not based on 
the franchise agreement, nor any payment which varies according to the 
number or amount of referrals by the franchisor or franchisee or which 
is based on a franchise agreement which has been adjusted on the basis 
of a previous number or amount of referrals by the franchiser or 
franchisees. A franchise agreement may not be constructed to insulate 
against kickbacks or referral fees.
    (c) Definitions. As used in this section:
    (1) Associate is defined in section 3(8) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 
2602(8)).
    (2) Affiliate relationship means the relationship among business 
entities where one entity has effective control over the other by virtue 
of a partnership or other agreement or is under common control with the 
other by a third entity or where an entity is a corporation related to 
another corporation as parent to subsidiary by an identity of stock 
ownership.
    (3) Beneficial ownership means the effective ownership of an 
interest in a provider of settlement services or the right to use and 
control the ownership interest involved even though legal ownership or 
title may be held in another person's name.
    (4) Control, as used in the definitions of ``associate'' and 
``affiliate relationship,'' means that a person:
    (i) Is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of another 
person;
    (ii) Directly or indirectly or acting in concert with others, or 
through one or more subsidiaries, owns, holds with power to vote, or 
holds proxies representing, more than 20 percent of the voting interests 
of another person;
    (iii) Affirmatively influences in any manner the election of a 
majority of the directors of another person; or
    (iv) Has contributed more than 20 percent of the capital of the 
other person.

[[Page 264]]

    (5) Direct ownership means the holding of legal title to an interest 
in a provider of settlement service except where title is being held for 
the beneficial owner.
    (6) Franchise is defined in 16 CFR 436.2(a).
    (7) Franchisor is defined in 16 CFR 436.2(c).
    (8) Franchisee is defined in 16 CFR 436.2(d).
    (9) Person who is in a position to refer settlement service business 
means any real estate broker or agent, lender, mortgage broker, builder 
or developer, attorney, title company, title agent, or other person 
deriving a significant portion of his or her gross income from providing 
settlement services.
    (d) Recordkeeping. Any documents provided pursuant to this section 
shall be retained for 5 years after the date of execution.
    (e) Appendix B of this part. Illustrations in appendix B of this 
part demonstrate some of the requirements of this section.

    (b) *  *  *
    (1) Prior to the referral, the person making a referral has provided 
to each person whose business is referred a written disclosure, in the 
format of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set 
forth in appendix D of this part. This disclosure shall specify the 
nature of the relationship (explaining the ownership and financial 
interest) between the person performing settlement services (or business 
incident thereto) and the person making the referral, and shall describe 
the estimated charge or range of charges (using the same terminology, as 
far as practical, as section L of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement 
statement) generally made by the provider of settlement services. The 
disclosure must be provided on a separate piece of paper no later than 
the time of each referral or, if the lender requires the use of a 
particular provider, the time of loan application, except that:

Sec. 3500.16  Title companies.

    No seller of property that will be purchased with the assistance of 
a federally related mortgage loan shall violate section 9 of RESPA (12 
U.S.C. 2608). Section 3500.2 defines ``required use'' of a provider of a 
settlement service. Section 3500.19(c) explains the liability of a 
seller for a violation of this section.

Sec. 3500.17  Escrow accounts.

    (a) General. This section sets out the requirements for an escrow 
account that a lender establishes in connection with a federally related 
mortgage loan. It sets limits for escrow accounts using calculations 
based on monthly payments and disbursements within a calendar year. If 
an escrow account involves biweekly or any other payment period, the 
requirements in this section shall be modified accordingly. A HUD Public 
Guidance Document entitled ``Biweekly Payments--Example'' provides 
examples of biweekly accounting and a HUD Public Guidance Document 
entitled ``Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement--Example'' 
provides examples of a 3-year accounting cycle that may be used in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section. A HUD Public Guidance 
Document entitled ``Consumer Disclosure for Voluntary Escrow Account 
Payments'' provides a model disclosure format that originators and 
servicers are encouraged, but not required, to provide to consumers when 
the originator or servicer anticipates a substantial increase in 
disbursements from the escrow account after the first year of the loan. 
The disclosures in that model format may be combined with or included in 
the Initial Escrow Account Statement required in Sec. 3500.17(g).
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Acceptable accounting method means an accounting method that a 
servicer uses to conduct an escrow account analysis for an escrow 
account subject to the provisions of Sec. 3500.17(c).

[[Page 265]]

    Aggregate (or) composite analysis, hereafter called aggregate 
analysis, means an accounting method a servicer uses in conducting an 
escrow account analysis by computing the sufficiency of escrow account 
funds by analyzing the account as a whole. Appendix E to this part sets 
forth examples of aggregate escrow account analyses.
    Annual escrow account statement means a statement containing all of 
the information set forth in Sec. 3500.17(i). As noted in 
Sec. 3500.17(i), a servicer shall submit an annual escrow account 
statement to the borrower within 30 calendar days of the end of the 
escrow account computation year, after conducting an escrow account 
analysis.
    Conversion date means the date three years after the publication 
date of the rule adding this section (i.e., October 27, 1997) by which 
date all servicers shall use aggregate analysis.
    Cushion or reserve (hereafter cushion) means funds that a servicer 
may require a borrower to pay into an escrow account to cover 
unanticipated disbursements or disbursements made before the borrower's 
payments are available in the account, as limited by Sec. 3500.17(c).
    Deficiency is the amount of a negative balance in an escrow account. 
As noted in Sec. 3500.17(f), if a servicer advances funds for a 
borrower, then the servicer must perform an escrow account analysis 
before seeking repayment of the deficiency.
    Delivery means the placing of a document in the United States mail, 
first-class postage paid, addressed to the last known address of the 
recipient. Hand delivery also constitutes delivery.
    Disbursement date means the date on which the servicer actually pays 
an escrow item from the escrow account.
    Escrow account means any account that a servicer establishes or 
controls on behalf of a borrower to pay taxes, insurance premiums 
(including flood insurance), or other charges with respect to a 
federally related mortgage loan, including charges that the borrower and 
servicer have voluntarily agreed that the servicer should collect and 
pay. The definition encompasses any account established for this 
purpose, including a ``trust account'', ``reserve account'', ``impound 
account'', or other term in different localities. An ``escrow account'' 
includes any arrangement where the servicer adds a portion of the 
borrower's payments to principal and subsequently deducts from principal 
the disbursements for escrow account items. For purposes of this 
section, the term ``escrow account'' excludes any account that is under 
the borrower's total control.
    Escrow account analysis means the accounting that a servicer 
conducts in the form of a trial running balance for an escrow account 
to:
    (1) Determine the appropriate target balances;
    (2) Compute the borrower's monthly payments for the next escrow 
account computation year and any deposits needed to establish or 
maintain the account; and
    (3) Determine whether shortages, surpluses or deficiencies exist.
    Escrow account computation year is a 12-month period that a servicer 
establishes for the escrow account beginning with the borrower's initial 
payment date. The term includes each 12-month period thereafter, unless 
a servicer chooses to issue a short year statement under the conditions 
stated in Sec. 3500.17(i)(4).
    Escrow account item or separate item means any separate expenditure 
category, such as ``taxes'' or ``insurance'', for which funds are 
collected in the escrow account for disbursement. An escrow account item 
with installment payments, such as local property taxes, remains one 
escrow account item regardless of multiple disbursement dates to the tax 
authority.
    Initial escrow account statement means the first disclosure 
statement that the servicer delivers to the borrower concerning the 
borrower's escrow account. The initial escrow account statement shall 
meet the requirements of Sec. 3500.17(g) and be in substantially the 
format set forth in Sec. 3500.17(h).
    Installment payment means one of two or more payments payable on an 
escrow account item during an escrow account computation year. An 
example of an installment payment is where a jurisdiction bills 
quarterly for taxes.
    Payment due date means the date each month when the borrower's

[[Page 266]]

monthly payment to an escrow account is due to the servicer. The initial 
payment date is the borrower's first payment due date to an escrow 
account.
    Penalty means a late charge imposed by the payee for paying after 
the disbursement is due. It does not include any additional charge or 
fee imposed by the payee associated with choosing installment payments 
as opposed to annual payments or for choosing one installment plan over 
another.
    Phase-in period means the period beginning on May 24, 1995, and 
ending on the conversion date, i.e., October 27, 1997, by which date all 
servicers shall use the aggregate accounting method in conducting escrow 
account analyses.
    Post-rule account means an escrow account established in connection 
with a federally related mortgage loan whose settlement date is on or 
after May 24, 1995.
    Pre-accrual is a practice some servicers use to require borrowers to 
deposit funds, needed for disbursement and maintenance of a cushion, in 
the escrow account some period before the disbursement date. Pre-accrual 
is subject to the limitations of Sec. 3500.17(c).
    Pre-rule account is an escrow account established in connection with 
a federally related mortgage loan whose settlement date is before May 
24, 1995.
    Shortage means an amount by which a current escrow account balance 
falls short of the target balance at the time of escrow analysis.
    Single-item analysis means an accounting method servicers use in 
conducting an escrow account analysis by computing the sufficiency of 
escrow account funds by considering each escrow item separately. 
Appendix E to this part sets forth examples of single-item analysis.
    Submission (of an escrow account statement) means the delivery of 
the statement.
    Surplus means an amount by which the current escrow account balance 
exceeds the target balance for the account.
    System of recordkeeping means the servicer's method of keeping 
information that reflects the facts relating to that servicer's handling 
of the borrower's escrow account, including, but not limited to, the 
payment of amounts from the escrow account and the submission of initial 
and annual escrow account statements to borrowers.
    Target balance means the estimated month end balance in an escrow 
account that is just sufficient to cover the remaining disbursements 
from the escrow account in the escrow account computation year, taking 
into account the remaining scheduled periodic payments, and a cushion, 
if any.
    Trial running balance means the accounting process that derives the 
target balances over the course of an escrow account computation year. 
Section 3500.17(d) provides a description of the steps involved in 
performing a trial running balance.
    (c) Limits on payments to escrow accounts; acceptable accounting 
methods to determine limits. (1) A lender or servicer (hereafter 
servicer) shall not require a borrower to deposit into any escrow 
account, created in connection with a federally related mortgage loan, 
more than the following amounts:
    (i) Charges at settlement or upon creation of an escrow account. At 
the time a servicer creates an escrow account for a borrower, the 
servicer may charge the borrower an amount sufficient to pay the charges 
respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, which 
are attributable to the period from the date such payment(s) were last 
paid until the initial payment date. The ``amount sufficient to pay'' is 
computed so that the lowest month end target balance projected for the 
escrow account computation year is zero (-0-) (see Step 2 in appendix E 
to this part). In addition, the servicer may charge the borrower a 
cushion that shall be no greater than one-sixth (\1/6\) of the estimated 
total annual payments from the escrow account.
    (ii) Charges during the life of the escrow account. Throughout the 
life of an escrow account, the servicer may charge the borrower a 
monthly sum equal to one-twelfth (\1/12\) of the total annual escrow 
payments which the servicer reasonably anticipates paying from the 
account. In addition, the servicer may add an amount to maintain a 
cushion no greater than one-sixth (\1/6\) of the estimated total annual 
payments from the account. However,

[[Page 267]]

if a servicer determines through an escrow account analysis that there 
is a shortage or deficiency, the servicer may require the borrower to 
pay additional deposits to make up the shortage or eliminate the 
deficiency, subject to the limitations set forth in Sec. 3500.17(f).
    (2) Escrow analysis at creation of escrow account. Before 
establishing an escrow account, the servicer must conduct an escrow 
account analysis to determine the amount the borrower must deposit into 
the escrow account (subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section), and the amount of the borrower's periodic payments into 
the escrow account (subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section). In conducting the escrow account analysis, the 
servicer must estimate the disbursement amounts according to paragraph 
(c)(7) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the 
servicer must use a date on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty as 
the disbursement date for the escrow item and comply with any other 
requirements of paragraph (k) of this section. Upon completing the 
initial escrow account analysis, the servicer must prepare and deliver 
an initial escrow account statement to the borrower, as set forth in 
paragraph (g) of this section. The servicer must use the escrow account 
analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage, or deficiency exists 
and must make any adjustments to the account pursuant to paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (3) Subsequent escrow account analyses. For each escrow account, the 
servicer must conduct an escrow account analysis at the completion of 
the escrow account computation year to determine the borrower's monthly 
escrow account payments for the next computation year, subject to the 
limitations of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. In conducting the 
escrow account analysis, the servicer must estimate the disbursement 
amounts according to paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Pursuant to 
paragraph (k) of this section, the servicer must use a date on or before 
the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement date for the escrow 
item and comply with any other requirements of paragraph (k) of this 
section. The servicer must use the escrow account analysis to determine 
whether a surplus, shortage, or deficiency exists, and must make any 
adjustments to the account pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. 
Upon completing an escrow account analysis, the servicer must prepare 
and submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower, as set 
forth in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (4) Acceptable accounting methods to determine escrow limits. The 
following are acceptable accounting methods that servicers may use in 
conducting an escrow account analysis.
    (i) Pre-rule accounts. For pre-rule accounts, servicers may use 
either single-item analysis or aggregate-analysis during the phase-in 
period. In conducting the escrow account analysis, servicers shall use 
``month-end'' accounting. Under month-end accounting, the timing of the 
disbursements and payments within the month is irrelevant. As of the 
conversion date, all pre-rule accounts shall comply with the 
requirements for post-rule accounts in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section. During the phase-in period, the transfer of servicing of a pre-
rule account to another servicer does not convert the account to a post-
rule account. After May 24, 1995, refinancing transactions (as defined 
in Sec. 3500.2) shall comply with the requirements for post-rule 
accounts.
    (ii) Post-rule accounts. For post-rule accounts, servicers shall use 
aggregate accounting to conduct an escrow account analysis. In 
conducting the escrow account analysis, servicers shall use ``month-
end'' accounting. Under month-end accounting, the timing of the 
disbursements and payments within the month is irrelevant.
    (5) Cushion. For post-rule accounts, the cushion shall be no greater 
than one-sixth (\1/6\) of the estimated total annual disbursements from 
the escrow account using aggregate analysis accounting. For pre-rule 
accounts, the cushion may not exceed the total of one-sixth of the 
estimated annual disbursements for each escrow account item using 
single-item analysis accounting. In determining the cushion using 
single-item analysis, a servicer

[[Page 268]]

shall not divide an escrow account item into sub-accounts, even if the 
payee requires installment payments.
    (6) Restrictions on pre-accrual. For pre-rule accounts, a servicer 
shall not require any pre-accrual that results in the escrow account 
balance exceeding the limits of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In 
addition, if the mortgage documents in a pre-rule account are silent 
about the amount of pre-accrual, the servicer shall not require in 
excess of one month of pre-accrual, subject to the additional 
limitations provided in paragraph (c)(8) of this section. For post-rule 
accounts, a servicer shall not practice pre-accrual.
    (7) Servicer estimates of disbursement amounts. To conduct an escrow 
account analysis, the servicer shall estimate the amount of escrow 
account items to be disbursed. If the servicer knows the charge for an 
escrow item in the next computation year, then the servicer shall use 
that amount in estimating disbursement amounts. If the charge is unknown 
to the servicer, the servicer may base the estimate on the preceding 
year's charge, or the preceding year's charge as modified by an amount 
not exceeding the most recent year's change in the national Consumer 
Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI, all items). In cases of 
unassessed new construction, the servicer may base an estimate on the 
assessment of comparable residential property in the market area.
    (8) Provisions in mortgage documents. The servicer shall examine the 
mortgage loan documents to determine the applicable cushion and 
limitations on pre-accrual for each escrow account. If the mortgage loan 
documents provide for lower cushion limits or less pre-accrual than this 
section, then the terms of the loan documents apply. Where the terms of 
any mortgage loan document allow greater payments to an escrow account 
than allowed by this section, then this section controls the applicable 
limits. Where the mortgage loan documents do not specifically establish 
an escrow account, whether a servicer may establish an escrow account 
for the loan is a matter for determination by State law. If the mortgage 
loan document is silent on the escrow account limits (for cushion or 
pre-accrual) and a servicer establishes an escrow account under State 
law, then the limitations of this section apply unless State law 
provides for a lower amount. If the loan documents provide for escrow 
accounts up to the RESPA limits, then the servicer may require the 
maximum amounts consistent with this section, unless an applicable State 
law sets a lesser amount.
    (9) Assessments for periods longer than one year. Some escrow 
account items may be billed for periods longer than one year. For 
example, servicers may need to collect flood insurance or water 
purification escrow funds for payment every three years. In such cases, 
the servicer shall estimate the borrower's payments for a full cycle of 
disbursements. For a flood insurance premium payable every 3 years, the 
servicer shall collect the payments reflecting 36 equal monthly amounts. 
For two out of the three years, however, the account balance may not 
reach its low monthly balance because the low point will be on a three-
year cycle, as compared to an annual one. The annual escrow account 
statement shall explain this situation (see example in the HUD Public 
Guidance Document entitled ``Annual Escrow Account Disclosure 
Statement--Example'', available in accordance with Sec. 3500.3).
    (d) Methods of escrow account analysis. Paragraph (c) of this 
section prescribes acceptable accounting methods. The following sets 
forth the steps servicers shall use to determine whether their use of an 
acceptable accounting method conforms with the limitations in 
Sec. 3500.17(c)(1). The steps set forth in this section derive maximum 
limits. Servicers may use accounting procedures that result in lower 
target balances. In particular, servicers may use a cushion less than 
the permissible cushion or no cushion at all. This section does not 
require the use of a cushion.
    (1) Aggregate analysis. (i) When a servicer uses aggregate analysis 
in conducting the escrow account analysis, the target balances may not 
exceed the balances computed according to the following arithmetic 
operations:
    (A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for the account as a 
whole over

[[Page 269]]

the next computation year (a trial running balance). In doing so the 
servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before 
the earlier of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if 
available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use 
pre-accrual on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that 
the borrower will make monthly payments equal to one-twelfth of the 
estimated total annual escrow account disbursements.
    (B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balances and adds 
to the first monthly balance an amount just sufficient to bring the 
lowest monthly trial balance to zero, and adjusts all other monthly 
balances accordingly.
    (C) The servicer then adds to the monthly balances the permissible 
cushion. The cushion is two months of the borrower's escrow payments to 
the servicer or a lesser amount specified by State law or the mortgage 
document (net of any increases or decreases because of prior year 
shortages or surpluses, respectively).
    (ii) Lowest monthly balance. Under aggregate analysis, the lowest 
monthly target balance for the account shall be less than or equal to 
one-sixth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements or 
a lesser amount specified by State law or the mortgage document. The 
target balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield the 
maximum limit for the escrow account. Appendix E to this part 
illustrates these steps.
    (2) Single-item or other non-aggregate analysis method. (i) When a 
servicer uses single-item analysis or any hybrid accounting method in 
conducting an escrow account analysis during the phase-in period, the 
target balances may not exceed the balances computed according to the 
following arithmetic operations:
    (A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for each item over 
the next computation year (a trial running balance). In doing so the 
servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before 
the earlier of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if 
available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use 
pre-accrual on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that 
the borrower will make periodic payments equal to one-twelfth of the 
estimated total annual escrow account disbursements.
    (B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balance for each 
escrow account item and adds to the first monthly balance for each 
separate item an amount just sufficient to bring the lowest monthly 
trial balance for that item to zero, and then adjusts all other monthly 
balances accordingly.
    (C) The servicer then adds the permissible cushion, if any, to the 
monthly balance for the separate escrow account item. The permissible 
cushion is two months of escrow payments for the escrow account item 
(net of any increases or decreases because of prior year shortages or 
surpluses, respectively) or a lesser amount specified by State law or 
the mortgage document.
    (D) The servicer then examines the balances for each item to make 
certain that the lowest monthly balance for that item is less than or 
equal to one-sixth of the estimated total annual escrow account 
disbursements for that item or a lesser amount specified by State law or 
the mortgage document.
    (ii) In performing an escrow account analysis using single-item 
analysis, servicers may account for each escrow account item separately, 
but servicers shall not further divide accounts into sub-accounts, even 
if the payee of a disbursement requires installment payments. The target 
balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield the maximum 
limit for the escrow account. Appendix F to this part illustrates these 
steps.
    (e) Transfer of servicing. (1) If the new servicer changes either 
the monthly payment amount or the accounting method used by the 
transferor (old) servicer, then the new servicer shall provide the 
borrower with an initial escrow account statement within 60 days of the 
date of servicing transfer.
    (i) Where a new servicer provides an initial escrow account 
statement upon the transfer of servicing, the new servicer shall use the 
effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish the new escrow 
account computation year.

[[Page 270]]

    (ii) Where the new servicer retains the monthly payments and 
accounting method used by the transferor servicer, then the new servicer 
may continue to use the escrow account computation year established by 
the transferor servicer or may choose to establish a different 
computation year using a short-year statement. At the completion of the 
escrow account computation year or any short year, the new servicer 
shall perform an escrow analysis and provide the borrower with an annual 
escrow account statement.
    (2) The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses and 
deficiencies in the transferred escrow account according to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 3500.17(f).
    (3) A pre-rule account remains a pre-rule account upon the transfer 
of servicing to a new servicer so long as the transfer occurs before the 
conversion date.
    (f) Shortages, surpluses, and deficiencies requirements--(1) Escrow 
account analysis. For each escrow account, the servicer shall conduct an 
escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage or 
deficiency exists.
    (i) As noted in Sec. 3500.17(c)(2) and (3), the servicer shall 
conduct an escrow account analysis upon establishing an escrow account 
and at completion of the escrow account computation year.
    (ii) The servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis at other 
times during the escrow computation year. If a servicer advances funds 
in paying a disbursement, which is not the result of a borrower's 
payment default under the underlying mortgage document, then the 
servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the 
extent of the deficiency before seeking repayment of the funds from the 
borrower under this paragraph (f).
    (2) Surpluses. (i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a 
surplus, the servicer shall, within 30 days from the date of the 
analysis, refund the surplus to the borrower if the surplus is greater 
than or equal to 50 dollars ($50). If the surplus is less than 50 
dollars ($50), the servicer may refund such amount to the borrower, or 
credit such amount against the next year's escrow payments.
    (ii) These provisions regarding surpluses apply if the borrower is 
current at the time of the escrow account analysis. A borrower is 
current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days 
of the payment due date. If the servicer does not receive the borrower's 
payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may 
retain the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the 
mortgage loan documents.
    (iii) After an initial or annual escrow analysis has been performed, 
the servicer and the borrower may enter into a voluntary agreement for 
the forthcoming escrow accounting year for the borrower to deposit funds 
into the escrow account for that year greater than the limits 
established under paragraph (c) of this section. Such an agreement shall 
cover only one escrow accounting year, but a new voluntary agreement may 
be entered into after the next escrow analysis is performed. The 
voluntary agreement may not alter how surpluses are to be treated when 
the next escrow analysis is performed at the end of the escrow 
accounting year covered by the voluntary agreement.
    (3) Shortages. (i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a 
shortage of less than one month's escrow account payment, then the 
servicer has three possible courses of action:
    (A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to 
change it;
    (B) The servicer may require the borrower to repay the shortage 
amount within 30 days; or
    (C) The servicer may require the borrower to repay the shortage 
amount in equal monthly payments over at least a 12-month period.
    (ii) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage that is 
greater than or equal to one month's escrow account payment, then the 
servicer has two possible courses of action:
    (A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to 
change it; or
    (B) The servicer may require the borrower to repay the shortage in 
equal monthly payments over at least a 12-month period.

[[Page 271]]

    (4) Deficiency. If the escrow account analysis confirms a 
deficiency, then the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional 
monthly deposits to the account to eliminate the deficiency.
    (i) If the deficiency is less than one month's escrow account 
payment, then the servicer:
    (A) May allow the deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it;
    (B) May require the borrower to repay the deficiency within 30 days; 
or
    (C) May require the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more 
equal monthly payments.
    (ii) If the deficiency is greater than or equal to 1 month's escrow 
payment, the servicer may allow the deficiency to exist and do nothing 
to change it or may require the borrower to repay the deficiency in two 
or more equal monthly payments.
    (iii) These provisions regarding deficiencies apply if the borrower 
is current at the time of the escrow account analysis. A borrower is 
current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days 
of the payment due date. If the servicer does not receive the borrower's 
payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may 
recover the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan 
documents.
    (5) Notice of shortage or deficiency in escrow account. The servicer 
shall notify the borrower at least once during the escrow account 
computation year if there is a shortage or deficiency in the escrow 
account. The notice may be part of the annual escrow account statement 
or it may be a separate document.
    (g) Initial escrow account statement. (1) Submission at settlement, 
or within 45 calendar days of settlement. As noted in 
Sec. 3500.17(c)(2), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account 
analysis before establishing an escrow account to determine the amount 
the borrower shall deposit into the escrow account, subject to the 
limitations of Sec. 3500.17(c)(1)(i). After conducting the escrow 
account analysis for each escrow account, the servicer shall submit an 
initial escrow account statement to the borrower at settlement or within 
45 calendar days of settlement for escrow accounts that are established 
as a condition of the loan.
    (i) The initial escrow account statement shall include the amount of 
the borrower's monthly mortgage payment and the portion of the monthly 
payment going into the escrow account and shall itemize the estimated 
taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges that the servicer 
reasonably anticipates to be paid from the escrow account during the 
escrow account computation year and the anticipated disbursement dates 
of those charges. The initial escrow account statement shall indicate 
the amount that the servicer selects as a cushion. The statement shall 
include a trial running balance for the account.
    (ii) Pursuant to Sec. 3500.17(h)(2), the servicer may incorporate 
the initial escrow account statement into the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement 
statement. If the servicer does not incorporate the initial escrow 
account statement into the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement, then 
the servicer shall submit the initial escrow account statement to the 
borrower as a separate document.
    (2) Time of submission of initial escrow account statement for an 
escrow account established after settlement. For escrow accounts 
established after settlement (and which are not a condition of the 
loan), a servicer shall submit an initial escrow account statement to a 
borrower within 45 calendar days of the date of establishment of the 
escrow account.
    (h) Format for initial escrow account statement. (1) The format and 
a completed example for an initial escrow account statement are set out 
in HUD Public Guidance Documents entitled ``Initial Escrow Account 
Disclosure Statement--Format'' and ``Initial Escrow Account Disclosure 
Statement--Example'', available in accordance with Sec. 3500.3.
    (2) Incorporation of initial escrow account statement into HUD-1 or 
HUD-1A settlement statement. Pursuant to Sec. 3500.9(a)(11), a servicer 
may add the initial escrow account statement to the HUD-1 or HUD-1A 
settlement statement. The servicer may include the initial escrow 
account statement in the basic text or may attach the initial

[[Page 272]]

escrow account statement as an additional page to the HUD-1 or HUD-1A 
settlement statement.
    (3) Identification of payees. The initial escrow account statement 
need not identify a specific payee by name if it provides sufficient 
information to identify the use of the funds. For example, appropriate 
entries include: county taxes, hazard insurance, condominium dues, etc. 
If a particular payee, such as a taxing body, receives more than one 
payment during the escrow account computation year, the statement shall 
indicate each payment and disbursement date. If there are several taxing 
authorities or insurers, the statement shall identify each taxing body 
or insurer (e.g., ``City Taxes'', ``School Taxes'', ``Hazard 
Insurance'', or ``Flood Insurance,'' etc.).
    (i) Annual escrow account statements. For each escrow account, a 
servicer shall submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower 
within 30 days of the completion of the escrow account computation year. 
The servicer shall also submit to the borrower the previous year's 
projection or initial escrow account statement. The servicer shall 
conduct an escrow account analysis before submitting an annual escrow 
account statement to the borrower.
    (1) Contents of annual escrow account statement. The annual escrow 
account statement shall provide an account history, reflecting the 
activity in the escrow account during the escrow account computation 
year, and a projection of the activity in the account for the next year. 
In preparing the statement, the servicer may assume scheduled payments 
and disbursements will be made for the final 2 months of the escrow 
account computation year. The annual escrow account statement must 
include, at a minimum, the following (the items in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) 
through (i)(1)(iv) must be clearly itemized):
    (i) The amount of the borrower's current monthly mortgage payment 
and the portion of the monthly payment going into the escrow account;
    (ii) The amount of the past year's monthly mortgage payment and the 
portion of the monthly payment that went into the escrow account;
    (iii) The total amount paid into the escrow account during the past 
computation year;
    (iv) The total amount paid out of the escrow account during the same 
period for taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges (as separately 
identified);
    (v) The balance in the escrow account at the end of the period;
    (vi) An explanation of how any surplus is being handled by the 
servicer;
    (vii) An explanation of how any shortage or deficiency is to be paid 
by the borrower; and
    (viii) If applicable, the reason(s) why the estimated low monthly 
balance was not reached, as indicated by noting differences between the 
most recent account history and last year's projection. HUD Public 
Guidance Documents entitled ``Annual Escrow Account Disclosure 
Statement--Format'' and ``Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement--
Example'' set forth an acceptable format and methodology for conveying 
this information.
    (2) No annual statements in the case of default, foreclosure, or 
bankruptcy. This paragraph (i)(2) contains an exemption from the 
provisions of Sec. 3500.17(i)(1). If at the time the servicer conducts 
the escrow account analysis the borrower is more than 30 days overdue, 
then the servicer is exempt from the requirements of submitting an 
annual escrow account statement to the borrower under Sec. 3500.17(i). 
This exemption also applies in situations where the servicer has brought 
an action for foreclosure under the underlying mortgage loan, or where 
the borrower is in bankruptcy proceedings. If the servicer does not 
issue an annual statement pursuant to this exemption and the loan 
subsequently is reinstated or otherwise becomes current, the servicer 
shall provide a history of the account since the last annual statement 
(which may be longer than 1 year) within 90 days of the date the account 
became current.
    (3) Delivery with other material. The servicer may deliver the 
annual escrow account statement to the borrower with other statements or 
materials, including the Substitute 1098, which is provided for federal 
income tax purposes.

[[Page 273]]

    (4) Short year statements. A servicer may issue a short year annual 
escrow account statement (``short year statement'') to change one escrow 
account computation year to another. By using a short year statement a 
servicer may adjust its production schedule or alter the escrow account 
computation year for the escrow account.
    (i) Effect of short year statement. The short year statement shall 
end the ``escrow account computation year'' for the escrow account and 
establish the beginning date of the new escrow account computation year. 
The servicer shall deliver the short year statement to the borrower 
within 60 days from the end of the short year.
    (ii) Short year statement upon servicing transfer. Upon the transfer 
of servicing, the transferor (old) servicer shall submit a short year 
statement to the borrower within 60 days of the effective date of 
transfer.
    (iii) Short year statement upon loan payoff. If a borrower pays off 
a mortgage loan during the escrow account computation year, the servicer 
shall submit a short year statement to the borrower within 60 days after 
receiving the pay-off funds.
    (j) Formats for annual escrow account statement. The formats and 
completed examples for annual escrow account statements using single-
item analysis (pre-rule accounts) and aggregate analysis are set out in 
HUD Public Guidance Documents entitled ``Annual Escrow Account 
Disclosure Statement--Format'' and ``Annual Escrow Account Disclosure 
Statement--Example''.
    (k) Timely payments. (1) If the terms of any federally related 
mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow 
account, the servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner, 
that is, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as long as the 
borrower's payment is not more than 30 days overdue.
    (2) The servicer must advance funds to make disbursements in a 
timely manner as long as the borrower's payment is not more than 30 days 
overdue. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, the servicer may 
seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) For the payment of property taxes from the escrow account, if a 
taxing jurisdiction offers a servicer a choice between annual and 
installment disbursements, the servicer must also comply with this 
paragraph (k)(3). If the taxing jurisdiction neither offers a discount 
for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis nor imposes any additional 
charge or fee for installment disbursements, the servicer must make 
disbursements on an installment basis. If, however, the taxing 
jurisdiction offers a discount for disbursements on a lump sum annual 
basis or imposes any additional charge or fee for installment 
disbursements, the servicer may at the servicer's discretion (but is not 
required by RESPA to), make lump sum annual disbursements in order to 
take advantage of the discount for the borrower or avoid the additional 
charge or fee for installments, as long as such method of disbursement 
complies with paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section. HUD 
encourages, but does not require, the servicer to follow the preference 
of the borrower, if such preference is known to the servicer.
    (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (k)(3) of this section, a servicer and 
borrower may mutually agree, on an individual case basis, to a different 
disbursement basis (installment or annual) or disbursement date for 
property taxes from that required under paragraph (k)(3) of this 
section, so long as the agreement meets the requirements of paragraphs 
(k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section. The borrower must voluntarily agree; 
neither loan approval nor any term of the loan may be conditioned on the 
borrower's agreeing to a different disbursement basis or disbursement 
date.
    (l) System of recordkeeping. (1) Each servicer shall keep records, 
which may involve electronic storage, microfiche storage, or any method 
of computerized storage, so long as the information is easily 
retrievable, reflecting the servicer's handling of each borrower's 
escrow account. The servicer's records shall include, but not be limited 
to, the payment of amounts into and from the escrow account and the 
submission of initial and annual escrow account statements to the 
borrower.
    (2) The servicer responsible for servicing the borrower's escrow 
account

[[Page 274]]

shall maintain the records for that account for a period of at least 
five years after the servicer last serviced the escrow account.
    (3) A servicer shall provide the Secretary with information 
contained in the servicer's records for a specific escrow account, or 
for a number or class of escrow accounts, within 30 days of the 
Secretary's written request for the information. The servicer shall 
convert any information contained in electronic storage, microfiche or 
computerized storage to paper copies for review by the Secretary.
    (i) To aid in investigations, the Secretary may also issue an 
administrative subpoena for the production of documents, and for the 
testimony of such witnesses as the Secretary deems advisable.
    (ii) If the subpoenaed party refuses to obey the Secretary's 
administrative subpoena, the Secretary is authorized to seek a court 
order requiring compliance with the subpoena from any United States 
district court. Failure to obey such an order of the court may be 
punished as contempt of court.
    (4) Borrowers may seek information contained in the servicer's 
records by complying with the provisions set forth in 12 U.S.C. 2605(e) 
and Sec. 3500.21(f).
    (5) After receiving a request (by letter or subpoena) from the 
Department for information relating to whether a servicer submitted an 
escrow account statement to the borrower, the servicer shall respond 
within 30 days. If the servicer is unable to provide the Department with 
such information, the Secretary shall deem that lack of information to 
be evidence of the servicer's failure to submit the statement to the 
borrower.
    (m) Penalties. (1) A servicer's failure to submit to a borrower an 
initial or annual escrow account statement meeting the requirements of 
this part shall constitute a violation of section 10(d) of RESPA (12 
U.S.C. 2609(d)) and this section. For each such violation, the Secretary 
shall assess a civil penalty of 55 dollars ($55), except that the total 
of the assessed penalties shall not exceed $110,000 for any one servicer 
for violations that occur during any consecutive 12-month period.
    (2) Violations described in paragraph (m)(1) of this section do not 
require any proof of intent. However, if a lender or servicer is shown 
to have intentionally disregarded the requirements that it submit the 
escrow account statement to the borrower, then the Secretary shall 
assess a civil penalty of $110 for each violation, with no limit on the 
total amount of the penalty.
    (n) Civil penalties procedures. The following procedures shall apply 
whenever the Department seeks to impose a civil money penalty for 
violation of section 10(c) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2609(c)):
    (1) Purpose and scope. This paragraph (n) explains the procedures by 
which the Secretary may impose penalties under 12 U.S.C. 2609(d). These 
procedures include administrative hearings, judicial review, and 
collection of penalties. This paragraph (n) governs penalties imposed 
under 12 U.S.C. 2609(d) and, when noted, adopts those portions of 24 CFR 
part 30 that apply to all other civil penalty proceedings initiated by 
the Secretary.
    (2) Authority. The Secretary has the authority to impose civil 
penalties under section 10(d) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2609(d)).
    (3) Notice of intent to impose civil money penalties. Whenever the 
Secretary intends to impose a civil money penalty for violations of 
section 10(c) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2609(c)), the responsible program 
official, or his or her designee, shall serve a written Notice of Intent 
to Impose Civil Money Penalties (Notice of Intent) upon any servicer on 
which the Secretary intends to impose the penalty. A copy of the Notice 
of Intent must be filed with the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of 
Administrative Law Judges, at the address provided in the Notice of 
Intent. The Notice of Intent will provide:
    (i) A short, plain statement of the facts upon which the Secretary 
has determined that a civil money penalty should be imposed, including a 
brief description of the specific violations under 12 U.S.C. 2609(c) 
with which the servicer is charged and whether such violations are 
believed to be intentional or unintentional in nature, or a combination 
thereof;
    (ii) The amount of the civil money penalty that the Secretary 
intends to

[[Page 275]]

impose and whether the limitations in 12 U.S.C. 2609(d)(1), apply;
    (iii) The right of the servicer to a hearing on the record to appeal 
the Secretary's preliminary determination to impose a civil penalty;
    (iv) The procedures to appeal the penalty;
    (v) The consequences of failure to appeal the penalty; and
    (vi) The name, address, and telephone number of the representative 
of the Department, and the address of the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of 
Administrative Law Judges, should the servicer decide to appeal the 
penalty.
    (4) Appeal procedures. (i) Answer. To appeal the imposition of a 
penalty, a servicer shall, within 30 days after receiving service of the 
Notice of Intent, file a written Answer with the Chief Docket Clerk, 
Office of Administrative Law Judges, Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, at the address provided in the Notice of Intent. The Answer 
shall include a statement that the servicer admits, denies, or does not 
have (and is unable to obtain) sufficient information to admit or deny 
each allegation made in the Notice of Intent. A statement of lack of 
information shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation that is 
not denied shall be deemed admitted. Failure to submit an Answer within 
the required period of time will result in a decision by the 
Administrative Law Judge based upon the Department's submission of 
evidence in the Notice of Intent.
    (ii) Submission of evidence. A servicer that receives the Notice of 
Intent has a right to present evidence. Evidence must be submitted 
within 45 calendar days from the date of service of the Notice of 
Intent, or by such other time as may be established by the 
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The servicer's failure to submit 
evidence within the required period of time will result in a decision by 
the Administrative Law Judge based upon the Department's submission of 
evidence in the Notice of Intent. The servicer may present evidence of 
the following:
    (A) The servicer did submit the required escrow account statement(s) 
to the borrower(s); or
    (B) Even if the servicer did not submit the required statement(s), 
that the failure was not the result of an intentional disregard of the 
requirements of RESPA (for purposes of determining the penalty).
    (iii) Review of the record. The Administrative Law Judge will review 
the evidence submitted by the servicer, if any, and that submitted by 
the Department. The Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination 
based upon a review of the written record, except that the 
Administrative Law Judge may order an oral hearing if he or she finds 
that the determination turns on the credibility or veracity of a 
witness, or that the matter cannot be resolved by review of the 
documentary evidence. If the Administrative Law Judge decides that an 
oral hearing is appropriate, then the procedural rules set forth at 24 
CFR part 30 shall apply, to the extent that they are not inconsistent 
with this section.
    (iv) Burden of proof. The burden of proof or the burden of going 
forward with the evidence shall be upon the proponent of an action. The 
Department's submission of evidence that the servicer's system of 
records lacks information that the servicer submitted the escrow account 
statement(s) to the borrower(s) shall satisfy the Department's burden. 
Upon the Department's presentation of evidence of this lack of 
information in the servicer's system of records, the burden of proof 
shifts from the Secretary to the servicer to provide evidence that it 
submitted the statement(s) to the borrower.
    (v) Standard of proof. The standard of proof shall be the 
preponderance of the evidence.
    (5) Determination of the Administrative Law Judge. (i) Following the 
hearing or the review of the written record, the Administrative Law 
Judge shall issue a decision that shall contain findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and the amount of any penalties imposed. The 
decision shall include a determination of whether the servicer has 
failed to submit any required statements and, if so, whether the 
servicer's failure was the result of an intentional disregard for the 
law's requirements.
    (ii) The Administrative Law Judge shall issue the decision to all 
parties within 30 days of the submission of the

[[Page 276]]

evidence or the post-hearing briefs, whichever is the last to occur.
    (iii) The decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall constitute 
the final decision of the Department and shall be final and binding on 
the parties.
    (6) Judicial review. (i) A person against whom the Department has 
imposed a civil money penalty under this part may obtain a review of the 
Department's final decision by filing a written petition for a review of 
the record with the appropriate United States district court.
    (ii) The petition must be filed within 30 days after the decision is 
filed with the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of Administrative Law Judges.
    (7) Collection of penalties. (i) If any person fails to comply with 
the Department's final decision imposing a civil money penalty, the 
Secretary, if the time for judicial review of the decision has expired, 
may request the Attorney General to bring an action in an appropriate 
United States district court to obtain a judgment against the person 
that has failed to comply with the Department's final decision.
    (ii) In any such collection action, the validity and appropriateness 
of the Department's final decision imposing the civil penalty shall not 
be subject to review in the district court.
    (iii) The Secretary may obtain such other relief as may be 
available, including attorney fees and other expenses in connection with 
the collection action.
    (iv) Interest on and other charges for any unpaid penalty may be 
assessed in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (8) Offset. In addition to any other rights as a creditor, the 
Secretary may seek to collect a civil money penalty through 
administrative offset.
    (9) At any time before the decision of the Administrative Law Judge, 
the Secretary and the servicer may enter into an administrative 
settlement. The settlement may include provisions for interest, 
attorney's fees, and costs related to the proceeding. Such settlement 
will terminate the appearance before the Administrative Law Judge.
    (o) Discretionary payments. Any borrower's discretionary payment 
(such as credit life or disability insurance) made as part of a monthly 
mortgage payment is to be noted on the initial and annual statements. If 
a discretionary payment is established or terminated during the escrow 
account computation year, this change should be noted on the next annual 
statement. A discretionary payment is not part of the escrow account 
unless the payment is required by the lender, in accordance with the 
definition of ``settlement service'' in Sec. 3500.2, or the servicer 
chooses to place the discretionary payment in the escrow account. If a 
servicer has not established an escrow account for a federally related 
mortgage loan and only receives payments for discretionary items, this 
section is not applicable.

Sec. 3500.19  Enforcement.

    (a) Enforcement policy. It is the policy of the Secretary regarding 
RESPA enforcement matters to cooperate with Federal, State or local 
agencies having supervisory powers over lenders or other persons with 
responsibilities under RESPA. Federal agencies with supervisory powers 
over lenders may use their powers to require compliance with RESPA. In

Sec. 3500.20  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 3500.21  Mortgage servicing transfers.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Master servicer means the owner of the right to perform servicing, 
which may actually perform the servicing itself or may do so through a 
subservicer.
    Mortgage servicing loan means a federally related mortgage loan, as 
that term is defined in Sec. 3500.2, subject to the exemptions in 
Sec. 3500.5, when the mortgage loan is secured by a first lien. The 
definition does not include subordinate lien loans or open-end lines of 
credit (home equity plans) covered by the Truth in Lending Act and 
Regulation Z, including open-end lines of credit secured by a first 
lien.
    Qualified written request means a written correspondence from the 
borrower to the servicer prepared in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section.
    Subservicer means a servicer who does not own the right to perform 
servicing, but who does so on behalf of the master servicer.
    Transferee servicer means a servicer who obtains or who will obtain 
the right to perform servicing functions pursuant to an agreement or 
understanding.
    Transferor servicer means a servicer, including a table funding 
mortgage broker or dealer on a first lien dealer loan, who transfers or 
will transfer the right to perform servicing functions pursuant to an 
agreement or understanding.
    (b) Servicing Disclosure Statement and Applicant Acknowledgement; 
requirements. (1) At the time an application for a mortgage servicing 
loan is submitted, or within 3 business days after submission of the 
application, the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table 
funding, or dealer who anticipates a first lien dealer loan shall 
provide to each person who applies for such a loan a Servicing 
Disclosure Statement. This requirement shall not apply when the 
application for credit is turned down within three business days after 
receipt of the application. A format for the Servicing Disclosure 
Statement appears as appendix MS-1 to this part. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the specific language of the Servicing 
Disclosure Statement is not required to be used, but the Servicing 
Disclosure Statement must include the information set out in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, including the statement of the borrower's rights 
in connection with complaint resolution. The information set forth in 
Instructions to Preparer on the Servicing Disclosure Statement need not 
be included on the form given to applicants, and material in square 
brackets is optional or alternative language.
    (2) The Applicant's Acknowledgement portion of the Servicing 
Disclosure Statement in the format stated is mandatory. Additional lines 
may be added to accommodate more than two applicants.
    (3) The Servicing Disclosure Statement must contain the following 
information, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section:
    (i) Whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold or 
transferred to any other person at any time while the loan is 
outstanding. If the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer in 
a first lien dealer loan does not engage in the servicing of any 
mortgage servicing loans, the disclosure may consist of a statement to 
the effect that there is a current intention to assign, sell, or 
transfer servicing of the loan.
    (ii) The percentages (rounded to the nearest quartile (25%)) of 
mortgage servicing loans originated by the lender in each calendar year 
for which servicing has been assigned, sold, or transferred for such 
calendar year. Compliance with this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is not required 
if the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer on a first lien 
dealer loan chooses option B in the model format in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, including in square

[[Page 278]]

brackets the language ``[and have not serviced mortgage loans in the 
last three years.]''. The percentages shall be provided as follows:
    (A) This information shall be set out for the most recent three 
calendar years completed, with percentages as of the end of each year. 
This information shall be updated in the disclosure no later than March 
31 of the next calendar year. Each percentage should be obtained by 
using as the numerator the number of mortgage servicing loans originated 
during the calendar year for which servicing is transferred within the 
calendar year and, as the denominator, the total number of mortgage 
servicing loans originated in the calendar year. If the volume of 
transfers is less than 12.5 percent, the word ``nominal'' or the actual 
percentage amount of servicing transfers may be used.
    (B) This statistical information does not have to include the 
assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing by the lender 
to an affiliate or subsidiary of the lender. However, lenders may 
voluntarily include transfers to an affiliate or subsidiary. The lender 
should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, 
sales, or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
    (C) In the alternative, if applicable, the following statement may 
be substituted for the statistical information required to be provided 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section: ``We have 
previously assigned, sold, or transferred the servicing of federally 
related mortgage loans.''
    (iii) The best available estimate of the percentage (0 to 25 
percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, or 76 to 100 percent) of 
all loans to be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date of 
origination for which the servicing may be assigned, sold, or 
transferred. Each percentage should be obtained by using as the 
numerator the estimated number of mortgage servicing loans that will be 
originated for which servicing may be transferred within the 12-month 
period and, as the denominator, the estimated total number of mortgage 
servicing loans that will be originated in the 12-month period.
    (A) If the lender, mortgage broker, or dealer anticipates that no 
loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year, the word ``none'' 
may be substituted for ``0 to 25 percent.'' If it is anticipated that 
all loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year, the word 
``all'' may be substituted for ``76 to 100 percent.''
    (B) This statistical information does not have to include the 
estimated assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing to an 
affiliate or subsidiary of that person. However, this information may be 
provided voluntarily. The Servicing Disclosure Statements should 
indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales or 
transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
    (iv) The information set out in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section.
    (v) A written acknowledgement that the applicant (and any co-
applicant) has/have read and understood the disclosure, and understand 
that the disclosure is a required part of the mortgage application. This 
acknowledgement shall be evidenced by the signature of the applicant and 
any co-applicant.
    (4) The following is a model format, which includes several options, 
for complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
The model format may be annotated with additional information that 
clarifies or enhances the model language. The lender or table funding 
mortgage broker (or dealer) should use the language that best describes 
the particular circumstances.
    (i) Model format: The following is the best estimate of what will 
happen to the servicing of your mortgage loan:
    (A) Option A. We may assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of your 
loan while the loan is outstanding. [We are able to service your 
loan[.][,] and we [will] [will not] [haven't decided whether to] service 
your loan.]; or
    (B) Option B. We do not service mortgage loans[.][,] [and have not 
serviced mortgage loans in the past three years.] We presently intend to 
assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of your mortgage loan. You will 
be informed about your servicer.

[[Page 279]]

    (C) As appropriate, the following paragraph may be used:
    We assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of some of our loans 
while the loans are outstanding, depending on the type of loan and other 
factors. For the program for which you have applied, we expect to 
[assign, sell, or transfer all of the mortgage servicing][retain all of 
the mortgage servicing] [assign, sell, or transfer ________% of the 
mortgage servicing].
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (c) Servicing Disclosure Statement and Applicant Acknowledgement; 
delivery. The lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer that 
anticipates a first lien dealer loan shall deliver Servicing Disclosure 
Statements to each applicant for mortgage servicing loans. Each 
applicant or co-applicant must sign an Acknowledgement of receipt of the 
Servicing Disclosure Statement before settlement.
    (1) In the case of a face-to-face interview with one or more 
applicants, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be delivered at the 
time of application. An applicant present at the interview may sign the 
Acknowledgment on his or her own behalf at that time. An applicant 
present at the interview also may accept delivery of the Servicing 
Disclosure Statement on behalf of the other applicants.
    (2) If there is no face-to-face interview, the Servicing Disclosure 
Statement shall be delivered by placing it in the mail, with prepaid 
first-class postage, within 3 business days from receipt of the 
application. If co-applicants indicate the same address on their 
application, one copy delivered to that address is sufficient. If 
different addresses are shown by co-applicants on the application, a 
copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants.
    (3) The signed Applicant Acknowledgment(s) shall be retained for a 
period of 5 years after the date of settlement as part of the loan file 
for every settled loan. There is no requirement for retention of 
Applicant Acknowledgment(s) if the loan is not settled.
    (d) Notices of Transfer; loan servicing--(1) Requirement for notice. 
(i) Except as provided in this paragraph (d)(1)(i) or paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii) of this section, each transferor servicer and transferee 
servicer of any mortgage servicing loan shall deliver to the borrower a 
written Notice of Transfer, containing the information described in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, of any assignment, sale, or transfer 
of the servicing of the loan. The following transfers are not considered 
an assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing for purposes 
of this requirement if there is no change in the payee, address to which 
payment must be delivered, account number, or amount of payment due:
    (A) Transfers between affiliates;
    (B) Transfers resulting from mergers or acquisitions of servicers or 
subservicers; and
    (C) Transfers between master servicers, where the subservicer 
remains the same.
    (ii) The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is not required under 
paragraph (d) of this section to submit to the borrower a Notice of 
Transfer in cases where a mortgage insured under the National Housing 
Act is assigned to FHA.
    (2) Time of notice. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
of this section:
    (A) The transferor servicer shall deliver the Notice of Transfer to 
the borrower not less than 15 days before the effective date of the 
transfer of the servicing of the mortgage servicing loan;
    (B) The transferee servicer shall deliver the Notice of Transfer to 
the borrower not more than 15 days after the effective date of the 
transfer; and
    (C) The transferor and transferee servicers may combine their 
notices into one notice, which shall be delivered to the borrower not 
less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer of the 
servicing of the mortgage servicing loan.
    (ii) The Notice of Transfer shall be delivered to the borrower by 
the transferor servicer or the transferee servicer not more than 30 days 
after the effective date of the transfer of the servicing of the 
mortgage servicing loan in any case in which the transfer of servicing 
is preceded by:
    (A) Termination of the contract for servicing the loan for cause;
    (B) Commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer; or

[[Page 280]]

    (C) Commencement of proceedings by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) for 
conservatorship or receivership of the servicer or an entity that owns 
or controls the servicer.
    (iii) Notices of Transfer delivered at settlement by the transferor 
servicer and transferee servicer, whether as separate notices or as a 
combined notice, will satisfy the timing requirements of paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (3) Notices of Transfer; contents. The Notices of Transfer required 
under paragraph (d) of this section shall include the following 
information:
    (i) The effective date of the transfer of servicing;
    (ii) The name, consumer inquiry addresses (including, at the option 
of the servicer, a separate address where qualified written requests 
must be sent), and a toll-free or collect-call telephone number for an 
employee or department of the transferee servicer;
    (iii) A toll-free or collect-call telephone number for an employee 
or department of the transferor servicer that can be contacted by the 
borrower for answers to servicing transfer inquiries;
    (iv) The date on which the transferor servicer will cease to accept 
payments relating to the loan and the date on which the transferee 
servicer will begin to accept such payments. These dates shall either be 
the same or consecutive days;
    (v) Information concerning any effect the transfer may have on the 
terms or the continued availability of mortgage life or disability 
insurance, or any other type of optional insurance, and any action the 
borrower must take to maintain coverage;
    (vi) A statement that the transfer of servicing does not affect any 
other term or condition of the mortgage documents, other than terms 
directly related to the servicing of the loan; and
    (vii) A statement of the borrower's rights in connection with 
complaint resolution, including the information set forth in paragraph 
(e) of this section. Appendix MS-2 of this part illustrates a statement 
satisfactory to the Secretary.
    (4) Notices of Transfer; sample notice. Sample language that may be 
used to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section is 
set out in appendix MS-2 of this part. Minor modifications to the sample 
language may be made to meet the particular circumstances of the 
servicer, but the substance of the sample language shall not be omitted 
or substantially altered.
    (5) Consumer protection during transfer of servicing. During the 60-
day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing 
of any mortgage servicing loan, if the transferor servicer (rather than 
the transferee servicer that should properly receive payment on the 
loan) receives payment on or before the applicable due date (including 
any grace period allowed under the loan documents), a late fee may not 
be imposed on the borrower with respect to that payment and the payment 
may not be treated as late for any other purposes.
    (e) Duty of loan servicer to respond to borrower inquiries-- (1) 
Notice of receipt of inquiry. Within 20 business days of a servicer of a 
mortgage servicing loan receiving a qualified written request from the 
borrower for information relating to the servicing of the loan, the 
servicer shall provide to the borrower a written response acknowledging 
receipt of the qualified written response. This requirement shall not 
apply if the action requested by the borrower is taken within that 
period and the borrower is notified of that action in accordance with 
the paragraph (f)(3) of this section. By notice either included in the 
Notice of Transfer or separately delivered by first-class mail, postage 
prepaid, a servicer may establish a separate and exclusive office and 
address for the receipt and handling of qualified written requests.
    (2) Qualified written request; defined. (i) For purposes of 
paragraph (e) of this section, a qualified written request means a 
written correspondence (other than notice on a payment coupon or other 
payment medium supplied by the servicer) that includes, or otherwise 
enables the servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower, 
and includes a statement of the reasons that the borrower believes the 
account is in error, if applicable, or that provides sufficient detail 
to the servicer

[[Page 281]]

regarding information relating to the servicing of the loan sought by 
the borrower.
    (ii) A written request does not constitute a qualified written 
request if it is delivered to a servicer more than 1 year after either 
the date of transfer of servicing or the date that the mortgage 
servicing loan amount was paid in full, whichever date is applicable.
    (3) Action with respect to the inquiry. Not later than 60 business 
days after receiving a qualified written request from the borrower, and, 
if applicable, before taking any action with respect to the inquiry, the 
servicer shall:
    (i) Make appropriate corrections in the account of the borrower, 
including the crediting of any late charges or penalties, and transmit 
to the borrower a written notification of the correction. This written 
notification shall include the name and telephone number of a 
representative of the servicer who can provide assistance to the 
borrower; or
    (ii) After conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a 
written explanation or clarification that includes:
    (A) To the extent applicable, a statement of the servicer's reasons 
for concluding the account is correct and the name and telephone number 
of an employee, office, or department of the servicer that can provide 
assistance to the borrower; or
    (B) Information requested by the borrower, or an explanation of why 
the information requested is unavailable or cannot be obtained by the 
servicer, and the name and telephone number of an employee, office, or 
department of the servicer that can provide assistance to the borrower.
    (4) Protection of credit rating. (i) During the 60-business day 
period beginning on the date of the servicer receiving from a borrower a 
qualified written request relating to a dispute on the borrower's 
payments, a servicer may not provide adverse information regarding any 
payment that is the subject of the qualified written request to any 
consumer reporting agency (as that term is defined in section 603 of the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681a).
    (ii) In accordance with section 17 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2615), the 
protection of credit rating provision of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this 
section does not impede a lender or servicer from pursuing any of its 
remedies, including initiating foreclosure, allowed by the underlying 
mortgage loan instruments.
    (f) Damages and costs. (1) Whoever fails to comply with any 
provision of this section shall be liable to the borrower for each 
failure in the following amounts:
    (i) Individuals. In the case of any action by an individual, an 
amount equal to the sum of any actual damages sustained by the 
individual as the result of the failure and, when there is a pattern or 
practice of noncompliance with the requirements of this section, any 
additional damages in an amount not to exceed $1,000.
    (ii) Class actions. In the case of a class action, an amount equal 
to the sum of any actual damages to each borrower in the class that 
result from the failure and, when there is a pattern or practice of 
noncompliance with the requirements of this section, any additional 
damages in an amount not greater than $1,000 for each class member. 
However, the total amount of any additional damages in a class action 
may not exceed the lesser of Sec. 500,000 or 1 percent of the net worth 
of the servicer.
    (iii) Costs. In addition, in the case of any successful action under 
paragraph (f) of this section, the costs of the action and any 
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the action.
    (2) Nonliability. A transferor or transferee servicer shall not be 
liable for any failure to comply with the requirements of this section, 
if within 60 days after discovering an error (whether pursuant to a 
final written examination report or the servicer's own procedures) and 
before commencement of an action under this section and the receipt of 
written notice of the error from the borrower, the servicer notifies the 
person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments are 
necessary in the appropriate account to ensure that the person will not 
be required to pay an amount in excess of any amount that the person 
otherwise would have paid.

[[Page 282]]

    (g) Timely payments by servicer. If the terms of any mortgage 
servicing loan require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of 
the loan for deposit into an escrow account for the purpose of assuring 
payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges with respect to 
the mortgaged property, the servicer shall make payments from the escrow 
account in a timely manner for the taxes, insurance premiums, and other 
charges as the payments become due, as governed by the requirements in 
Sec. 3500.17(k).
    (h) Preemption of State laws. A lender who makes a mortgage 
servicing loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with 
the provisions of any State law or regulation requiring notice to a 
borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing 
of a loan if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of 
this section. Any State law requiring notice to the borrower at the time 
of application or at the time of transfer of servicing of the loan is 
preempted, and there shall be no additional borrower disclosure 
requirements. Provisions of State law, such as those requiring 
additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities, are not 
preempted by section 6 of RESPA or this section, and this additional 
information may be added to a notice prepared under this section, if the 
procedure is allowable under State law.

 Appendix A to Part 3500--Instructions for Completing HUD-1 and HUD-1A 
        Settlement Statements; Sample HUD-1 and HUD-1A Statements

    The following are instructions for completing sections A through L 
of the HUD-1 settlement statement, required under section 4 of RESPA and 
Regulation X of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (24 CFR 
part 3500). This form is to be used as a statement of actual charges and 
adjustments to be given to the parties in connection with the 
settlement. The instructions for completion of the HUD-1 are primarily 
for the benefit of the settlement agents who prepare the statements and 
need not be transmitted to the parties as an integral part of the HUD-1. 
There is no objection to the use of the HUD-1 in transactions in which 
its use is not legally required. Refer to the definitions section of 
Regulation X for specific definitions of many of the terms which are 
used in these instructions.

                          General Instructions

    Information and amounts may be filled in by typewriter, hand 
printing, computer printing, or any other method producing clear and 
legible results. Refer to Regulation X regarding rules applicable to 
reproduction of the HUD-1. An additional page(s) may be attached to the 
HUD-1 for the purpose of including customary recitals and information 
used locally in settlements, for example, a breakdown of payoff figures; 
a breakdown of the Borrower's total monthly mortgage payments; check 
disbursements; a statement indicating receipt of funds; applicable 
special stipulations between Borrower and Seller, and the date funds are 
transferred.
    The settlement agent shall complete the HUD-1 to itemize all charges 
imposed upon the Borrower and the Seller by the Lender and all sales 
commissions, whether to be paid at settlement or outside of settlement, 
and any other charges which either the Borrower or the Seller will pay 
for at settlement. Charges to be paid outside of settlement, including 
cases where a non-settlement agent (i.e., attorneys, title companies, 
escrow agents, real estate agents or brokers) holds the Borrower's 
deposit against the sales price (earnest money) and applies the entire 
deposit towards the charge for the settlement service it is rendering, 
shall be included on the HUD-1 but marked ``P.O.C.'' for ``Paid Outside 
of Closing'' (settlement) and shall not be included in computing totals. 
P.O.C. items should not be placed in the Borrower or Seller columns, but 
rather on the appropriate line next to the columns.
    Blank lines are provided in section L for any additional settlement 
charges. Blank lines are also provided for additional insertions in 
sections J and K. The names of the recipients of the settlement charges 
in section L and the names of the recipients of adjustments described in 
section J or K should be included on the blank lines.
    Lines and columns in section J which relate to the Borrower's 
transaction may be left blank on the copy of the HUD-1 which will be 
furnished to the Seller. Lines and columns in section K which relate to 
the Seller's transaction may be left blank on the copy of the HUD-1 
which will be furnished to the Borrower.

                         Line Item Instructions

    Instructions for completing the individual items on the HUD-1 
follow.
    Section A. This section requires no entry of information.

[[Page 283]]

    Section B. Check appropriate loan type and complete the remaining 
items as applicable.
    Section C. This section provides a notice regarding settlement costs 
and requires no additional entry of information.
    Sections D and E. Fill in the names and current mailing addresses 
and zip codes of the Borrower and the Seller. Where there is more than 
one Borrower or Seller, the name and address of each one is required. 
Use a supplementary page if needed to list multiple Borrowers or 
Sellers.
    Section F. Fill in the name, current mailing address and zip code of 
the Lender.
    Section G. The street address of the property being sold should be 
given. If there is no street address, a brief legal description or other 
location of the property should be inserted. In all cases give the zip 
code of the property.
    Section H. Fill in name, address, and zip code of settlement agent; 
address and zip code of ``place of settlement.''
    Section I. Date of settlement.
    Section J. Summary of Borrower's Transaction. Line 101 is for the 
gross sales price of the property being sold, excluding the price of any 
items of tangible personal property if Borrower and Seller have agreed 
to a separate price for such items.
    Line 102 is for the gross sales price of any items of tangible 
personal property excluded from Line 101. Personal property could 
include such items as carpets, drapes, stoves, refrigerators, etc. What 
constitutes personal property varies from state to state. Manufactured 
homes are not considered personal property for this purpose.
    Line 103 is used to record the total charges to Borrower detailed in 
Section L and totaled on Line 1400.
    Lines 104 and 105 are for additional amounts owed by the Borrower or 
items paid by the Seller prior to settlement but reimbursed by the 
Borrower at settlement. For example, the balance in the Seller's reserve 
account held in connection with an existing loan, if assigned to the 
Borrower in a loan assumption case, will be entered here. These lines 
will also be used when a tenant in the property being sold has not yet 
paid the rent, which the Borrower will collect, for a period of time 
prior to the settlement. The lines will also be used to indicate the 
treatment for any tenant security deposit. The Seller will be credited 
on Lines 404-405.
    Lines 106 through 112 are for items which the Seller had paid in 
advance, and for which the Borrower must therefore reimburse the Seller. 
Examples of items for which adjustments will be made may include taxes 
and assessments paid in advance for an entire year or other period, when 
settlement occurs prior to the expiration of the year or other period 
for which they were paid. Additional examples include flood and hazard 
insurance premiums, if the Borrower is being substituted as an insured 
under the same policy; mortgage insurance in loan assumption cases; 
planned unit development or condominium association assessments paid in 
advance; fuel or other supplies on hand, purchased by the Seller, which 
the Borrower will use when Borrower takes possession of the property; 
and ground rent paid in advance.
    Line 120 is for the total of Lines 101 through 112.
    Line 201 is for any amount paid against the sales price prior to 
settlement.
    Line 202 is for the amount of the new loan made by the Lender or 
first user loan (a loan to finance construction of a new structure or 
purchase of manufactured home where the structure was constructed for 
sale or the manufactured home was purchased for purposes of resale and 
the loan is used as or converted to a loan to finance purchase by the 
first user). For other loans covered by Regulation X which finance 
construction of a new structure or purchase of a manufactured home, list 
the sales price of the land on Line 104, the construction cost or 
purchase price of manufactured home on Line 105 (Line 101 would be left 
blank in this instance) and amount of the loan on Line 202. The 
remainder of the form should be completed taking into account 
adjustments and charges related to the temporary financing and permanent 
financing and which are known at the date of settlement.
    Line 203 is used for cases in which the Borrower is assuming or 
taking title subject to an existing loan or lien on the property.
    Lines 204-209 are used for other items paid by or on behalf of the 
Borrower. Examples include cases in which the Seller has taken a trade-
in or other property from the Borrower in part payment for the property 
being sold. They may also be used in cases in which a Seller (typically 
a builder) is making an ``allowance'' to the Borrower for carpets or 
drapes which the Borrower is to purchase separately. Lines 204-209 can 
also be used to indicate any Seller financing arrangements or other new 
loan not listed in Line 202. For example, if the Seller takes a note 
from the Borrower for part of the sales price, insert the principal 
amount of the note with a brief explanation on Lines 204-209.
    Lines 210 through 219 are for items which have not yet been paid, 
and which the Borrower is expected to pay, but which are attributable in 
part to a period of time prior to the settlement. In jurisdictions in 
which taxes are paid late in the tax year, most cases will show the 
proration of taxes in these lines. Other examples include utilities used 
but not paid for by the Seller, rent collected in advance by the Seller 
from a tenant for a period extending beyond the settlement date, and 
interest on loan assumptions.

[[Page 284]]

    Line 220 is for the total of Lines 201 through 219.
    Lines 301 and 302 are summary lines for the Borrower. Enter total in 
Line 120 on Line 301. Enter total in Line 220 on Line 302.
    Line 303 may indicate either the cash required from the Borrower at 
settlement (the usual case in a purchase transaction) or cash payable to 
the Borrower at settlement (if, for example, the Borrower's deposit 
against the sales price (earnest money) exceeded the Borrower's cash 
obligations in the transaction). Subtract Line 302 from Line 301 and 
enter the amount of cash due to or from the Borrower at settlement on 
Line 303. The appropriate box should be checked.
    Section K. Summary of Seller's Transaction. Instructions for the use 
of Lines 101 and 102 and 104-112 above, apply also to Lines 401-412. 
Line 420 is for the total of Lines 401 through 412.
    Line 501 is used if the Seller's real estate broker or other party 
who is not the settlement agent has received and holds the deposit 
against the sales price (earnest money) which exceeds the fee or 
commission owed to that party, and if that party will render the excess 
deposit directly to the Seller, rather than through the settlement 
agent, the amount of excess deposit should be entered on Line 501 and 
the amount of the total deposit (including commissions) should be 
entered on Line 201.
    Line 502 is used to record the total charges to the Seller detailed 
in section L and totaled on Line 1400.
    Line 503 is used if the Borrower is assuming or taking title subject 
to existing liens which are to be deducted from sales price.
    Lines 504 and 505 are used for the amounts (including any accrued 
interest) of any first and/or second loans which will be paid as part of 
the settlement.
    Line 506 is used for deposits paid by the Borrower to the Seller or 
other party who is not the settlement agent. Enter the amount of the 
deposit in Line 201 on Line 506 unless Line 501 is used or the party who 
is not the settlement agent transfers all or part of the deposit to the 
settlement agent in which case the settlement agent will note in 
parentheses on Line 507 the amount of the deposit which is being 
disbursed as proceeds and enter in column for Line 506 the amount 
retained by the above described party for settlement services. If the 
settlement agent holds the deposit insert a note in Line 507 which 
indicates that the deposit is being disbursed as proceeds.
    Lines 506 through 509 may be used to list additional liens which 
must be paid off through the settlement to clear title to the property. 
Other payoffs of Seller obligations should be shown on Lines 506-509 
(but not on Lines 1303-1305). They may also be used to indicate funds to 
be held by the settlement agent for the payment of water, fuel, or other 
utility bills which cannot be prorated between the parties at settlement 
because the amounts used by the Seller prior to settlement are not yet 
known. Subsequent disclosure of the actual amount of these post-
settlement items to be paid from settlement funds is optional. Any 
amounts entered on Lines 204-209 including Seller financing arrangements 
should also be entered on Lines 506-509.
    Instructions for the use of Lines 510 through 519 are the same as 
those for Lines 210 to 219 above.
    Line 520 is for the total of Lines 501 through 519.
    Lines 601 and 602 are summary lines for the Seller. Enter total in 
Line 420 on Line 610. Enter total in Line 520 on Line 602.
    Line 603 may indicate either the cash required to be paid to the 
Seller at settlement (the usual case in a purchase transaction) or cash 
payable by the Seller at settlement. Subtract Line 602 from Line 601 and 
enter the amount of cash due to or from the Seller at settlement on Line 
603. The appropriate box should be checked.
    Section L. Settlement Charges.
    For all items except for those paid to and retained by the Lender, 
the name of the person or firm ultimately receiving the payment should 
be shown. In the case of ``no cost'' or ``no point'' loans, the charge 
to be paid by the lender to an affiliated or independent service 
provider should be shown as P.O.C. (Paid Outside of Closing) and should 
not be used in computing totals. Such charges also include indirect 
payments or back-funded payments to mortgage brokers that arise from the 
settlement transaction. When used, ``P.O.C.'' should be placed in the 
appropriate lines next to the identified item, not in the columns 
themselves.
    Line 700 is used to enter the sales commission charged by the sales 
agent or broker. If the sales commission is based on a percentage of the 
price, enter the sales price, the percentage, and the dollar amount of 
the total commission paid by the Seller.
    Lines 701-702 are to be used to state the split of the commission 
where the settlement agent disburses portions of the commission to two 
or more sales agents or brokers.
    Line 703 is used to enter the amount of sales commission disbursed 
at settlement. If the sales agent or broker is retaining a part of the 
deposit against the sales price (earnest money) to apply towards the 
sales agent's or broker's commission, include in Line 703 only that part 
of the commission being disbursed at settlement and insert a note on 
Line 704 indicating the amount the sales agent or broker is retaining as 
a ``P.O.C.'' item.
    Line 704 may be used for additional charges made by the sales agent 
or broker, or for a sales commission charged to the Borrower,

[[Page 285]]

which will be disbursed by the settlement agent.
    Line 801 is used to record the fee charged by the Lender for 
processing or originating the loan. If this fee is computed as a 
percentage of the loan amount, enter the percentage in the blank 
indicated.
    Line 802 is used to record the loan discount or ``points'' charged 
by the Lender, and, if it is computed as a percentage of the loan 
amount, enter the percentage in the blank indicated.
    Line 803 is used for appraisal fees if there is a separate charge 
for the appraisal. Appraisal fees for HUD and VA loans are also included 
on Line 803.
    Line 804 is used for the cost of the credit report if there is a 
charge separate from the origination fee.
    Line 805 is used only for inspections by the Lender or the Lender's 
agents. Charges for other pest or structural inspections required to be 
stated by these instructions should be entered in Lines 1301-1305.
    Line 806 should be used for an application fee required by a private 
mortgage insurance company.
    Line 807 is provided for convenience in using the form for loan 
assumption transactions.
    Lines 808-811 are used to list additional items payable in 
connection with the loan including a CLO Access fee, a mortgage broker 
fee, fees for real estate property taxes or other real property charges.
    Lines 901-905. This series is used to record the items which the 
Lender requires (but which are not necessarily paid to the lender, i.e., 
FHA mortgage insurance premium) to be paid at the time of settlement, 
other than reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in 1000 series.
    Line 901 is used if interest is collected at settlement for a part 
of a month or other period between settlement and the date from which 
interest will be collected with the first regular monthly payment. Enter 
that amount here and include the per diem charges. If such interest is 
not collected until the first regular monthly payment, no entry should 
be made on Line 901.
    Line 902 is used for mortgage insurance premiums due and payable at 
settlement, except reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in the 
1000 series. A lump sum mortgage insurance premium paid at settlement 
should be inserted on Line 902, with a note that indicates that the 
premium is for the life of the loan.
    Line 903 is used for hazard insurance premiums which the Lender 
requires to be paid at the time of settlement except reserves collected 
by the Lender and recorded in the 1000 series.
    Lines 904 and 905 are used to list additional items required by the 
Lender (except for reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in the 
1000 series) including flood insurance, mortgage life insurance, credit 
life insurance and disability insurance premiums. These lines are also 
used to list amounts paid at settlement for insurance not required by 
the Lender.
    Lines 1000-1008. This series is used for amounts collected by the 
Lender from the Borrower and held in an account for the future payment 
of the obligations listed as they fall due. Include the time period 
(number of months) and the monthly assessment. In many jurisdictions 
this is referred to as an ``escrow'', ``impound'', or ``trust'' account. 
In addition to the items listed, some Lenders may require reserves for 
flood insurance, condominium owners' association assessments, etc.
    After itemizing individual deposits in the 1000 series using single-
item accounting, the servicer shall make an adjustment based on 
aggregate accounting. This adjustment equals the difference between the 
deposit required under aggregate accounting and the sum of the deposits 
required under single-item accounting. The computation steps for both 
accounting methods are set out in Sec. 3500.17(d). The adjustment will 
always be a negative number or zero (-0-). The settlement agent shall 
enter the aggregate adjustment amount on a final line in the 1000 series 
of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A statement.
    During the phase-in period, as defined in Sec. 3500.17(b), an 
alternative procedure is available. If a servicer has not yet conducted 
the escrow account analysis to determine the aggregate accounting 
starting balance, the settlement agent may initially calculate the 1000 
series deposits for the HUD-1 and HUD-1A settlement statement using 
single-item analysis with a one-month cushion (unless the mortgage loan 
documents indicate a smaller amount). In the escrow account analysis 
conducted within 45 days of settlement, the servicer shall adjust the 
escrow account to reflect the aggregate accounting balance.
    Lines 1100-1113. This series covers title charges and charges by 
attorneys. The title charges include a variety of services performed by 
title companies or others and includes fees directly related to the 
transfer of title (title examination, title search, document 
preparation) and fees for title insurance. The legal charges include 
fees for Lender's, Seller's or Buyer's attorney, or the attorney 
preparing title work. The series also includes any fees for settlement 
or closing agents and notaries. In many jurisdictions the same person 
(for example, an attorney or a title insurance company) performs several 
of the services listed in this series and makes a single overall charge 
for such services. In such cases, enter the overall fee on Line 1107 
(for attorneys), or Line 1108 (for title companies), and enter on that 
line the item numbers of the services listed which are

[[Page 286]]

covered in the overall fee. If this is done, no individual amounts need 
be entered into the borrower's and seller's columns for the individual 
items which are covered by the overall fee. In transactions involving 
more than one attorney, one attorney's fees should appear on Line 1107 
and the other attorney's fees should be on Line 1111, 1112 or 1113. If 
an attorney is representing a buyer, seller, or lender and is also 
acting as a title agent, indicate on line 1107 which services are 
covered by the attorney fee and on line 1113 which services are covered 
by the insurance commission.
    Line 1101 is used for the settlement agent's fee.
    Lines 1102 and 1103 are used for the fees for the abstract or title 
search and title examination. In some jurisdictions the same person both 
searches the title (that is, performs the necessary research in the 
records) and examines title (that is, makes a determination as to what 
matters affect title, and provides a title report or opinion). If such a 
person charges only one fee for both services, it should be entered on 
Line 1103 unless the person performing these tasks is an attorney or a 
title company in which case the fees should be entered as described in 
the general directions for Lines 1100-1113. If separate persons perform 
these tasks, or if separate charges are made for searching and 
examination, they should be listed separately.
    Line 1104 is used for the title insurance binder which is also known 
as a commitment to insure.
    Line 1105 is used for charges for preparation of deeds, mortgages, 
notes, etc. If more than one person receives a fee for such work in the 
same transaction, show the total paid in the appropriate column and the 
individual charges on the line following the word ``to.''
    Line 1106 is used for the fee charged by a notary public for 
authenticating the execution of settlement documents.
    Line 1107 is used to disclose the attorney's fees for the 
transaction. The instructions are discussed in the general directions 
for Lines 1100-1113. This line should include any charges by an attorney 
to represent a buyer, seller or lender in the real estate transaction.
    Lines 1108-1110 are used for information regarding title insurance. 
Enter the total charge for title insurance (except for the cost of the 
title binder) on Line 1108. Enter on Lines 1109 and 1110 the individual 
charges for the Lender's and owner's policies. Note that these charges 
are not carried over into the Borrower's and Seller's columns, since to 
do so would result in a duplication of the amount in Line 1108. If a 
combination Lender's/owner's policy is purchased, show this amount as an 
additional entry on Lines 1109 and 1110.
    Lines 1111-1113 are for the entry of other title charges not already 
itemized. Examples in some jurisdictions would include a fee to a 
private tax service, a fee to a county tax collector for a tax 
certificate, or a fee to a public title registrar for a certificate of 
title in a Torrens Act transaction. Line 1113 should be used to disclose 
services that are covered by the commission of an attorney acting as a 
title agent when Line 1107 is already being used to disclose the fees 
and services of the attorney in representing the buyer, seller, or 
lender in the real estate transaction.
    Lines 1201-1205 are used for government recording and transfer 
charges. Recording and transfer charges should be itemized. Additional 
recording or transfer charges should be listed on Lines 1204 and 1205.
    Lines 1301 and 1302, or any other available blank line in the 1300 
series, are used for fees for survey, pest inspection, radon inspection, 
lead-based paint inspection, or other similar inspections.
    Lines 1303-1305 are used for any other settlement charges not 
referable to the categories listed above on the HUD-1, which are 
required to be stated by these instructions. Examples may include 
structural inspections or pre-sale inspection of heating, plumbing, or 
electrical equipment. These inspection charges may include a fee for 
insurance or warranty coverage.
    Line 1400 is for the total settlement charges paid from Borrower's 
funds and Seller's funds. These totals are also entered on Lines 103 and 
502, respectively, in sections J and K.

              Line Item Instructions for Completing HUD-1A

    Note: HUD-1A is an optional form that may be used for refinancing 
and subordinate lien federally related mortgage loans, as well as for 
any other one-party transaction that does not involve the transfer of 
title to residential real property. The HUD-1 form may also be used for 
such transactions, by utilizing the borrower's side of the HUD-1 and 
following the relevant parts of the instructions as set forth above. The 
use of either the HUD-1 or HUD-1A is not mandatory for open-end lines of 
credit (home-equity plans), as long as the provisions of Regulation Z 
are followed.

                               Background

    The HUD-1A settlement statement is to be used as a statement of 
actual charges and adjustments to be given to the borrower at 
settlement, as defined in this part. The instructions for completion of 
the HUD-1A are for the benefit of the settlement agent who prepares the 
statement; the instructions are not a part of the statement and need not 
be transmitted to the borrower. There is no objection to using the HUD-
1A in transactions in which it is not required, and its use in open-end 
lines of credit transactions (home-

[[Page 287]]

equity plans) is encouraged. It may not be used as a substitute for a 
HUD-1 in any transaction in which there is a transfer of title and a 
first lien is taken as security.
    Refer to the ``definitions'' section of Regulation X for specific 
definitions of terms used in these instructions.

                          General Instructions

    Information and amounts may be filled in by typewriter, hand 
printing, computer printing, or any other method producing clear and 
legible results. Refer to Sec. 3500.9 regarding rules for reproduction 
of the HUD-1A. Additional pages may be attached to the HUD-1A for the 
inclusion of customary recitals and information used locally for 
settlements or if there are insufficient lines on the HUD-1A.
    The settlement agent shall complete the HUD-1A to itemize all 
charges imposed upon the borrower by the lender, whether to be paid at 
settlement or outside of settlement, and any other charges that the 
borrower will pay for at settlement. In the case of ``no cost'' or ``no 
point'' loans, these charges include any payments the lender will make 
to affiliated or independent settlement service providers relating to 
this settlement. These charges shall be included on the HUD-1A, but 
marked ``P.O.C.'' for ``paid outside of closing,'' and shall not be used 
in computing totals. Such charges also include indirect payments or 
back-funded payments to mortgage brokers that arise from the settlement 
transaction. When used, ``P.O.C.'' should be placed in the appropriate 
lines next to the identified item, not in the columns themselves.
    Blank lines are provided in section L for any additional settlement 
charges. Blank lines are also provided in section M for recipients of 
all or portions of the loan proceeds. The names of the recipients of the 
settlement charges in section L and the names of the recipients of the 
loan proceeds in section M should be set forth on the blank lines.

                         Line Item Instructions

    The identification information at the top of the HUD-1A should be 
completed as follows:
    The borrower's name and address is entered in the space provided. If 
the property securing the loan is different from the borrower's address, 
the address or other location information on the property should be 
entered in the space provided. The loan number is the lender's 
identification number for the loan. The settlement date is the date of 
settlement in accordance with Sec. 3500.2, not the end of any applicable 
rescission period. The name and address of the lender should be entered 
in the space provided.
    Section L. Settlement Charges. This section of the HUD-1A is similar 
to section L of the HUD-1, with minor changes or omissions, including 
deletion of lines 700 through 704, relating to real estate broker 
commissions. The instructions for section L in the HUD-1, should be 
followed insofar as possible. Inapplicable charges should be ignored, as 
should any instructions regarding seller items.
    Line 1400 in the HUD-1A is for the total settlement charges charged 
to the borrower. Enter this total on line 1602 as well. This total 
should include section L amounts from additional pages, if any are 
attached to this HUD-1A.
    Section M. Disbursement to Others. This section is used to list 
payees, other than the borrower, of all or portions of the loan proceeds 
(including the lender, if the loan is paying off a prior loan made by 
the same lender), when the payee will be paid directly out of the 
settlement proceeds. It is not used to list payees of settlement 
charges, nor to list funds disbursed directly to the borrower, even if 
the lender knows the borrower's intended use of the funds.
    For example, in a refinancing transaction, the loan proceeds are 
used to pay off an existing loan. The name of the lender for the loan 
being paid off and the pay-off balance would be entered in section M. In 
a home improvement transaction when the proceeds are to be paid to the 
home improvement contractor, the name of the contractor and the amount 
paid to the contractor would be entered in section M. In a consolidation 
loan, or when part of the loan proceeds is used to pay off other 
creditors, the name of each creditor and the amount paid to that 
creditor would be entered in section M. If the proceeds are to be given 
directly to the borrower and the borrower will use the proceeds to pay 
off existing obligations, this would not be reflected in section M.
    Section N. Net Settlement. Line 1600 normally sets forth the 
principal amount of the loan as it appears on the related note for this 
loan. In the event this form is used for an open-ended home equity line 
whose approved amount is greater than the initial amount advanced at 
settlement, the amount shown on Line 1600 will be the loan amount 
advanced at settlement. Line 1601 is used for all settlement charges 
that are both included in the totals for lines 1400 and 1602 and are not 
financed as part of the principal amount of the loan. This is the amount 
normally received by the lender from the borrower at settlement, which 
would occur when some or all of the settlement charges were paid in cash 
by the borrower at settlement, instead of being financed as part of the 
principal amount of the loan. Failure to include any such amount in line 
1601 will result in an error in the amount calculated on line 1604. 
P.O.C. amounts should not be included in line 1601.
    Line 1602 is the total amount from line 1400.

[[Page 288]]

    Line 1603 is the total amount from line 1520.
    Line 1604 is the amount disbursed to the borrower. This is 
determined by adding together the amounts for lines 1600 and 1601, and 
then subtracting any amounts listed on lines 1602 and 1603.

     Appendix B to Part 3500--Illustrations of Requirements of RESPA

    The following illustrations provide additional guidance on the 
meaning and coverage of the provisions of RESPA. Other provisions of 
Federal or State law may also be applicable to the practices and 
payments discussed in the following illustrations.
    1. Facts: A, a provider of settlement services, provides settlement 
services at abnormally low rates or at no charge at all to B, a builder, 
in connection with a subdivision being developed by B. B agrees to refer 
purchasers of the completed homes in the subdivision to A for the 
purchase of settlement services in connection with the sale of 
individual lots by B.
    Comments: The rendering of services by A to B at little or no charge 
constitutes a thing of value given by A to B in return for the referral 
of settlement services business and both A and B are in violation of 
section 8 of RESPA.
    2. Facts: B, a lender, encourages persons who receive federally-
related mortgage loans from it to employ A, an attorney, to perform 
title searches and related settlement services in connection with their 
transaction. B and A have an understanding that in return for the 
referral of this business A provides legal services to B or B's officers 
or employees at abnormally low rates or for no charge.
    Comments: Both A and B are in violation of section 8 of RESPA. 
Similarly, if an attorney gives a portion of his or her fees to another 
attorney, a lender, a real estate broker or any other provider of 
settlement services, who had referred prospective clients to the 
attorney, section 8 would be violated by both persons.
    3. Facts: A, a real estate broker, obtains all necessary licenses 
under state law to act as a title insurance agent. A refers individuals 
who are purchasing homes in transactions in which A participates as a 
broker to B, an unaffiliated title company, for the purchase of title 
insurance services. A performs minimal, if any, title services in 
connection with the issuance of the title insurance policy (such as 
placing an application with the title company). B pays A a commission 
(or A retains a portion of the title insurance premium) for the 
transactions or alternatively B receives a portion of the premium paid 
directly from the purchaser.
    Comments: The payment of a commission or portion of the title 
insurance premium by B to A, or receipt of a portion of the payment for 
title insurance under circumstances where no substantial services are 
being performed by A is a violation of section 8 of RESPA. It makes no 
difference whether the payment comes from B or the purchaser. The amount 
of the payment must bear a reasonable relationship to the services 
rendered. Here A really is being compensated for a referral of business 
to B.
    4. Facts: A is an attorney who, as a part of his legal 
representation of clients in residential real estate transactions, 
orders and reviews title insurance policies for his clients. A enters 
into a contract with B, a title company, to be an agent of B under a 
program set up by B. Under the agreement, A agrees to prepare and 
forward title insurance applications to B, to re-examine the preliminary 
title commitment for accuracy and if he chooses to attempt to clear 
exceptions to the title policy before closing. A agrees to assume 
liability for waiving certain exceptions to title, but never exercises 
this authority. B performs the necessary title search and examination 
work, determines insurability of title, prepares documents containing 
substantive information in title commitments, handles closings for A's 
clients and issues title policies. A receives a fee from his client for 
legal services and an additional fee for his title agent ``services'' 
from the client's title insurance premium to B.
    Comments: A and B are violating section 8 of RESPA. Here, A's 
clients are being double billed because the work A performs as a ``title 
agent'' is that which he already performs for his client in his capacity 
as an attorney. For A to receive a separate payment as a title agent, A 
must perform necessary core title work and may not contract out the 
work. To receive additional compensation as a title agent for this 
transaction, A must provide his client with core title agent services 
for which he assumes liability, and which includes, at a minimum, the 
evaluation of the title search to determine insurability of the title, 
and the issuance of a title commitment where customary, the clearance of 
underwriting objections, and the actual issuance of the policy or 
policies on behalf of the title company. A may not be compensated for 
the mere re-examination of work performed by B. Here, A is not 
performing these services and may not be compensated as a title agent 
under section 8(c)(1)(B). Referral fees or splits of fees may not be 
disguised as title agent commissions when the core title agent work is 
not performed. Further, because B created the program and gave A the 
opportunity to collect fees (a thing of value) in exchange for the 
referral of settlement service business, it has violated section 8 of 
RESPA.
    5. Facts: A, a ``mortgage originator,'' receives loan applications, 
funds the loans with its own money or with a wholesale line

[[Page 294]]

of credit for which A is liable, and closes the loans in A's own name. 
Subsequently, B, a mortgage lender, purchases the loans and compensates 
A for the value of the loans, as well as for any mortgage servicing 
rights.
    Comments: Compensation for the sale of a mortgage loan and servicing 
rights constitutes a secondary market transaction, rather than a 
referral fee, and is beyond the scope of section 8 of RESPA. For 
purposes of section 8, in determining whether a bona fide transfer of 
the loan obligation has taken place, HUD examines the real source of 
funding, and the real interest of the named settlement lender.
    6. Facts. A, a credit reporting company, places a facsimile 
transmission machine (FAX) in the office of B, a mortgage lender, so 
that B can easily transmit requests for credit reports and A can 
respond. A supplies the FAX machine at no cost or at a reduced rental 
rate based on the number of credit reports ordered.
    Comments: Either situation violates section 8 of RESPA. The FAX 
machine is a thing of value that A provides in exchange for the referral 
of business from B. Copying machines, computer terminals, printers, or 
other like items which have general use to the recipient and which are 
given in exchange for referrals of business also violate RESPA.
    7. Facts: A, a real estate broker, refers title business to B, a 
company that is a licensed title agent for C, a title insurance company. 
A owns more than 1% of B. B performs the title search and examination, 
makes determinations of insurability, issues the commitment, clears 
underwriting objections, and issues a policy of title insurance on 
behalf of C, for which C pays B a commission. B pays annual dividends to 
its owners, including A, based on the relative amount of business each 
of its owners refers to B.
    Comments: The facts involve an affiliated business arrangement. The 
payments of a commission by C to B is not a violation of section 8 of 
RESPA if the amount of the commission constitutes reasonable 
compensation for the services performed by B for C. The payment of a 
dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A that is 
based on the amount of business referred to B by A does not meet the 
affiliated business agreement exemption provisions and such actions 
violate section 8. Similarly, if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, 
if B were a partnership, the distribution of partnership profits by B to 
A) varies based on the amount of business referred or expected to be 
referred, or if B retained any funds for subsequent distribution to A 
where such funds were generally in proportion to the amount of business 
A referred to B relative to the amount referred by other owners such 
arrangements would violate section 8. The exemption for controlled 
business arrangements would not be available because the payments here 
would not be considered returns on ownership interests. Further, the 
required disclosure of the affiliated business arrangement and estimated 
charges have not been provided.
    8. Facts: Same as illustration 7, but B pays annual dividends in 
proportion to the amount of stock held by its owners, including A, and 
the distribution of annual dividends is not based on the amount of 
business referred or expected to be referred.
    Comments: If A and B meet the requirements of the affiliated 
business arrangement exemption there is not a violation of RESPA. Since 
the payment is a return on ownership interests, A and B will be exempt 
from section 8 if (1) A also did not require anyone to use the services 
of B, and (2) A disclosed its ownership interest in B on a separate 
disclosure form and provided an estimate of B's charges to each person 
referred by A to B (see appendix D of this part), and (3) B makes no 
payment (nor is there any other thing of value exchanged) to A other 
than dividends.
    9. Facts: A, a franchisor for franchised real estate brokers, owns 
B, a provider of settlement services. C, a franchisee of A, refers 
business to B.
    Comments: This is an affiliated business arrangement. A, B and C 
will all be exempt from section 8 if C discloses its franchise 
relationship with the owner of B on a separate disclosure form and 
provides an estimate of B's charges to each person referred to B (see 
appendix D of this part) and C does not require anyone to use B's 
services and A gives no thing a value to C under the franchise agreement 
(such as an adjusted level of franchise payment based on the referrals), 
and B makes no payments to A other than dividends representing a return 
on ownership interest (rather than, e.g., an adjusted level of payment 
being based on the referrals). Nor may B pay C anything of value for the 
referral.
    10. Facts: A is a real estate broker who refers business to its 
affiliate title company B. A makes all required written disclosures to 
the homebuyer of the arrangement and estimated charges and the homebuyer 
is not required to use B. B refers or contracts out business to C who 
does all the title work and splits the fee with B. B passes its fee to A 
in the form of dividends, a return on ownership interest.
    Comments: The relationship between A and B is an affiliated business 
arrangement. However, the affiliated business arrangement exemption does 
not provide exemption between an affiliated entity, B, and a third 
party, C. Here, B is a mere ``shell'' and provides no substantive 
services for its portion of the fee. The arrangement between B and C 
would be in violation of section 8(a) and (b). Even if B had an 
affiliate relationship with C, the required exemption criteria have not

[[Page 295]]

been met and the relationship would be subject to section 8.
    11. Facts: A, a mortgage lender is affiliated with B, a title 
company, and C, an escrow company and offers consumers a package of 
mortgage title and escrow services at a discount from the prices at 
which such services would be sold if purchased separately. Neither A, B, 
nor C, requires consumers to purchase the services of their sister 
companies and each company sells such services separately and as part of 
the package. A also pays its employees (i.e., loan officers, 
secretaries, etc.,) a bonus for each loan, title insurance or closing 
that A's employees generate for A, B, or C respectively. A pays such 
employee bonuses out of its own funds and receives no payments or 
reimbursements for such bonuses from B or C. At or before the time that 
customers are told by A or its employees about the services offered by B 
and C and/of the package of services that is available, the customers 
are provided with an affiliated business disclosure form.
    Comments: A's selling of a package of settlement services at a 
discount to a settlement service purchaser does not violate section 8 of 
RESPA. A's employees are making appropriate affiliated business 
disclosures and since the services are available separately and as part 
of a package, there is not ``required use'' of the additional services. 
A's payments of bonuses to its employees for the referral of business to 
A or A's affiliates, B and C, are exempt from section 8 under section 
3500.14(g)(1). However, if B or C reimbursed A for any bonuses that A 
paid to its employees for referring business to B or C, such 
reimbursements would violate section 8. Similarly, if B or C paid 
bonuses to A's employees directly for generating business for them, such 
payments would violate section 8.
    12. Facts: A, a real estate broker, is affiliated with B, a mortgage 
lender, and C, a title agency. A employs F to advise and assist any 
customers of A who have executed sales contracts regarding mortgage 
loans and title insurance. F collects and transmits (by computer, fax, 
mail, or other means) loan applications or other information to B and C 
for processing. A pays F a small salary and a bonus for every loan 
closed with B or title insurance issued with C. F furnishes the 
controlled business disclosure to consumers at the time of each 
referral. F receives no other compensation from the real estate or 
mortgage transaction and performs no settlement services in any 
transaction. At the end of each of A's fiscal years, M, a managerial 
employee of A, receives a $1,000 bonus if 20% of the consumers who 
purchase a home through A close a loan on the home with B and have the 
title issued by C. During the year, M acted as a real estate agent for 
his neighbor and received a real estate sales commission for selling his 
neighbor's home.
    Comments: Under Sec. 3500.14(g)(1), employers may pay their own bona 
fide employees for generating business for their employer 
(Sec. 3500.14(g)(1)(vii)). Employers may also pay their own bona fide 
employees for generating business for their affiliate business entities 
(Sec. 3500.14(g)(1)(ix)), as long as the employees do not perform 
settlement services in any transaction and disclosure is made. This 
permits a company to employ a person whose primary function is to market 
the employer's or its affiliate's settlement services (frequently 
referred to as a Financial Services Representative, or ``FSR''). An FSR 
may not perform any settlement services including, for example, those 
services of a real estate agent, loan processor, settlement agent, 
attorney, or mortgage broker. In accordance with the terms of the 
exemption at Sec. 3500.14(g)(1)(ix), the marketing of a settlement 
service or product of an affiliated entity, including the collection and 
conveyance of information or the taking of an application or order for 
the services of an affiliated entity, does not constitute the 
performance of a settlement service. Under the exemption, marketing of a 
settlement service or product also may include incidental communications 
with the consumer after the application or order, such as providing the 
consumer with information about the status of an application or order; 
marketing may not include serving as the ongoing point of contact for 
coordinating the delivery and provision of settlement services.
    Thus, in the circumstances described, F and M may receive the 
additional compensation without violating RESPA.
    Also, employers may pay managerial employees compensation in the 
form of bonuses based on a percentage of transactions completed by an 
affiliated company (frequently called a ``capture rate''), as long as 
the payment is not directly calculated as a multiple of the number or 
value of the referrals. 24 CFR 3500.14(g)(1)(viii). A managerial 
employee who receives compensation for performing settlement services in 
three or fewer transactions in any calendar year ``does not routinely'' 
deal directly with the consumer and is not precluded from receiving 
managerial compensation.
    13. Facts. A is a mortgage broker who provides origination services 
to submit a loan to a Lender for approval. The mortgage broker charges 
the borrower a uniform fee for the total origination services, as well 
as a direct up-front charge for reimbursement of credit reporting, 
appraisal services or similar charges.
    Comment. The mortgage broker's fee must be itemized in the Good 
Faith Estimate and on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Other charges 
which are paid for by the borrower and paid in advance are listed as 
P.O.C. on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement, and reflect the actual 
provider charge for such

[[Page 296]]

services. Also, any other fee or payment received by the mortgage broker 
from either the lender or the borrower arising from the initial funding 
transaction, including a servicing release premium or yield spread 
premium, is to be noted on the Good Faith Estimate and listed in the 800 
series of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.
    14. Facts. A is a dealer in home improvements who has established 
funding arrangements with several lenders. Customers for home 
improvements receive a proposed contract from A. The proposal requires 
that customers both execute forms authorizing a credit check and 
employment verification, and, frequently, execute a dealer consumer 
credit contract secured by a lien on the customer's (borrower's) 1- to 
4-family residential property. Simultaneously with the completion and 
certification of the home improvement work, the note is assigned by the 
dealer to a funding lender.
    Comments. The loan that is assigned to the funding lender is a loan 
covered by RESPA, when a lien is placed on the borrower's 1- to 4-family 
residential structure. The dealer loan or consumer credit contract 
originated by a dealer is also a RESPA-covered transaction, except when 
the dealer is not a ``creditor'' under the definition of ``federally 
related mortgage loan'' in Sec. 3500.2. The lender to whom the loan will 
be assigned is responsible for assuring that the lender or the dealer 
delivers to the borrower a Good Faith Estimate of closing costs 
consistent with Regulation X, and that the HUD-1 or HUD-1A Settlement 
Statement is used in conjunction with the settlement of the loan to be 
assigned. A dealer who, under Sec. 3500.2, is covered by RESPA as a 
creditor is responsible for the Good Faith Estimate of Closing Costs and 
the use of the appropriate settlement statement in connection with the 
loan.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 29253, June 7, 1996, appendix B to 
part 3500 was amended by revising Illustration 11, redesignating 
Illustrations 12 and 13 as Illustrations 13 and 14, respectively, and 
adding a new Illustration 12, effective Oct. 7, 1996. At 61 FR 51782, 
Oct. 4, 1996, the effective date was delayed until further notice. For 
the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:

     Appendix B to Part 3500--Illustrations of Requirements of RESPA

                                * * * * *

    11. Facts: A, a mortgage lender, is affiliated with B, a title 
company, and C, an escrow company, and offers consumers a package of 
mortgage, title, and escrow services at a discount from the prices at 
which such services would be sold if purchased separately. A, B, and C 
are subsidiaries of H, a holding company, which also controls a retail 
stock brokerage firm, D. None of A, B, or C requires consumers to 
purchase the services of its sister companies, and each company sells 
such services separately and as part of the package. A also pays an 
employee T, a full-time bank teller who does not perform settlement 
services, a bonus for each loan, title insurance binder, or closing that 
T generates for A, B, or C. A pays T these bonuses out of A's own funds 
and receives no reimbursements for these bonuses from B, C, or H. At the 
time that T refers customers to B and C, T provides the customers with a 
disclosure using the controlled business arrangement disclosure format. 
Also, Z, a stockbroker employee of D, occasionally refers her customers 
to A, B, or C; gives a statement in the controlled business disclosure 
format; and receives a payment from D for each referral.
    Comments: Selling a package of settlement services at a discount is 
not prohibited by RESPA, consistent with the definition of ``required 
use'' in 24 CFR 3500.2. Also, A is always allowed to compensate its own 
employees for business generated for A's company. Here, A may also 
compensate T, an employee who does not perform settlement services in 
this or any transaction, for referring business to a business entity in 
an affiliate relationship with A. Z, who does not perform settlement 
services in this or any transaction, can also be compensated by D, but 
not by anyone else. Employees who perform settlement services cannot be 
compensated for referrals to other settlement service providers. None of 
the entities in an affiliated relationship with each other may pay for 
referrals received from an affiliate's employees. Sections 
3500.15(b)(3)(i)(A) and (B) set forth the permissible exchanges of funds 
between controlled business entities. In all circumstances described a 
statement in the controlled business disclosure format must be provided 
to a potential consumer at or before the time that the referral is made.

    These estimates are provided pursuant to the Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act of 1974, as amended (RESPA). Additional information can 
be found in the HUD Special Information Booklet, which is to be provided 
to you by your mortgage broker or lender, if your application is to 
purchase residential real property and the Lender will take a first lien 
on the property.

                                Footnotes

    \1\ The name of the lender shall be placed at the top of the form. 
Additional information identifying the loan application and property may 
appear at the bottom of the form or on a separate page. Exception: If 
the disclosure is being made by a mortgage broker who is not an 
exclusive agent of the lender, the lender's name will not appear at the 
top of the form, but the following legend must appear:
    This Good Faith Estimate is being provided by ________________, a 
mortgage broker, and no lender has yet been obtained.
    \2\ Items for which there is estimated to be no charge to the 
borrower are not required to be listed. Any additional items for which 
there is estimated to be a charge to the borrower shall be listed if 
required on the HUD-1.
    \3\ As an alternative to using aggregate accounting with no more 
than a two-month cushion, the estimate may be obtained by using single-

<R05>
Sec. 4100.1  Functions and activities.

    (a) General statement. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation 
(referred to in this part as the Corporation) was established by 
Congress in the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act (title VI of 
the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, Pub. L. 95-
557, October 31, 1978). The Corporation is not a department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the Federal Government.
    (b) The Corporation is authorized to receive and expend Federal 
appropriations and other public and private revenues to conduct a 
variety of programs designed primarily to revitalize older urban 
neighborhoods by mobilizing public, private, and community resources at 
the neighborhood level. These programs include:
    (1) Neighborhood Housing Services. The major effort of the 
Corporation is to assist local communities in the development, expansion 
and provision of technical services to local Neighborhood Housing 
Services (NHS) programs. NHS programs are based upon partnerships of 
community residents, and representatives of local governments and 
financial institutions. Each local program is administered by an 
autonomous, private, non-profit corporation, and conducts a 
comprehensive revitalization effort in locally selected neighborhoods. 
Services to neighborhood residents include rehabilitation counseling, 
construction assistance, financial counseling, loan referrals and loans 
at flexible rates and terms to homeowners who do not meet private 
lending criteria. Programs and strategies to remove blighting 
influences, obtain improved public services and amenities, and improve 
the neighborhood's image and the functioning of its real estate market 
are also undertaken. To insure the continuing effectiveness of NHS 
programs, the Corporation provides grants, training, information and 
technical services to NHS programs.'
    (2) Mutual Housing Associations. The Corporation also supports the 
organizational development of, and provides technical assistance to, 
Mutual Housing Associations. Mutual Housing Associations are private, 
nonprofit organizations which own, manage and continually develop 
affordable housing. Mutual Housing residents are members of the 
Association which owns and manages their buildings; thus they enjoy the 
security of long-term housing tenure. Mutual Housing developments are 
capitalized through up-front grants and mortgages in a combination that 
ensures permanent affordability to low- and moderate-income families. 
Monthly housing charges to residents are kept at affordable levels on a 
continuing basis. A key element of Mutual Housing is the Association's 
commitment to use all resources in excess of operating and maintenance 
costs for the production of additional units. A Mutual Housing 
Association's board of directors includes current member-residents, 
potential residents, and representatives from the community, local 
government and business. Residents and community members make up the 
majority on the board. A highly qualified professional staff, employed 
by the Mutual Housing Association, carries out the day-to-day activities 
of the organization. In addition to creating new affordable housing 
opportunities, Mutual Housing Associations offer a creative alternative 
for subsidized rental housing developments whose subsidies are scheduled 
to expire.
    (3) Neighborhood preservation projects. The Corporation identifies, 
monitors, evaluates and supports through demonstration grants and 
technical assistance other promising neighborhood preservation 
strategies based on local, public-private partnerships.

[[Page 312]]

    (4) Programmatic supplements. Proven, replicable programmatic tools 
are offered as broadly as resources permit. Often, these selected 
strategies are supported by Neighborhood Reinvestment grants. The 
Corporation's major programmatic supplements include the following:
    (i) Neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization 
strategies. The Corporation's neighborhood economic development and 
commercial revitalization strategies offer NHSs a variety of tools 
designed to stabilize and enhance the economic base of NHS 
neighborhoods. They complement NHSs' revitalization mission by focusing 
the energies and resources of the partnership on the economic issues 
underlying neighborhood decline. Neighborhood economic development and 
commercial revitalization assures a viable neighborhood economy by 
strengthening small businesses and improving the physical environment of 
the area, thus providing additional goods, services, and employment 
opportunities for the community.
    (ii) Housing Development Strategies. The Corporation's Housing 
Development Strategies program addresses the shortage of affordable, 
quality housing available to low to moderate income families in NHS 
neighborhoods, as well as the blighting effect of vacant lots and 
substandard properties. Home ownership opportunities are created through 
the planning and implementation of a variety of housing mechanisms by 
the NHS, which are intended to reverse negative real estate market 
trends, enhance new residential growth, and create renewed neighborhood 
pride. The mechanisms being used to achieve these goals include the 
following.
    (A) The Owner Built Housing program is a supervised housing 
construction process that helps moderate-income homeowners to 
collectively build their own homes. The NHS provides technical 
assistance while private lenders and public bodies providing financing.
    (B) The Owner Rehab Housing program assists low to moderate income 
families in collectively rehabilitating existing blighted and vacant 
structures.
    (C) The Infill Housing program provides a mechanism for assisting 
NHSs in building new units on vacant land to meet the needs of 
prospective lower income homeowners.
    (D) The Urban Subdivisions program focuses on providing low cost, 
new housing for low-to-moderate income families on tracts of land 
suitable for the construction of 20 or more units.
    (iii) Problem properties strategies. This program assists NHSs in 
addressing specific problem areas beyond the scope of basic NHS services 
and typical financial resources. Through the implementation of various 
problem properties strategies, NHS programs are able to assist tenants 
to purchase, improve the physical condition of target blocks, eliminate 
vacant neighborhood eyesores, develop housing and service facilities for 
special populations, and stimulate private reinvestment and new 
conventional mortgages in the NHS community.
    (5) Apartment Improvement Program. The goal of the Apartment 
Improvement Program is to provide an effective, economical means of 
revitalizing and preserving neighborhoods with multi-family housing for 
the benefit of the current residents. The program is based upon a 
partnership of tenants and community representatives, property owners 
and managers, financial institutions and local government. The program 
assists in the development of an individually tailored improvement plan 
of activities from which each building may benefit, including tenant 
participation, tax assessment reviews, and increased investment or 
restructured mortgages to improve the economic viability of the 
buildings and to finance improvements.
    (6) Neighborhood Housing Services of America. The Corporation also 
supports Neighborhood Housing Services of America (NHSA), an 
independent, private, non-profit corporation which provides a variety of 
services to local NHS programs, including a secondary market for NHS 
revolving loan fund loans, and the strengthening of private sector 
resources available to the network of local NHSs.

Sec. 4100.2  General organization.

    (a) The Board of Directors. (1) The Corporation is under the 
direction of a Board of Directors composed of six members: the Chairman 
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or a member of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board designated by the Chairman; the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development; the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, or a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System designated by the Chairman; the Chairman of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or the appointive member of the Board of 
Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if so designated 
by the Chairman; the Comptroller of the Currency; and the Chairman of 
the National Credit Union Administration, or a member of the Board of 
the National Credit Union Administration designated by the Chairman. 
Members of the Board serve without additional compensation. The Board 
elects from among its members a Chairman and Vice-Chairman. The Bylaws 
of the Corporation provide for the creation of an Audit Committee, and 
such other committees as the Board may from time to time establish.
    (2) The Board holds an Annual Meeting each year during the month of 
May (or as the Bylaws or the Board may specify). The Board also holds 
regular meetings at least quarterly and special meetings as required. 
The meetings of the Board are conducted in accordance with provisions of 
the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act, the Government in the 
Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b), the Corporation's Bylaws, and when not 
inconsistent with the foregoing, with Robert's Rules of Order. Every 
portion of every meeting of the Board is open to public observation 
except as provided by the Government in the Sunshine Act. Interested 
members of the public may attend such meetings, but may not participate 
therein unless invited or permitted to do so by the Board.
    (3) The Secretary of the Corporation, in consultation with the 
Corporation's General Counsel, is responsible for taking such steps as 
are required to ensure the Corporation's compliance with the Government 
in the Sunshine Act, as that Act may be amended from time to time. 
Consistent with this responsibility, the Secretary of the Corporation 
provides to the Communications Department at the principal office of the 
Corporation such records as the Act requires to be made available to the 
public for access during regular office hours on regular business days.
    (b) The Officers. (1) The officers of the Corporation are the 
Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, the Secretary, the 
Treasurer, and such other officer positions as the Board may, in 
consultation with the Executive Director, create. The Board elects the 
officers of the Corporation annually.
    (2) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act provides that the 
Executive Director shall serve as the chief executive officer of the 
Corporation. Consistent with that authority, the Corporation's Bylaws 
provide that the Executive Director shall have the responsibility and 
authority for the day-to-day administration of the affairs of the 
Corporation under the general supervision of the Board. The Board 
periodically reviews the activities of the Executive Director and, from 
time to time, provides guidance and policy direction to the Executive 
Director in the exercise of his or her authority.
    (3) The responsibilities and authorities of the other officers of 
the Corporation are set forth in the Corporation's Bylaws, resolutions 
and policies adopted by the Board, duties and authorities delegated to 
each officer, other statutes and this statement. (See, for example, the 
Government in the Sunshine Act and paragraph (a)(3) of this section for 
specific duties of the Secretary and General Counsel.)
    (c) Principal office. The Corporation maintains its principal office 
in the District of Columbia. Currently, the principal office is 
maintained at 1325 G Street NW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005.

[49 FR 12700, Mar. 30, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 13062, Mar. 30, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 4100.3  Field activities.

    The Corporation conducts its field activities from district and 
field offices around the country. District offices

[[Page 314]]

provide coordination of field activities in support of local programs 
within the geographic limits of each district. Field offices within each 
district provide assistance in the development and support of local 
programs. A current directory of all district and field offices can be 
obtained upon request from the Communications Department, Neighborhood 
Reinvestment Corporation, 1325 G Street NW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 
20005.

[49 FR 12700, Mar. 30, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 13061, Mar. 30, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 4100.4  Inquiries.

    (a) General. All requests for information, forms, and records should 
be addressed to: Communications Department, Neighborhood Reinvestment 
Corporation, 1325 G Street NW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005.
    (b) Applications. Applications for the Corporation's assistance in 
the development of NHS programs and complementary programs and 
strategies, or the support of other promising neighborhood strategies 
are accepted on an ongoing basis. Local governmental or nonprofit 
entities should submit completed applications (forms are available upon 
request), including supportive materials, to the Corporation at the 
address stated in paragraph (a) of this section. The Corporation reviews 
applications to determine their readiness for development or support. 
Promising applications are selected for field reviews. Subject to the 
availability of the Corporation's resources, the Corporation may enter 
into agreements with top ranking applicants to provide financial and 
technical assistance in the development or support of selected programs. 
The application form contains a list of the criteria used for 
determining the readiness and promise of applications.
    (c) Records. (1) The Corporation maintains such records and 
information for public inspection and copying as are required by the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as that Act may be amended 
from time to time. Records are available for public inspection and 
copying during regular business hours on regular business days at the 
address stated in paragraph (a) of this section. Requests for records 
should be submitted in writing and state the full name and address of 
the person requesting the records and a description of the records or 
other information sought that is reasonably sufficient to permit their 
identification without undue difficulty. A request should be submitted 
sufficiently in advance of the date inspection or copying is desired, 
preferably by mail.
    (2) Although the Corporation finds that the publication of indexes 
of statements of policy and interpretations or administrative staff 
manuals and instructions would be unnecessary and impracticable, such 
information will be made available upon request.
    (d) Fees for providing copies for records. Fees shall be assessed 
pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) in order to 
recover the full allowable direct costs of providing copies of records. 
For purposes of this section, the term direct costs means those 
expenditures which the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and 
duplicating (and in the case of commercial use requesters, reviewing) 
documents to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') request. 
Direct costs include, for example, the salaries of the employees 
performing the work (the basic rate of pay plus 16 percent of that rate 
to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. The 
term search includes all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. Searches may be done 
manually or by computer using existing programming. The term duplication 
refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to 
respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, 
microfilm, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation 
(e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The term review refers to 
the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial 
use request to determine whether any portion of any document is 
permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for 
disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to exise them and 
otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent 
resolving general

[[Page 315]]

legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. A 
schedule based on these principles is set forth in paragraph (d)(9) of 
this section.
    (1) Categories of requesters. Fees will be assessed according to the 
category of the requester. There are four categories:
    (i) Commercial use requesters. For purposes of this section, the 
term commercial use request refers to a request from or on behalf of one 
who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, 
trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose 
behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly 
belongs in this category, the Corporation will look to the use to which 
the requester will put the documents requested. If the use is not clear 
from the request itself, or if there is reasonable cause to doubt the 
requester's stated use, the Corporation shall seek additional 
clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
    (ii) Educational and noncommercial scientific institution 
requesters. For purposes of this section, the term educational 
institution refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or 
secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an 
institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of 
professional education, or an institution of vocational education, which 
operates a program or programs of scholarly research. The term 
noncommercial scientific institution refers to an institution that is 
not operated on a commercial basis, as that term is used in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose 
of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended 
to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligible for 
inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is 
made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution, and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, 
but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an 
educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a 
noncommercial scientific institution) research.
    (iii) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. For 
purposes of this section, the term representative of the news media 
refers to any person actively gathering information for an entity that 
is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. 
Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) 
who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the 
general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. In 
the case of freelance journalists, they may be regarded as working for a 
news organization if they demonstrate a solid basis for expecting 
publication through that organization, even though not actually employed 
by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the 
Corporation may also look at the past publication record of a requester 
in making this determination. To be eligible for inclusion in this 
category, a requester must meet the criteria above, and his or her 
request must not be made for a commerical use. In reference to this 
class of requester, a request for records supporting the news 
dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a 
request that is for a commercial use.
    (iv) All other requesters.
    (2) Limitations on fees to be charged--(i) Commercial use 
requesters. Commercial use requesters shall be assessed the full direct 
costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating records, in 
accordance with the fee schedule at paragraph (d)(9) of this section. 
Commercial use requesters are not entitled to the free search time or 
free pages of duplication provided to other categories of requesters.
    (ii) Educational and noncommercial scientific institution 
requesters. Requesters in this category may be assessed fees only for 
duplication of records in excess of the first 100 pages. Requesters in 
this category may not be assessed fees for search or review.
    (iii) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. 
Requesters in this category may be assessed fees only for duplication of 
records in excess of the

[[Page 316]]

first 100 pages. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees 
for research or review.
    (iv) All other requesters. Requesters who do not fit into any of the 
categories above shall be assessed fees only for searching and 
duplicating records, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and 
the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. 
Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for review.
    (v) Review of records. Charges will be assessed only for the initial 
review of the located documents and not for time spent at the 
administrative appeal level on an exemption applied at the initial 
determination level. However, where records or portions of records are 
withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not 
to apply, and these records are reviewed again to determine the 
applicability of other exemptions not previously considered, charges for 
review are properly assessable.
    (vi) Additional copies. The Corporation will normally furnish only 
one copy of any record. The allowance of 100 free pages of duplication 
under paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not 
apply to additional copies furnished at the request of the record 
requester. Full duplication fees shall be assessed for each page of each 
such additional copy.
    (3) Charges for unsuccessful search. Where applicable under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section search fees may be assessed for time 
spent searching, even if the Corporation fails to locate the records or 
if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (4) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. Unless the 
person making the request states in his or her initial request that he 
or she will pay all costs regardless of amount, the Corporation will 
notify him or her as soon as possible if there is reason to believe that 
the cost for obtaining access to and/or copies of such records will 
exceed $25. If such notice is given, the time limitations contained in 
the Freedom of Information Act shall not commence until the person 
making the intitial request agrees in writing to pay such cost.
    (5) Advance payments. The Communications Director is authorized to 
require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges 
whenever he or she determines that:
    (i) The allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay 
are likely to exceed $250 and the requester has no history of payment 
and cannot provide satisfactory assurance that payment will be made; or
    (ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a 
timely manner.

If such a payment is required, the time limitations contained in the 
Freedom of Information Act shall not commence until payment is made.
    (6) Charging interest. The Corporation will assess interest charges 
on any unpaid fees starting on the 31st day following the day on which 
the billing for fees was sent to the requester. Interest will be at the 
rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the 
billing. Receipt of the fee by the Corporation, even if not processed, 
will stay the accrual of interest. Interest is not chargeable for unpaid 
advance payments under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
    (7) Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests 
at the same time, each seeking portions of the document or documents, 
solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Corporation 
reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in 
concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests 
for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation may 
aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.
    (8) Waiver or reduction of fee. The Corporation will furnish 
documents without charge or at a reduced charge when it is determined 
that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it 
is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the 
operations or activities of the Corporation and is not primarily in the 
commercial interest of the requester. In making a request for a waiver 
or reduction of fees, a requester should include a clear statement of 
his or her interest in the requested documents: The

[[Page 317]]

proposed use for the documents and whether the requester will derive 
income or other benefit from such use; and a statement of how the public 
will benefit from such use. Determinations concerning waiver or 
reduction of fees shall be made by the Executive Director, or his or her 
designee.
    (9) Schedule of fees. Fees for searching for, reviewing, 
duplicating, and providing records and information of the Corporation 
under this section will be assessed in accordance with the following 
schedule:
    (i) Manual search. For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $3.37.
    (ii) Computer search. For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: 
$3.37.
    (iii) Review. For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $4.87.
    (iv) Duplication.
    (A) For a paper photocopy of an existing paper record, $.10 per 
page.
    (B) For duplication of records other than existing paper records 
(such as computer-stored information, audio or video tapes, microfiche 
or microfilm), the fee shall equal the actual direct cost of production 
and duplication of the records or information in a form that is 
reasonably usable by the requester.
    (10) Processing costs. The Communications Director will waive 
payment in instances in which the costs of routine collection and 
processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the 
fee.
