                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 700.1  Scope.

    The regulations in chapter VII of 30 CFR, consisting of parts 700 
through 899, establish the procedures through which the Secretary of the 
Interior will implement the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act 
of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-87, 91 Stat. 445 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et. seq.)). Chapter 
VII is divided into 13 subchapters.
    (a) Subchapter A contains introductory information intended to serve 
as a guide to the rest of the chapter and to the regulatory requirements 
and definitions generally applicable to the programs and persons covered 
by the Act.
    (b) Subchapter B contains regulations covering the initial 
regulatory program which apply before the applicability of permanent 
program regulations to persons conducting surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and other persons covered by the Act.
    (c) Subchapter C sets forth regulations covering applications for 
and decisions on permanent State programs; the process to be followed 
for substituting a Federal program for an approved State program, if 
necessary; the process for assuming temporary Federal enforcement of an 
approved State program; and the process for implementing a Federal 
program in a State when required by the Act.
    (d) Subchapter D of this chapter identifies the procedures that 
apply to surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted on 
Federal lands rather than State or private lands and incorporates by 
reference the requirements of the applicable regulatory program and the 
inspection and enforcement requirements of subchapter L of this chapter.
    (e) Subchapter E of this chapter contains regulations that apply to 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted on Indian 
lands.
    (f)(1) Subchapter F implements the requirements of the Act for--
    (i) Designating lands which are unsuitable for all or certain types 
of surface coal mining operations;
    (ii) Terminating designations no longer found to be appropriate; and
    (iii) Prohibiting surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
those lands or areas where the Act states that surface coal mining 
operations should not be permitted or should be permitted only after 
specified determinations are made.
    (2) Subchapter F does not include regulations governing designation 
of areas unsuitable for noncoal mining under the terms of section 601 of 
the Act or the designation of Federal lands under the Federal lands 
review provisions of section 522(b) of the Act. The Bureau of Land 
Management of the Department of the Interior is responsible for these 
provisions which will be implemented when promulgated by regulations in 
title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (g) Subchapter G governs applications for and decisions on permits 
for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Indian and 
non-Federal lands under a State or Federal program. It also governs coal 
exploration and permit application and decisions on permits for special 
categories of coal mining on non-Indian and non-Federal lands under a 
State or Federal program. Regulations implementing the experimental 
practices provision of the Act are also included in subchapter G.
    (h) Subchapter J sets forth requirements for performance bonds and 
public liability insurance for both surface

[[Page 10]]

mining and underground mining activities.
    (i) Subchapter K sets forth the environmental and other performance 
standards which apply to coal exploration and to surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations during the permanent regulatory program. The 
regulations establish the minimum requirements for operations under 
State and Federal programs. Performance standards applicable to special 
mining situations such as anthracite mines, steep slope mining, alluvial 
valley floors, and prime farmlands are included.
    (j) Subchapter L sets forth the inspection, enforcement, and civil 
penalty provisions that apply to a State, Federal, or Federal lands 
program.
    (k) Subchapter M sets forth the requirements for the training, 
examination, and certification of blasters.
    (l) Subchapter P sets forth the provisions for protection of 
employees who initiate proceedings under the Act or testify in any 
proceedings resulting from the administration or enforcement of the Act.
    (m) Subchapter R sets forth the regulations for the abandoned mine 
land reclamation program. These regulations include the fee collection 
requirements and the mechanisms for implementing the State and Federal 
portions of the abandoned mine land reclamation program.
    (n) Subchapter S sets forth the regulations that apply to grants for 
mining and mineral research institutes and grants for mineral research 
projects.

Sec. 700.10  Information collection.

    The collection of information, and recordkeeping requirements, 
contained in 30 CFR 700.11(d), 700.12(b) and 700.13 has approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and 
assigned clearance number 1029-0094. The information collected in Sec. 
700.11(d) is used by OSMRE and States to establish standards for 
determining when a mine site is no longer a surface coal mining and 
reclamation operation and thereby when regulatory jurisdiction may end. 
The information collection under Sec. 700.12(b) is used by OSMRE to 
consider need, costs, and benefits of a proposed regulatory change in 
order to grant or deny a petition that has been submitted. Information 
collected in Sec. 700.13 identifies the person and nature of a 
citizen's suit, so that OSMRE or a state can respond appropriately.

reclamation operations, except:
    (1) The extraction of coal by a landowner for his or her own 
noncommercial use from land owned or leased by him or her. Noncommercial 
use does not include the extraction of coal by one unit of an integrated 
company or other business or nonprofit entity which uses the coal in its 
own manufacturing or power plants;
    (2) The extraction of 250 tons of coal or less by a person 
conducting a surface coal mining and reclamation operation. A person who 
intends to remove more than 250 tons is not exempted;
    (3) The extraction of coal as an incidental part of Federal, State 
or local government-financed highway or other construction in accordance 
with part 707 of this chapter;
    (4) The extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other 
minerals where coal does not exceed 16\2/3\ percent of the total tonnage 
of coal and other minerals removed for purposes of commercial use or 
sale in accordance with part 702 of this chapter.
    (5) Coal exploration on lands subject to the requirement of 43 CFR 
parts 3480-3487.
    (b) This chapter does not apply to the extraction of coal for 
commercial purposes where the surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation, together with any related operations, has or will have an 
affected area of two acres or less. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (1) Where a segment of a road is used for access or coal haulage by 
more than one surface coal mining operation, the entire segment shall be 
included in the affected area of each of those operations; provided, 
that two or more operations which are deemed related pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be considered as one operation 
for purposes of this paragraph.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, surface 
coal mining operations shall be deemed related if they occur within 
twelve months of each other, are physically related, and are under 
common ownership or control.

[[Page 14]]

    (i) Operations shall be deemed physically related if drainage from 
both operations flows into the same watershed at or before a point 
within five aerial miles of either operation.
    (ii) Operations shall be deemed under common ownership or control if 
they are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf 
of:
    (A) The same person;
    (B) Two or more persons, one of whom controls, is under common 
control with, or is controlled by the other; or
    (C) Members of the same family and their relatives, unless it is 
established that there is no direct or indirect business relationship 
between or among them;
    (iii) For purposes of this paragraph, control means: ownership of 50 
percent or more of the voting shares of, or general partnership in, an 
entity; any relationship which gives one person the ability in fact or 
law to direct what the other does; or any relationship which gives one 
person express or implied authority to determine the manner in which 
coal at different sites will be mined, handled, sold or disposed of.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the regulatory authority may determine, in accordance with the 
procedures applicable to requests for determination of exemption 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, that two or more surface coal 
mining operations shall not be deemed related if, considering the 
history and circumstances relating to the coal, its location, the 
operations at the sites in question, all related operations and all 
persons mentioned in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
regulatory authority concludes in writing that the operations are not of 
the type which the Act was intended to regulate and that there is no 
intention on the part of such operations or persons to evade the 
requirements of the Act or the applicable regulatory program.
    (4) The exemption provided by paragraph (b) of this section applies 
only to operations with an affected area of less than two acres where 
coal is being extracted for commercial purposes and to surface coal 
mining operations within that affected area incidental to such 
operations.
    (c) The regulatory authority may on its own initiative and shall, 
within a reasonable time of a request from any person who intends to 
conduct surface coal mining operations, make a written determination 
whether the operation is exempt under this section. The regulatory 
authority shall give reasonable notice of the request to interested 
persons. Prior to the time a determination is made, any person may 
submit, and the regulatory authority shall consider, any written 
information relevant to the determination. A person requesting that an 
operation be declared exempt shall have the burden of establishing the 
exemption. If a written determination of exemption is reversed through 
subsequent administrative or judicial action, any person who, in good 
faith, has made a complete and accurate request for an exemption and 
relied upon the determination, shall not be cited for violations which 
occurred prior to the date of the reversal.
    (d)(1) A regulatory authority may terminate its jurisdiction under 
the regulatory program over the reclaimed site of a completed surface 
coal mining and reclamation operation, or increment thereof, when:
    (i) The regulatory authority determines in writing that under the 
initial program, all requirements imposed under subchapter B of this 
chapter have been successfully completed; or
    (ii) The regulatory authority determines in writing that under the 
permanent program, all requirements imposed under the applicable 
regulatory program have been successfully completed or, where a 
performance bond was required, the regulatory authority has made a final 
decision in accordance with the State or Federal program counterpart to 
part 800 of this chapter to release the performance bond fully.
    (2) Following a termination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
the regulatory authority shall reassert jurisdiction under the 
regulatory program over a site if it is demonstrated that the bond 
release or written determination referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section was based upon fraud,

[[Page 15]]

collusion, or misrepresentation of a material fact.

Sec. 701.4  Responsibility.

    (a) A State regulatory authority shall assume primary responsibility 
for regulation of coal exploration and surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations during the permanent regulatory program upon 
submission to and approval by the Secretary of a State program meeting 
all applicable requirements of the Act and this chapter. After approval 
of the State program, the State regulatory authority has responsibility 
for review of and decisions on permits and bonding for surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations, approval of coal exploration which 
substantially disturbs the natural land surface and removes more than 
250 tons of coal from the earth in any one location, inspection of coal 
exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations for 
compliance with the Act, this chapter, the State program, permits and 
exploration approvals, and for enforcement of the State program.
    (b) While a State regulatory program is in effect, the Office's 
responsibility includes, but is not limited to --
    (1) Evaluating the administration of the State program through such 
means as periodic inspections of coal exploration and surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations in the State and review of exploration 
approvals, permits, inspection reports, and other documents required to 
be made available to the Office;
    (2) Referring to the State regulatory authority information which 
creates reasonable belief that a person is in violation of the Act, this 
chapter, the State regulatory program, a permit condition, or coal 
exploration approval condition, and initiating an inspection when 
authorized by the Act or this chapter;
    (3) Issuing notices of violation when a State regulatory authority 
fails to take appropriate action to cause a violation to be corrected; 
and
    (4) Issuing cessation orders, including imposing affirmative 
obligations, when a condition, practice, or violation exists which 
creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or is 
causing or could reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent 
environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.
    (c) The Office shall implement a Federal program in a State, if that 
State does not have an approved State program by June 3, 1980. The 
Office shall not implement a Federal program in a State for a period of 
up to 1 year following that date if the State's failure to have an 
approved program by that date is due to an injunction imposed by a court 
of competent jurisdiction.
    (d) Under a Federal program, the Office shall be the regulatory 
authority for all coal exploration and surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations in that State and shall perform the functions 
that a State regulatory authority would perform under an approved State 
program.
    (e) During the period in which a State program is in effect, the 
Office shall assume responsibility for enforcing permit conditions, 
issuing new or revised permits, and issuing necessary

[[Page 18]]

notices and orders, when required by 30 CFR part 733.
    (f) The Secretary shall substitute a Federal program under 30 CFR 
part 736 for an approved State program, when required by 30 CFR part 
733.
    (g) The Secretary shall have the responsibility for administration 
of the Federal lands program. The Director and other Federal authorities 
shall have the responsibilities under a Federal lands program as are 
provided for under subchapter D of this chapter. In addition, State 
regulatory authorities shall have responsibilities to administer the 
Federal lands program as provided for under cooperative agreements 
approved by the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR part 745.
    (h) The Secretary shall have the responsibility for the 
administration of the Federal program for Indian lands, as provided for 
under subchapter E of this chapter. The Director and other Federal 
authorities have the responsibilities under the Indian lands program as 
are provided for under subchapter E of this chapter.

option the conduct of surface coal mining and reclamation operations; 
(b) lands that the regulatory authority determines, on the basis of 
additional cropland history of the surrounding lands and the lands under 
consideration, that the permit area is clearly cropland but falls 
outside the specific 5-years-in-10 criterion, in which case the 
regulations for prime farmland may be applied to include more years of 
cropland history only to increase the prime farmland acreage to be 
preserved; or (c) lands that would likely have been used as cropland for

    Hydrologic regime means the entire state of water movement in a 
given area. It is a function of the climate and includes the phenomena 
by which water first occurs as atmospheric water vapor, passes into a 
liquid or solid form, falls as precipitation, moves along or into the 
ground surface, and returns to the atmosphere as vapor by means of 
evaporation and transpiration.
    Imminent danger to the health and safety of the public means the 
existence of any condition or practice, or any violation of a permit or 
other requirements of the Act in a surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation, which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
physical harm to persons outside the permit area before the condition, 
practice, or violation can be abated. A reasonable expectation of death 
or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, 
subjected to the same condition or practice giving rise to the peril, 
would avoid exposure to the danger during the time necessary for 
abatement.

environment, in violation of the Act, the regulatory program, or this 
chapter, that cannot be corrected by actions of the applicant.
    Knowing or knowingly means that a person who authorized, ordered, or 
carried out an act or omission knew or had reason to know that the act 
or omission would result in either a violation or a failure to abate or 
correct a violation.
    Land use means specific uses or management-related activities, 
rather than the vegetation or cover of the land. Land uses may be 
identified in combination when joint or seasonal uses occur and may 
include land used for support facilities that are an integral part of

delivery costs for premining water supplies.
    (a) Upon agreement by the permittee and the water supply owner, the 
obligation to pay such operation and maintenance costs may be satisfied 
by a one-time payment in an amount which covers the present worth of the 
increased annual operation and maintenance costs for a period agreed to 
by the permittee and the water supply owner.
    (b) If the affected water supply was not needed for the land use in 
existence at the time of loss, contamination, or diminution, and if the

<R05>
Sec. 702.1  Scope.

    This part implements the exemption contained in section 701(28) of 
the Act concerning the extraction of coal incidental to the extraction 
of other minerals where coal does not exceed 16\2/3\ percent of the 
total tonnage of coal and other minerals removed for purposes of 
commercial use or sale.


<R05>
Sec. 702.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following terms have the meaning 
specified, except where otherwise indicated:
    (a) Cumulative measurement period means the period of time over 
which both cumulative production and cumulative revenue are measured.
    (1) For purposes of determining the beginning of the cumulative 
measurement period, subject to regulatory authority approval, the 
operator must select and consistently use one of the following:
    (i) For mining areas where coal or other minerals were extracted 
prior to August 3, 1977, the date extraction of coal or other minerals 
commenced at that mining area or August 3, 1977, or
    (ii) For mining areas where extraction of coal or other minerals 
commenced on or after August 3, 1977, the date extraction of coal or 
other minerals commenced at that mining area, whichever is earlier.
    (2) For annual reporting purposes pursuant to Sec. 702.18 of this 
part, the end of the period for which cumulative production and revenue 
is calculated is either
    (i) For mining areas where coal or other minerals were extracted 
prior to April 1, 1990, March 31, 1990, and every March 31 thereafter; 
or
    (ii) For mining areas where extraction of coal or other minerals 
commenced on or after April 1, 1990, the last day of the calendar 
quarter during which coal extraction commenced, and each anniversary of 
that day thereafter.
    (b) Cumulative production means the total tonnage of coal or other 
minerals extracted from a mining area during the cumulative measurement 
period. The inclusion of stockpiled coal and other mineral tonnages in 
this total is governed by Sec. 702.16.
    (c) Cumulative revenue means the total revenue derived from the sale 
of coal or other minerals and the fair market value of coal or other 
minerals transferred or used, but not sold, during the cumulative 
measurement period.
    (d) Mining area means an individual excavation site or pit from 
which coal, other minerals and overburden are removed.
    (e) Other minerals means any commercially valuable substance mined 
for its mineral value, excluding coal, topsoil, waste and fill material.

Sec. 702.11  Application requirements and procedures.

    (a)(1) Any person who plans to commence or continue coal extraction 
after April 1, 1990, under a Federal program or on Indian lands, or 
after the effective date of counterpart provisions in a State program, 
in reliance on the incidental mining exemption shall file a complete 
application for exemption with the regulatory authority for each mining 
area.
    (2) Following incorporation of an exemption application approval 
process into a regulatory program, a person may not commence coal 
extraction based upon the exemption until the regulatory authority 
approves such application, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section.
    (b) Existing operations. Any person who has commenced coal 
extraction at a mining area in reliance upon the incidental mining 
exemption prior to April 1, 1990, in a State with a Federal program or 
on Indian lands, or prior to the effective date of counterpart 
provisions in a State program, may continue mining operations for 60 
days after such effective date. Coal extraction may not continue after 
such 60-day period unless that person files an administratively complete 
application for exemption with the regulatory authority. If an 
administratively complete application is filed within 60 days, the 
person may continue extracting coal in reliance on the exemption beyond 
the 60-day period until the regulatory authority makes an administrative 
decision on such application.
    (c) Additional information. The regulatory authority shall notify 
the applicant if the application for exemption is incomplete and may at 
any time require submittal of additional information.
    (d) Public comment period. Following publication of the newspaper 
notice required by Sec. 702.12(g), the regulatory authority shall 
provide a period of no less than 30 days during which time any person 
having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by a decision 
on the application may submit written comments or objections.
    (e) Exemption determination. (1) No later than 90 days after filing 
of an administratively complete application, the regulatory authority 
shall make a written determination whether, and under what conditions, 
the persons claiming the exemption are exempt under this part, and shall 
notify the applicant and persons submitting comments on the application 
of the determination and the basis for the determination.
    (2) The determination of exemption shall be based upon information 
contained in the application and any other information available to the 
regulatory authority at that time.
    (3) If the regulatory authority fails to provide an applicant with 
the determination as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an 
applicant who has not begun may commence coal extraction pending a 
determination on the application unless the regulatory authority issues 
an interim finding, together with reasons therefor, that the applicant 
may not begin coal extraction.
    (f) Administrative review. (1) Any adversely affected person may 
request administrative review of a determination under paragraph (e) of 
this section within 30 days of the notification of such determination in 
accordance with procedures established under 43 CFR 4.1280 when OSM is 
the regulatory authority or under corresponding State procedures when a 
State is the regulatory authority.
    (2) A petition for administrative review filed under 43 CFR 4.1280 
or under corresponding State procedures shall not suspend the effect of 
a determination under paragraph (e) of this section.

Sec. 702.14  Requirements for exemption.

    (a) Activities are exempt from the requirements of the Act if all of 
the following are satisfied:
    (1) The cumulative production of coal extracted from the mining area 
determined annually as described in this paragraph does not exceed 16\2/
3\ percent of the total cumulative production of coal and other minerals 
removed during such period for purposes of bona fide sale or reasonable 
commercial use.
    (2) Coal is produced from a geological stratum lying above or 
immediately below the deepest stratum from which other minerals are 
extracted for purposes of bona fide sale or reasonable commercial use.
    (3) The cumulative revenue derived from the coal extracted from the 
mining area determined annually shall not exceed 50 percent of the total 
cumulative revenue derived from the coal and other minerals removed for 
purposes of bona fide sale or reasonable commercial use. If the coal 
extracted or the minerals removed are used by the operator or 
transferred to a related entity for use instead of being sold in a bona 
fide sale, then the fair market value of the coal or other minerals 
shall be calculated at the time of use or transfer and shall be 
considered rather than revenue.
    (b) Persons seeking or that have obtained an exemption from the 
requirements of the Act shall comply with the following:
    (1) Each other mineral upon which an exemption under this part is 
based must be a commercially valuable mineral for which a market exists 
or which is mined in bona fide anticipation that a market will exist for 
the mineral in the reasonably foreseeable future, not to exceed twelve 
months from the end of the current period for which cumulative 
production is calculated. A legally binding agreement for the future 
sale of other minerals is sufficient to demonstrate the above standard.
    (2) If either coal or other minerals are transferred or sold by the 
operator to a related entity for its use or sale, the transaction must 
be made for legitimate business purposes.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 702.16  Stockpiling of minerals.

    (a) Coal. Coal extracted and stockpiled may be excluded fom the 
calculation of cumulative production until the time of its sale, 
transfer to a related entity or use:
    (1) Up to an amount equaling a 12-month supply of the coal required 
for future sale, transfer or use as calculated based upon the average 
annual sales, transfer and use from the mining area over the two 
preceding years; or
    (2) For a mining area where coal has been extracted for a period of 
less than two years, up to an amount that would represent a 12-month 
supply of the coal required for future sales, transfer or use as 
calculated based on the average amount of coal sold, transferred or used 
each month.
    (b) Other minerals. (1) The regulatory authority shall disallow all 
or part of an operator's tonnages of stockpiled other minerals for 
purposes of meeting the requirements of this part if the operator fails 
to maintain adequate and verifiable records of the mining area of 
origin, the disposition of stockpiles or if the disposition of the 
stockpiles indicates the lack of commercial use or market for the 
minerals.
    (2) The regulatory authority may only allow an operator to utilize 
tonnages of stockpiled other minerals for purposes of meeting the 
requirements of this part if:
    (i) The stockpiling is necessary to meet market conditions or is 
consistent with generally accepted industry practices; and
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 
stockpiled other minerals do not exceed a 12-month supply of the mineral 
required for future sales as approved by the regulatory authority on the 
basis of the exemption application.
    (3) The regulatory authority may allow an operator to utilize 
tonnages of stockpiled other minerals beyond the 12-month limit 
established in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if the operator can 
demonstrate to the regulatory authority's satisfaction that the 
additional tonnage is required to meet future business obligations of 
the operator, such as may be demonstrated by a legally binding agreement 
for future delivery of the minerals.
    (4) The regulatory authority may periodically revise the other 
mineral stockpile tonnage limits in accordance with the criteria 
established by paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section based on 
additional information available to the regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 702.17  Revocation and enforcement.

    (a) Regulatory authority responsibility. The regulatory authority 
shall conduct an annual compliance review of the mining area, utilizing 
the annual report submitted pursuant to Sec. 702.18, an on-site 
inspection and any other information available to the regulatory 
authority.
    (b) If the regulatory authority has reason to believe that a 
specific mining area was not exempt under the provisions of this part or 
counterpart provisions of the State regulatory program at the end of the 
previous reporting period, is not exempt, or will be unable to satisfy 
the exemption criteria at the end of the current reporting period, the 
regulatory authority shall notify the operator that the exemption may be 
revoked and the reason(s) therefor. The exemption will be revoked unless 
the operator demonstrates to the regulatory authority within 30 days 
that the mining area in question should continue to be exempt.
    (c)(1) If the regulatory authority finds that an operator has not 
demonstrated that activities conducted in the mining area qualify for 
the exemption, the regulatory authority shall revoke the exemption and 
immediately notify the operator and intervenors. If a decision is made 
not to revoke an exemption, the regulatory authority shall immediately 
notify the operator and intervenors.
    (2) Any adversely affected person may request administrative review 
of a decision whether to revoke an exemption within 30 days of the 
notification of such decision in accordance with procedures established 
under 43 CFR 4.1280 when OSM is the regulatory authority or under 
corresponding State procedures when a State is the regulatory authority.
    (3) A petition for administrative review filed under 43 CFR 4.1280 
or under corresponding State procedures shall

[[Page 37]]

not suspend the effect of a decision whether to revoke an exemption.
    (d) Direct enforcement. (1) An operator mining in accordance with 
the terms of an approved exemption shall not be cited for violations of 
the regulatory program which occurred prior to the revocation of the 
exemption.
    (2) An operator who does not conduct activities in accordance with 
the terms of an approved exemption and knows or should know such 
activities are not in accordance with the approved exemption shall be 
subject to direct enforcement action for violations of the regulatory 
program which occur during the period of such activities.
    (3) Upon revocation of an exemption or denial of an exemption 
application, an operator shall stop conducting surface coal mining 
operations until a permit is obtained and shall comply with the 
reclamation standards of the applicable regulatory program with regard 
to conditions, areas and activities existing at the time of revocation 
or denial.


<R05>
Sec. 702.18  Reporting requirements.

    (a)(1) Following approval by the regulatory authority of an 
exemption for a mining area, the person receiving the exemption shall, 
for each mining area, file a written report annually with the regulatory 
authority containing the information specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (2) The report shall be filed no later than 30 days after the end of 
the 12-month period as determined in accordance with the definition of 
Cumulative measurement period in Sec. 702.5 of this part.
    (3) The information in the report shall cover:
    (i) Annual production of coal and other minerals and annual revenue 
derived from coal and other minerals during the preceding 12-month 
period, and
    (ii) The cumulative production of coal and other minerals and the 
cumulative revenue derived from coal and other minerals.
    (b) For each period and mining area covered by the report, the 
report shall specify:
    (1) The number of tons of extracted coal sold in bona fide sales and

<R05>
Sec. 705.10  Information collection.

    The collections of information contained in Sec. Sec. 705.11 and 
705.17 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1029-0067. The 
information is being collected on OSM Form 23 and will be used to meet 
the requirements of section 517(g) of the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1977, which provides that no employee of the State 
regulatory authority shall have direct or indirect financial interests 
in any underground or surface coal mining operation. This information 
will be used by officials of the state regulatory authority to determine 
whether each State employee complies with the financial interest 
provisions of section 517(g). The obligation to respond is mandatory

[[Page 41]]

in accordance with section 517(g). Public reporting burden for this 
information is estimated to average 20 minutes per response per state 
employee and 30 minutes per response per State regulatory authority, 
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this 
burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, 
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information 
Collection Clearance Officer, Office of Surface Mining, 1951

[56 FR 46988, Sept. 17, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 705.11  Who shall file.

    (a) Any employee who performs any function or duty under the Act is 
required to file a statement of employment and financial interests. 
Members of advisory boards and commissions established in accordance 
with State laws or regulations to represent multiple interests, who 
perform a function or duty under the Act, must file a statement of 
employment and financial interests. An employee who occupies a position 
which has been determined by the Head of the State Regulatory Authority 
not to involve performance of any function or duty under the Act or who 
is no longer employed by the State Regulatory Authority at the time a 
filing is due, is not required to file a statement.
    (b) The Head of each State Regulatory Authority shall prepare a list 
of those positions within the State Regulatory Authority that do not 
involve performance of any functions or duties under the Act. State 
Regulatory Authorities may be organized to include more activities than 
are covered by the Act. For example, if a State has identified its 
Department of Natural Resources as the State Regulatory Authority there 
may be only one or two offices within that Department which have 
employees who perform any functions, or duties under the Act. In those 
cases, the Head of the State Regulatory Authority shall list the title 
of boards, offices, bureaus or divisions within the State Regulatory 
Authority which do not perform any functions or duties under the Act and 
list the positions not performing functions or duties under the Act for 
only those boards, offices, bureaus or divisions that do have some 
employees performing functions or duties under the Act. Only those 
employees who are employed in a listed organizational unit or who occupy 
a listed position will be exempted from the filing requirements of 
section 517(g) of the Act.
    (c) The Head of each State Regulatory Authority shall prepare and 
submit to the director, an initial listing of positions that do not 
involve performance of any functions or duties under the Act within 60 
days of the effective date of these regulations.
    (d) The Head of each State Regulatory Authority shall annually 
review and update this listing. For monitoring and reporting reasons, 
the listing must be submitted to the Director and must contain a written 
justification for inclusion of the positions listed. Proposed revisions 
or a certification that revision is not required shall be submitted to 
the Director by no later than September 30 of each year. The Head of 
each State Regulatory Authority may revise the listing by the addition 
or deletion of positions at any time he or she determines such revisions 
are required to carry out the purpose of the law or the regulations of 
this part. Additions to and deletions from the listing of positions are 
effective upon notification to the incumbents of the positions added or 
deleted.
    (e) The Secretary or the Director may modify the listing at any time 
one or both of them determines that the listing submitted by the Head of 
a State Regulatory Authority indicates that coverage is not sufficient 
to carry out the purpose of the law or the regulations of this part.

[[Page 42]]


<R05>
Sec. 705.13  When to file.

    (a) Employees and members of advisory boards and commissions 
representing multiple interests performing functions or duties under the 
Act shall file:
    (1) Within 120 days of the effective date of these regulations; and
    (2) Annually on February 1 of each year, or at such other date as 
may be agreed to by the Director, provided that such alternative date 
will allow sufficient time to obtain information needed by the Director 
for his or her annual report to the Congress.
    (b) New employees and new members of advisory boards and commissions 
representing multiple interest hired, appointed, or transferred to 
perform functions or duties under the Act will be required to file at 
the time of entrance to duty.
    (c) New employees and new members of advisory boards and commissions 
representing multiple interests are not required to file an annual 
statement on the subsequent annual filing date if this date occurs 
within two months after their initial statement was filed. For example, 
an employee entering duty on December 2, 1986 would file a statement on 
that date. Because December 2 is within two months of February 1 the 
employee would not be required to file his or her next annual statement 
until February 1, 1988.

[51 FR 37122, Oct. 17, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 705.15  Where to file.

    The head of the State Regulatory Authority shall file his or her 
statement with the Director. All other employees and members of advisory 
boards and commissions representing multiple interests, as provided in 
Sec. 705.11, shall file their statements with the head of the State 
Regulatory Authority or such other official as may be designated by 
State law or regulation.

[51 FR 37122, Oct. 17, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 705.17  What to report.

    (a) Each employee shall report all information required on the 
statement of employment and financial interests of the employee, his or 
her spouse, minor children, or other relatives who are fulltime 
residents of the employee's home. The report shall be on OSM Form 23 as 
provided by the Office. The statement consists of three major parts, (1) 
a listing of all financial interests, including employment, security, 
real property, creditor and other financial interests held during the 
course of the preceding year, (2) a certification that none of the 
listed financial interests represent a direct or indirect financial 
interest in an underground or surface coal mining operation except as 
specifically identified and described by the employee as part of the 
certificate and (3) a certification by the reviewer that the form was 
reviewed, that prohibited interests have been resolved, and that no 
other prohibited interests have been identified from the statement.
    (b) Listing of all financial interests. The statement will set forth 
the following information regarding any financial interest:
    (1) Employment. Any continuing financial interests in business 
entities and nonprofit organizations through a pension or retirement 
plan, shared income, salary or other income arrangement as a result of 
prior or current employment. The employee, his or her spouse or other 
resident relative is not required to report a retirement plan from which 
he or she will receive a guaranteed income. A guaranteed income is one 
which is unlikely to be changed as a result of actions taken by the 
State Regulatory Authority.
    (2) Securities. Any financial interest in business entities and 
nonprofit organizations through ownership of stock, stock options, 
bonds, securities or other arrangements including trusts. An employee is 
not required to report mutual funds, investment clubs or regulated 
investment companies not specializing in underground and surface coal 
mining operations.
    (3) Real Property. Ownership, lease, royalty or other interests or 
rights in lands or minerals. Employees are not required to report lands 
developed and occupied for a personal residence.
    (4) Creditors. Debts owed to business entities and nonprofit 
organizations. Employees are not required to report debts owed to 
financial institutions (banks, savings and loan associations, credit 
unions, and the like) which are

[[Page 43]]

chartered to provide commercial or personal credit. Also excluded are 
charge accounts and similar short term debts for current and ordinary 
household and living expenses.
    (c) Employee certification, and, if applicable, a listing of 
exceptions.
    (1) The statement will provide for a signed certification by the 
employee that to the best of his or her knowledge, (i) none of the 
listed financial interests represent an interest in an underground or 
surface coal mining operation except as specifically identified and 
described as exceptions by the employee as part of the certificate, and 
(ii) the information shown on the statement is true, correct, and 
complete.
    (2) An employee is expected to (i) have complete knowledge of his or 
her personal involvement in business enterprises such as a sole 
proprietorship and partnership, his or her outside employment and the 
outside employment of the spouse and other covered relatives, and (ii) 
be aware of the information contained in the annual financial statement 
or other corporate or business reports routinely circulated to investors 
or routinely made available to the public.
    (3) The exceptions shown in the employee certification of the form 
must provide enough information for the Head of the State Regulatory 
Authority to determine the existence of a direct or indirect financial 
interest. Accordingly, the exceptions should:
    (i) List the financial interests;
    (ii) Show the number of shares, estimated value or annual income of 
the financial interests; and
    (iii) Include any other information which the employee believes 
should be considered in determining whether or not the interest 
represents a prohibited interest.
    (4) Employees are cautioned to give serious consideration to their 
direct and indirect financial interests before signing the statement of 
certification. Signing the certification without listing known 
prohibited financial interests may be cause for imposing the penalties 
prescribed in Sec. 705.6(a).

<R05>
Sec. 705.18  Gifts and gratuities.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, employees 
shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan or any other thing of monetary value, from a 
coal company which:
    (1) Conducts or is seeking to conduct, operations or activities that 
are regulated by the State Regulatory Authority; or
    (2) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or non-performance of the employee's official duty.
    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
in the context of obvious family or personal relationships, such as 
those between the parents, children, or spouse of the employee and the 
employee, when the circumstances make it clear that it is those 
relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned which 
are the motivating factors. An employee may accept:
    (1) Food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions 
in the ordinary course of a luncheon, dinner, or other meeting where an 
employee may properly be in attendance; and
    (2) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, 
pencils, note pads, calendars and other items of nominal value.
    (c) Employees found guilty of violating the provisions of this 
section will be subject to administrative remedies in accordance with 
existing or adopted State regulations or policies.


<R05>
Sec. 705.19  Resolving prohibited interests.

    (a) Actions to be taken by the Head of the State Regulatory 
Authority:
    (1) Remedial action to effect resolution. If an employee has a 
prohibited financial interest, the Head of the State Regulatory 
Authority shall promptly advise the employee that remedial action which 
will resolve the prohibited interest is required within 90 days.
    (2) Remedial action may include:
    (i) Reassignment of the employee to a position which performs no 
function or duty under the Act, or
    (ii) Divestiture of the prohibited financial interest, or

[[Page 44]]

    (iii) Other appropriate action which either eliminates the 
prohibited interest or eliminates the situation which creates the 
conflict.
    (3) Reports of noncompliance. If 90 days after an employee is 
notified to take remedial action that employee is not in compliance with 
the requirements of the Act and these regulations, the Head of the State 
Regulatory Authority shall report the facts of the situation to the 
Director who shall determine whether action to impose the penalties 
prescribed by the Act should be initiated. The report to the Director 
shall include the original or a certified true copy of the employee's 
statement and any other information pertinent to the Director's 
determination, including a statement of actions being taken at the time 
the report is made.
    (b) Actions to be taken by the Director:
    (1) Remedial action to effect resolution. Violations of the 
regulations in this part of the Head of a State Regulatory Authority, 
will be cause for remedial action by the Governor of the State or other 
appropriate State official based on recommendations from the Director on 
behalf of the Secretary. The Governor or other appropriate State 
official shall promptly advise the Head of the State Regulatory 
Authority that remedial action which will resolve the prohibited 
interest is required within 90 days.
    (2) Remedial action should be consistent with the procedures 
prescribed for other State employees by Sec. 705.19(a)(2).
    (3) Reports on noncompliance.
    (i) If 90 days after the Head of State Regulatory Authority is 
notified to take remedial action the Governor or other appropriate State 
official notifies the Director that the Head of the State Regulatory 
Authority is not in compliance with the Act and these regulations, the 
Director shall report the facts of the situation to the Secretary who 
shall determine whether the action to impose the penalties prescribed by 
the Act, or to impose the eligibility restrictions prescribed by Sec. 
705.1 should be initiated.
    (ii) Within 30 days of receipt of a noncompliance report from the 
Head of a Regulatory Authority under Sec. 705.19(a)(3), the Director 
shall notify the Head of the State Regulatory Authority and the employee 
involved of additional action to be taken. Actions which the Director 
may take include but are not limited to the granting of additional time 
for resolution or the initiation of action to impose the penalties 
prescribed by the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 705.21  Appeals procedures.

    Employees have the right to appeal an order for remedial action 
under Sec. 705.19, and shall have 30 days to exercise this right before

may file their appeal, in writing, through established procedures within 
their particular State.
    (b) The Head of the State Regulatory Authority may file his or her

[42 FR 56060, Oct. 20, 1977, as amended at 56 FR 46988, Sept. 19, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 706.6  Penalties.

    (a) Criminal penalties are imposed by section 201(f) of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-87, which 
prohibits each employee of the Office or any other Federal employee who 
performs any function or duty under the Act from having a direct or 
indirect financial interest in underground or surface coal mining 
operations. The Act provides that whoever knowingly violates the 
provisions of section 201(f) shall, upon conviction, be punished by a 
fine of not more than $2,500, or by imprisonment for not more than one 
year, or both.
    (b) Regulatory penalties are imposed by this part. The provisions in 
section 201(f) of the Act make compliance with the financial interest 
requirements a condition of employment for all Office employees and for 
other Federal employees who perform any functions or duties under the 
Act. Accordingly, an employee who fails to file the required financial 
statement will be considered in violation of the intended employment 
provisions of section 201(f) and will be subject to removal from his or 
her position.

[[Page 48]]


<R05>
Sec. 706.11  Who shall file.

    (a) Every employee in the Office is required to file a statement of 
employment and financial interests.
    (b) Any other Federal employee who performs any function or duty 
under the Act is required to file a statement of employment and 
financial interests. The Head of each other Federal agency and the Heads 
of other bureaus and offices within the U.S. Department of the Interior 
shall prepare and submit a report within 60 days of the effective date 
of these regulations, either listing the Federal positions identified as 
performing functions or duties under the Act, or listing the 
organizational unit and showing the total number of employees within the 
unit who must file a statement. Revision to the listing or certification 
that revision is not required shall be submitted to the Director by no 
later than September 30 of each year. The Secretary, the Director, or 
the Heads of the other affected Federal organizations may revise the 
list by the addition or deletion of positions at any time such revisions 
are required to carry out the purpose of the law or regulations of this 
part. Additions to or deletions from the list of positions are effective 
upon notification to the incumbents.


<R05>
Sec. 706.13  When to file.

    (a) Employees performing functions or duties under the Act will be 
required to file:
    (1) Within 120 days of the effective date of these regulations, and
    (2) Annually on February 1 of each year or at such other date as may 
be agreed to by the Director, provided that such alternative date will 
allow sufficient time to obtain information needed by the Director for 
his or her annual report to the Congress.
    (b) New employees hired, appointed, or transferred to perform 
functions or duties under the Act will be required to file at the time 
of entrance to duty.
    (c) New employees are not required to file an annual statement on 
the subsequent annual filing date if this date occurs within two months 
after their initial statement was filed. For example, an employee 
entering duty on December 1, 1978 would file a statement on that date. 
Because December 1 is within two months of February 1 the employee would 
not be required to file his or her next annual statement until February 
1, 1980.


<R05>
Sec. 706.15  Where to file.

    (a) Each Office employee shall file his or her statement of 
employment and financial interests with the Director.
    (b) Each Department of the Interior employee, who is not an Office 
employee but does perform any function or duty under the Act, shall file 
a statement of employment and financial interests with his or her 
appropriate Ethics Counselor as identified in 43 CFR 20.735-22(c).
    (c) Each employee of another Federal agency who performs a function 
or duty under the Act shall file a statement of employment and financial 
interests with the official designated by the Head of the other Federal 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 706.17  What to report.

    (a) Each employee shall report all information required on the 
statement of employment and financial interests of the employee, his or 
her spouse, minor children, or other relatives who are fulltime 
residents of the employee's home. The report shall be on a form provided 
by the Office or on a similar form adopted by another Federal agency. 
The statement shall consist of three major parts, (1) a listing of all 
financial interests, including employment, security, real property, 
creditor and other financial interests held during the course of the 
preceding year, (2) a certification that none of the listed financial 
interests represent a direct or indirect financial interest in an 
underground or surface coal mining operation except as specifically 
identified and described by the employee as part of the certificate, and 
(3) a certification by the reviewer that the form was reviewed, that 
prohibited interests have been resolved, and that no other prohibited 
interests have been identified from the statement.
    (b) Listing of all financial interests. The statement will set forth 
the following information regarding any financial interest:
    (1) Employment. Any continuing financial interests in business 
entities and nonprofit organizations through a

[[Page 49]]

pension or retirement plan, shared income, salary or other income 
arrangement as a result of prior or current employment. The employee, 
his or her spouse or other resident relative is not required to report a 
statement plan from which he or she will receive a guaranteed income. A 
guaranteed income is one which is unlikely to be changed as a result of 
actions taken by the Federal Government under the Act.
    (2) Securities. Any financial interest in business entities and 
nonprofit organizations through ownership of stock, stock options, 
bonds, securities or other arrangements including trusts. An employee is 
not required to report holdings in widely diversified mutual funds, 
investment clubs or regulated investment companies not specializing in 
underground and surface coal mining operations.
    (3) Real property. Ownership, lease, royalty or other interests or 
rights in lands or minerals. Employees are not required to report lands 
developed and occupied for a personal residence.
    (4) Creditors. Debts owed to business entities and nonprofit 
organizations. Employees are not required to report debts owed to 
financial institutions (banks, savings and loan associations, credit 
unions, and the like) which are chartered to provide commercial or 
personal credit. Also excluded are charge accounts and similar short 
term debts for current and ordinary household and living expenses.
    (c) Employee certification, and if applicable, a listing of 
exceptions.
    (1) The statement will provide for a signed certification by the 
employee that to the best of his or her knowledge, (i) none of the 
listed financial interests represent an interest in an underground or 
surface coal mining operation except as specifically identified and 
described as exceptions by the employee as part of the certificate, and 
(ii) the information shown on the statement is true, correct, and 
complete.
    (2) An employee is expected to (i) have complete knowledge of his or 
her personal involvement in business enterprises such as a sole 
proprietorship and partnership, his or her outside employment and the 
outside employment of the spouse and other covered relatives, and (ii) 
be aware of the information contained in the annual financial statements 
or other corporate or business reports routinely circulated to investors 
or routinely made available to the public.
    (3) The exceptions shown in the employee certification of the form 
must provide enough information for the Director, the Head of another 
Federal agency, or the Head of other bureaus or offices within the U.S. 
Department of the Interior to determine the existence of a direct or 
indirect financial interest. Accordingly, the exceptions should:
    (i) List the financial interests;
    (ii) Show the number of shares, estimated value or annual income of 
the financial interests; and
    (iii) Include any other information which the employee believes 
should be considered in determining whether or not the interest 
represents a prohibited interest.
    (4) Employees are cautioned to give serious consideration to their 
direct and indirect financial interests before signing the statement of 
certification. Signing the certification without listing known 
prohibited financial interests may be cause for imposing the penalties 
prescribed in Sec. 706.6(a).


<R05>
Sec. 706.18  Gifts and gratuities.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, employees 
shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a 
coal company which:
    (1) Conducts or is seeking to conduct operations or activities that 
are regulated by the Federal Government; or
    (2) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty.
    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
in the context of obvious family or personal relationships, such as 
those between the parents, children, or spouse of the employee and the 
employee, when the circumstances make it clear that it is those 
relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned

[[Page 50]]

which are the motivating factors. An employee may accept:
    (1) Food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions 
in the ordinary course of a luncheon, dinner, or other meeting where an 
employee may properly be in attendance, and
    (2) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, 
pencils, note pads, calendars and other items of nominal value.
    (c) Employees found guilty of violating the provisions of this 
section will be subject to administrative remedies in accordance with 
existing Federal regulations or policies.


<R05>
Sec. 706.19  Resolving prohibited interests.

    Actions to be taken by the Director, the heads of other Federal 
agencies, and the heads of other affected bureaus and offices within the 
U.S. Department of the Interior include:
    (a) Remedial action to effect resolution. If an employee has a 
prohibited financial interest, the head of the organizational entity 
(Department, bureau, office, etc.) where the employee works shall 
promptly advise the employee that remedial action which will resolve the 
prohibited interest is required within 90 days.
    (b) Remedial action may include: (1) Reassignment of the employee to 
a position which performs no function or duty under the Act, or
    (2) Divestiture of the prohibited financial interest, or
    (3) Other appropriate action which either eliminates the prohibited 
financial interest or eliminates the situation which creates the 
conflict.
    (c) Reports of noncompliance. If 90 days after an employee is 
notified to take remedial action that employee is not in compliance with 
the requirements of the Act and these regulations, the official, other 
than the Director, who ordered the remedial action shall promptly report 
the facts of the situation to the Director. The reports to the Director 
shall include the original or a certified true copy of the employee's 
statement and any other information pertinent to the Director, including 
a statement of actions being taken at the time the report is made. 
Within 30 days of receipt of a noncompliance report, the Director shall 
notify the head of the employing organization and the employee involved 
of additional action to be taken. Actions which the Director may take 
include but are not limited to the granting of additional time for 
resolution or the initiation of action to impose the penalties 
prescribed by the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 706.21  Appeals procedures.

    Employees have the right to appeal an order for remedial action 
under Sec. 706.19 and shall have 30 days to exercise this right before 
disciplinary action is initiated.
    (a) Office employees and other Department of the Interior employees 
may file their appeal, in writing, in accordance with the provisions in 
43 CFR 20.735-25(b).
    (b) Employees of other Federal agencies may file their appeal, in 
writing, in accordance with the established procedures of their 
employing agency.

<R05>
Sec. 707.1  Scope.

    (a) This part establishes the procedures for determining those 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations which are exempt from the 
Act and this chapter because the extraction of coal is an incidental 
part of Federal, State, or local government-financed highway or other 
construction.
    (b) This part exempts the extraction of coal which is incidental to 
government-financed construction from the requirements of the Act and 
this Chapter, if that extraction meets specified criteria which ensure 
that the construction is government-financed and

[[Page 51]]

that the extraction of coal is incidental to it.


<R05>
Sec. 707.4  Responsibility.

    (a) The regulatory authority is responsible for enforcing the 
requirements of this part.
    (b) Any person conducting coal extraction as an incidental part of 
government-financed construction is responsible for possessing, on the 
site of the extraction operation, the documentation required by 30 CFR 
707.12.


<R05>
Sec. 707.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following terms have the specified 
meaning:
    Extraction of coal as an incidental part means the extraction of 
coal which is necessary to enable the construction to be accomplished. 
For purposes of this part, only that coal extracted from within the 
right-of-way, in the case of a road, railroad, utility line or other 
such construction, or within the boundaries of the area directly 
affected by other types of government-financed construction, may be 
considered incidental to that construction. Extraction of coal outside 
the right-of-way or boundary of the area directly affected by the 
construction shall be subject to the requirements of the Act and this 
chapter.
    Government financing agency means a Federal, State, county, 
municipal, or local unit of government, or a department, bureau, agency 
or office of the unit which, directly or through another unit of 
government, finances construction.
    Government-financed construction means construction funded at 50 
percent or more by funds appropriated from a government financing 
agency's budget or obtained from general revenue bonds. Government 
financing at less than 50 percent may qualify if the construction is 
undertaken as an approved reclamation project under Title IV of the Act. 
Construction funded through government financing agency guarantees, 
insurance, loans, funds obtained through industrial revenue bonds or 
their equivalent, or in-kind payments does not qualify as government-
financed construction.

<R05>
Sec. 707.10  Information collection.

    Since the information collection requirement contained in 30 CFR 
707.12 consists only of expenditures on information collection 
activities that would be incurred by persons in the normal course of 
their activities, it is exempt from the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and does not require clearance by 
OMB.

Sec. 707.11  Applicability.

    (a) Coal extraction which is an incidental part of government-
financed construction is exempt from the Act and this chapter.
    (b) Any person who conducts or intends to conduct coal extraction 
which does not satisfy paragraph (a) of this section shall not proceed 
until a permit has been obtained from the regulatory authority under a 
State, Federal or Federal lands program.


<R05>
Sec. 707.12  Information to be maintained on site.

    Any person extracting coal incident to government-financed highway 
or other construction who extracts more than 250 tons of coal or affects 
more than two acres shall maintain, on the site of the extraction 
operation and available for inspection, documents which show--
    (a) A description of the construction project;
    (b) The exact location of the construction, right-of-way or the

<R05>
Sec. 710.1  Scope.

    (a) This part provides general introductory and applicability 
material for the initial regulatory program required by section 502 and 
other sections of the Act which require early implementation. The 
initial regulatory program is effective until permanent programs are 
approved in accordance with sections 503, 504, or 523 of the Act.
    (b) The initial regulatory program which this part introduces 
includes--
    (1) Environmental performance standards of parts 715 through 718 of 
this chapter.
    (2) Inspection and enforcement procedures of parts 720 through 723 
of this chapter; and
    (3) Reimbursements to States of part 725 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 710.2  Objectives.

    The objectives of the initial regulatory program are to--
    (a) Protect the health and safety of the public and minimize the 
damage to the environment resulting from surface coal mining operations 
during the interval between enactment of the Act and adoption of a 
permanent State or Federal regulatory program; and
    (b) Coordinate the State and Federal regulatory programs to 
accomplish the purposes of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 710.3  Authority.

    (a) The Secretary is directed to implement an initial regulatory 
program within six months after the date of enactment of the Act in each 
State which regulates any aspect of surface coal mining under one or 
more State laws until a State program has been approved or until a 
Federal program has been implemented.
    (b) The Secretary is also authorized to regulate surface coal mining 
and reclamation operations on Federal Lands by the Mineral Leasing Act 
of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181-287) and the Minerals, 
Leasing Act for Acquired Lands (30 U.S.C. 351-359) and on Indian lands 
by various Indian lands acts. Additional regulations under these Acts 
are in 30 CFR part 211,\1\ 43 CFR part 3041 and 25 CFR part 177.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<R05>
Sec. 710.4  Responsibility.

    (a) Under the general direction of the Assistant Secretary, Energy 
and Minerals, the Director is responsible for administering the initial 
regulatory program established by the Secretary.
    (b) The States are responsible for issuing permits and inspection 
and enforcement on lands on which operations are regulated by a State to 
insure compliance with the initial performance standards in parts 715 
through 718 of this chapter. States are required to file copies of 
inspection reports with the Office. States are also responsible for 
assuring that permits are not issued which would be in conflict with the 
restriction on mining found in section 510 of the Act, particularly in 
regard to alluvial valley floors and prime farm lands, and section 
522(e) of the Act in regard to prohibitions of mining on certain lands.


<R05>
Sec. 710.5  Definitions.

    As used throughout the initial regulatory program the following 
terms have the specified meanings unless otherwise indicated:
    Acid drainage means water with a pH of less than 6.0 discharged from 
active

[[Page 53]]

or abandoned mines and from areas affected by coal mining operations.
    Acid-forming materials means earth materials that contain sulfide 
mineral or other materials which, if exposed to air, water, or 
weathering processes, will cause acids that may create acid drainage.
    Alluvial valley floors means unconsolidated stream-laid deposits 
holding streams where water availability is sufficient for subirrigation 
or flood irrigation agricultural activities but does not include upland 
areas which are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial 
deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion, deposits by 
unconcentrated runoff or slope wash, together with talus, other mass 
movement accumulation and windblown deposits.
    Approximate original contour means that surface configuration 
achieved by backfilling and grading of the mined area so that the 
reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely 
resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining 
and blends into and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding 
terrain, with all highwalls and spoil piles eliminated; water 
impoundments may be permitted where the regulatory authority determines 
that they are in compliance with Sec. 715.17.
    Aquifer means a zone, stratum, or group of strata that can store and 
transmit water in sufficient quantities for a specific use.
    Combustible material means organic material that is capable of 
burning either by fire or through a chemical process (oxidation) 
accompanied by the evolution of heat and a significant temperature rise.
    Compaction means the reduction of pore spaces among the particles of 
soil or rock, generally done by running heavy equipment over the earth 
materials.
    Disturbed area means those lands that have been affected by surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations.
    Diversion means a channel, embankment, or other manmade structure 
constructed for the purpose of diverting water from one area to another.
    Downslope means the land surface between a valley floor and the 
projected outcrop of the lowest coalbed being mined along each highwall.
    Embankment means an artificial deposit of material that is raised 
above the natural surface of the land and used to contain, divert, or 
store water, support roads or railways, or other similar purposes.
    Essential hydrologic functions means, with respect to alluvial 
valley floors, the role of the valley floor in collecting, storing, and 
regulating the natural flow of surface water and ground water, and in 
providing a place for irrigated and subirrigated farming, by reason of 
its position in the landscape and the characteristics of its underlying 
material.
    Flood irrigation means irrigation through natural overflow or the 
temporary diversion of high flows in which the entire surface of the 
soil is covered by a sheet of water.
    Ground water means subsurface water that fills available openings in 
rock or soil materials such that they may be considered water-saturated.
    Head-of-hollow fill means a fill structure consisting of any 
material, other than coal processing waste and organic material, placed 
in the uppermost reaches of a hollow where side slopes of the fill 
measured at the steepest point are greater that 20[deg] or the profile 
of the hollow from the toe of the fill to the top of the fill is greater 
than 10[deg]. In fills with less than 250.00 cubic yards of material, 
associated with contour mining, the top surface of the fill will be at 
the elevation of the coal seam. In all other head-of-hollow fills, the 
top surface of the fill, when completed, is at approximately the same 
elevation as the adjacent ridge line, and no significant area of natural 
drainage occurs above the fill draining into the fill area.
    Highwall means the face of exposed overburden and coal in an open 
cut of a surface or for entry to an underground coal mine.
    Hydrologic balance means the relationship between the quality and 
quantity of inflow to, outflow from, and storage in a hydrologic unit 
such as a drainage basin, aquifer, soil zone, lake,

[[Page 54]]

or reservoir. It encompasses the quantity and quality relationships 
between precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and the change in ground and 
surface water storage.
    Hydrologic regime means the entire state of water movement in a 
given area. It is a function of the climate, and includes the phenomena 
by which water first occurs as atmospheric water vapor, passes into a 
liquid or solid form and falls as precipitation, moves thence along or 
into the ground surface, and returns to the atmosphere a vapor by means 
of evaporation and transpiration.
    Impoundment means a closed basin formed naturally or artificially 
built, which is dammed or excavated for the retention of water, 
sediment, or waste.
    Intermittent or perennial stream means a stream or part of a stream 
that flows continuously during all (perennial) or for at least one month 
(intermittent) of the calendar year as a result of ground-water 
discharge or surface runoff. The term does not include an ephemeral 
stream which is one that flows for less than one month of a calendar 
year and only in direct response to precipitation in the immediate 
watershed and whose channel bottom is always above the local water 
table.
    Leachate means a liquid that has percolated through soil, rock, or 
waste and has extracted dissolved or suspended materials.
    Noxious plants means species that have been included on official 
State lists of noxious plants for the State in which the operation 
occurs.
    Overburden means material of any nature, consolidated or 
unconsolidated, that overlies a coal deposit, excluding topsoil.
    Outslope means the exposed area sloping away from a bench or terrace 
being constructed as a part of a surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation.
    Productivity means the vegetative yield produced by a unit area for 
a unit of time.
    Recharge capacity means the ability of the soils and underlying 
materials to allow precipitation and runoff to infiltrate and reach the 
zone of saturation.
    Roads means access and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, 
improved, or maintained for use in surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations, including use by coal-hauling vehicles leading to transfer, 
processing, or storage areas. The term includes any such road used and 
not graded to approximate original contour within 45 days of 
construction other than temporary roads used for topsoil removal and 
coal haulage roads within the pit area. Roads maintained with public 
funds such as all Federal, State, county, or local roads are excluded.
    Recurrence interval means the precipitation event expected to occur, 
on the average, once in a specified interval. For example, the 10-year 
24-hour precipitation event would be that 24-hour precipitation event 
expected to be exceeded on the average once in 10 years. Magnitude of 
such events are as defined by the National Weather Service Technical 
Paper No. 40, ``Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the U.S.,'' May 1961, and 
subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or rainfall probability 
information developed therefrom.
    Runoff means precipitation that flows overland before entering a 
defined stream channel and becoming streamflow.
    Safety factor means the ratio of the available shear strength to the 
developed shear stress on a potential surface of sliding determined by 
accepted engineering practice.
    Sediment means undissolved organic and inorganic material 
transported or deposited by water.
    Sedimentation pond means any natural or artifical structure or 
depression used to remove sediment from water and store sediment or 
other debris.
    Slope means average inclination of a surface, measured from the 
horizontal. Normally expressed as a unit of vertical distance to a given 
number of units of horizontal distance (e.g., 1v to 5h=20 percent=11.3 
degrees).
    Soil horizons means contrasting layers of soil lying one below the 
other, parallel or nearly parallel to the land surface. Soil horizons 
are differentiated on the basis of field characteristics and laboratory 
data. The three major soil horizons are--
    (a) A horizon. The uppermost layer in the soil profile often called 
the surface soil. It is the part of the soil in which organic matter is 
most abundant, and

[[Page 55]]

where leaching of soluble or suspended particles is the greatest.
    (b) B horizon. The layer immediately beneath the A horizon and often 
called the subsoil. This middle layer commonly contains more clay, iron, 
or aluminum than the A or C horizons.
    (c) C horizon. The deepest layer of the soil profile. It consists of 
loose material or weathered rock that is relatively unaffected by 
biologic activity.
    Spoil means overburden that has been removed during surface mining.
    Stabilize means any method used to control movement of soil, spoil 
piles, or areas of disturbed earth and includes increasing bearing 
capacity, increasing shear strength, draining, compacting, or 
revegetating.
    Subirrigation means irrigation of plants with water delivered to the 
roots from underneath.
    Surface water means water, either flowing or standing, on the 
surface of the earth.
    Suspended solids means organic or inorganic materials carried or 
held in suspension in water that will remain on a 0.45 micron filter.
    Toxic-forming materials means earth materials or wastes which, if 
acted upon by air, water, weathering, or microbiological processes, are 
likely to produce chemical or physical conditions in soils or water that 
are detrimental to biota or uses of water.
    Toxic-mine drainage means water that is discharged from active or 
abandoned mines and other areas affected by coal mining operations and 
which contains a substance which through chemical action or physical 
effects is likely to kill, injure, or impair biota commonly present in 
the area that might be exposed to it.
    Valley fill means a fill structure consisting of any material other 
than coal waste and organic material that is placed in a valley where 
side slopes of the fill measured at the steepest point are greater than 
20[deg] or the profile of the hollow from the toe of the fill to the top 
of the fill is greater than 10[deg].
    Waste means earth materials, which are combustible, physically 
unstable, or acid-forming or toxic-forming, wasted or otherwise 
separated from product coal and are slurried or otherwise transported 
from coal processing facilities or preparation plants after physical or 
chemical processing, cleaning, or concentrating of coal.
    Water table means upper surface of a zone of saturation, where the 
body of ground water is not confined by an overlying impermeable zone.

    (i) The exemption shall be effective on the date approved. It shall 
remain in effect until expiration or renewal of the State permit to 
which it applies, December 31, 1978, or until revoked, whichever is 
earlier.
    (j) The Director shall revoke the exemption upon finding that the 
exemption was erroneously issued or that the exempted operation has or 
will produce more than 100,000 tons of coal per year.

Sec. 715.11  General obligations.

    (a) Compliance. All surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
conducted on lands where any element of the operations is regulated by a 
State shall comply with the initial performance standards of this part 
according to the time schedule specified in Sec. 710.11. Part 717 of 
this chapter establishes performance standards for surface effects of 
underground coal mines. Initial regulations regarding the special 
Initial Performance Standards are established by part 716 of this 
chapter for--
    (1) Surface coal mining operations on steep slopes;
    (2) Surface coal mining operations involving mountaintop removal;
    (3) Special bituminous coal mines;
    (4) Anthracite surface coal mining operations;
    (5) Surface coal mining operations in Alaska; and
    (6) Surface coal mining operations on prime farmlands.

Where State environmental protection standards are adopted for a 
specific State because they are more stringent than the standards of 
parts 715, 716, and 717, they will be published in part 718 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Authorizations to operate. A copy of all current permits, 
licenses, approved plans, or other authorizations to operate the mine 
shall be available for inspection at or near the mine site.
    (c)(1) Mine maps. Any person conducting surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on and after May 3, 1978, shall submit two copies 
of an accurate map of the mine and permit area at a scale of 1:6000 or 
larger. The map shall show as of May 3, 1978, the lands from which coal 
has not yet been removed and the lands and structures which have been 
used or disturbed to facilitate mining. One copy of the mine map shall 
be submitted to the State regulatory authority and one copy shall be 
submitted to the Regional Director, OSM, before July 3, 1978.
    (2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, any person who conducted surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations pursuant to a small operator's exemption shall submit before 
March 15, 1979, two copies of an accurate map of each mine showing the 
permit area at a scale of 1:6000 or larger. One copy shall be submitted 
to the state regulatory authority and one copy to the appropriate 
Regional Director, OSM. The map shall show as of December 31, 1978 or 
the expiration date of the exemption (whichever is earlier) the lands 
from which coal had not yet been removed, the lands and structures which 
had been used or disturbed to facilitate mining, and the lands which had 
not been disturbed. The map need not be submitted if these areas have 
already been shown on mine maps submitted to the state regulatory 
authority, if a copy is available to the appropriate Regional Director 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section or 30 CFR 720.13(b).
    (d) Indian lands--(1) Mine maps. Any person conducting surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations on Indian lands under this part shall 
submit no fewer than 7 copies of an accurate map of the mine and 
authorized mining areas at a scale of 1:6000 or larger. The map shall 
show, as of December 16, 1977, the lands where coal has not yet been 
removed and the lands and structures that have been used or disturbed to 
facilitate surface coal mining operations.
    (2) Consultation with tribal governments. Any requirement in this 
part for consultation with or notification to

[[Page 60]]

State and local governments shall be interpreted as requiring, in like 
manner, consultation with or notification to tribal governments. OSM 
shall consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs with respect to special 
requirements relating to the protection of noncoal resources and with 
the Bureau of Land Management with respect to the requirements relating 
to the development, production, and recovery of mineral resources on 
Indian lands.

    (a) Specifications. All signs required to be posted shall be of a 
standard design that can be seen and read easily and shall be made of 
durable material. The signs and other markers shall be maintained during 
all operations to which they pertain and shall conform to local 
ordinances and codes.
    (b) Mine and permit identification signs. Signs identifying the mine 
area shall be displayed at all points of access to the permit area from 
public roads and highways. Signs shall show the name, business address, 
and telephone number of the permittee and identification numbers of 
current mining and reclamation permits or other authorizations to 
operate. Such signs shall not be removed until after release of all 
bonds.
    (c) Perimeter markers. The perimeter of the permit area shall be 
clearly marked by durable and easily recognized markers, or by other 
means approved by the regulatory authority.
    (d) Buffer zone markers. Buffer zones as defined in Sec. 715.17 
shall be marked in a manner consistent with the perimeter markers along 
the interior boundary of the buffer zone.
    (e) Blasting signs. If blasting is necessary to conduct surface coal 
mining operations, signs reading ``Blasting Area'' shall be displayed 
conspicuously at the edge of blasting areas along access and haul roads 
within the mine property. Signs reading ``Blasting Area'' and explaining 
the blasting warning and all-clear signals shall be posted at all 
entrances to the permit area.
    (f) Topsoil markers. Where topsoil or other vegetation-supporting 
material is segregated and stockpiled according to Sec. 715.16(c), the 
stockpiled material shall be marked. Markers shall remain in place until 
the material is removed.


<R05>
Sec. 715.13  Postmining use of land.

    (a) General. All disturbed areas shall be restored in a timely 
manner (1) to conditions that are capable of supporting the uses which 
they were capable of supporting before any mining, or (2) to higher or 
better uses achievable under criteria and procedures of paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (b) Determining premining use of land. The premining uses of land to 
which the postmining land use is compared shall be those uses which the 
land previously supported if the land had not been previously mined and 
had been properly managed.
    (1) The postmining land use for land that has been previously mined 
and not reclaimed shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best 
use that can be achieved and is compatible with surrounding areas.
    (2) The postmining land use for land that has received improper 
management shall be judged on the basis of the premining use of 
surrounding lands that have received proper management.
    (3) If the premining use of the land was changed within 5 years of 
the beginning of mining, the comparison of postmining use to premining 
use shall include a comparison with the historic use of the land as well 
as its use immediately preceding mining.
    (c) Land-use categories. Land use is categorized in the following 
groups. Change from one to another land use category in premining to 
postmining constitutes an alternate land use and the permittee shall 
meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section and all other 
applicable environmental protection performance standards of this 
chapter.
    (1) Heavy industry. Manufacturing facilities, powerplants, airports 
or similar facilities.
    (2) Light industry and commercial services. Office buildings, 
stores, parking facilities, apartment housed, motels, hotels, or similar 
facilities.

    (d) Criteria for approving alternative postmining use of land. An 
alternative postmining land use shall be approved by the regulatory 
authority, after consultation with the landowner or the land-management 
agency having jurisdiction over State or Federal lands, if the following 
criteria are met. Proposals to remove an entire coal seam running 
through the upper part of a mountain, ridge, or hill must also meet 
these criteria in addition to the requirements of Sec. 716.3 of this 
chapter.
    (1) The proposed land use is compatible with adjacent land use and, 
where applicable, with existing local, State or Federal land use 
policies and plans. A written statement of the views of the authorities 
with statutory responsibilities for land use policies and plans shall 
accompany the request for approval. The permittee shall obtain any 
required approval of local, State or Federal land management agencies, 
including any necessary zoning or other changes necessarily required for 
the final land use.
    (2) Specific plans have been prepared which show the feasibility of 
the proposed land use as related to needs, projected land use trends, 
and markets and that include a schedule showing how the proposed use 
will be developed and achieved within a reasonable time after mining and 
be sustained. The regulatory authority may require appropriate 
demonstrations to show that the planned procedures are feasible, 
reasonable, and integrated with mining and reclamation, and that the 
plans will result in successful reclamation.
    (3) Provision of any necessary public facilities is assured as 
evidenced by letters of commitment from parties other than the 
permittee, as appropriate, to provide them in a manner compatible with 
the permittee's plans.
    (4) Specific and feasible plans for financing attainment and 
maintenance of the postmining land use including letters of commitment

threat of water flow diminution or pollution.
    (7) The use or uses will not involve unreasonable delays in 
reclamation.
    (8) Necessary approval of measures to prevent or mitigate adverse 
effects on fish and wildlife has been obtained from the regulatory 
authority and appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management 
agencies.
    (9) Proposals to change premining land uses of range, fish and 
wildlife habitat, forest land, hayland, or pasture to a postmining 
cropland use, where the cropland would require continous maintenance 
such as seeding, plowing, cultivation, fertilzation, or other similar 
practices to be practicable or to comply with applicable Federal, State, 
and local laws, shall be reviewed by the regulatory authority to assure 
that--
    (i) There is a firm written commitment by the permittee or by the 
landowner or land manager to provide sufficient crop management after 
release of applicable performance bonds to assure that the proposed 
postmining cropland use remains practical and reasonable;
    (ii) There is sufficient water available and committed to maintain 
crop production; and
    (iii) Topsoil quality and depth are shown to be sufficient to 
support the proposed use.

<R05>
Sec. 715.14  Backfilling and grading.

    In order to achieve the approximate orginal contour, the permittee 
shall, except as provided in this section, transport, backfill, compact 
(where advisable to ensure stability or to prevent leaching of toxic 
materials), and grade all spoil material to eliminate all highwalls, 
spoil piles, and depressions. Cut-and-fill terraces may be used only in 
those situations expressly identified in this section. The postmining 
graded slopes must approximate the premining natural slopes in the area 
as defined in paragraph (a).
    (a) Slope measurements. (1) To determine the natural slopes of the 
area before mining, sufficient slopes to adequately represent the land 
surface configuration, and as approved by the regulatory authority in 
accordance with site conditions, must be accurately measured and 
recorded. Each measurement shall consist of an angle of inclination 
along the prevailing slope extending 100 linear feet above and below or 
beyond the coal outcrop or the area to be disturbed; or, where this is 
impractical, at locations specified by the regulatory authority. Where 
the area has been previously mined, the measurements shall extend at 
least 100 feet beyond the limits of mining disturbances as determined by 
the regulatory authority to be representative of the premining 
configuration of the land. Slope measurements shall take into account 
natural variations in slope so as to provide accurate representation of 
the range of natural slopes and shall reflect geomorphic differences of 
the area to be disturbed. Slope measurements may be made from 
topographic maps showing contour lines, having sufficient detail and 
accuracy consistent with the submitted mining and reclamation plan.
    (2) After the disturbed area has been graded, the final graded 
slopes shall be measured at the beginning and end of lines established 
on the prevailing slope at locations representative of premining slope 
conditions and approved by the regulatory authority. These measurements 
must not be made so as to allow unacceptably steep slopes to be 
constructed.
    (b) Final graded slopes. (1) The final graded slopes shall not 
exceed either the approximate premining slopes as determined according 
to paragraph (a)(1) and approved by the regulatory authority or any 
lesser slope specifed by the regulatory based on consideration of soil, 
climate, or other characteristics of the surrounding area. Postmining 
final graded slopes need not be uniform. The requirements of this 
paragraph may be modifed by the regulatory authority where the mining is 
reaffecting previously mined lands that have not been restored to the

[[Page 63]]

standards of this section and sufficient spoil is not available to 
return to the slope determined according to paragraph (a)(1). Where such 
modifications are approved, the permittee shall, as a minimum, be 
required to--
    (i) Retain all overburden and spoil on the solid portion of existing 
or new benches; and
    (ii) Backfill and grade to the most moderate slope possible to 
eliminate the highwall which does not exceed the angle of repose or such 
lesser slopes as is necessary to assure stability.
    (2) On approval by the regulatory authority and in order to conserve 
soil moisture, ensure stability, and control erosion on final graded 
slopes, cut-and-fill terraces may be allowed if the terraces are 
compatible with the postmining land use approved under Sec. 715.13, and 
are appropriate substitutes for construction of lower grades on the 
reclaimed lands. The terraces shall meet the following requirements:
    (i) Where specialized grading, foundation conditions, or roads are 
required for the approved postmining land use, the final grading may 
include a terrace of adequate width to ensure the safety, stability, and 
erosion control necessary to implement the postmining land use plan.
    (ii) The vertical distance between terraces shall be as specified by 
the regulatory authority to prevent excessive erosion and to provide 
long-term stability.
    (iii) The slope of the terrace outslope shall not exceed 1v:2h (50 
percent). Outslopes which exceed 1v:2h (50 percent) may be approved if 
they have a minimum static safety factor of more than 1.5 and provide 
adequate control over erosion and closely resemble the surface 
configuration of the land prior to mining. In no case may highwalls be 
left as part of terraces.
    (iv) Culverts and underground rock drains shall be used on the 
terrace only when approved by the regulatory authority.
    (3) All operations on steep slopes of 20 degrees or more or on such 
lesser slopes as the regulatory authority defines as a steep slope shall 
meet the provisions of Sec. 716.2 of this chapter.
    (c) Mountaintop removal. The requirements of this paragraph and of 
Sec. 716.3 shall apply to surface mining operations which remove entire 
coal seams in the upper part of a mountain, ridge, or hill by removing 
all of the overburden, and where the requirements for achieving the 
approximate original contour of this section cannot be met. Final graded 
top plateau slopes on the mined area shall be less than 1v:5h so as to 
create a level plateau or gently rolling configuration and the outslopes 
of the plateau shall not exceed 1v:2h, except where engineering data 
substantiates and the regulatory authority finds that a minimum static 
safety factor of 1.5 (or higher factors specified by the regulatory 
authority) will be attained. Although the area need not be restored to 
approximate original contour, all highwalls, spoil piles, and 
depressions except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section 
shall be eliminated. All mountaintop removal operations shall in 
addition meet the provisions of Sec. 716.3 of this chapter.
    (d) Small depressions. The requirement of this section to achieve 
approximate original contour does not prohibit construction of small 
depressions if they are approved by the regulatory authority to minimize 
erosion, conserve soil moisture or promote revegetation. These 
depressions shall be compatible with the approved postmining land use 
and shall not be inappropriate substitutes for construction of lower 
grades on the reclaimed lands. Depressions approved under this section 
shall have a holding capacity of less than 1 cubic yard of water or, if 
it is necessary that they be larger, shall not restrict normal access 
throughout the area or constitute a hazard. Large, permanent 
impoundments shall be governed by paragraph (e) of this section and by 
Sec. 715.17.
    (e) Permanent impoundments. Permanent impoundments may be retained 
in mined and reclaimed areas provided all highwalls are eliminated by 
grading to appropriate contour and the provisions for postmining land 
use (Sec. 715.13) and protection of the hydrologic balance (Sec. 
715.17) are met. No impoundments shall be constructed on top of areas in 
which excess materials are deposited pursuant to Sec. 715.15 of this 
part. Impoundments shall not be used to meet

[[Page 64]]

the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section.
    (f) Definition of thin and thick restored overburden. The thin 
overburden provisions of paragraph (g) of this section may apply only 
where the final thickness is less than 0.8 of the initial thickness. The 
thick overburden provisions of paragraph (h) of this section may apply 
only where the final thickness is greater than 1.2 of the initial 
thickness. Initial thickness is the sum of the overburden thickness and 
coal thickness. Final thickness is the product of the overburden 
thickness times the bulking factor to be determined for each mine area. 
The provisions of paragraphs (g) and (h) apply only when operations 
cannot be carried out to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section to achieve the approximate original contour.
    (g) Thin overburden. In surface coal mining operations carried out 
continuously in the same limited pit area for more than 1 year from the 
day coal-removal operations begin and where the volume of all available 
spoil and suitable waste materials is demonstrated to be insufficient to 
achieve approximate original contour, surface coal mining operations 
shall be conducted to meet, at a minimum, the following standards:
    (1) Transport, backfill, and grade, using all available spoil and 
suitable waste materials from the entire mine area, to attain the lowest 
practicable stable grade, which may not exceed the angle of repose, and 
to provide adequate drainage and long-term stability of the regraded 
areas.
    (2) Eliminate highwalls by grading or backfilling to stable slopes 
not exceeding 1v:2h (50 percent), or such lesser slopes as the 
regulatory authority may specify to reduce erosion, maintain the 
hydrologic balance, or allow the approved postmining land use.
    (3) Transport, backfill, grade, and revegetate to achieve an 
ecologically sound land use compatible with the prevailing land use in 
unmined areas surrounding the permit area.
    (4) Transport, backfill, and grade to ensure the impoundments are 
constructed only where it has been demonstrated to the regulatory 
authority's satisfaction that all requirements of Sec. 715.17 have been 
met and that the impoundments have been approved by the regulatory 
authority as meeting the requirements of this part and all other 
applicable Federal and State regulations.
    (h) Thick overburden. In surface coal mining operations where the 
volume of spoil is demonstrated to be more than sufficient to achieve 
the approximate original contour surface coal mining operations shall be 
conducted to meet at a minimum the following standards:
    (1) Transport, backfill, and grade all spoil and wastes not required 
to achieve approximate original contour in the surface mining area to 
the lowest practicable grade.
    (2) Deposit, backfill, and grade excess spoil and wastes only within 
the permit area and dispose of such materials in conformance with this 
part.
    (3) Transport, backfill, and grade excess spoil and wastes to 
maintain the hydrologic balance in accordance with this part and to 
provide long-term stability.
    (4) Transport, backfill, grade, and revegetate wastes and excess 
spoil to achieve an ecologically sound land use compatible with the 
prevailing land uses in unmined areas surrounding the permit area.
    (5) Eliminate all highwalls and depressions except as stated in 
paragraph (e) of this section by backfilling with spoil and suitable 
waste materials.
    (i) Regrading or stabilizing rills and gullies. When rills or 
gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas that have been regraded and 
the topsoil replaced but vegetation has not yet been established the 
permittee shall fill, grade, or otherwise stabilize the rills and 
gullies and reseed or replant the areas according to Sec. 715.20. The 
regulatory authority shall specify that rills or gullies of lesser size 
be stabilized if the rills or gullies will be disruptive to the approved 
postmining land use or may result in additional erosion and 
sedimentation.
    (j) Covering coal and acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible, and 
other waste materials; stabilizing backfilled materials; and using waste 
material for fill--(1) Cover. All exposed coal seams remaining after 
mining and any acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible

[[Page 65]]

materials, or any other waste materials identified by the regulatory 
authority that are exposed, used, or produced during mining shall be 
covered with a minimum of 4 feet of nontoxic and noncombustible 
material; or, if necessary, treated to neutralize toxicity in order to 
prevent water pollution and sustained combustion, and to minimize 
adverse effects on plant growth and land uses. Where necessary to 
protect against upward migration of salts, exposure by erosion, to 
provide an adequate depth for plant growth, or to otherwise meet local 
conditions, the regulatory authority shall specify thicker amounts of 
cover using nontoxic material. Acid-forming or toxic-forming material 
shall not be buried or stored in proximity to a drainage course so as to 
cause or pose a threat of water pollution or otherwise violate the 
provisions of Sec. 715.17 of this part.
    (2) Stabilization. Backfilled materials shall be selectively placed 
and compacted wherever necessary to prevent leaching of toxic-forming 
materials into surface or subsurface waters in accordance with Sec. 
715.17 and wherever necessary to ensure the stability of the backfilled 
materials. The method of compacting material and the design 
specifications shall be approved by the regulatory authority before the 
toxic materials are covered.
    (3) Use of waste materials as fill. Before waste materials from a 
coal preparation or conversion facility or from other activities 
conducted outside the permit area such as municipal wastes are used for 
fill material, it must be demonstrated to the regulatory authority by 
hydrogeological means and chemical and physical analyses that use of 
these materials will not adversely affect water quality, water flow, and 
vegetation; will not present hazards to public health and safety; and 
will not cause instability in the backfilled area.
    (k) Grading along the contour. All final grading, preparation of 
overburden before replacement of topsoil, and placement of topsoil, in 
accordance with Sec. 715.16, shall be done along the contour to 
minimize subsequent erosion and instability. If such grading, 
preparation or placement along the contour would be hazardous to 
equipment operators then grading, preparation or placement in a 
direction other than generally parallel to the contour may be used. In 
all cases, grading, preparation, or placement shall be conducted in a 
manner which minimizes erosion and provides a surface for replacement of 
topsoil which will minimize slippage.

Sec. 715.15  Disposal of excess spoil.

    (a) General requirements. (1) Spoil not required to achieve the 
approximate original contour within the area where overburden has been 
removed shall be hauled or conveyed to and placed in designated disposal 
areas within a permit area, if the disposal areas are authorized for 
such purposes in the approved permit application in accordance with 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. The spoil shall be placed in 
a controlled manner to ensure--
    (i) That leachate and surface runoff from the fill will not degrade 
surface or ground waters or exceed the effluent limitations of Sec. 
715.17(a)
    (ii) Stability of the fill; and
    (iii) That the land mass designated as the disposal area is suitable 
for reclamation and revegetation compatible with the natural 
surroundings.
    (2) The fill shall be designed using recognized professional 
standards, certified by a registered professional engineer, and approved 
by the regulatory authority.
    (3) All vegetative and organic materials shall be removed from the 
disposal area and the topsoil shall be removed, segregated, and stored 
or replaced under Sec. 715.16. If approved by the regulatory authority, 
organic material may be used as mulch or may be included in the topsoil 
to control erosion, promote growth of vegetation, or increase the 
moisture retention of the soil.
    (4) Slope protection shall be provided to minimize surface erosion 
at the site. Diversion design shall conform with the requirements of 
Sec. 715.17(c). All disturbed areas, including diversion ditches that 
are not rip rapped, shall be vegetated upon completion of construction.

[[Page 66]]

    (5) The disposal areas shall be located on the most moderately 
sloping and naturally stable areas available as approved by the 
regulatory authority. If such placement provides additional stability 
and prevents mass movement, fill materials suitable for disposal shall 
be placed upon or above a natural terrace, bench, or berm.
    (6) The spoil shall be hauled or conveyed and placed in horizontal 
lifts in a controlled manner, concurrently compacted as necessary to 
ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement, covered, and graded to 
allow surface and subsurface drainage to be compatible with the natural 
surroundings and ensure a long-term static safety factor of 1.5.
    (7) The final configuration of the fill must be suitable for 
postmining land uses approved in accordance with Sec. 715.13, except 
that no depressions or impoundments shall be allowed on the completed 
fill.
    (8) Terraces may be utilized to control erosion and enhance 
stability if approved by the regulatory authority and consistent with 
Sec. 715.14(b)(2).
    (9) Where the slope in the disposal area exceeds 1v:2.8h (36 
percent), or such lesser slope as may be designated by the regulatory 
authority based on local conditions, keyway cuts (excavations to stable 
bedrock) or rock toe buttresses shall be constructed to stabilize the 
fill. Where the toe of the spoil rests on a downslope, stability 
analyses shall be performed to determine the size of rock toe buttresses 
and key way cuts.
    (10) The fill shall be inspected for stability by a registered 
engineer or other qualified professional specialist experienced in the 
construction of earth and rockfill embankments at least quarterly 
throughout construction and during the following critical construction 
periods: (i) Removal of all organic material and topsoil, (ii) placement 
of underdrainage systems, (iii) installation of surface drainage 
systems, (iv) placement and compaction of fill materials, and (v) 
revegetation. The registered engineer or other qualified professional 
specialist shall provide to the regulatory authority a certified report 
within 2 weeks after each inspection that the fill has been constructed 
as specified in the design approved by the regulatory authority. A copy 
of the report shall be retained at the minesite.
    (11) Coal processing wastes shall not be disposed of in head-of-
hollow or valley fills, and may only be disposed of in other excess 
spoil fills, if such waste is--
    (i) Demonstrated to be nontoxic and nonacid forming; and
    (ii) Demonstrated to be consistent with the design stability of the 
fill.
    (12) If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade 
watercourses, or wet-weather seeps, an underdrain system consisting of 
durable rock shall be constructed from the wet areas in a manner that 
prevents infiltration of the water into the spoil material. The 
underdrain system shall be protected by an adequate filter and shall be 
designed and constructed using standard geotechnical engineering 
methods.
    (13) The foundation and abutments of the fill shall be stable under 
all conditions of construction and operation. Sufficient foundation 
investigation and laboratory testing of foundation materials shall be 
performed in order to determine the design requirements for stability of 
the foundation. Analyses of foundation conditions shall include the 
effect of underground mine workings, if any, upon the stability of the 
structure.
    (14) Excess spoil may be returned to underground mine workings, but 
only in accordance with a disposal program approved by the regulatory 
authority and MSHA.
    (15) Disposal of excess spoil from an upper actively mined bench to 
a lower pre-existing bench by means of gravity transport is permitted 
provided that:
    (i) The operator receives the prior written approval of the 
regulatory authority upon demonstration by the operator that the spoil 
to be disposed of by gravity transport is not necessary for elimination 
of the highwall and return of the upper bench to approximate original 
contour;
    (ii) The following conditions and performance standards in addition 
to the environmental performance standards of this part are met:
    (A) The highwall of the lower bench intersects (meets) the upper 
actively

[[Page 67]]

mined bench with no natural slope between them;
    (B) The gravity transport points are determined on a site specific 
basis by the operator and approved by the regulatory authority to 
minimize hazards to health and safety and to ensure that damage will be 
minimized should spoil accidentally move down-slope of the lower bench;
    (C) The excess spoil is placed only on solid portions of the lower 
pre-existing bench;
    (D) All excess spoil on the lower solid bench, including that spoil 
immediately below the gravity transport points, is rehandled and placed 
in a controlled manner to eliminate as much of the lower highwall as 
practicable. Rehandling and placing the excess spoil on the lower solid 
bench shall consist of placing the excess spoil in horizontal lifts in a 
controlled manner, concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass 
stability and prevent mass movement, and graded to allow surface and 
subsurface drainage to be compatible with the natural surroundings to 
ensure a long term static safety factor of 1.3. Spoil on the bench prior 
to the current mining operation need not be rehandled except to ensure 
stability of the fill.
    (E) A safety berm is constructed on the solid portion of the lower 
bench prior to gravity transport of the excess spoil. Where there is 
insufficient material on the lower bench to construct a safety berm, 
only that amount of spoil necessary for the construction of the berm may 
be gravity transported to the lower bench prior to construction of the 
berm. The safety berm must be removed by the operator by final grading 
operations;
    (F) The area of the lower bench used to facilitate the disposal of 
excess spoil is considered a disturbed area.
    (b) Valley fills. Valley fills shall meet all of the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section and the additional requirements of this 
section.
    (1) The fill shall be designed to attain a long-term static safety 
factor of 1.5 based upon data obtained from subsurface exploration, 
geotechnical testing, foundation design, and accepted engineering 
analyses.
    (2) A subdrainage system for the fill shall be constructed in 
accordance with the following:
    (i) A system of underdrains constructed of durable rock shall meet 
the requirements of paragraph (2)(iv) of this section and:
    (A) Be installated along the natural drainage system;
    (B) Extend from the toe to the head of the fill; and
    (C) Contain lateral drains to each area of potential drainage or 
seepage.
    (ii) A filter system to insure the proper functioning of the rock 
underdrain system shall be designed and constructed using standard 
geotechnical engineering methods.
    (iii) In constructing the underdrains, no more than 10 percent of 
the rock may be less than 12 inches in size and no single rock may be 
larger than 25 percent of the width of the drain. Rock used in 
underdrains shall meet the requirements of paragraph (2)(iv) of this 
section. The minimum size of the main underdrain shall be:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         Minimum size of
                                   Predominant type of   drain, in feet

 Do..............................  Shale..............       16       16
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iv) Underdrains shall consist of nondegradable, non-acid or toxic 
forming rock such as natural sand and gravel, sandstone, limestone, or 
other durable rock that will not slake in water and will be free of 
coal, clay or shale.
    (3) Spoil shall be hauled or conveyed and placed in a controlled 
manner and concurrently compacted as specified by the regulatory 
authority, in lifts no greater than 4 feet or less if required by the 
regulatory authority to--
    (i) Achieve the densities designed to ensure mass stability;
    (ii) Prevent mass movement;
    (iii) Avoid contamination of the rock underdrain or rock core; and
    (iv) Prevent formation of voids.
    (4) Surface water runoff from the area above the fill shall be 
diverted away from the fill and into stabilized diversion channels 
designed to pass safely the runoff from a 100-year, 24-hour 
precipitation event or larger

[[Page 68]]

event specified by the regulatory authority. Surface runoff from the 
fill surface shall be diverted to stabilized channels off the fill which 
will safely pass the runoff from a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation 
event. Diversion design shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 
715.17(c).
    (5) The tops of the fill and any terrace constructed to stabilize 
the face shall be graded no steeper than 1v:20h (5 percent). The 
vertical distance between terraces shall not exceed 50 feet.
    (6) Drainage shall not be directed over the outslope of the fill.
    (7) The outslope of the fill shall not exceed 1v:2h (50 percent). 
The regulatory authority may require a flatter slope.
    (c) Head-of-hollow fills. Disposal of spoil in the head-of-hollow 
fill shall meet all standards set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) and 
the additional requirements of this section.
    (1) The fill shall be designed to completely fill the disposal site 
to the approximate elevation of the ridgeline. A rock-core chimney drain 
may be utilized instead of the subdrain and surface diversion system 
required for valley fills. If the crest of the fill is not approximately 
at the same elevation as the low point of the adjacent ridgeline, the 
fill must be designed as specified in paragraph (b), with diversion of 
runoff around the fill. A fill associated with contour mining and placed 
at or near the coal seam, and which does not exceed 250,000 cubic yards 
may use the rock-core chimney drain.
    (2) The alternative rock-core chimney drain system shall be designed 
and incorporated into the construction of head-of-hollow fills as 
follows:
    (i) The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main 
buried stream channel or rill a vertical core of durable rock at least 
16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of 
the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill. A 
system of lateral rock underdrains shall connect this rock core to each 
area of potential drainage or seepage in the disposal area. Rocks used 
in the rock core and underdrains shall meet the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv).
    (ii) A filter system to ensure the proper functioning of the rock 
core shall be designed and constructed using standard geotechnical 
engineering methods.
    (iii) The grading may drain surface water away from the outslope of 
the fill and toward the rock core. The maximum slope of the top of the 
fill shall be 1v:33h (3 percent). Instead of the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(7) of this section, a drainage pocket may be maintained at 
the head of the fill during and after construction, to intercept surface 
runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the rock drain, if 
stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall this pocket or 
sump have a potential for impounding more than 10,000 cubic feet of 
water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a 3- to 5-percent grade 
toward the fill and a 1-percent slope toward the rock core.
    (3) The drainage control system shall be capable of passing safely 
the runoff from a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation event, or larger event 
specified by the regulatory authority.
    (d) Durable rock fills. In lieu of the requirements of paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section the regulatory authority may approve 
alternate methods for disposal of hard rock spoil, including fill 
placement by dumping in a single lift, on a site specific basis, 
provided the services of a registered professional engineer experienced 
in the design and construction of earth and rockfill embankments are 
utilized and provided the requirements of this paragraph and paragraph 
(a) are met. For this section, hard rock spoil shall be defined as 
rockfill consisting of at least 80 percent by volume of sandstone, 
limestone, or other rocks that do not slake in water. Resistance of the 
hard rock spoil to slaking shall be determined by using the slake index 
and slake durability tests in accordance with guidelines and criteria 
established by the regulatory authority.
    (1) Spoil is to be transported and placed in a specified and 
controlled manner which will ensure stability of the fill.
    (i) The method of spoil placement shall be designed to ensure mass 
stability and prevent mass movement in

[[Page 69]]

accordance with the additional requirements of this section.
    (ii) Loads of noncemented clay shale and/or clay spoil in the fill 
shall be mixed with hard rock spoil in a controlled manner to limit on a 
unit basis concentrations of noncemented clay shale and clay in the 
fill. Such materials shall comprise no more than 20 percent of the fill 
volume as determined by tests performed by a registered engineer and 
approved by the regulatory authority.
    (2)(i) Stability analyses shall be made by the registered 
professional engineer. Parameters used in the stability analyses shall 
be based on adequate field reconnaissance, subsurface investigations, 
including borings, and laboratory tests.
    (ii) The embankment which constitutes the valley fill or head-of-
hollow fill shall be designed with the following factors of safety:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Minimum
                Case                     Design condition      factor of
                                                                safety
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I...................................  End of construction...         1.5
II..................................  Earthquake............         1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The design of a head-of-hollow fill shall include an internal 
drainage system which will ensure continued free drainage of anticipated 
seepage from precipitation and from springs or wet weather seeps.
    (i) Anticipated discharge from springs and seeps and due to 
precipitation shall be based on records and/or field investigations to 
determine seasonal variation. The design of the internal drainage system 
shall be based on the maximum anticipated discharge.
    (ii) All granular material used for the drainage system shall be 
free of clay and consist of durable particles such as natural sands and 
gravels, sandstone, limestone or other durable rock which will not slake 
in water.
    (iii) The internal drain shall be protected by a properly designed 
filter system.
    (4) Surface water runoff from the areas adjacent to and above the 
fill shall not be allowed to flow onto the fill and shall be diverted 
into stabilized channels which are designed to pass safely the runoff 
from a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation event. Diversion design shall 
comply with the requirements of Sec. 715.17(c).
    (5) The top surface of the completed fill shall be graded such that 
the final slope after settlement will be no steeper than 1v:20h (5 
percent) toward properly designed drainage channels in natural ground 
along the periphery of the fill. Surface runoff from the top surface of 
the fill shall not be allowed to flow over the outslope of the fill.
    (6) Surface runoff from the outslope of the fill shall be diverted 
off the fill to properly designed channels which will pass safely a 100-
year, 24-hour precipitation event. Diversion design shall comply with 
the requirements of Sec. 715.17(c).
    (7) Terraces shall be constructed on the outslope if required for 
control of erosion or for roads included in the approved postmining land 
use plan. Terraces shall meet the following requirements:
    (i) The slope of the outslope between terrace benches shall not 
exceed 1v:2h (50 percent.).
    (ii) To control surface runoff, each terrace bench shall be graded 
to a slope of 1v:20h (5 percent) toward the embankment. Runoff shall be 
collected by a ditch along the intersection of each terrace bench and 
the outslope.
    (iii) Terrace ditches shall have a 5-percent slope toward the 
channels specified in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, unless steeper 
slopes are necessary in conjunction with approved roads.
    (e) Preexisting benches. (1) The regulatory authority may approve 
the disposal of excess spoil through placement on preexisting benches: 
Provided, That the standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)-(a)(5) and 
(a)(7)-(a)(14) of this section and the requirements of this paragraph 
(e) are met.
    (2) All spoil shall be placed on the solid portion of the 
preexisting bench.
    (3) The fill shall be designed, using standard geotechnical 
analysis, to attain a long-term static safety factor of 1.3 for all 
portions of the fill.
    (4) The preexisting bench shall be backfilled and graded to--
    (i) Achieve the most moderate slope possible which does not exceed 
the angle of repose, and

[[Page 70]]

    (ii) Eliminate the highwall to the extent practicable.

Sec. 715.16  Topsoil handling.

    To prevent topsoil from being contaminated by spoil or waste 
materials, the permittee shall remove the topsoil as a separate 
operation from areas to be disturbed. Topsoil shall be immediately 
redistributed according to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section on areas graded to the approved postmining configuration. The 
topsoil shall be segregated, stockpiled, and protected from wind and 
water erosion and from contaminants which lessen its capability to 
support vegetation if sufficient graded areas are not immediately 
available for redistribution.
    (a) Topsoil removal. All topsoil to be salvaged shall be removed 
before any drilling for blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance.
    (1) All topsoil shall be removed unless use of alternative materials 
is approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section. Where the removal of topsoil results in erosion 
that may cause air or water pollution, the regulatory authority shall 
limit the size of the area from which topsoil may be removed at any one 
time and specify methods of treatment to control erosion of exposed 
overburden.
    (2) All of the A horizon of the topsoil as identified by soil 
surveys shall be removed according to paragraph (a) and then replaced on 
disturbed areas as the surface soil layers. Where the A horizon is less 
than 6 inches, a 6-inch layer that includes the A horizon and the 
unconsolidated material immediately below the A horizon (or all 
unconsolidated material if the total available is less than 6 inches) 
shall be removed and the mixture segregated and replaced as the surface 
soil layer.
    (3) Where necessary to obtain soil productivity consistent with 
postmining land use, the regulatory authority may require that the B 
horizon or portions of the C horizon or other underlying layers 
demonstrated to have comparable quality for root development be 
segregated and replaced as subsoil.
    (4) Selected overburden materials may be used instead of, or as a 
supplement to, topsoil where the resulting soil medium is equal to or 
more suitable for vegetation, and if all the following requirements are 
met:
    (i) The permittee demonstrates that the selected overburden 
materials or an overburden-topsoil mixture is more suitable for 
restoring land capability and productivity by the results of chemical 
and physical analyses. These analyses shall include determinations of 
pH, percent organic material, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, texture 
class, and water-holding capacity, and such other analyses as required 
by the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority also may require 
that results of field-site trials or greenhouse tests be used to 
demonstrate the feasibility of using such overburden materials.
    (ii) The chemical and physical analyses and the results of field-
site trials and greenhouse tests are accompanied by a certification from 
a qualified soil scientist or agronomist.
    (iii) The alternative material is removed, segregated, and replaced 
in conformance with this section.
    (b) Topsoil redistribution. (1) After final grading and before the 
topsoil is replaced, regraded land shall be scarified or otherwise 
treated to eliminate slippage surfaces and to promote root penetration.
    (2) Topsoil shall be redistributed in a manner that--
    (i) Achieves an approximate uniform thickness consistent with the 
postmining land uses;
    (ii) Prevents excess compaction of the spoil and topsoil; and
    (iii) Protects the topsoil from wind and water erosion before it is 
seeded and planted.
    (c) Topsoil storage. If the permit allows storage of topsoil, the 
stockpiled topsoil shall be placed on a stable area within the permit 
area where it will not be disturbed or be exposed to excessive water, 
wind erosion, or contaminants which lessen its capability to support 
vegetation before it can be redistributed on terrain graded to final 
contour. Stockpiles shall be selectively placed and protected from wind 
and

[[Page 71]]

water erosion, unnecessary compaction, and contamination by undesirable 
materials either by a vegetative cover as defined in Sec. 715.20(g) or 
by other methods demonstrated to provide equal protection such as snow 
fences, chemical binders, and mulching. Unless approved by the 
regulatory authority, stockpiled topsoil shall not be moved until 
required for redistribution on a disturbed area.
    (d) Nutrients and soil amendments. Nutrients and soil amendments in 
the amounts and analyses as determined by soil tests shall be applied to 
the surface soil layer so that it will support the postmining 
requirements of Sec. 715.13 and the revegetation requirements of Sec. 
715.20.


<R05>
Sec. 715.17  Protection of the hydrologic system.

    The permittee shall plan and conduct coal mining and reclamation 
operations to minimize disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance 
in order to prevent long-term adverse changes in the hydrologic balance 
that could result from surface coal mining and reclamation operations, 
both on- and off-site. Changes in water quality and quantity, in the 
depth to ground water, and in the location of surface water drainage 
channels shall be minimized such that the postmining land use of the 
disturbed land is not adversely affected and applicable Federal and 
State statutes and regulations are not violated. The permittee shall 
conduct operations so as to minimize water pollution and shall, where 
necessary, use treatment methods to control water pollution. The 
permittee shall emphasize surface coal mining and reclamation practices 
that will prevent or minimize water pollution and changes in flows in 
preference to the use of water treatment facilities. Practices to 
control and minimize pollution include, but are not limited to, 
stabilizing disturbed areas through grading, diverting runoff, achieving 
quick growing stands of temporary vegetation, lining drainage channels 
with rock or vegetation, mulching, sealing acid-forming and toxic-
forming materials, and selectively placing waste materials in backfill 
areas. If pollution can be controlled only by treatment, the permittee 
shall operate and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities for 
as long as treatment is required.
    (a) Water quality standards and effluent limitations. All surface 
drainage from the disturbed area, including disturbed areas that have 
been graded, seeded, or planted, shall be passed through a sedimentation 
pond or a series of sedimentation ponds before leaving the permit area. 
Sedimentation ponds shall be retained until drainage from the disturbed 
areas has met the water quality requirements of this section and the 
revegetation requirements of Sec. 715.20 have been met. The regulatory 
authority may grant exemptions from this requirement only when the 
disturbed drainage area within the total disturbed area is small and if 
the permittee shows that sedimentation ponds are necessary to meet the 
effluent limitations of this paragraph and to maintain water quality in 
downstream receiving waters. For purpose of this section only, disturbed 
area shall not include those areas in which only diversion ditches, 
sedimentation ponds, or roads are installed in accordance with this 
section and the upstream area is not otherwise disturbed by the 
permittee. Sedimentation ponds required by this paragraph shall be 
constructed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section in 
appropriate locations prior to any mining in the affected drainage area 
in order to control sedimentation or otherwise treat water in accordance 
with this paragraph. Discharges from areas disturbed by surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations must meet all applicable Federal and 
State laws and regulations and, at a minimum, the following numerical 
effluent limitations:

   Effluent Limitations, in Milligrams Per Liter, mg/l, Except For pH
------------------------------------------------------------------------

\1\ Based on representative sampling.

[[Page 72]]

 
\2\ In Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South
  Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, total suspended solids limitations will be
  determined on a case-by-case basis, but they must not be greater than
  45 mg/l (maximum allowable) and 30 mg/l (average of daily value for 30
  consecutive discharge days) based on a representative sampling.
\3\ Where the application of neutralization and sedimentation treatment
  technology results in inability to comply with the manganese
  limitation set forth, the regulatory authority may allow the pH level
  in the discharge to exceed to a small extent the upper limit of 9.0 in
  order that the manganese limitations will be achieved.
\4\ Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.

    (1) Any overflow or other discharge of surface water from the 
disturbed area within the permit area demonstrated by the permittee to 
result from a precipitation event larger than a 10-year, 24-hours 
frequency event will not be subject to the effluent limitations of 
paragraph (a).
    (2) The permittee shall install, operate, and maintain adequate 
facilities to treat any water discharged from the disturbed area that 
violates applicable federal or State laws or regulations or the 
limitations of paragraph (a). If the pH of waters to be discharged from 
the disturbed area is normally less than 6.0, an automatic line feeder 
or other neutralization process approved by the regulatory authority 
shall be installed operated, and maintained. If, the regulatory 
authority finds (i) that small and infrequent treatment requirements to 
meet applicable standards do not necessitate use of an automatic 
neutralization process, and (ii) that the mine normally produces less 
than 500 tons of coal per day, then the regulatory authority may approve 
the use of a manual system if the permittee ensures consistent and 
timely treatment.
    (3) The effluent limitations for manganese shall be applicable only 
to acid drainage.
    (b) Surface-water monitoring. (1) The permittee shall submit for 
approval by the regulatory authority a surface-water monitoring program 
which meets the following requirements:
    (i) Provides adequate monitoring of all discharge from the disturbed 
area.
    (ii) Provides adequate data to describe the likely daily and 
seasonal variation in discharges from the disturbed area in terms of 
water flow, pH, total iron, total managanese, and total suspended solids 
and, if requested by the regulatory authority, any other parameter 
characteristic of the discharge.
    (iii) Provides monitoring at appropriate frequencies to measure 
normal and abnormal variations in concentrations.
    (iv) Provides an analytical quality control system including 
standard methods of analysis such as those specified in 40 CFR 136.
    (v) Within sixty (60) days of the end of each sixty (60) day sample 
collection period, a report of all samples shall be made to the 
regulatory authority, unless the discharge for which water monitoring 
reports are required is subject to regulation by a National Pollution 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued in compliance with 
the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. 1251-1378), (A) which includes 
equivalent reporting requirements, and (B) which requires filing of the 
water monitoring report within 90 days or less of sample collection. For 
such discharges, the reporting requirements of this paragraph may be 
satisfied by submitting to the regulatory authority on the same time 
schedule as required by the NPDES permit or within ninety (90) days 
following sample collection, whichever is earlier, either (1) a copy of 
the completed reporting form filed to meet the NPDES permit 
requirements, or (2) a letter identifying the State or Federal 
government official with whom the reporting form was filed to meet the 
NPDES permit requirements and the date of filing. In all cases in which 
analytical results of the sample collections indicate a violation of a 
permit condition or applicable standard has occurred, the operator shall 
notify the regulatory authority immediately. Where an NPDES permit 
effluent limitation requirement has been violated, the permittee should 
forward a copy of the Discharge Monitoring Report, EPA Form 3320-1, 
concurrently with notification of the violation.
    (2) After disturbed areas have been regraded and stabilized in 
accordance with this part, the permittee shall monitor surface water 
flow and quality. Data from this monitoring shall be used to demonstrate 
that the quality and quantity of runoff without treatment will be 
consistent with the requirement of this section to minimize

[[Page 73]]

disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance and with the 
requirements of this part to attain the approved postmining land use. 
These data shall provide a basis for approval by the regulatory 
authority for removal of water quality or flow control systems and for 
determining when the requirements of this section are met. The 
regulatory authority shall determine the nature of data, frequency of 
collection, and reporting requirements.
    (3) Equipment, structures, and other measures necessary to 
accurately measure and sample the quality and quantity of surface water 
discharges from the disturbed area of the permit area shall be properly 
installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed when no longer 
required.
    (c) Diversion and conveyance of overland flow away from disturbed 
areas. In order to minimize erosion and to prevent or remove water from 
contacting toxic-producing deposits, overland flow from undisturbed 
areas may, if required or approved by the regulatory authority, be 
diverted away from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent 
diversion structures. The following requirements shall be met:
    (1) Temporary diversion structures shall be constructed to safely 
pass the peak runoff from a precipitation event with a one year 
recurrence interval, or a larger event as specified by the regulatory 
authority. The design criteria must assure adequate protection of the 
environment and public during the existence of the temporary diversion 
structure.
    (2) Permanent diversion structures are those remaining after mining 
and reclamation and approved for retention by the regulatory authority 
and other appropriate State and Federal agencies. To protect fills and 
property and to avoid danger to public health and safety, permanent 
diversion structures shall be constructed to safely pass the peak runoff 
from a precipitation event with a 100-year recurrence interval, or a 
larger event as specified by the regulatory authority. Permanent 
diversion structures shall be constructed with gently sloping banks that 
are stabilized by vegetation. Asphalt, concrete, or other similar 
linings shall not be used unless specifically required to prevent 
seepage or to provide stability and are approved by the regulatory 
authority.
    (3) Diversions shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in a 
manner to prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to 
streamflow or to runoff outside the permit area to the extent possible, 
using the best technology currently available. In no event shall such 
contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable State or 
Federal law. Appropriate sediment control measures for these diversions 
shall include, but not be limited to, maintenances of appropriate 
gradients, channel lining, revegetation, roughness structures, and 
detention basins.
    (d) Stream channel diversions. (1) Flow from perennial and 
intermittent streams within the permit area may be diverted only when 
the diversions are approved by the regulatory authority and they are in 
compliance with local, State, and Federal statutes and regulations. When 
streamflow is allowed to be diverted, the new stream channel shall be 
designed and constructed to meet the following requirements:
    (i) The average stream gradient shall be maintained and the channel 
designed, constructed, and maintained to remain stable and to prevent 
additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff 
outside the permit area to the extent possible, using the best 
technology currently available. In no event shall such contributions be 
in excess of requirements set by applicable State or Federal law. 
Erosion control structures such as channel lining structures, retention 
basins, and artificial channel roughness structures shall be used only 
when approved by the regulatory agency for temporary diversions where 
necessary or for permanent diversions where they are stable and will 
require only infrequent maintenance.
    (ii) Channel, bank, and flood-plain configurations shall be adequate 
to safely pass the peak runoff of a precipitation event with a 10-year 
recurrence interval for temporary diversions and a 100-year recurrence 
interval for permanent diversions, or larger events as specified by the 
regulatory authority.
    (iii) Fish and wildlife habitat and water and vegetation of 
significant

[[Page 74]]

value for wildlife shall be protected in consultation with appropriate 
State and Federal fish and wildlife management agencies.
    (2) All temporary diversion structures shall be removed and the 
affected land regraded and revegetated consistent with the requirements 
of Sec. Sec. 715.14 and 715.20. At the time such diversions are 
removed, the permittee shall ensure that downstream water treatment 
facilities previously protected by the diversion are modified or removed 
to prevent overtopping or failure of the facilities.
    (3) Buffer zone. No land within 100 feet of an intermittent or 
perennial stream shall be disturbed by surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations unless the regulatory authority specifically 
authorizes surface coal mining and reclamation operations through such a 
stream. The area not to be disturbed shall be designated a buffer zone 
and marked as specified in Sec. 715.12.
    (e) Sedimentation ponds--(1) General requirements. Sedimentation 
ponds shall be used individually or in series and shall--
    (i) Be constructed before any disturbance of the undisturbed area to 
be drained into the pond;
    (ii) Be located as near as possible to the disturbed area and out of 
perennial streams; unless approved by the regulatory authority;
    (iii) Meet all the criteria of this section.
    (2) Sediment storage volume. Sedimentation ponds shall provide a 
minimum sediment storage volume.
    (3) Detention time. Sedimentation ponds shall provide the required 
theoretical detention time for the water inflow or runoff entering the 
pond from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event (design event).
    (4) Dewatering. The water storage resulting from inflow shall be 
removed by a nonclogging dewatering device or a conduit spillway 
approved by the regulatory authority. The dewatering device shall not be 
located at a lower elevation than the maximum elevation of the 
sedimentation storage volume.
    (5) Each person who conducts surface mining activities shall design, 
construct, and maintain sedimentation ponds to prevent short-circuiting 
to the extent possible.
    (6) The design, construction, and maintenance of a sedimentation 
pond or other sediment control measures in accordance with this section 
shall not relieve the person from compliance with applicable effluent 
limitations as contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (7) There shall be no out-flow through the emergency spillway during 
the passage of the runoff resulting from the 10-year, 24-hour 
precipitation event or lesser events through the sedimentation pond.
    (8) Sediment shall be removed from sedimentation ponds.
    (9) An appropriate combination of principal and emergency spillways 
shall be provided to safely discharge the runoff from a 25-year, 24-hour 
precipitation event, or larger event specified by the regulatory 
authority. The elevation of the crest of the emergency spillway shall be 
a minimum of 1.0 foot above the crest of the principal spillway. 
Emergency spillway grades and allowable velocities shall be approved by 
the regulatory authority.
    (10) The minimum elevation at the top of the settled embankment 
shall be 1.0 foot above the water surface in the pond with the emergency 
spillway flowing at design depth. For embankments subject to settlement, 
this 1.0 foot minimum elevation requirement shall apply at all times, 
including the period after settlement.
    (11) The constructed height of the dam shall be increased a minimum 
of 5 percent over the design height to allow for settlement, unless it 
has been demonstrated to the regulatory authority that the material used 
and the design will ensure against all settlement.
    (12) The minimum top width of the embankment shall not be less than 
the quotient of (H+35)/5, where H is the height, in feet, of the 
embankment as measured from the upstream toe of the embankment.
    (13) The combined upstream and downstream side slopes of the settled 
embankment shall not be less than 1v:5h, with neither slope steeper than 
1v:2h. Slopes shall be designed to be stable in all cases, even if 
flatter side slopes are required.

[[Page 75]]

    (14) The embankment foundation areas shall be cleared of all organic 
matter, all surfaces sloped to no steeper than 1v:1h, and the entire 
foundation surface scarified.
    (15) The fill material shall be free of sod, large roots, other 
large vegetative matter, and frozen soil, and in on case shall coal-
processing waste be used.
    (16) The placing and spreading of fill material shall be started at 
the lowest point of the foundation. The fill shall be brought up in 
horizontal layers of such thickness as is required to facilitate 
compaction and meet the design requirements of this section. Compaction 
shall be conducted as specified in the design approved by the regulatory 
authority.
    (17) If a sedimentation pond has an embankment that is more than 20 
feet in height, as measured from the upstream toe of the embankment to 
the crest of the emergency spillway, or has a storage volume of 20 acre-
feet or more, the following additional requirements shall be met:
    (i) An appropriate combination of principal and emergency spillways 
shall be provided to discharge safely the runoff resulting from a 100-
year, 24-hour precipitation event, or a larger event specified by the 
regulatory authority.
    (ii) The embankment shall be designed and constructed with a static 
safety factor of at least 1.5, or a higher safety factor as designated 
by the regulatory authority to ensure stability.
    (iii) Appropriate barriers shall be provided to control seepage 
along conduits that extend through the embankment.
    (iv) The criteria of the Mine Safety and Health Administration as 
published in 30 CFR 77.216 shall be met.
    (18) Each pond shall be designed and inspected during construction 
under the supervision of, and certified after construction by, a 
registered professional engineer.
    (19) The entire embankment including the surrounding areas disturbed 
by construction shall be stabilized with respect to erosion by a 
vegetative cover or other means immediately after the embankment is 
completed. The active upstream face of the embankment where water will 
be impounded may be riprapped or otherwise stabilized. Areas in which 
the vegetation is not successful or where rills and gullies develop 
shall be repaired and revegetated in accordance with Sec. 715.20.
    (20) All ponds, including those not meeting the size or other 
criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a), shall be examined for structural weakness, 
erosion, and other hazardous conditions, and reports and modifications 
shall be made to the regulatory authority, in accordance with 30 CFR 
77.216-3. With the approval of the regulatory authority, dams not 
meeting these criteria (30 CFR 77.216(a)) shall be examined four times 
per year.
    (21) Sedimentation ponds shall not be removed until the disturbed 
area has been restored, and the vegetation requirements of Sec. 715.20 
are met and the drainage entering the pond has met the applicable State 
and Federal water quality requirements for the receiving stream. When 
the sedimentation pond is removed, the affected land shall be regraded 
and revegetated in accordance with Sec. Sec. 715.14, 715.16, and 
715.20, unless the pond has been approved by the regulatory authority 
for retention as being compatible with the approved postmining land use. 
If the regulatory authority approves retention, the sedimentation pond 
shall meet all the requirements for permanent impoundments of paragraph 
(k) of this section.
    (22)(i) Where surface mining activities are proposed to be conducted 
on steep slopes, as defined in Sec. 716.2 of this chapter, special 
sediment control measures may be followed if the person has demonstrated 
to the regulatory authority that a sedimentation pond (or series of 
ponds) constructed according to paragraph (e) of this section--
    (A) Will jeopardize public health and safety; or
    (B) Will result in contributions of suspended solids to streamflow 
in excess of the incremental sediment volume trapped by the additional 
pond size required.
    (ii) Special sediment control measures shall include but not be 
limited to--
    (A) Designing, constructing, and maintaining a sedimentation pond as 
near as physically possible to the disturbed area which complies with 
the

[[Page 76]]

design criteria of this section to the maximum extent possible.
    (B) A plan and commitment to employ sufficient onsite sedimentation 
control measures including bench sediment storage, filtration by natural 
vegetation, mulching, and prompt revegetation which, in conjunction with 
the required sediment pond, will achieve and maintain applicable 
effluent limitations. The plan submitted pursuant to this paragraph 
shall include a detailed description of all onsite control measures to 
be employed, a quantitative analysis demonstrating that onsite 
sedimentation control measures, in conjunction with the required 
sedimentation pond, will achieve and maintain applicable effluent 
limitations, and maps depicting the location of all onsite sedimentation 
control measures.
    (f) Discharge structures. Discharges from sedimentation ponds and 
diversions shall be controlled, where necessary, using energy 
dissipators, surge ponds, and other devices to reduce erosion and 
prevent deepening or enlargement of stream channels and to minimize 
disturbances to the hydrologic balance.
    (g) Acid and toxic materials. Drainage from acid-forming and toxic-
forming mine waste materials and soils into ground and surface water 
shall be avoided by--
    (1) Identifying, burying, and treating where necessary, spoil or 
other materials that, in the judgment of the regulatory authority, will 
be toxic to vegetation or that will adversely affect water quality if 
not treated or buried. Such material shall be disposed of in accordance 
with the provision of Sec. 715.14(j);
    (2) Preventing or removing water from contact with toxic-producing 
deposits;
    (3) Burying or otherwise treating all toxic or harmful materials 
within 30 days, if such materials are subject to wind and water erosion, 
or within a lesser period designated by the regulatory authority. If 
storage of such materials is approved, the materials shall be placed on 
impermeable material and protected from erosion and contact with surface 
water. Coal waste ponds and other coal waste materials shall be 
maintained according to paragraph (g)(4) of this section, and Sec. 
715.18 shall apply;
    (4) Burying or otherwise treating waste materials from coal 
preparation plants no later than 90 days after the cessation of the 
filling of the disposal area. Burial or treatment shall be in accordance 
with Sec. 715.14(j);
    (5) Casing, sealing or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, wells, 
and auger holes or other more or less horizontal holes to prevent 
pollution of surface or ground water and to prevent mixing of ground 
waters of significantly different quality. All boreholes that are within 
the permit area but are outside the surface coal mining area or which 
extend beneath the coal to be mined and into water bearing strata shall 
be plugged permanently in a manner approved by the regulatory authority, 
unless the boreholes have been approved for use in monitoring;
    (6) Taking such other actions as required by the regulatory 
authority.
    (h) Ground water--(1) Recharge capacity of reclaimed lands. The 
disturbed area shall be reclaimed to restore approximate premining 
recharge capacity through restoration of the capability of the reclaimed 
areas as a whole to transmit water to the ground water system. The 
recharge capacity should be restored to support the approved postmining 
land use and to minimize disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic 
balance at the mined area and in associated offsite areas. The permittee 
shall be responsible for monitoring according to paragraph (h)(3) of 
this section to ensure operations conform to this requirement.
    (2) Ground water systems. Backfilled materials shall be placed to 
minimize adverse effects on ground water flow and quality, to minimize 
offsite effects, and to support the approved postmining land use. The 
permittee shall be responsible for performing monitoring according to 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section to ensure operations conform to this 
requirement.
    (3) Monitoring. Ground water levels, infiltration rates, subsurface 
flow and storage characteristics, and the quality of ground water shall 
be monitored in a

[[Page 77]]

manner approved by the regulatory authority to determine the effects of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on the recharge capacity 
of reclaimed lands and on the quantity and quality of water in ground 
water systems at the mine area and in associated offsite areas. When 
operations are conducted in such a manner that may affect the ground 
water system, ground water levels and ground water quality shall be 
periodically monitored using wells that can adequately reflect changes 
in ground water quantity and quality resulting from such operations. 
Sufficient water wells must be used by the permittee. The regulatory 
authority may require drilling and development of additional wells if 
needed to adequately monitor the ground water system. As specified and 
approved by the regulatory authority, additional hydrologic tests, such 
as infiltration tests and aquifer tests, must be undertaken by the 
permittee to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (h) (1) and (2) of 
this section.
    (i) Water rights and replacement. The permittee shall replace the 
water supply of an owner of interest in real property who obtains all or 
part of his supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or 
other legitimate use from an underground or surface source where such 
supply has been affected by contamination, diminution, or interruption 
proximately resulting from surface coal mine operation by the permittee.
    (j) Alluvial valley floors west of the 100th meridian west 
longitude. (1) Surface coal mining operations conducted in or adjacent 
to alluvial valley floors shall be planned and conducted so as to 
preserve the essential hydrologic functions of these alluvial valley 
floors throughout the mining and reclamation process. These functions 
shall be preserved by maintaining or reestablishing those hydrologic and 
biologic characteristics of the alluvial valley floor that are necessary 
to support the functions. The permittee shall provide information to the 
regulatory authority as required in paragraph (j)(3) of this section to 
allow identification of essential hydrologic functions and demonstrate 
that the functions will be preserved. The characteristics of an alluvial 
valley floor to be considered include, but are not limited to--
    (i) The longitudinal profile (gradient), cross-sectional shape, and 
other channel characteristics of streams that have formed within the 
alluvial valley floor and that provide for maintenance of the prevailing 
conditions of surface flow;
    (ii) Aquifers (including capillary zones and perched water zones) 
and confining beds within the mined area which provide for storage, 
transmission, and regulation of natural ground water and surface water 
that supply the alluvial valley floors;
    (iii) Quantity and quality of surface and ground water that supply 
alluvial valley floors;
    (iv) Depth to and seasonal fluctuations of ground water beneath 
alluvial valley floors;
    (v) Configuration and stability of the land surface in the flood 
plain and adjacent low terraces in alluvial valley floors as they allow 
or facilitate irrigation with flood waters or subirrigation and maintain 
erosional equilibrium; and
    (vi) Moisture-holding capacity of soils (or plant growth medium) 
within the alluvial valley floors, and physical and chemical 
characteristics of the subsoil which provide for sustained vegetation 
growth or cover through dry months.
    (2) Surface coal mining operations located west of the 100th 
meridian west longitude shall not interrupt, discontinue, or preclude 
farming on alluvial valley floors and shall not materially damage the 
quantity or quality of surface or ground water that supplies these 
valley floors unless the premining land use has been undeveloped 
rangeland which is not significant to farming on the alluvial valley 
floors or unless the area of affected alluvial valley floor is small and 
provides negligible support for the production from one or more farms. 
This paragraph (j)(2) does not apply to those surface coal mining 
operations that--
    (i) Were in production in the year preceding August 3, 1977, were 
located in or adjacent to an alluvial valley floor, and produced coal in 
commercial quantities during the year preceding August 3, 1977; or

[[Page 78]]

    (ii) Had specific permit approval by the State regulatory authority 
before August 3, 1977, to conduct surface coal mining operations for an 
area within an alluvial valley floor.
    (3)(i) Before surface mining and reclamation operations authorized 
under paragraph (j)(2) of this section may be issued a new revised or 
amended permit, the permittee shall submit, for regulatory authority 
approval, detailed surveys and baseline data to establish standards 
against which the requirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this section may 
be measured and from which the degree of material damage to the quantity 
and quality of surface and ground water that supply the alluvial valley 
floors may be assessed. The surveys and date shall include--
    (A) A map at a scale determined by the regulatory authority, showing 
the location and configuration of the alluvial valley floor;
    (B) Baseline data covering a full water year for each of the 
hydrologic functions identified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section;
    (C) Plans showing how the operation will avoid, during mining and 
reclamation, interruption, discontinuance, or preclusion of farming on 
the alluvial valley floors and will not materially damage the quantity 
or quality of water in surface and ground water systems that supply such 
valley floors;
    (D) Historic land use data for the proposed permit area and for 
farms to be affected; and
    (E) Such other data as the regulatory authority may require.
    (ii) Surface mining operations which qualify for the exceptions in 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section are not required to submit the plans 
prescribed in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (4) The holder of a Federal coal lease or the fee holder of any coal 
deposit located within or adjacent to an alluvial valley floor west of 
the 100th meridian west from which coal was not produced in commercial 
quantities between August 3, 1976, and August 3, 1977, and for which no 
specific permit by the appropriate State or Federal regulatory authority 
to conduct surface coal mining operations in the alluvial valley floors 
has been obtained, may be entitled to an exchange of the Federal coal 
lease for a lease of other Federal coal deposits under section 510(b)(5) 
of the Act, or to the conveyance by the Secretary of fee title to other 
available Federal coal deposits in exchange for the fee title to such 
deposits under section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
of 1976 (90 Stat. 2743), if the Secretary determines that substantial 
financial and legal commitments were made by the operator prior to 
January 1, 1977, in connection with surface coal mining operations on 
such lands.
    (k) Permanent impoundments. The permittee may construct, if 
authorized by the regulatory agency pursuant to this paragraph and Sec. 
715.13, permanent water impoundments on mining sites as a part of 
reclamation activities only when they are adequately demonstrated to be 
incompliance with Sec. Sec. 715.13 and 715.14 in addition to the 
following requirements:
    (1) The size of the impoundment is adequate for its intended 
purposes.
    (2) The impoundment dam construction is designed to achieve 
necessary stability with an adequate margin of safety compatible with 
that of structures constructed under Pub. L. 83-566 (16 U.S.C. 1006).
    (3) The quality of the impounded water will be suitable on a 
permanent basis for its intended use and discharges from the impoundment 
will not degrade the quality of receiving waters below the water quality 
standards established pursuant to applicable Federal and State law.
    (4) The level of water will be reasonably stable.
    (5) Final grading will comply with the provisions of Sec. 715.14 
and will provide adequate safety and access for proposed water users.
    (6) Water impoundments will not result in the diminution of the 
quality or quantity of water used by adjacent or surrounding landowners 
for agricultural, industrial, recreational, or domestic uses.
    (l) Hydrologic impact of roads. (1) General. Access and haul roads 
and associated bridges, culverts, ditches, and road rights-of-way shall 
be constructed, maintained, and reclaimed to prevent additional 
contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff outside 
the permit area to the

[[Page 79]]

extent possible, using the best technology currently available. In no 
event shall the contributions be in excess of requirements set by 
applicable State or Federal law. All access and haul roads shall be 
removed and the land affected regraded and revegetated consistent with 
the requirements of Sec. Sec. 715.14 and 715.20, unless retention of a 
road is approved as part of a postmining land use under Sec. 715.13 as 
being nessary to support the postmining land use or necessary to 
adequately control erosion and the necessary maintenance is assured.
    (2) Construction. (i) All roads, insofar as possible, shall be 
located on ridges or on the available flatter and more stable slopes to 
minimize erosion. Stream fords are prohibited unless they are 
specifically approved by the regulatory authority as temporary routes 
across dry streams that will not adversely affect sedimentation and that 
will not be used for coal haulage. Other stream crossings shall be made 
using bridges, culverts or other structures designed and constructed to 
meet the requirements of this paragraph. Roads shall not be located in 
active stream channels nor shall they be constructed or maintained in a 
manner that increases erosion or causes significant sedimentation or 
flooding. However, nothing in this paragraph will be construed to 
prohibit relocation of stream channels in accordance with paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (ii) In order to minimize erosion and subsequent disturbances of the 
hydrologic balance, roads shall be constructed in compliance with the 
following grade restrictions or other grades determined by the 
regulatory authority to be necessary to control erosion:
    (A) The overall sustained grade shall not exceed 1v:10h (10 
percent).
    (B) The maximum grade greater than 10 percent shall not exceed 
1v:6.5h (15 percent) for more than 300 feet.
    (C) There shall not be more than 300 feet of grade exceeding 10 
percent within each 1,000 feet.
    (iii) All access and haul roads shall be adequately drained using 
structures such as, but not limited to, ditches, water barriers, cross 
drains, and ditch relief drains. For access and haul roads that are to 
be maintained for more than 1 year, water-control structures shall be 
designed with a discharge capacity capable of passing the peak runoff 
from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event. Drainage pipes and culverts 
shall be constructed to avoid plugging or collapse and erosion at inlets 
and outlets. Drainage ditches shall be provided at the toe of all cut 
slopes formed by construction of roads. Trash racks and debris basins 
shall be installed in the drainage ditches wherever debris from the 
drainage area could impair the functions of drainage and sediment 
control structures. Ditch relief and cross drains shall be spaced 
according to grade. Effluent limitations of paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply to drainage from access and hauls roads located 
outside the disturbed area as defined in this section unless otherwise 
specified by the regulatory authority.
    (iv) Access and haul roads shall be surfaced with durable material. 
Toxic- or acid-forming substances shall not be used. Vegetation may be 
cleared only for the essential width necessary for road and associated 
ditch construction and to serve traffic needs.
    (3) Maintenance. (i) Access and haul roads shall be routinely 
maintained by means such as, but not limited to, wetting, scraping or 
surfacing.
    (ii) Ditches, culverts, drains, trash racks, debris basins and other 
structures serving to drain access and haul roads shall not be 
restricted or blocked in any manner that impedes drainage or adversely 
affects the intended purpose of the structure.
    (m) Hydrologic impacts of other transport facilities. Railroad 
loops, spurs, sidings and other transport facilities shall be 
constructed, maintained and reclaimed to control diminution or 
degradation of water quality and quantity and to prevent additional 
contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to run-off outside 
the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology 
currently available. In no event shall contributions be in excess of 
requirements set by applicable State or Federal law.

[[Page 80]]

    (n) Discharge of waters into underground mines. Surface and ground 
waters shall not be discharged or diverted into underground mine 
workings.

Sec. 715.18  Dams constructed of or impounding waste material.

    (a) General. No waste material shall be used in or impounded by 
existing or new dams without the approval of the regulatory authority. 
The permittee shall design, locate, construct, operate, maintain, 
modify, and abandon or remove all dams (used either temporarily or 
permanently) constructed of waste materials, in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.
    (b) Construction of dams. (1) Waste shall not be used in the 
construction of dams unless demonstrated through appropriate engineering 
analysis, to have no adverse effect on stability.
    (2) Plans for dams subject to this section, and also including those 
dams that do not meet the size or other criteria of Sec. 77.216(a) of 
this title, shall be approved by the regulatory authority before 
construction and shall contain the minimum plan requirements established 
by the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration pursuant to Sec. 
77.216-2 of this title.
    (3) Construction requirements are as follows:
    (i) Design shall be based on the flood from the probable maximum 
precipitation event unless the permittee shows that the failure of the 
impounding structure would not cause loss of life or severely damage 
property or the environment, in which case depending on site conditions, 
a design based on a precipitations event of no less than 100-year 
frequency may be approved by the regulatory authority.
    (ii) The design freeboard distance between the lowest point on the 
embankment crest and the maximum water elevation shall be at least 3 
feet to avoid overtopping by wind and wave action.
    (iii) Dams shall have minimum safety factors as follows:

determine the factors of safety of the dam for all loading conditions in 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and for all increments of 
construction.
    (v) Seepage through the dam, foundation, and abutments shall be 
controlled to prevent excessive uplift pressures, internal erosion, 
sloughing, removal of material by solution, or erosion of material by 
loss into cracks, joints, and cavities. This may require the use of 
impervious blankets, pervious drainage zones or blankets, toe drains, 
relief wells, or dental concreting of jointed rock surface in contact 
with embankment materials.
    (vi) Allowances shall be made for settlement of the dams and the 
foundation so that the freeboard will be maintained.
    (vii) Impoundments created by dams of waste materials shall be 
subject to a minimum drawdown criteria that allows the facility to be 
evacuated by spillways or decants of 90 percent of the volume of water 
stored during the design precipitation event within 10 days.

be cut where necessary to facilitate inspection and repairs. Ditches and 
spillways shall be cleaned. Any combustible materials present on the 
surface, other than that used for surface stability such as mulch or dry 
vegetation, shall be removed and any other appropriate maintenance 
procedures followed.
    (6) All dams subject to this section shall be certified annually as 
having been constructed and modified in accordance with current prudent 
engineering practices to minimize the possibility of failures, Any 
changes in the geometry of the impounding structure shall be highlighted 
and included in the annual certification report. These certifications 
shall include a report on existing and required monitoring procedures 
and instrumentation, the average and maximum depths and elevations of 
any impounded waters over the past year, existing storage capacity of 
impounding structures, any fires occurring in the material over the past 
year and any other aspects of the structures affecting their stability.
    (7) Any enlargements, reductions in size, reconstruction or other 
modification of the dams shall be approved by the regulatory authority 
before construction begins.
    (8) All dams shall be removed and the disturbed areas regraded,

[[Page 82]]

physical factors that could reasonably be affected by the blasting. 
Assessments of structures such as pipes, cables, transmission lines, and 
wells and other water systems shall be limited to surface condition and 
other readily available data. Special attention shall be given to the 
preblasting condition of wells and other water systems used for human, 
animal, or agricultural purposes and to the quantity and quality of the 
water.
    (3) A written report of the survey shall be prepared and signed by 
the person or persons who conducted the survey and prepared the written 
report. The report shall include recommendations of any special 
conditions or proposed adjustments to the blasting procedures outlined 
in paragraph (e) of this section which should be incorporated into the 
blasting plan to prevent damage. Copies of the report shall be provided 
to the person requesting the survey and to the regulatory authority.
    (c) Public notice of blasting schedule. At least 10 days, but not 
more than 20 days before beginning a blasting program in which 
explosives that use more than the equivalent of 5 pounds of TNT are 
detonated, the permittee shall publish a blasting schedule in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the proposed site. 
Copies of the schedule shall be distributed by mail to local governments 
and public utilities and to each residence within one-half mile of the 
blasting sites described in the schedule. The permittee shall republish 
and redistribute the schedule by mail at least every 3 months. Blasting 
schedules shall not be so general as to cover all working hours but 
shall identify as accurately as possible the location of the blasting 
sites and the time periods when blasting will occur. The blasting 
schedule shall contain at a minimum--
    (1) Identification of the specific areas in which blasting will take 
place. The specific blasting areas described shall not be larger than 
300 acres with a generally contiguous border;
    (2) Dates and times when explosives are to be detonated expressed in 
not more than 4-hour increments;

regulatory authority, when it may be necessary to blast at times other 
than those described in the schedule.
    (d) Public notice of changes to blasting schedules. Before blasting 
in areas not covered by a previous schedule or whenever the proposed 
frequency of individual detonations are materially changed, the 
permittee shall prepare a revised blasting schedule in accordance with 
the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. If the change involves 
only a temporary adjustment of the frequency of blasts, the permittee 
may use alternate methods to notify the governmental bodies and 
individuals to whom the original schedule was sent.
    (e) Blasting procedures--(1) General. (i) All blasting shall be 
conducted only during the daytime hours, defined as sunrise until 
sunset. Based on public requests or other considerations, including the 
proximity to residential areas, the regulatory authority may specify 
more restrictive time periods.
    (ii) Blasting may not be conducted at times different from those 
announced in the blasting schedule except in emergency situations where 
rain, lightning, other atmospheric conditions, or operator or public 
safety requires unscheduled detonation.
    (iii) Warning and all-clear signals of different character that are 
audible within a range of one-half mile from the point of the blast 
shall be given. All persons within the permit area shall be notified of 
the meaning of the signals through appropriate instructions and signs 
posted as required by Sec. 715.12.
    (iv) Access to the blasting area shall be regulated to protect the 
public and livestock from the effects of blasting. Access to the 
blasting area shall be controlled to prevent unauthorized entry at least 
10 minutes before each blast and until the permittee's authorized 
representative has determined that no unusual circumstances such as 
imminent slides or undetonated charges exist and access to and travel

[[Page 83]]

in or through the area can safely resume.
    (v) Areas in which charged holes are awaiting firing shall be 
guarded, barricaded and posted, or flagged against unauthorized entry.
    (vi) Airblast shall be controlled such that it does not exceed 128 
decibel linear-peak at any manmade dwelling or structure located within 
one-half mile of the permit area.
    (vii) Except where lesser distances are approved by the regulatory 
authority (based upon a preblasting survey or other appropriate 
investigations) blasting shall not be conducted within--
    (A) 1,000 feet of any building used as a dwelling, school, church, 
hospital, or nursing facility;
    (B) 500 feet of facilities including, but not limited to, disposal 
wells, petroleum or gas-storage facilities, municipal water-storage 
facilities, fluid-transmission pipelines, gas or oil-collection lines, 
or water and sewage lines; and
    (C) 500 feet of an underground mine not totally abandoned except 
with the concurrence of the Mining Enforcement and Safety 
Administration.
    (2) Blasting standards. (i) Blasting shall be conducted to prevent 
injury to persons, damage to public or private property outside the 
permit area, adverse impacts on any underground mine, and change in the 
course, channel, or availability of ground or surface waters outside the 
permit area.
    (ii) Ground vibration--(A) General. In all blasting operations, 
except as otherwise authorized in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the maximum ground vibration shall not exceed a value approved by the 
regulatory authority. It shall be established in accordance with the 
maximum peak-particle-velocity limit of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B), the 
scaled-distance equation of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C), or the blasting-
level chart of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(D), or such other standard 
established under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(E), of this section. All 
structures in the vicinity of the blasting area, not listed in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii)(B), of this section, such as water towers, pipelines and 
other utilities, tunnels, dams, impoundments, and underground mines, 
shall be protected from damage by establishment of a maximum allowable 
limit on the ground vibration, submitted by the operator and approved by 
the regulatory authority before the initiation of blasting.
    (B) Maximum peak-particle velocity. (1) The maximum ground vibration 
shall not exceed the following limits at the location of any dwelling, 
public building, school, church, or community or institutional building 
outside the permit area.

    (2) A seismographic record shall be provided for each blast.
    (C) Scaled-distance equation. (1) The operator may use the scaled-
distance equation, W=(D/Ds)\2\, to determine the allowable charge weight 
of explosives to be detonated in any 8-millisecond period without 
seismic monitoring; where W=the maximum weight of explosives, in pounds; 
D=the distance, in feet, from the blasting site to the nearest protected 
structure; and Ds=the scaled-distance factor, which may initially be 
approved by the regulatory authority using the values for scaled-
distance factor listed in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(1), of this section.
    (2) The development of a modified scaled-distance factor may be 
authorized by the regulatory authority on receipt of a written request 
by the operator, supported by seismographic records of blasting at the 
minesite. The modified scaled-distance factor shall be determined such 
that the particle velocity of the predicted ground vibration will not 
exceed the prescribed maximum allowable peak particle velocity of 
paragraph (e)(2)(B)(1) of this section at a 95-percent confidence level.

    (2 ) If the Figure 1 limits are used, a seismographic record 
including both particle-velocity and vibration-frequency levels shall be 
provided for each blast. The method for the analysis of the predominant 
frequency contained in the blasting records shall be approved by the 
regulatory authority before application of this alternative blasting 
criterion.
    (E) The maximum allowable ground vibration shall be reduced by the 
regulatory authority beyond the limits otherwise provided by this 
section, if determined necessary to provide damage protection.
    (F) The regulatory authority may require an operator to conduct 
seismic monitoring of any or all blasts and may specify the location at 
which the measurements are taken and the degree of detail necessary in 
the measurement.
    (iii) If blasting is conducted in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section, the maximum ground-vibration and airblast 
standards shall not apply at the following locations:

<R05>
Sec. 715.20  Revegetation.

    (a) General. (1) The permittee shall establish on all land that has 
been disturbed, a diverse, effective, and permanent vegetative cover of 
species native to the area of disturbed land or species that will 
support the planned postmining uses of the land approved according to 
Sec. 715.13. For areas designated as prime farmland, the reclamation 
procedures of Sec. 716.7 shall apply.
    (2) Revegetation shall be carried out in a manner that encourages a 
prompt vegetative cover and recovery of productivity levels compatible 
with approved land uses. The vegetative cover shall be capable of 
stabilizing the soil surface with respect to erosion. All disturbed 
lands, except water areas and surface areas of roads that are approved 
as a part of the postmining land use, shall be seeded or planted to 
achieve a vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the 
area of disturbed land. If both the pre- and postmining land use is 
intensive agriculture, planting of the crops normally grown will meet 
the requirement. Vegetative cover will be considered of the same 
seasonal variety when it consists of a mixture of species of equal or 
superior utility for the intended land use when compared with the 
utility of naturally occurring vegetation during each season of the 
year.
    (3) On Federal lands, the surface management agency shall be 
consulted for approval prior to revegetation regarding what species are 
selected, and following revegetation, to determine when the area is 
ready to be used.
    (b) Use of introduced species. Introduced species may be substituted 
for native species only if appropriate field trials have demonstrated 
that the introduced species are of equal or superior utility for the 
approved postmining land use, or are necessary to achieve a quick, 
temporary, and stabilizing cover. Such species substitution shall be 
approved by the regulatory authority. Introduced species shall meet 
applicable State and Federal seed or introduced species statutes, and 
shall not include poisonous or potentially toxic species.
    (c) Timing of revegetation. Seeding and planting of disturbed areas 
shall be

[[Page 86]]

conducted during the first normal period for favorable planting 
conditions after final preparation. The normal period for favorable 
planting shall be that planting time generally accepted locally for the 
type of plant materials selected to meet specific site conditions and 
climate. Any disturbed areas, except water areas and surface areas or 
roads that are approved under Sec. 715.13 as part of the postmining 
land use, which have been graded shall be seeded with a temporary cover 
of small grains, grasses, or legumes to control erosion until an 
adequate permanent cover is established. When rills or gullies, that 
would preclude the successful establishment of vegetation or the 
achievement of the postmining land use, form in regraded topsoil and 
overburden materials as specified in Sec. 715.14, additional regrading 
or other stabilization practices will be required before seeding and 
planting.
    (d) Mulching. Mulch shall be used on all regraded and topsoiled 
areas to control erosion, to promote germination of seeds, and to 
increase the moisture retention of the soil. Mulch shall be anchored to 
the soil surface where appropriate, to insure effective protection of 
the soil and vegetation. Mulch means vegetation residues or other 
suitable materials that aid in soil stabilization and soil moisture 
conservation, thus providing micro-climatic conditions suitable for 
germination and growth, and do not interfere with the postmining use of 
the land. Annual grains such as oats, rye and wheat may be used instead 
of mulch when it is shown to the satisfaction of the regulatory 
authority that the substituted grains will provide adequate stability 
and that they will later be replaced by species approved for the 
postmining use.
    (e) Methods of revegetation. (1) The permittee shall use technical 
publications or the results of laboratory and field tests approved by 
the regulatory authority to determine the varieties, species, seeding 
rates, and soil amendment practices essential for establishment and 
self-regeneration of vegetation. The regulatory authority shall approve 
species selection and planting plans.
    (2) Where hayland, pasture, or range is to be the postmining land 
use, the species of grasses, legumes, browse, trees, or forbes for 
seeding or planting and their pattern of distribution shall be selected 
by the permittee to provide a diverse, effective, and permanent 
vegetative cover with the seasonal variety, succession, distribution, 
and regenerative capabilities native to the area. Livestock grazing will 
not be allowed on reclaimed land until the seedlings are established and 
can sustain managed grazing. The regulatory authority, in consultation 
with the permittee and the landowner or in concurrence with the 
governmental landmanaging agency having jurisdiction over the surface, 
shall determine when the revegetated area is ready for livestock 
grazing.
    (3) Where forest is to be the postmining land use, the permittee 
shall plant trees adapted for local site conditions and climate. Trees 
shall be planted in combination with an herbaceous cover of grains, 
grasses, legumes, forbs, or woody plants to provide a diverse, 
effective, and permanent vegetation cover with the seasonal variety, 
sucession, and regeneration capabilities native to the area.
    (4) Where wildlife habitat is to be included in the postmining land 
use, the permittee shall consult with appropriate State and Federal 
wildlife and land management agencies and shall select those species 
that will fulfill the needs of wildlife, including food, water, cover, 
and space. Plant groupings and water resources shall be spaced and 
distributed to fulfill the requirements of wildlife.
    (f) Standards for measuring success of revegetation. (1) Success of 
revegetation shall be measured on the basis of reference areas approved 
by the regulatory authority. Reference areas mean land units of varying 
size and shape identified and maintained under appropriate management 
for the purpose of measuring ground cover, productivity and species 
diversity that are produced naturally. The reference areas must be 
representative of geology, soils, slope, aspect, and vegetation in the 
permit area. Management of the reference area shall be comparable to 
that which will be required for the approved

[[Page 87]]

postmining land use of the area to be mined. The regulatory authority 
shall approve the estimating techniques that will be used to determine 
the degree of success in the revegetated area.
    (2) The ground cover of living plants on the revegetated area shall 
be equal to the ground cover of living plants of the approved reference 
area for a minimum of two growing seasons. The ground cover shall not be 
considered equal if it is less than 90 percent of the ground cover of 
the reference area for any significant portion of the mined area. 
Exceptions may be authorized by the regulatory authority for--
    (i) Previously mined areas that were not reclaimed to the standards 
required by this chapter prior to the effective date of these 
regulations. The ground cover of living plants for such areas shall not 
be less than required to control erosion, and in no case less than that 
existing before redisturbance.
    (ii) Areas to be developed immediately for industrial or residential 
use. The ground cover of living plants shall not be less than required 
to control erosion. As used in this paragraph, immediately means less 
than 2 years after regrading has been completed for the area to be used; 
and
    (iii) Areas to be used for agricultural cropland purposes. Success 
in revegetation of cropland shall be determined on the basis of crop 
production from the mined area compared to the reference area. Crop 
production from the mined area shall be equal to that of the approved 
reference area for a minimum of two growing seasons. Production shall 
not be considered equal if it is less than 90 percent of the production 
of the reference area for any significant portion of the mined area.
    (3) Species diversity, distribution, seasonal variety, and vigor 
shall be evaluated on the basis of the results which could reasonably be 
expected using the methods of revegetation approved under paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (g) Seeding of stockpiled topsoil. Topsoil stockpiled in compliance 
with Sec. 715.16 must be seeded or planted with an effective cover of 
nonnoxious, quick growing annual and perennial plants during the first 
normal period for favorable planting conditions or protected by other 
approved measures as specified in Sec. 715.16.

in this part. Such operations shall also comply with all general 
performance standards in part 715 of this chapter unless specifically 
exempted in this part from the requirements of part 715.


<R05>
Sec. 716.2  Steep-slope mining.

    The permittee conducting surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on natural slopes that exceed 20 degrees, or on lesser slopes 
that require measures to protect the area from disturbance, as 
determined by the regulatory authority after consideration of soils, 
climate, the method of operation, geology, and other regional 
characteristics, shall meet the following performance standards. The 
standards of this section do not apply where mining is done on a flat or 
gently rolling terrain with an occasional steep slope through which the 
mining proceeds and leaves a plain or predominantly flat area; or where 
the mining is governed by Sec. 716.3.
    (a) Spoil, waste materials or debris, including that from clearing 
and grubbing, and abandoned or disabled equipment, shall not be placed 
or allowed to remain on the downslope.
    (b) The highwall shall be completely covered with spoil and the 
disturbed are a graded to comply with the provisions of Sec. 715.14 of 
this chapter. Land above the highwall shall not be disturbed unless the 
regulatory authority finds that the disturbance will facilitate 
compliance with the requirements of this section.
    (c) Material in excess of that required to meet the provisions of 
Sec. 715.14 of this chapter shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 715.15 of this chapter.
    (d) Woody materials may be buried in the backfilled area only when 
burial does not cause, or add to, instability of the backfill. Woody 
materials may be chipped and distributed through the backfill when 
approved by the regulatory authority.
    (e) Variances from approximate original contour restoration 
requirements. (1) This section applies to surface coal mining operations 
on steep slopes where the operation is not to be reclaimed to achieve 
the approximate original contour and is not a mountaintop removal 
operation.
    (2) The objective of this subsection is to allow for a variance from 
the approximate original contour restoration requirements on steep 
slopes to--
    (i) Improve watershed control of the area; and
    (ii) Allow the land to be used for an industrial, commercial, 
residential, or public use, including recreational facilities.
    (3) The regulatory authority may grant a variance from the 
requirement for restoration of the affected lands to their approximate 
original contour only if it first finds, in writing, on the basis of a 
showing made by the permittee, that all of the following requirements 
are met:
    (i) The permittee has demonstrated that the purpose of the variance 
is to

[[Page 89]]

make the lands to be affected within the permit area suitable for an 
industrial, commercial, residential, or public use postmining land use 
and that the proposed industrial, commercial, residential, or public use 
is likely to occur.
    (ii) The proposed use, after consultation with the appropriate land-
use planning agencies, if any, constitutes an equal or better economic 
or public use.
    (iii) The permittee has demonstrated that compliance with the 
requirements for acceptable alternative postmining industrial, 
commercial, residential or public land uses of 30 CFR 715.13 has been 
achieved except for the requirement at Sec. 715.13(d)(3) and (4) to 
provide letters of commitment. The permittee must demonstrate to the 
regulatory authority that necessary public facilities are likely to be 
provided and that the plan is financially feasible.
    (iv) The permittee has demonstrated that the watershed of the area 
will be improved as compared to the condition of the watershed before 
mining. The watershed will be deemed improved only if--
    (A) There will be a reduction in the amount of total suspended 
solids or other pollutants discharged to ground or surface waters from 
the area as compared to such discharges; or, there will be reduced flood 
hazards or more even flow within the watershed containing the area due 
to reduction of the peak flow discharges from precipitation events or 
thaws; or any other criterion authority in the granting of the variance. 
While improving one or more variables, the permittee must also at least 
maintain the variables not improved at their premining levels;
    (B) The total volume of flows from the proposed affected lands, 
during every season of the year, will not vary in a way that adversely 
affects the ecology of any surface water or any existing or planned use 
of surface or ground water; and
    (C) The appropriate State environmental agency approves the plan.
    (v) The permittee has demonstrated that the owner of the surface of 
the lands within the permit area has knowingly requested, in writing, as 
a part of the application, that a variance be granted. The request shall 
be made separately from any surface owner consent given for the 
operation and shall show an understanding that the variance could not be 
granted without the surface owner's request.
    (vi) The proposal is designed and certified by a qualified 
registered professional engineer in conformance with professional 
standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and 
configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.
    (vii) All other requirements of the Act and these regulations will 
be met by the proposed operations.
    (4) Every permittee who obtains a variance under this subsection 
shall:
    (i) Backfill completely the highwall with spoil material, in a 
manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3 using 
general geotechnical analysis.
    (ii) Improve the watershed control of the area by reducing the peak 
flow from precipitation or thaw or reducing the total suspended solids 
or other pollutants in the surface water discharge during precipitation 
or thaw or by attaining the criteria approved by the regulatory 
authority in the granting of the variance. While improving one or more 
variables, the permittee must also at least maintain the variables not 
improved at their premining levels. The total volume of flow during 
every season of the year shall not vary in a way that adversely affects 
the ecology of any surface or ground water.
    (iii) Disturb land above the highwall only to the extent that the 
regulatory authority deems appropriate and approves as necessary to 
facilitate compliance with the provisions of this section. The 
regulatory authority may authorize such a disturbance above the highwall 
if it finds the disturbance is necessary to--
    (A) Blend the solid highwall and the backfilled material; or
    (B) Control surface runoff; or
    (C) Provide access to the area above the highwall.
    (iv) Place off the mine bench no more than the amount of spoil 
necessary to achieve the postmining land use, ensure the stability of 
spoil retained on the bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act 
and parts 710 through

[[Page 90]]

725 of this chapter. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be placed 
in accordance with the Act and these regulations.
    (5) The regulatory authority shall review every variance granted 
pursuant to this subsection not more than three years from the date of 
issuance of the permit to ensure that the proposed alternative 
postmining use is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the 
approved plan, unless the permittee affirmatively so demonstrates.

Sec. 716.3  Mountaintop removal.

    (a) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations that remove 
entire coal seams running through the upper fraction of a mountain, 
ridge, or hill by removing all of the overburden and creating a level 
plateau or gently rolling contour with no highwalls remaining are exempt 
from the requirements of Sec. 715.14 of this chapter for achieving 
approximate original contour, if the following requirements are met:
    (1) An industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or public 
facility (including recreational facilities) use is proposed for the 
affected land.
    (2) The alternative land use criteria in Sec. 715.13(d) of this 
chapter are met and the proposal is approved by the regulatory 
authority.
    (3) All other applicable requirements of part 715 of this chapter 
can be met.
    (b) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted under 
this section shall comply with the following standards:
    (1) An outcrop barrier of sufficient width consisting of the toe of 
the lowest coal seam, and its associated overburden shall be retained to 
prevent slides and erosion.
    (2) The final graded top plateau slopes on the mined area shall be 
less than 1v:5h so as to create a level plateau or gently rolling 
configuration and the outslopes of the plateau shall not exceed 1v:2h, 
except where engineering data substantiates and the regulatory authority 
finds that a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 will be attained.
    (3) The resulting level or gently rolling contour shall be graded to 
drain inward from the outslope except at specific points where it drains 
over the outslope in protected stable channels.
    (4) Damage to natural watercourses below the area to be mined shall 
be prevented.
    (5) Spoil shall be placed on the mountaintop bench as is necessary 
to achieve the postmining land use approved under Sec. 715.13 of this 
chapter. All excess spoil material not retained on the mountaintop shall 
be placed in accordance with the standards of Sec. 715.15 of this 
chapter.
    (c)(1) All permits giving approval for mountaintop removal shall be 
reviewed not more than 3 years from the date of issuance of the permit, 
unless the permittee affirmatively demonstrates and the regulatory 
authority finds that all operations are proceeding in accordance with 
the terms of the permit and applicable requirements of the Act and the 
regulations of this part. The terms of the permit shall be in accordance 
with the requirements of the Act and the regulations of this part.
    (2) The terms of a permit for mountaintop removal may be modified by 
the regulatory authority if it determines that more stringent measures 
are necessary to prevent or control slides and erosion, prevent damage 
to natural water courses, avoid water pollution, or to assure successful 
revegetation.


<R05>
Sec. 716.4  Special bituminous coal mines.

    (a) Definition. Special bituminous coal surface mines as used in 
this section means those bituminous coal surface mines that are located 
in the State of Wyoming and that are being mined or will be mined 
according to the following criteria:
    (1) Excavation of the mine pit takes place on a relatively limited 
site for an extended period of time. For the purposes of this section, 
mine pit means an open-pit mine in which the surface opening is at least 
the full size of the excavation and has a contiguous border. The pit 
generally is quite deep and is formed by the removal of relatively large 
amounts of overburden to obtain lesser amounts of coal. The term as used 
in this section applies only to mining operations that extract coal

[[Page 91]]

from seams dipping 15 degrees or more from the horizontal.
    (2) Excavation of the mine pit follows a coal seam that inclines 15 
degrees or more from the horizontal, and as the excavation proceeds 
downward it expands laterally to maintain stability of the pitwall or as 
necessary to accommodate the orderly expansion of the total mining 
operations.
    (3)(i) Surface coal mining operations in the mine pit have taken 
place since January 1, 1972, and
    (A) Operations in the mine pit are removing more than one coal seam, 
and
    (B) Mining has begun on the deepest coal seam scheduled to be mined; 
or
    (ii) Surface coal mining operations which may be developed after 
August 3, 1977, and are conducted on lands immediately adjacent to 
operations meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) The amount of material removed from the pit is large in 
proportion to the surface area disturbed.
    (5) There is no practicable alternative to the deep open-pit method 
of mining the coal.
    (6) There is no practicable way to entirely reclaim the land as 
required by part 715 of this chapter.
    (b) Requirements for special bituminous coal mines operating prior 
to July 1, 1973. Those portions of a special bituminous coal mine 
approved for operation prior to July 1, 1973, including the orderly 
expansion of such a mine pit to the extent authorized by State law, 
shall at a minimum meet the general performance standards of part 715 of 
this chapter for all operations conducted on the permit area outside the 
mine pit and for those operations associated with spoil storage areas. 
The standards of part 715 also apply to the mine pit with the exception 
of Sec. 715.14, which relates to backfilling and grading. Special 
requirements for backfilling and grading the mine pit area are as 
follows:
    (1) In the final mine area, highwalls will be allowed to remain and 
benches will be allowed. Details of the benches shall be included in the 
mine plans submitted to the regulatory authority for approval.
    (2) The exposed pit floors will be sloped and graded to provide 
access to the area, and topsoil shall be applied and the floor area 
seeded according to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 715.16 and 715.20. 
Where water impoundments are included as part of the mine plan, riprap 
may be used if necessary to prevent erosion.
    (3) Spoil piles will be graded and contoured with no more than 
overall slope of 17 degrees allowed, and terraces may be used to break 
the slope when it can be shown that terraces will accomplish the 
required reclamation. For the postmining land use, steeper slopes may be 
permitted upon approval of the regulatory authority, provided it can be 
demonstrated that such method will provide the required results.
    (c) Requirements for other special bituminous coal mines. Those 
portions of a special bituminous coal mine which do not meet the 
criteria of paragraph (b) of this section shall, at minimum meet the 
general performance standards of part 715 of this chapter for all 
operations conducted on the permit area outside the mine pit and for 
these operations associated with spoil storage areas. The standards of 
part 715 also apply to the mine pit with the exception of Sec. 715.14, 
which relates to backfilling and grading. Special requirements for 
backfilling and grading the mine pit area are as follows:
    (1) Slope specifications. Slope specifications for the postmining 
land use shall be based on an average of the natural slopes measured in 
the immediate area of the mine site, and the maximum inclination of the 
slopes in the reclaimed area shall not be greater than this average 
slope. However, slopes steeper than the average of the natural slopes 
may be approved by the regulatory authority if it can be demonstrated 
that returning the minded area to a slope equal to or less than the 
average natural slope would greatly increase the amount of disturbed 
land. Measurements of individual slopes, locations at which measurements 
are made, and the average natural slope as determined from the 
individual slope measurements shall be submitted for approval to the 
regulatory authority. The regulatory authority may make an independent 
slope survey to verify the average natural slope.
    (2) Postmining land uses that do not include permanent water 
impoundments. (i)

[[Page 92]]

The final mine area shall be backfilled, graded, and contoured to the 
extent necessary to return the land to the use approved by the 
regulatory authority.
    (ii) All backfilling, grading, and contouring shall be done in a 
manner to preserve the original drainage system or to provide substitute 
drainage systems approved by the regulatory authority.
    (iii) Terraces or benches may be used only if it can be demonstrated 
that contouring methods will not provide the required results. Detailed 
plans of dimensions and design of the terraces or benches, check dams, 
erosion prevention techniques, and slopes of the terraces or benches and 
their intervals shall be submitted to the regulatory authority for 
approval before construction.
    (iv) Depressions that will accumulate water shall not be allowed 
unless they are approved under paragraph (3).
    (3) Postmining land uses that include permanent water impoundments. 
(i) The exposed mine pit area shall be sloped, graded, and contoured to 
blend with the topography of the surrounding terrain and to provide for 
access to the area. Where necessary to prevent erosion, riprap shall be 
used.
    (ii) Under certain conditions where it can be demonstrated by the 
permittee that the pitwall can be stabilized by terracing or other 
techniques it may be permissible to leave one-half the proposed 
shoreline, as measured along the circumference, composed of the 
stabilized pitwall. The remaining part of the shoreline shall be graded 
and contoured to blend with the topography of the surrounding terrain 
and to provide access to the area. Detailed explanations of the 
techniques to be used to stabilize the pitwalls shall be submitted for 
approval to the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority may 
verify the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization techniques from a 
study made by an independent engineering company and based on this 
information and an onsite inspection, the regulatory authority will then 
determine the acceptability of the proposed stabilization techniques.
    (d) In the event of an amendment or revision to the State of 
Wyoming's regulatory program, regulations, or decisions made thereunder 
governing special bituminous coal mines, the Secretary shall issue such 
additional regulations as necessary to meet the purposes of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 716.5  Anthracite coal mines.

    (a) Permittees of anthracite surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations in those States where the mines are regulated by State 
environmental protection standards shall be subject to the environmental 
protection standards of the State regulatory program in existence on 
August 3, 1977, instead of part 715 and part 717 of this chapter.
    (b) The environmental protection provisions of Title 25, Rules and 
Regulations, part 1, Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, shall apply to reclamation of anthracite surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
instead of part 715 and part 717 of this chapter. In addition, the 
regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pertaining to standards 
for air and water quality shall apply instead of the regulations of part 
715 and part 717 of this chapter.
    (c) If a State's regulatory program or regulations for anthracite 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations in force at the time of 
this Act are amended, the Secretary, upon receipt of a notice of 
amendment, shall issue additional regulations as necessary to meet the 
purposes of this Act.

[45 FR 61259, Sept. 15, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 716.6  Coal mines in Alaska.

    (a) Permittees of surface coal mining operations in Alaska from 
which coal has been mined on or after August 3, 1977, shall conduct 
operations in a manner that, at a minimum, meets the performance 
standards of this chapter.
    (b) The Secretary, after consultation with the Governor of Alaska, 
may modify the applicability of any environmental protection standard to 
any surface coal mining operation if he determines that it is necessary 
to ensure the continued operation of the mine.
    (c) Any person may petition the Secretary to modify the 
applicability of a performance standard to a coal mine in Alaska. No 
particular form of petition

[[Page 93]]

is required. However, the petition shall be in writing and shall 
identify clearly--
    (1) The performance standard involved;
    (2) The alternative methods to be used to protect the environment 
and public health and safety;
    (3) The reasons why a modification is requested with full 
descriptions of the impacts continued requirements for compliance with 
the performance standard to be modified would have on mining and 
reclamation and of the impacts the proposed method would have on the 
environment and public health and safety; and
    (4) The location of the mine.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that the petition presents 
reasonable justification for modifying the performance standard, he may 
grant a temporary suspension of enforcement of the performance standard, 
and he shall publish a notice of intention to modify the applicability 
of the performance standard in the Federal Register and in a newspaper 
of general circulation in the area of Alaska where the affected coal 
mine is located. A public hearing shall be held in Alaska and any person 
may testify for or against the proposed modification. The Secretary, 
after considering the public comments, and consulting with the Governor 
of Alaska, shall publish his decision in the Federal Register and in the 
same newspaper in which the original notice was published.


<R05>
Sec. 716.7  Prime farmland.

    (a) Applicability. (1) Permittees of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations conducted on prime farmland shall comply with the 
general performance standards of part 715 of this chapter in addition to 
the special requirements of this section.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the requirements 
of the section are applicable to any lands covered by a permit 
application filed on or after August 3, 1977. This section does not 
apply to:
    (i) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
are conducted pursuant to any permit issued prior to August 3, 1977; or
    (ii) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
are conducted pursuant to any renewal or revision of a permit issued 
prior to August 3, 1977; or
    (iii) Lands included in any existing surface coal mining operations 
for which a permit was issued for all or any part thereof prior to 
August 3, 1977, provided that:
    (A) Such lands are part of a single continuous surface coal mining 
operation begun under a permit issued before August 3, 1977; and
    (B) The permittee had a legal right to mine the lands prior to 
August 3, 1977, through ownership, contract, or lease but not including 
an option to buy, lease, or contract; and
    (C) The lands contain part of a continuous recoverable coal seam 
that was being mined in a single continuous mining pit (or multiple pits 
if the lands are proven to be part of a single continuous surface coal 
mining operation) begun under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977.
    (3) For purposes of this section:
    (i) ``Renewal'' of a permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory 
authority to extend the time by which the permittee may complete mining 
within the boundaries of the original permit, and ``revision'' of the 
permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to allow 
changes in the method of mining operations within the original permit 
area, or the decision of the regulatory authority to allow incidental 
boundary changes to the original permit;
    (ii) A pit shall be deemed to be a single continuous mining pit even 
if portions of the pit are crossed by a road, pipeline, railroad, or 
powerline or similar crossing;
    (iii) A single continuous surface coal mining operation is presumed 
to consist only of a single continuous mining pit under a permit issued 
prior to August 3, 1977, but may include non-contiguous parcels if the 
operator can prove by clear and convincing evidence that, prior to 
August 3, 1977, the contiguous parcels were part of a single permitted 
operation. For the purposes of this paragraph, clear and convincing 
evidence includes, but is not limited to, contracts, leases, deeds or 
other

[[Page 94]]

properly executed legal documents (not including options) that 
specifically treat physically separate parcels as one surface coal 
mining operation.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions are applicable.
    (1) Prime farmland means those lands which are defined by the 
Secretary of Agriculture in 7 CFR 657 and which have been historically 
used for cropland.
    (2) Historically used for cropland means (i) lands that have been 
used for cropland for any 5 years or more out of the 10 years 
immediately preceding the acquisition, including purchase, lease, or 
option, of the land for the purpose of conducting or allowing through 
resale, lease, or option the conduct of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations; (ii) lands that the regulatory authority 
determines, on the basis of additional cropland history of the 
surrounding lands and the lands under consideration, that the permit 
area is clearly cropland but falls outside the specific 5-years-in-10 
criterion, or (iii) lands that would likely have been used as cropland 
for any 5 out of the last 10 years immediately preceding such acquistion 
but for some fact of ownership or control of the land unrelated to the 
productivity of the land, in which case the regulations for prime 
farmland may be applied to include more years of cropland history only 
to increase the prime farmland acreage to be protected.
    (3) Cropland means land used for the production of adapted crops for 
harvest, alone or in a rotation with grasses and legumes, and includes 
row crops, small grain crops, hay crops, nursery crops, orchard crops, 
and other similar speciality crops.
    (4) The soils either have no water table or have a water table that 
is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow 
food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops common to the area to be 
grown.
    (5) The soils can be managed so that in all horizons within a depth 
of 40 inches or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 40 inches 
deep, during part of each year the conductivity of saturation extract is 
less than 4 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) is 
less than 15.
    (6) The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season 
(less often than once in 2 years).
    (7) The soils have a product of K (erodibility factor) x percent 
slope of less than 2.0 and a product of I (soil erodibility) x C 
(climatic factor) not exceeding 60.
    (8) The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch per 
hour in the upper 20 inches and the mean annual soil temperature at a 
depth of 20 inches is less than 59 degrees F.; the permeability rate is 
not a limiting factor if the mean annual soil temperature is 59 degress 
F. or higher.
    (9) Less than 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in 
these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches.
    (c) Indentification of prime farmland. Prime farmland shall be 
identified on the basis of soil surveys submitted by the applicant. The 
regulatory authority also may require data on irrigation, drainage, 
flood control, and subsurface water managament. The requirement for 
submission of soil surveys may be waived by the regulatory authority, if 
the applicant can demonstrate according to the procedures in paragraph 
(d) of this section that no prime farmlands are involved. Soil surveys 
shall be conducted according to standards of the National Cooperative 
Soil Survey, which include the procedures set forth in U.S. Department 
of Agriculture Handbooks 436 (Soil Taxonomy) and 18 (Soil Survey 
Manual), and shall include--
    (1) Data on moisture availability, temperature regime, flooding, 
water table, erosion characteristics, permeability, or other information 
that is needed to determine prime farmland in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this section;
    (2) A map designating the exact location and extent of the prime 
farmland; and
    (3) A description of each soil mapping unit.
    (d) Negative determination of prime farmland. The land shall not be 
considered as prime farmland where the applicant can demonstrate one or 
more of the following situations--

[[Page 95]]

    (1) Lands within the proposed permit boundaries have not been 
historically used for cropland.
    (2) The slope of all land within the permit area is 10 percent or 
greater.
    (3) Land within the permit area is not irrigated or naturally 
subirrigated, has no developed water supply that is dependable and of 
adequate quality, and the average annual precipitation is 14 inches or 
less.
    (4) Other factors exist, such as a very rocky surface, or the land 
is frequently flooded, which clearly place all land within the area 
outside the purview of prime farmland.
    (5) A written notification based on scientific findings and soil 
surveys that land within the proposed mining area does not meet the 
applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section is submitted 
to the regulatory authority by a qualified person other than the 
applicant, and is approved by the regulatory authority.
    (e) Plan for restoration of prime farmland. The applicant shall 
submit to the regulatory authority a plan for the mining and restoration 
of any prime farmland within the proposed permit boundaries. This plan 
shall be used by the regulatory authority in judging the technological 
capability of the applicant to restore prime farmlands. The plan shall 
include--
    (1) A description of the original undisturbed soil profile, as 
determined from a soil survey, showing the depth and thickness of each 
of the soil horizons that collectively constitute the root zone of the 
locally adapted crops and are to be removed, stored, and replaced;
    (2) The proposed method and type of equipment to be used for 
removal, storage, and replacement of the soil in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section;
    (3) The location of areas to be used for the separate stockpiling of 
the soil and plans for soil stabilization before redistribution;
    (4) If applicable, documentation such as agricultural school studies 
or other scientific data from comparable areas that supports the use of 
other suitable material, instead of the A, B or C soil horizon to obtain 
on the restored area equivalent or higher levels of yield as non-mined 
prime farmlands in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of 
management; and
    (5) Plans for seeding or cropping the final graded mine land and the 
conservation practices to control erosion and sedimentation during the 
first 12 months after regrading is completed. Proper adjustments for 
seasons must be made so that final graded land is not exposed to erosion 
during seasons when vegetation or conservation practices cannot be 
established due to weather conditions; and
    (6) Available agricultural school studies, company data, or other 
scientific data for comparable areas that demonstrate that the applicant 
using his proposed method of reclamation will achieve, within a 
reasonable time equivalent or higher levels of yield after mining as 
existed before mining.
    (f) Consultation with Secretary of Agriculture and issuance of 
permit. (1) The regulatory authority may grant a permit which shall 
incorporate the plan submitted under paragraph (e) of this section, if 
it finds in writing that the applicant--
    (i) Has the technological capability to restore the prime farmland 
within the proposed permit area, within a reasonable time, to equivalent 
or higher levels of yield as nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding 
area under equivalent levels of management; and
    (ii) Will achieve compliance with the standards of paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (2) Before any permit is issued for areas that include prime 
farmlands, the regulatory authority shall consult with the Secretary of 
Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a review of the 
proposed method of soil reconstruction and comment on possible revisions 
that will result in a more complete and adequate restoration. The 
Secretary of Agriculture has assigned his responsibilities under this 
paragraph to the Administrator of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service and 
the U.S. Soil Conservation Service will carry out the consultation and 
review through their State Conservationist, located in each State.
    (g) Special requirements. For all prime farmlands to be mined and 
reclaimed,

[[Page 96]]

the applicant shall meet the following special requirements:
    (1) All soil horizons to be used in the reconstruction of the soil 
shall be removed before drilling, blasting, or mining ro prevent 
contaminating the soil horizons with undesirable materials. Where 
removal of soil horizons result in erosion that may cause air and water 
pollution, the regulatory authority shall specify methods of treatment 
to control erosion of exposed overburden. The permittee shall--
    (i) Remove separately the entire A horizon or other suitable soil 
materials which will create a final soil having an equal or greater 
productive capacity than that which existed prior to mining in a manner 
that prevents mixing or contamination with other material before 
replacement;
    (ii) Remove separately the B horizon of the natural soil or a 
combination of B horizon and underlying C horizon or other suitable soil 
material that will create a reconstructed root zone of equal or greater 
productivity capacity than that which existed prior to mining in a 
manner that prevents mixing or contamination with other material; and
    (iii) Remove separately the underlying C horizons or other strata, 
or a combination of such horizons or other strata, to be used instead of 
the B horizon that are of equal or greater thickness and that can be 
shown to be equal or more favorable for plant growth than the B horizon, 
and that when replaced will create in the reconstructed soil a final 
root zone of comparable depth and quality to that which existed in the 
natural soil.
    (2) If stockpiling of soil horizons is allowed by the regulatory 
authority in lieu of immediate replacement, the A horizon and B horizon 
must be stored separately from each other. The stockpiles must be placed 
within the permit area and where they will not be disturbed or exposed 
to excessive erosion by water or wind before the stockpiled horizons can 
be redistributed on terrain graded to final contour. Stockpiles in place 
for more than 30 days must meet the requirements of Sec. 715.16(c).
    (3) Scarify the final graded land before the soil horizons are 
replaced.
    (4) Replace the material from the B horizon, or other suitable 
material specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) or (g)(1)(iii) of this 
section in such a manner as to avoid excessive compaction of overburden 
and to a thickness comparable to the root zone that existed in the soil 
before mining.
    (5) Replace the A horizon or other suitable soil materials, which 
will create a final soil having an equal or greater productive capacity 
than existed prior to mining, as the final surface soil layer to the 
thickness of the original soil as determined in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of 
this section in a manner that--
    (i) Prevents excess compaction of both the surface layer and 
underlying material and reduction of permeability to less than 0.06 inch 
per hour in the upper 20 inches of the reconstructed soil profile; and
    (ii) Protects the surface layer from wind and water erosion before 
it is seeded or planted.
    (6) Apply nutrients and soil amendments as needed to establish quick 
vegetative growth.

information collection requirements contained in 30 CFR part 717 do not 
require approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

[59 FR 43420, Aug. 23, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 717.11  General obligations.

    (a) Compliance. All underground coal mining and associated 
reclamation operations conducted on lands where any element of the 
operations is regulated by a State shall comply with the initial 
performance standards of this part according to the time schedule 
specified in Sec. 710.11.
    (1) For the purposes of this part, underground coal mining and 
associated reclamation operations mean a combination of surface 
operations and underground operations. Surface operations include 
construction, use, and reclamation of new and existing access and haul 
roads, aboveground repair areas, storage areas, processing areas, 
shipping areas, and areas upon which are sited support facilities 
including hoist and ventilating ducts, and on which materials incident 
to underground mining operations are placed. Underground operations 
include underground construction, operation, and reclamation of shafts, 
adits, underground support facilities, underground mining, hauling, 
storage, and blasting.
    (2) For the purpose of this part the term permittee means the person 
permitted to conduct underground mining operations by a State or if no 
permit is issued in the State, the person operating a mine.
    (3) For the purpose of this part, Disturbed areas means surface work 
areas and lands affected by surface operations including, but not 
limited to, roads, mine entry excavations, above ground (surface) work 
areas, such as tipples, coal processing facilities and other operating 
facilities, waste work and spoil disposal areas, and mine waste 
impoundments or embankments.
    (4) Where State environmental protection standards are adopted for a 
specific State because they are more stringent than the standards of 
this part, they will be published in part 718 of this chapter.
    (b) Authorizations to operate. A copy of all current permits, 
licenses, approved plans or other authorizations to operate the mine 
shall be available for inspection at or near the mine site.


<R05>
Sec. 717.12  Signs and markers.

    (a) Specifications. All signs required to be posted shall be of a 
standard design that can be seen and read easily and shall be made of 
durable material, and shall conform to local ordinances and codes. The 
signs and other markers shall be maintained during all operations to 
which they pertain.
    (b) Mine and permit identification signs. Signs identifying the mine 
area shall be displayed at all points of access to the permit area from 
public highways. Signs shall show the name, business address, and 
telephone number of the permittee and identification numbers of current 
mining and reclamation permits or other authorizations to operate. Such 
signs shall not be removed until after release of all bonds.


<R05>
Sec. 717.13  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 717.14  Backfilling and grading of road cuts, mine entry area cuts, 
and other surface work areas.

    (a) Upon completion of underground mining, surface work areas which 
are involved in excavation, disposal of materials, or otherwise 
affected, shall be regraded to approximate original contour. The 
permittee shall transport, backfill and compact fill material to assure 
stability or to prevent leaching of toxic pollutants. Barren rock or 
similar materials excess to the mining operations and which are disposed 
on the land surface shall be subject to the provision of Sec. 717.15 of 
this part. Roads and support facility areas existing prior to the 
effective date of this part and used in support of underground mining 
operations which are subject to this part shall be regraded to the 
extent deemed feasible by the regulatory authority based on the 
availability of

[[Page 98]]

backfill material and resulting stability of the affected lands after 
reclamation. As a minimum, the permittee shall be required to:
    (1) Retain all earth, rock and other mineral nonwaste materials on 
the solid portion of existing or new benches, except that the regulatory 
authority may permit placement of such material at the site of the 
faceup as a means of disposing of excavated spoil when additional 
working space is needed to facilitate operations. Such placement of 
material shall be limited to minimize disturbance of land and to the 
hydrologic balance. Such fills shall be stabilized with vegetation and 
shall achieve a minimum static safety factor of 1.5. In no case shall 
the outslope exceed the angle of repose.
    (2) Backfill and grade to the most moderate slope possible to 
eliminate any highwall along roads, mine entry faces or other areas. 
Slopes shall not exceed the angle of repose or such lesser slopes as 
required by the regulatory authority to maintain stability.
    (b) On approval by the regulatory authority and in order to conserve 
soil moisture, ensure stability, and control erosion on final graded 
slopes, cut-and-fill terraces may be allowed if the terraces are 
appropriate substitutes for construction of lower grades on the 
reclaimed lands. The terraces shall meet the following requirements:
    (1) The width of the individual terrace bench shall not exceed 20 
feet unless specifically approved by the regulatory authority as 
necessary for stability erosion control, or roads.
    (2) The vertical distance between terraces shall be as specified by 
the regulatory authority to prevent excessive erosion and to provide 
long/term stability.
    (3) The slope of the terrace outslope shall not exceed 1v:2h (50 
percent). Outslopes which exceed 1v:2h (50 percent) may be approved if 
they have a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 of more and provide 
adequate control over erosion and closely resemble the surface 
configuration of the land prior to mining. In no case may highwalls be 
left as part of terraces.
    (4) Culverts and underground rock drains shall be used on the 
terrace only when approved by the regulatory authority.
    (c) All surface operations on steep slopes of 20 degrees or more or 
on such lesser slopes as the regulatory authority define as a steep 
slope shall be conducted so as not to place any material on the 
downslope below road cuts, mine working or other benches, other than in 
conformance with paragraph (a)(1) of this part.
    (d) Regrading or stabilizing rills and gullies. When rills or 
gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas tht have been regraded and 
the topsoil replaced but vegetation has not yet been established, the 
permittee shall fill, grade, or otherwise stabilize the rills and 
gullies and reseed or replant the areas according to Sec. 717.20. The 
regulatory authority shall specify that erosional features of lesser 
size be stabilized if they result in additional erosion and 
sedimentation.
    (e) Covering coal and acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible, and 
other waste materials; stabilizing backfilled materials; and using waste 
material for fill. Any acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible 
materials, or any other waste materials as identified by the regulatory 
authority that are exposed, used, or produced during underground mining 
and which are deposited on the land surface shall, after placement in 
accordance with Sec. 717.15 of this part, be covered with a minimum of 
4 feet of nontoxic and noncombustible material; or, if necessary, 
treated to neutralize toxicity, in order to prevent water pollution and 
sustained combustion, and to minimize adverse effects on plant growth 
and land uses. Where necessary to protect against upward migration of 
salts, exposure by erosion, to provide an adequate depth for plant 
growth, or to otherwise meet local conditions, the regulatory authority 
shall specify thicker amount of cover using nontoxic material. Acid-
forming or toxic-forming material shall not be buried or stored in 
proximity to a drainage course so as to cause or pose a threat of water 
pollution or otherwise violate the provisions of Sec. 717.17 of this 
part.
    (f) Grading along the contour. All final grading, preparation of 
earth, rock and other nonwaste materials before replacement of topsoil, 
and placement of

[[Page 99]]

topsoil in accordance with Sec. 717.20, shall be done along the contour 
to minimize subsequent erosion and instability. If such grading, 
preparation or placement along the contour would be hazardous to 
equipment operators, grading, preparation or placement in a direction 
other than generally parallel to the contour may be used. In all cases, 
grading, preparation or placement shall be conducted in a manner which 
minimizes erosion and provides a surface for replacement of topsoil 
which will minimize slippage.


<R05>
Sec. 717.15  Disposal of excess rock and earth materials on surface areas.

    Excess rock and earth materials produced from an underground mine 
and not disposed in underground workings or used in backfilling and 
grading operations shall be placed in surface disposal areas in 
accordance with requirements of Sec. 715.15. Where the volume of such 
material is small and its chemical and physical characteristics do not 
pose a threat to either public safety or the environment, the regulatory 
authority may modify the requirements of Sec. 715.15 in accordance with 
Sec. 717.14(a)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 717.16  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 717.17  Protection of the hydrologic system.

    The permittee shall plan and conduct underground coal mining and 
reclamation operations to minimize disturbance of the prevailing 
hydrologic balance in order to prevent long-term adverse changes in the 
hydrologic balance that could result from underground coal mining 
operations, both on and off site. changes in water quality and quantity, 
in the depth to ground water, and in the location of surface water 
drainage channels shall be minimized and applicable Federal and State 
statutes and regulations shall not be violated. The permittee shall 
conduct operations so as to minimize water pollution and shall, where 
necessary, use treatment methods to control water pollution. The 
permittee shall emphasize underground coal mining and reclamation 
practices that will prevent or minimize water pollution and changes in 
flows in preference to the use of water treatment facilities prior to 
discharge to surface waters. Practices to control and minimize pollution 
include, but are not limited to, diverting water from underground 
workings or preventing water contact with acid- or toxic-forming 
materials, and minimizing water contact time with waste materials, 
maintaining mine barriers to enhance postmining inundation and sealing, 
establishing disturbed areas through grading, diverting runoff, 
achieving quick growing stands of temporary vegetation, and lining 
drainage channels. If treatment is required to eliminate pollution of 
surface or ground waters, the permittee shall operate and maintain the 
necessary water treatment facilities as set forth in this section.
    (a) Water quality standards and effluent limitations. (1) All 
surface drainage from the disturbed area, including disturbed areas that 
have been graded, seeded or planted and which remain subject to the 
requirements of this section, except for drainage from disturbed areas 
that have met the requirements of Sec. 717.20 shall be passed through a 
sedimentation pond or a series of sedimentation ponds prior to leaving 
the permit area. All waters which flow or are removed from underground 
operations or underground waters which are removed from other areas to 
facilitate mining and which discharge to surface waters must be passed 
through appropriate treatment facilities prior to discharge where 
necessary to meet effluent limitations.
    (2) For purposes of this section only, disturbed areas shall include 
areas of surface operations but shall not include those areas in which 
only diversion ditches, sedimentation ponds, or roads are installed in 
accordance with this section and the upstream area is not otherwise 
disturbed by the permittee. Disturbed areas shall not include those 
surface areas overlying the underground working unless those areas are 
also disturbed by surface operations such as fill (disposal) areas, 
support facilities areas, or other major activities which create a risk 
of pollution.
    (3) The regulatory authority may grant exemptions from this 
requirement only when the disturbed drainage

[[Page 100]]

area within the total disturbed area is small and if the permittee shows 
that sedimentation ponds are not necessary to meet effluent limitations 
of this paragraph and to maintain water quality in downstream receiving 
waters. Sedimentation ponds required by this paragraph shall be 
constructed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section in 
appropriate locations prior to any mining in the affected drainage area 
in order to control sedimentation or otherwise treat water in accordance 
with this paragraph. Discharges from areas disturbed by underground 
operation and by surface operation and reclamation activities conducted 
thereon, must meet all applicable Federal and State regulations and, at 
a minimum, the following numerical effluent limitations:

    Effluent Limitations, in Milligrams Per Liter, mg/l Except for pH
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Average of
                                                                daily
                                                  Maximum     values for
           Effluent characteristics              allowable        30

                                                              discharge
                                                               days \1\

pH \3\........................................        (\4\)        (\4\)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Based on representative sampling.
\2\ In Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South
  Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, total suspended solids limitations will be
  determined on a case-by-case basis, but they must not be greater than
  45/mg/l (maximum allowable) and 30 mg/l (average of daily value for 30
  consecutive discharge days) based on a representative sampling.
\3\ Where the application of neutralization and sedimentation treatment
  technology results in inability to comply with the manganese
  limitations set forth, the regulatory authority may allow the pH level
  in the discharge to exceed to a small extent the upper limit of 9.0 in
  order that the manganese limitations will be achieved.
\4\ Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.

    (i) Any overflow or other discharge of surface water from the 
disturbed area within the permit area demonstrated by the permittee to 
result from a precipitation event larger than the 10-year 24-hour 
frequency event will not be subject to the effluent limitations of 
paragraph (a).
    (ii) The permittee shall install, operate, and maintain adequate 
facilities to treat any water discharged from the disturbed area that 
violates applicable Federal or State regulations or the limitations of 
paragraph (a). If the pH of waters to be discharged from the disturbed 
area is normally less than 6.0, an automatic lime feeder or other 
neutralization process approved by the regulatory authority shall be 
installed, operated, and maintained. If the regulatory authority finds 
that small and infrequent treatment requirements to meet applicable 
standards do not necessitate use of an automatic neutralization process, 
and the mine normally produces less than 500 tons of coal per day, the 
regulatory authority can approve the use of a manual system if the 
permittee agrees to insure that consistent and timely treatment is 
carried out.
    (iii) The effluent limitations for manganese shall be applicable 
only to acid drainage.
    (b) Surface water monitoring. (1) The permittee shall submit for 
approval by the regulatory authority a surface water monitoring program 
which meets the following requirements:
    (i) Provides adequate monitoring of all discharge from the disturbed 
area and from the underground operations.
    (ii) Provides adequate data to describe the likely daily and 
seasonal variation in discharges from the disturbed area in terms of 
flow, pH, total iron, total manganese, and total suspended solids and, 
as requested by the regulatory authority, any other parameter 
characteristic of the discharge.
    (iii) Provides monitoring at appropriate frequencies to measure 
normal and abnormal variations in concentration.
    (iv) Provides an analytical quality control system including 
standard methods of analysis such as those specified in 40 CFR part 136.
    (v) Within sixty (60) days of the end of each sixty (60) day sample 
collection period, a report of all samples shall be made to the 
regulatory authority, unless the discharge for which water monitoring 
reports are required is subject to regulation by a National Pollution 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued in compliance with 
the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. 1251--1378), (A) which includes 
equivalent reporting requirements, and (B) which requires filing of the 
water monitoring reports within 90 days or less of sample collection.

For such discharges, the reporting requirements of this paragraph may be

[[Page 101]]

satisfied by submitting to the regulatory authority on the same time 
schedule as required by the NPDES permit or within ninety (90) days 
following sample collection, whichever is earlier, either (1) a copy of 
the completed reporting form filed to meet the NPDES permit 
requirements, or (2) a letter identifying the State or Federal 
government official with whom the reporting form was filed to meet the 
NPDES permit requirements and the date of filing. In all cases in which 
analytical results of the sample collections indicate a violation of a 
permit condition or applicable standard has occurred, the operator shall 
notify the regulatory authority immediately. Where an NPDES permit 
effluent limitation requirement has been violated, the permittee should 
forward a copy of the Discharge Monitoring Report, EPA Form 3320-1, 
concurrently with notification of the violation.
    (2) Equipment, structures, or other measures necessary to accurately 
measure and sample the quality and quantity of surface water discharges 
from the disturbed area of the permit area shall be properly installed, 
maintained and operated and shall be removed when no longer required.
    (c) Diversion and conveyance of overland flow away from disturbed 
areas. In order to minimize erosion and to prevent or remove water from 
contacting toxic-producing deposits, overland flow from undisturbed 
areas may, as required or approved by the regulatory authority, be 
diverted away from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent 
diversion structures. The following requirements shall be met for such 
diversions:
    (1) Temporary diversion structures shall be constructed to safely 
pass the peak runoff from a precipitation event with a one year 
recurrence interval, or a larger event as specified by the regulatory 
authority. The design criteria must assure adequate protection of the 
environment and public during the existence of the temporary diversion 
structure.
    (2) Permanent diversion structures are those remaining after mining 
and reclamation and approved for retention by the regulatory authority 
and other appropriate State and Federal agencies. To protect fills and 
property, to prevent water from contacting toxic-producing deposits, and 
to avoid danger to public health and safety, permanent diversion 
structures shall be constructed to safely pass the peak runoff from a 
precipitation event with a 100-year recurrence interval or a larger 
event as specified by the regulatory authority. Permanent diversion 
structures shall be constructed with gently sloping banks that are 
stabilized by vegetation. Asphalt, concrete, or other similar linings 
shall not be used unless specifically required to prevent seepage or to 
provide stability and they are approved by the regulatory authority.
    (3) Diversions shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in a 
manner so as to prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to 
streamflow, or to runoff outside the permit area to the extent possible, 
using the best technology currently available. In no event shall such 
contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable State or 
Federal law. Appropriate sediment control measures for these diversions 
shall include, but not be limited to, maintenance of appropriate 
gradients, channel lining, vegetation, and roughness structures and 
detention basins.

inflow from the underground mine.
    (4) Dewatering. The water storage resulting from inflow shall be 
removed by a nonclogging dewatering device or a conduit spillway 
approved by the regulatory authority. The dewatering device shall not be 
located at a lower elevation than the maximum elevation of the 
sedimentation storage volume.
    (5) Each person who conducts underground mining activities shall 
design, construct, and maintain sedimentation ponds to prevent short-
circuiting to the extent possible.
    (6) The design, construction, and maintenance of a sedimentation 
pond or other sediment control measures in accordance with this section 
shall not relieve the person from compliance with applicable effluent 
limitations as contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (7) There shall be no out-flow through the emergency spillway during 
the passage of the runoff resulting from the 10-year, 24-hour 
precipitation events and lesser events through the sedimentation pond, 
regardless of the volume of water and sediment present from the 
underground mine during the runoff.
    (8) Sediment shall be removed from sedimentation ponds.
    (9) An appropriate combination of principal and emergency spillways 
shall be provided to discharge safely the runoff from a 25-year, 24-hour

the crest of the emergency spillway shall be a Minimum of 1.0 foot above 
the crest of the principal spillway. Emergency spillway grades and 
allowable velocities shall be approved by the regulatory authority.
    (10) The minimum elevation of the top of the settled embankment 
shall be 1.0 foot above the water surface in the pond with the emergency 
spillway flowing at design depth. For embankments subject to settlement, 
this 1.0 foot minimum elevation requirement shall apply at all times, 
including the period after settlement.
    (11) The constructed height of the dam shall be increased a minimum 
of 5 percent over the design height to allow for settlement, unless it 
has been demonstrated to the regulatory authority that the material used 
and the design will ensure against all settlement.
    (12) The minimum top width of the embankment shall not be less than 
the quotient of (H+35)/5, where H, in feet, is the height of the 
embankment as measured from the upstream toe of the embankment.
    (13) The combined upstream and downstream side slopes of the settled 
embankment shall not be less than 1v:5h, with neither slope steeper than 
1v:2h, Slopes shall be designed to be stable in all cases, even if 
flatter side slopes are required.

shall be conducted as specified in the design approved by the regulatory 
authority.
    (17) If a sedimentation pond has an embankment that is more than 20 
feet in height, as measured from the upstream top of the embankment to 
the crest of the emergency spillway, or has a storage volume of 20 acre-
feet or more, the following additional requirements shall be met:
    (i) An appropriate combination of principal and emergency spillways 
shall be provided to safely discharge the runoff resulting from a 100-
year, 24-hour precipitation event, or a larger event specified by the 
regulatory authority, plus any in-flow from the underground mine.
    (ii) The embankment shall be designed and constructed with an 
acceptable static safety factor of at least 1.5, or a higher safety 
factor as designated by the regulatory authority to ensure stability.

[[Page 103]]

    (iii) Appropriate barriers shall be provided to control seepage 
along conduits that extend through the embankment.
    (iv) The criteria of the Mine Safety and Health Administration as 
published in 30 CFR 77.216 shall be met.
    (18) Each pond shall be designed and inspected during construction 
under the supervision of, and certified after construction by, a 
registered professional engineer.
    (19) The entire embankment including the surrounding areas disturbed 
by construction shall be stabilized with respect to erosion by a 
vegetative cover or other means immediately after the embankment is 
completed. The active upstream face of the embankment where water is 
being impounded may be riprapped or otherwise stabilized. Areas in which 
the vegetation is not successful or where rills and guillies develop 
shall be repaired and revegetated, in accordance with Sec. 717.20.
    (20) All ponds, including those not meeting the size or other 
criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a), shall be examined for structural weakness, 
erosion, and other hazardous conditions and reports and notifications 
shall be made to the regulatory authority, in accordance with 30 CFR 
77.216-3. With the approval of the regulatory authority, dams not 
meeting these criteria (30 CFR 77.216(a)) shall be examined four times 
per year.
    (21) Sedimentation ponds shall not be removed until the disturbed 
area has been restored and the vegetation requirements of Sec. 715.20 
are met and the drainage entering the pond has met the applicable State 
and Federal water quality requirements for the receiving stream. When 
the sedimentation pond is removed, the affected land shall be regraded 
and revegetated in accordance with Sec. Sec. 717.14 and 717.20, unless 
the pond has been approved by the regulatory authority for retention as 
compatible with the approved post-mining land use paragraph (k) of this 
section. If the regulatory authority approves retention, the 
sedimentation pond shall meet all the requirements for permanent 
impoundments of paragraph (k).
    (22)(i) Where surface mining activities are proposed to be conducted 
on steep slopes, as defined in Sec. 716.2 of this chapter, special 
sediment control measures may be followed if the person has demonstrated 
to the regulatory authority that a sedimentation pond (or series of 
ponds) constructed according to paragraph (e) of this section--
    (A) Will jeopardize public health or safety; or
    (B) Will result in contributions of suspended solids to streamflow 
in excess of the incremental sediment volume trapped by the additional 
pond size required.
    (ii) Special sediment control measures shall include but not be 
limited to--
    (A) Designing, constructing, and maintaining a sedimentation pond as 
near as physically possible to the disturbed area which complies with 
the design criteria of this section to the maximum extent possible.
    (B) A plan and commitment to employ sufficient onsite sedimentation 
control measures including bench sediment storage, filtration by natural 
vegetation, mulching, and prompt revegetation which, in conjunction with 
the required sediment pond, will achieve and maintain applicable 
effluent limitations. The plan submitted pursuant to this paragraph 
shall include a detailed description of all onsite control measures to 
be employed, a quantitative analysis demonstrating that onsite 
sedimentation control measures, in conjunction with the required 
sedimentation pond, will achieve and maintain applicable effluent 
limitations, and maps depicting the location of all onsite sedimentation 
control measures.
    (f) Discharge structures. Discharges from sedimentation ponds and 
diversion structures shall be controlled, where necessary, using energy 
dissipators, surge ponds, and other devices to reduce erosion and 
prevent deepening or enlargement of stream channels and to minimize 
disturbances to the hydrologic balance.
    (g) Acid and toxic materials. Drainage to ground and surface waters 
which emanates from acid-forming or toxic-forming mine waste materials 
and spoils placed on the land surface shall be avoided by--

[[Page 104]]

    (1) Identifying, burying, and treating where necessary, spoil or 
other materials that, in the judgment of the regulatory authority, will 
be toxic to vegetation or that will adversely affect water quality if 
not treated or buried. Such material shall be disposed in accordance 
with the provision of Sec. 717.14(e);
    (2) Preventing or removing water from contact with toxic-producing 
deposits;
    (3) Burying or otherwise treating all toxic or harmful materials 
within 30 days if such materials are subject to wind and water erosion, 
or within a lesser period designated by the regulatory authority. If 
storage of such materials is approved, the materials shall be placed on 
impermeable material and protected from erosion and contact with surface 
water. Coal waste ponds and other coal waste materials shall be 
maintained according to paragraph (g)(4) of this section and Sec. 
717.18 shall apply;
    (4) Burying or otherwise treating waste materials from coal 
preparation plants no later than 90 days after the cessation of the 
filling of the disposal area. Burial or treatment shall be in accordance 
with Sec. 717.14(e) of this part;
    (5) Casing, sealings, or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, 
wells, and auger holes or other more or less horizontal holes to prevent 
pollution of surface or ground water and to prevent mixing of ground 
waters of significantly different quality. All boreholes that are within 
the permit area but are outside the surface coal mining area or which 
extend beneath the coal to be mined and into water-bearing strata shall 
be plugged permanently in a manner approved by the regulatory authority, 
unless boreholes have been approved for use in monitoring.
    (h) Ground water systems. (1) Underground operations shall be 
conducted to minimize adverse effects on ground water flow and quality, 
and to minimize offsite effects. The permittee will be responsible for 
performing monitoring according to paragraph (h)(2) of this section to 
ensure operations conform to this requirement.
    (2) Ground water levels, subsurface flow and storage 
characteristics, and the quality of ground water shall be monitored in a 
manner approved by the regulatory authority to determine the effects of 
underground coal mining operations on the quantity and quality of water 
in ground water systems at the mine area and in associated offsite 
areas. When operations are conducted in such a manner that may affect 
the ground water system, ground water levels and ground water quality 
shall be periodically monitored using wells which can adequately reflect 
changes in ground water quantity and quality resulting from such 
operations. Sufficient water wells must be used by the permittee. The 
regulatory authority may require drilling and development of additional 
wells if needed to adequately monitor the ground water system. As 
specified and approved by the regulatory authority, additional 
hydrologic tests, such as aquifer tests, must be undertaken by the 
permittee to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section.
    (i) Water rights and replacement. The permittee shall replace the 
water supply of an owner of interest in real property who obtains all or 
part of his supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or 
other legitimate use from an underground or surface source where such 
supply has been affected by contamination, diminution, or interruption 
proximately resulting from surface coal mine operation by the permittee.
    (j) Hydrologic impact of roads. (1) General. Access and haul roads 
and associated bridges, culverts, ditches, and road rights-of-way shall 
be constructed, maintained, and reclaimed so as to the extent possible, 
using the best technology currently available, prevent additional 
contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff outside 
the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology 
currently available. In no event shall the contributions be in excess of 
requirements set by applicable State or Federal law. All haul and access 
roads shall be removed and the land affected shall be regraded and 
revegetated consistent with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 717.14 and 
717.20, unless retention of a road is approved and assured of necessary 
maintenance to adequately control erosion.

[[Page 105]]

    (2) Construction. (i) All roads, insofar as possible, shall be 
located on ridges or on flatter and more stable slopes to minimize 
erosion. Stream fords are prohibited unless they are specifically 
approved by the regulatory authority as temporary routes across dry 
streams that will not adversely affect sedimentation and that will not 
be used for coal haulage. Other stream crossings shall be made using 
bridges, culverts, or other structures designed and constructed to meet 
the requirements of this paragraph. Roads shall not be located in active 
stream channels nor shall they be constructed or maintained in a manner 
that increases erosion or causes significant sedimentation or flooding. 
However, nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prohibit 
relocation of stream channels in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (ii) In order to minimize erosion and subsequent disturbances of the 
hydrologic balance, roads shall be constructed in compliance with the 
following grade restrictions or other grades determined by the 
regulatory authority to be necessary to control erosion:
    (A) The overall sustained grade shall not exceed 1v:10h (10 
percent).
    (B) The maximum grade greater than 10 percent shall not exceed 
1v:6.5h (15 percent) for more than 300 feet.
    (C) There shall not be more than 300 feet of grade exceeding 10 
percent within each 1,000 feet.
    (iii) All access and haul roads shall be adequately drained using 
structures such as, but not limited to, ditches, water barriers, cross 
drains, and ditch relief drains. For access and haul roads that are to 
be maintained for more than 1 year, water-control structures shall be 
designed with a discharge capacity capable of passing the peak runoff 
from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event. Drainage pipes and culverts 
shall be constructed to avoid plugging or collapse and erosion at inlets 
and outlets. Drainage ditches shall be provided at the toe of all cut 
slopes formed by construction of roads. Trash racks and debris basis 
shall be installed in the drainage ditches wherever debris from the 
drainage area could impair the functions of drainage and sediment 
control structures. Ditch relief and cross drains shall be spaced 
according to grade. Effluent limitations of paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not apply to drainage from access and haul roads located 
outside the disturbed area as defined in this section unless otherwise 
specified by the regulatory authority.
    (iv) Access and haul roads shall be surfaced with durable material. 
Toxic- or acid-forming substances shall not be used. Vegetation may be 
cleared only for the essential width necessary for road and associated 
ditch construction and to serve traffic roads.
    (3) Maintenance. (i) Access and haul roads shall be routinely 
maintained by means such as, but not limited to, wetting, scraping, or 
surfacing.
    (ii) Ditches, culverts, drains, trash racks, debris basins, and 
other structures serving to drain access and haul roads shall not be 
restricted or blocked in any manner that impedes drainage or adversely 
affects the intended purpose of the structure.
    (4) Access roads constructed for and used only to provide infrequent 
service to surface facilities, such as ventilators or monitoring devices 
shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section provided adequate stabilization to control erosion is achieved 
through use of alternative measures.
    (k) Hydrologic impacts of other transport facilities. Railroad 
loops, spurs, conveyors, or other transport facilities shall be 
constructed, maintained, and reclaimed to prevent additional 
contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff outside 
the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology 
currently available and to control other diminution or degradation of 
water quality and quantity. In no event shall contributions be in excess 
of requirements set by applicable State or Federal law.

[[Page 106]]

    (l) Discharge of waters into underground mines. Surface and ground 
waters shall not be discharged or diverted into underground mine 
workings.

conditions of construction and operation of the impoundment. Sufficient 
foundation investigations and laboratory testing shall be performed to 
determine the factors of safety of the dam for all loading conditions in 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and for all increments of 
construction.
    (v) Seepage through the dam, foundation, and abutments shall be 
controlled to prevent excessive uplift pressures, internal erosion, 
sloughing, removal of material by solution, or erosion of material by 
loss into cracks, joints, and cavities. This may require the use of 
impervious blankets, pervious drainage zones or blankets, toe drains, 
relief wells, or dental concreting of jointed rock surface in contact 
with embankment materials.
    (vi) Allowances shall be made for settlement of the dams and the 
foundation so that the freeboard will be maintained.
    (vii) Impoundments created by dams of waste materials shall be 
subject to a minimum drawdown criteria that allows the facility to be 
evacuated by spillways or decants of 90 percent of the volume of water 
stored during the design precipitation event within 10 days.

of Sec. 77.216(a) of this title, shall be routinely inspected by a 
registered professional engineer, or someone under the supervision of a 
registered professional engineer, in accordance with Mining Enforcement, 
and Safety Administration regulations pursuant to Sec. 77.216-3 of this 
title.
    (5) All dams shall be routinely maintained. Vegetative growth shall 
be cut where necessary to facilitate inspection and repairs. Ditches and 
spillways shall be cleaned. Any combustible materials present on the 
surface, other than that used for surface stability such as mulch or dry 
vegetation, shall be removed and any other appropriate maintenance 
procedures followed.
    (6) All dams subject to this section shall be recertified annually 
as having been constructed and modified in accordance with current 
prudent enginnering practices to minimize the possibility of failures. 
Any changes in the geometry of the impounding structure shall be 
highlighted and included in the annual recertification report. These 
certifications shall include a report on existing and required 
monitoring procedures and instrumentation, the average and maximum 
depths and elevations of any impounded waters over the past year, 
existing storage capacity of impounding structures, any fires occurring

<R05>
Sec. 717.20  Topsoil handling and revegetation.

    (a) Topsoil shall be removed as a separate operation from areas to 
be disturbed by surface operations, such as roads and areas upon which 
support facilities are to be sited. Selected overburden materials may be 
used instead of, or as a substitute for topsoil where the resulting soil 
medium is determined by the regulatory authority to be equal to or more 
suitable for reveg etation. Topsoil shall be segregated, stockpiled, and 
protected from wind and water erosion, or contaminants. Disturbed areas 
no longer required for the conduct of mining operations shall be 
regraded, topsoil distributed, and revegetated.
    (b) The permittee shall establish on all land that has been 
disturbed by mining operations a diverse, effective, and permanent 
vegetative cover capable of self-regeneration and plant succession, and 
adequate to control soil erosion. Introduced species may be substituted 
for native species if approved by the regulatory authority. Introduced 
species shall meet applicable State and Federal seed or introduced 
species statutes, and may not include poisonous or potentially toxic 
species.

operations subject to regulation under the Act--
    (a) On the basis of not less than two consecutive State inspection 
reports indicating a violation of the Act, regulations or permit 
conditions required by the Act;
    (b) On the basis of information provided by a State or any person 
which gives rise to a reasonable belief that the provisions of the Act, 
regulations or permit conditions required by the Act are being violated, 
or that a condition or practice exists which creates an imminent danger 
to the health or safety of the public, or is causing or can reasonably 
be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, 
air, or water resources; and
    (c) On a random basis of at least one complete inspection each 6 
months. A complete inspection is an onsite review of the operator's 
compliance with all applicable standards in these regulations within the 
entire area disturbed or affected by mining.


<R05>
Sec. 721.12  Right of entry.

    (a) Authorized representatives of the Secretary, without advance 
notice and upon presentation of appropriate credentials and without a 
search warrant, shall have the right of entry to, upon, or through any 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations or any premises in which 
any records required to be maintained are located.
    (b) The authorized representatives may at reasonable times, and 
without delay, have access to and copy any records, and inspect any 
monitoring equipment or method of operation required under this Act, the 
regulations or the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 721.13  Inspections based on citizen requests.

    (a) Citizens reports. (1) Any person who believes that there is a 
violation of the Act, regulations or permit conditions rquired by the 
Act or that any imminent danger or harm exists may report this 
information to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. 
Written reports must be signed and include a phone number where the 
reporting party can be contacted. Oral reports will be accepted but must 
be followed by a written and signed statement including the information 
reported. The complaint or other information shall be considered as 
having a reasonable basis if it alleges facts which, if proven to be 
true, would be sufficient to show a violation of the Act, regulations or 
permit. Unless the Office has reason to believe that the information is 
incorrect, or determines that even if true it would not constitute a 
violation, the Office shall conduct an inspection within 15 days of 
receipt of the complaint. If the complaint alleges an imminent danger or 
harm, the inspection shall be conducted promptly.
    (2) The identity of any person supplying information to the Office 
relating to possible violations or imminent dangers or harms shall 
remain confidential with the Office, if requested by the person 
supplying the information, unless disclosure is required under the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or by other Federal law.
    (b) Right to accompany the authorized representative of the 
Secretary. (1) If a Federal inspection is conducted as a result of 
information provided to the Office, the person who provided the 
information shall be notified when the inspection is to occur and the 
person will be allowed to accompany the authorized representative of the 
Secretary during the inspection.
    (2) Any person accompanying an authorized representative of the 
Secretary has a right of entry to, upon and through the mining and 
reclamation operations about which he supplied information, only if he 
is in the presence of and is under the control, direction and 
supervision of the authorized representative while on the mine property.
    (c) Notification of results of investigation. Within 10 days of the 
inspection or, if no inspection, within 15 days of the complaint, the 
Office shall notify the person in writing of the following--
    (1) The results of the investigation, including a description of any 
inspection which occurred and any enforcement action taken; copies of 
Federal inspection reports, notices of violation, and cessation orders 
may be forwarded to the person in satisfaction of this requirement;

[[Page 109]]

    (2) If no inspection was conducted, an explanation of the reason for 
not inspecting;
    (3) A statement as to the person's right to informal review of the 
actions or inactions of the Office.
    (4) The permittee shall receive copies of all such reports which 
have not already been given to the permittee, except that the name of 
the complainant shall be removed.
    (d) Review of action of local offices. A person who does not agree 
with the action taken by the Office on their report may request the 
Regional Director to review the complaint and actions taken. The 
Regional Director shall advise the person in writing, within 30 days of 
the results of the review. Informal review under this subsection shall 
not affect any rights to formal review or a citizen's suit.


<R05>
Sec. 721.14  Failure to give notice and lack of reasonable belief.

    No notice of violation or cessation order may be vacated by reason 
of failure to give notice required by the Act or these regulations prior 
to the inspection; or by reason of a subsequent determination that prior 
to the inspection the Office did not have information sufficient to 
create a reasonable belief that a violation had occurred.

<R05>
Sec. 722.1  Scope.

    The regulations of this part set forth general procedures governing 
issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and orders to 
show cause under section 521 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 722.11  Imminent dangers and harms.

    (a) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds 
conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or 
any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory 
program, which create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the 
public, the authorized representative shall immediately order a 
cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or that 
portion of the operation relevant to the condition, practice, or 
violation.
    (b) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds 
conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or 
any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory 
program, which are causing, or can reasonably be expected to cause, 
significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water 
resources, the authorized representative shall immediately order a 
cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or that 
portion of the operation relevant to the condition, practice, or 
violation.
    (c) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted by any 
person without a valid surface coal mining permit required by this 
subchapter constitute a condition or practice which causes or can 
reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm 
to land, air or water resources, unless such operations are an integral, 
uninterrupted extension of previously permitted operations, and the 
person conducting such operations has filed a timely and complete 
application for a permit to conduct such operations.
    (d) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall impose 
affirmative obligations on an operator which the authorized 
representative deems necessary to abate the condition, practice, or 
violation if--
    (1) A cessation order is issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section; and
    (2) The cessation of mining or reclamation activities will not 
completely abate the imminent danger or harm or eliminate the practices 
or conditions that contributed to the imminent danger or harm.

[[Page 110]]

    (e) When imposing affirmative obligations under this section, the 
authorized representative of the Secretary shall require abatement of 
the imminent danger or harm in the most expeditious manner physically 
possible. The affirmative obligation shall include a time by which 
abatement shall be accomplished and may include, among other things, the 
use of existing or additional personnel and equipment.
    (f) Reclamation operations not directly the subject of the order or 
affirmative obligation shall continue during any cessation order.
    (g) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a 
cessation order issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section by 
written notice when the authorized representative determines that the 
conditions or practices or violations that contributed to the imminent 
danger to life or the environment have been eliminated.

[42 FR 62701, Dec. 13, 1977, as amended at 45 FR 67501, Oct. 10, 1980; 
47 FR 18558, Apr. 29, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 722.12  Non-imminent dangers or harms.

    (a) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds 
conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or 
of any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim 
regulatory program, but such violations do not create an imminent danger 
to the health or safety of the public, or are not causing and cannot 
reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm 
to land, air, or water resources, the authorized representative shall 
issue a notice of violation fixing a reasonable time for abatement.
    (b) An authorized representative of the Secretary may extend the 
time to abate a violation by written notice if the failure to abate 
within the time set was not caused by the permittee's lack of diligence.
    (c) An authorized representative of the Secretary may establish 
interim steps in an abatement period. If the permittee fails to meet any 
interim step within the time set, the authorized representative may 
extend the time set for meeting the interim step, in accordance with 
this section, or may issue a cessation order pursuant to Sec. 722.13 of 
this part.
    (d) The total time for abatement as originally fixed and 
subsequently extended shall not exceed 90 days except upon a showing by 
the permittee that it is not feasible to abate the violation within 90 
calendar days due to one or more of the circumstances in Sec. 
722.12(e). An extended abatement date pursuant to this section shall not 
be granted when the permittee's failure to abate within 90 days has been 
caused by a lack of diligence or intentional delay by the permittee in 
completing the remedial action required.
    (e) Circumstances which may qualify a surface coal mining operation 
for an abatement period of more than 90 days are:
    (1) Where the permittee of an ongoing permitted operation has timely 
applied for and diligently pursued a permit renewal or other necessary 
approval of designs or plans but such permit or approval has not been or 
will not be issued within 90 days after a valid permit expires or is 
required, for reasons not within the control of the permittee;
    (2) Where there is a valid judicial order precluding abatement 
within 90 days as to which the permittee has diligently pursued all 
rights of appeal and as to which he or she has no other effective legal 
remedy;
    (3) Where the permittee cannot abate within 90 days due to a labor 
strike;
    (4) Where climatic conditions preclude abatement within 90 days, or 
where, due to climatic conditions, abatement within 90 days clearly:
    (i) Would cause more environmental harm than it would prevent; or
    (ii) Requires action that would violate safety standards established 
by statute or regulation under the Mine Safety and Health Act.
    (f) Whenever an abatement time in excess of 90 days is permitted, 
interim abatement measures shall be imposed to the extent necessary to 
minimize harm to the public or the environment.
    (g) If any of the conditions in paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) 
exist, the permittee may request the authorized representative to grant 
an abatement period exceeding 90 days. The authorized representative 
shall not grant such an

[[Page 111]]

abatement period without the concurrence of the Director or his or her 
designee and the abatement period granted shall not exceed the shortest 
possible time necessary to abate the violation. The permittee shall have 
the burden of establishing by clear and convincing proof that he or she 
is entitled to an extension under the provisions of Sec. 722.12 (d) and 
(e). In determining whether or not to grant an abatement period 
exceeding 90 days the authorized representative may consider any 
relevant written or oral information from the permittee or any other 
source. The authorized representative shall promptly and fully document 
in the file his or her reasons for granting or denying the request. The 
inspector's immediate supervisor shall review this document before 
concurring in or disapproving the extended abatement date and shall 
promptly and fully document the reasons for his or her concurrence or 
disapproval in the file.
    (h) Any determination made under paragraph (g) shall be in writing 
and shall contain a right of appeal to the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1281 and the regulations at 43 CFR 
part 4.
    (i) No extension granted under paragraph (b) may exceed 90 days in 
length. Where the condition or circumstance which prevented abatement 
within 90 days exists at the expiration of any such extension, the 
permittee may request a further extension in accordance with the 
procedures of paragraph (g).

<R05>
Sec. 722.13  Failure to abate.

    An authorized representative of the Secretary shall order cessation 
of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, or the portion 
relevant to the violation, when a notice of violation has been issued 
under Sec. 722.12 of this part and the permittee fails to abate the 
violation within the time originally fixed or subsequently extended. In 
a cessation order issued under this section, the authorized 
representative shall impose affirmative obligations to abate the 
violation in the manner provided in Sec. 722.11 of this part. 
Reclamation operations not directly the subject of the order or 
affirmative obligation shall continue during any cessation order. A 
cessation order issued under this section shall be terminated as 
provided in Sec. 722.11 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 722.14  Service of notices of violation, cessation orders, and 
orders to show cause.

    (a) A notice of violation or cessation order shall be served on the 
person to whom it is directed or his designated agent promptly after 
issuance, as follows:
    (1) By tendering a copy at the surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation to the designated agent or to the person to whom it is 
directed. If no such agent is reasonably available, a copy may be 
tendered to the individual who, based upon reasonable inquiry by the 
authorized representative, appears to be in charge of the surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation referred to in the notice or order. If 
no such individual can be located at the site, a copy may be tendered to 
any individual at the site who appears to be an employee or agent of the 
person to whom the notice or order is issued. Service shall be complete 
upon tender of the notice or order and shall not be deemed incomplete 
because of refusal to accept.
    (2) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, service 
may be made by sending a copy of the notice or order by certified mail 
or by hand to the person to whom it is issued or his or her designated 
agent, or by any alternative means consistent with the rules governing 
service of a summons and complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Service shall be complete upon tender of the notice or 
order or of the certified mail and shall not be deemed incomplete 
because of refusal to accept.
    (b) A show cause order, or a vacation, modification or termination 
of a notice or order, may be served on the person to whom it is issued 
in either manner provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Designation by any person of an agent for service of notices and 
orders shall be made in a conspicuous, easy-

[[Page 112]]

to-read manner on the mine identification sign, or on the mine bulletin 
board posted by the minesite office.
    (d) The Office shall furnish copies of notices and orders to the 
State regulatory authority, if any, after their issuance. The Office may 
furnish copies to any person having an interest in the surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation or the permit area, such as the owner 
of the fee, a corporate officer of the permittee, or the bonding 
company.

<R05>
Sec. 722.15  Informal public hearing.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
notice of violation or cessation order which requires cessation of 
mining, expressly or by necessary implication, shall expire within 30 
days after it is served unless an informal public hearing has been held 
within that time. The hearing shall be held at or reasonably close to 
the minesite so that it may be viewed during the hearing or at any other 
location acceptable to the Office and the person to whom the notice or 
order was issued. The Office of Surface Mining office nearest to the 
minesite shall be deemed to be reasonably close to the minesite unless a 
closer location is requested and agreed to by the Office. Expiration of 
a notice or order shall not affect the Office's right to assess civil 
penalties with respect to the period during which the notice or order 
was in effect. No hearing will be required where the condition, practice 
or violation in question has been abated, or the hearing has been 
waived. For purposes of this section only, mining means (1) extracting 
coal from the earth or from coal waste piles and transporting it within 
or from the permit area, and (2) the processing, cleaning, 
concentrating, preparing or loading of coal where such operations occur 
at a place other than at a minesite.
    (b) A notice of violation or cessation order shall not expire as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section if the informal public hearing 
has been waived or if, with the consent of the person to whom the notice 
or order was issued, the informal public hearing is held later than 30 
days after the notice or order was served. For purposes of this section:
    (1) The informal public hearing will be deemed waived if the person 
to whom the notice or order is issued:
    (i) Is informed, by written notice served in the manner provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that he will be deemed to have waived 
an informal public hearing unless he requests one within 30 days after 
service of the notice or order, and
    (ii) Fails to request an informal public hearing within that time.
    (2) The written notice referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall be delivered to such person by an authorized 
representative or sent by certified mail to such person no later than 
five days after the notice or order is served on such person.
    (3) The person to whom the notice or order is issued shall be deemed 
to have consented to an extension of the time for holding the informal 
public hearing if his request is received on or after the 21st day after 
the service of the notice of order. The extension of time shall be equal 
to the number of days elapsed after the 21st day.
    (c) The Office shall give as much advance notice as is practicable 
of the time, place, and subject matter of the informal public hearing 
to:
    (1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
    (2) Any person who filed a report which led to the notice or order; 
and
    (3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
    (d) The Office shall also post notice of the hearing at the regional 
district or field office closest to the minesite, and publish it, where 
practicable, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the 
mine.
    (e) Section 554 of Title 5 of the United States Code, regarding 
requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings, shall not govern the 
conduct of these informal public hearings. An informal public hearing 
shall be conducted by a representative of the Office, who may accept 
oral or written arguments and any other relevant information from any 
person attending.

[[Page 113]]

    (f) Within five business days after the date of the informal public 
hearing, the Office shall affirm, modify, or vacate the notice or order 
in writing and send its decision to:
    (1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
    (2) Any person who filed a report which led to the notice or order; 
and
    (3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
    (g) The granting or waiver of an informal public hearing shall not 
affect the right of any person to formal review under sections 518(b), 
521(a)(4), or 525 of the Act.
    (h) The person conducting the hearing for the Office shall determine 
whether or not the minesite should be viewed during the hearing. In 
making this determination the only consideration shall be whether a view 
of the minesite will assist the person conducting the hearing in 
reviewing the appropriateness of the enforcement action or the required 
remedial action.

<R05>
Sec. 722.16  Pattern of violations.

    (a) The regulations of this section set forth the procedures 
governing the suspension or revocation of State permits and rights to 
mine under this Act based on a pattern of violations arising during 
Federal inspections during the initial regulatory program.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--
    (1) Violations of the same or related requirements of the Act, 
regulations or permit conditions means noncompliance with any single 
section of parts 715, 716, or 717 of this chapter.
    (2) Violations of different requirements of the Act, regulations, or 
permit conditions means noncompliance with different sections of parts 
715, 716, or 717 of this chapter.
    (3) Unwarranted failure to comply means the failure of a permittee 
to prevent the occurrence of any violation of his permit or any 
requirement of the Act or these regulations due to indifference, lack of 
diligence, lack of reasonable care; or the failure to abate any 
violation of such permit, the Act or regulations due to indifference, 
lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable care.
    (4) Willful violation means an intentional action or omission which 
violates the Act, regulations or permit conditions required under the 
Act.
    (5) Inspection as used in this section means any visit to the mine.
    (c) Order to show cause. (1) If the Director determines that a 
pattern of violations of any requirements of the Act, the regulations, 
or a permit condition imposed under the Act or regulations exists, or 
has existed, and that such violations are caused by the unwarranted 
failure of the permittee or were willful violations, the Director shall 
issue an order to the permittee to show cause why the permit should not 
be suspended or revoked.
    (2) The Director may determine that a pattern of violations exists 
or has existed, after considering the circumstances, including--
    (i) The number of willful violations or violations caused by 
unwarranted failure to comply with the same or related requirements of 
the Act, regulations, or permit conditions during two or more Federal 
inspections;
    (ii) The number of willful violations or violations caused by 
unwarranted failure to comply with different requirements of the Act, 
regulations, or permit conditions; and
    (iii) The extent to which the violations were isolated departures 
from lawful conduct.
    (3) Violations of the same or related requirements of the Act, 
regulations, or permit conditions required by the Act during three or 
more Federal inspections within any 12-month period which were either 
caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee to comply with the 
Act, the regulations or permit conditions required by the Act, or were 
willful violations, shall constitute a pattern of violations. A show 
cause order shall issue unless the Director finds that it would not 
further enforcement of the performance standards of the Act.
    (d) Suspension or revocation of permit. (1) The order to show cause 
shall be issued and a public hearing, if requested, shall be conducted 
under the procedures of 43 CFR part 4.

[[Page 114]]

    (2) If the Secretary finds that a pattern of violations exists or 
has existed, the permit and right to mine under this Act shall be either 
suspended or revoked and the permittee directed to complete necessary 
corrective measures and reclamation operations.
    (e) Whenever a permittee fails to abate a violation contained in a 
notice of violation or cessation order within the abatement period set 
in the notice or order or as subsequently extended, the Director shall 
review the permittee's history of violations to determine whether a 
pattern of violations exists pursuant to this section, and shall issue 
an order to show cause as appropriate pursuant to 30 CFR 723.15(b)(2).

Sec. 722.17  Inability to comply.

    (a) Neither a notice of violation nor a cessation order issued under 
this part may be vacated because of inability to comply.
    (b) A permittee may not be deemed to have shown good cause for not 
suspending or revoking a permit by showing inability to comply.
    (c) Unless caused by lack of diligence, inability to comply may be 
considered in mitigation of the amount of a civil penalty under part 723 
of this chapter and of the duration of the suspension of the permit 
under Sec. 722.16 of this part.

Sec. 723.1  Scope.

    This part covers the assessment of civil penalties under section 518 
of the Act for violations of a permit condition, any provision of Title 
V of the Act, or any implementing regulations, except for the assessment 
of individual civil penalties under section 518(f), which is covered by 
part 724. This part governs when a civil penalty is assessed and how the 
amount is determined, and sets forth applicable procedures. This part 
applies to cessation orders and notices of violation issued under part 
722 of this chapter during a Federal inspection.

[53 FR 3674, Feb. 8, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 723.2  Objective.

    Civil penalties are assessed under section 518 of the Act and this 
part to deter violations and to ensure maximum compliance with the terms 
and purpose of the Act on the part of the coal mining industry.


<R05>
Sec. 723.11  How assessments are made.

    The Office shall review each notice of violation and cessation order 
in accordance with the assessment procedures described in Sec. Sec. 
723.12, 723.13, 723.14, 723.15, and 723.16 to determine whether a civil 
penalty will be assessed, the amount of the penalty, and whether each 
day of a continuing violation will be deemed a separate violation for 
purposes of the total penalty assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 723.12  When penalty will be assessed.

    (a) The Office shall assess a penalty for each cessation order.
    (b) The Office shall assess a penalty for each notice of violation, 
if the violation is assigned 31 points or more under the point system 
described in Sec. 723.13.
    (c) The Office may assess a penalty for each notice of violation 
assigned 30 points or less under the point system described in Sec. 
723.13. In determining whether to assess a penalty, the Office

[[Page 115]]

shall consider the factors listed in Sec. 723.13(b).


<R05>
Sec. 723.13  Point system for penalties.

    (a) The Office shall use the point system described in this section 
to determine the amount of the penalty and, in the case of notices of 
violation, whether a mandatory penalty should be assessed as provided in 
Sec. 723.12(b).
    (b) Points shall be assigned as follows:
    (1) History of previous violations. The Office shall assign up to 30 
points based on the history of previous violations. One point shall be 
assigned for each past violation contained in a notice of violations. 
Five points shall be assigned for each violation (but not a condition or 
practice) contained in a cessation order. The history of previous 
violations for the purpose of assigning points, shall be determined and 
the points assigned with respect to a particular surface coal mining 
operation. Points shall be assigned as follows:
    (i) A violation shall not be counted if the notice or order is the 
subject of pending administrative or judicial review or if the time to 
request such review or to appeal any administrative or judicial decision 
has not expired, and thereafter it shall be counted for only one year.
    (ii) No violation for which the notice or order has been vacated 
shall be counted; and
    (iii) Each violation shall be counted without regard to whether it 
led to a civil penalty assessment.
    (2) Seriousness. The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on 
the seriousness of the violation, as follows:
    (i) Probability of occurrence. The Office shall assign up to 15 
points based on the probability of the occurrence of the event which a 
violated standard is designed to prevent. Points shall be assessed 
according to the following schedule:

                        Probability of Occurrence
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
None...........................................................        0
Insignificant..................................................      1-4
Unlikely.......................................................      5-9
Likely.........................................................    10-14
Occurred.......................................................       15
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Extent of potential or actual damage. The Office shall assign 
up to 15 points, based on the extent of the potential or actual damage, 
in terms of area and impact on the public or environment, as follows:
    (A) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed 
to prevent would remain within the permit area, the Office shall assign 
zero to seven points, depending on the duration and extent of the damage 
or impact.
    (B) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed 
to prevent would extend outside the permit area, the Office shall assign 
eight to fifteen points, depending on the duration and extent of the 
damage or impact.
    (iii) Alternative. In the case of a violation of an administrative 
requirement, such as a requirement to keep records, the Office shall, in 
lieu of paragraphs (i) and (ii), assign up to 15 points for seriousness, 
based upon the extent to which enforcement is obstructed by the 
violation.
    (3) Negligence. (i) The Office shall assign up to 25 points based on 
the degree of fault of the person to whom the notice or order was issued 
in causing or failing to correct the violation, condition, or practice 
which led to the notice or order, either through act or omission. Points 
shall be assessed as follows:
    (A) A violation which occurs through no negligence shall be assigned 
no penalty points for negligence;
    (B) A violation which is caused by negligence shall be assigned 12 
points or less, depending on the degree of negligence;
    (C) A violation which occurs through a greater degree of fault than 
negligence shall be assigned 13 to 25 points, depending on the degree of 
fault.
    (ii) In determining the degree of negligence involved in a violation 
and the number of points to be assigned, the following definitions 
apply:
    (A) No negligence means an inadvertent violation which was 
unavoidable by the exercise of reasonable care.
    (B) Negligence means the failure of a permittee to prevent the 
occurrence of any violation of his or her permit or

[[Page 116]]

any requirement of the Act or this chapter due to indifference, lack of 
diligence, or lack of reasonable care, or the failure to abate any 
violation of such permit or the Act due to indifference, lack of 
diligence, or lack of reasonable care.
    (C) A greater degree of fault than negligence means reckless, 
knowing, or intentional conduct.
    (iii) In calculating points to be assigned for negligence, the acts 
of all persons working on the surface coal mining and reclamation site 
shall be attributed to the person to whom the notice or order was 
issued, unless than person establishes that they were acts of deliberate 
sabotage.
    (4) Good faith in attemping to achieve compliance. (i) The Office 
shall add points based on the degree of good faith of the person to whom 
the notice or order was issued in attempting to achieve rapid compliance 
after notification of the violation. Points shall be assigned as 
follows:

                          Degree of Good Faith
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid compliance...........................................    -1 to -10
Normal compliance..........................................            0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The following definitions shall apply under paragraph (b)(4)(i) 
of this section:
    (A) Rapid compliance means that the person to whom the notice or 
order was issued took extraordinary measures to abate the violation in 
the shortest possible time and that abatement was achieved before the 
time set for abatement.
    (B) Normal compliance means the person to whom the notice or order 
was issued abated the violation within the time given for abatement.
    (iii) If the consideration of this criterion is impractical because 
of the length of the abatement period, the assessment may be made 
without considering this criterion and may be reassessed after the 
violation has been abated.


<R05>
Sec. 723.14  Determination of amount of penalty.

    The Office shall determine the amount of any civil penalty by 
converting the total number of points assigned under 30 CFR 723.13 to a 
dollar amount, according to the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<R05>
Sec. 723.15  Assessment of separate violations for each day.

    (a) The Office may assess separately a civil penalty for each day 
from the date of issuance of the notice of violation or cessation order 
to the date set for abatement of the violation. In determining whether 
to make such an assessment, the Office shall consider the factors listed 
in 30 CFR 723.13 and may consider the extent to which the person to whom 
the notice or order was issued gained any economic benefit as a result 
of a failure to comply. For any violation which continues for two or 
more days and which is assigned more than 70 points under 30 CFR 
723.13(b), the Office shall assess a civil penalty for a minimum of two 
separate days.
    (b) In addition to the civil penalty provided for in paragraph (a), 
whenever a violation contained in a notice of violation or cessation 
order has not been abated within the abatement period set in the notice 
or order or as subsequently extended pursuant to section 521(a) of the 
Act, a civil penalty of not less than $925 shall be assessed for each 
day during which such failure to abate continues, except that:
    (1)(i) If suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or 
order is ordered in a temporary relief proceeding under section 525(c) 
of the Act, after a determination that the person to whom the notice or 
order was issued will suffer irreparable loss or damage from the 
application of the requirements, the period permitted for abatement 
shall not end until the date on which the Office of Hearing and Appeals 
issues a final order with respect to the violation in question; and
    (ii) If the person to whom the notice or order was issued initiates 
review proceedings under section 526 of the Act with respect to the 
violation, in which the obligations to abate are suspended by the court 
pursuant to section 526(c) of the Act, the daily assessment of a penalty 
shall not be made for any period before entry of a final order by the 
court.
    (2) Such penalty for the failure to abate a violation shall not be 
assessed for more than 30 days for such violation. If the permittee has 
not abated the violation within the 30-day period, the Office shall take 
appropriate action pursuant to sections 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) or 
521(c) of the Act within 30 days to ensure that abatement occurs or to 
ensure that there will not be a reoccurrence of the failure to abate.

[45 FR 58783, Sept. 4, 1980, as amended at 62 FR 63276, Nov. 28, 1997; 
66 FR 58647, Nov. 21, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 723.16  Waiver of use of formula to determine civil penalty.

    (a) The Director, upon his own initiative or upon written request 
received within 15 days of issuance of a notice of violation or a 
cessation order, may waive the use of formula contained in 30 CFR 723.13 
to set the civil penalty, if he or she determines that, taking into 
account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty 
is demonstrably unjust. However, the Director shall not waive the use of 
the formula or reduce the proposed assessment on the basis of an 
argument that a reduction in the proposed penalty could be used to abate 
violations of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or any 
condition of any permit or exploration approval. The basis for every 
waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the 
case.
    (b) If the Director waives the use of the formula, he or she shall 
use the criteria set forth in 30 CFR 723.13(b) to determine the 
appropriate penalty. When the Director has elected to waive the use of 
the formula, he or she shall give a written explanation of the basis for 
the assessment made to the person to whom the notice or order was 
issued.


<R05>
Sec. 723.17  Procedures for assessment of civil penalties.

    (a) Within 15 days of service of a notice or order, the person to 
whom it was issued may submit written information about the violation to 
the Office and to the inspector who issued the notice of violation or 
cessation order. The Office shall consider any information so submitted 
in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the 
penalty.
    (b) The Office shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment and of 
the

[[Page 118]]

work sheet showing the computation of the proposed assessment on the 
person to whom the notice or order was issued, by certified mail, or by 
any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a 
summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice or order. If a 
copy of the proposed assessment and work sheet or the certified mail is 
tendered at the address of that person set forth in the sign required 
under 30 CFR 715.12(b) or at any address at which that person is in fact 
located, and he or she refuses to accept delivery or to collect such 
documents, the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed to have 
been complied with upon such tender.
    (c) Unless a conference has been requested, the Office shall review 
and reassess any penalty if necessary to consider facts which were not 
reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment 
because of the length of the abatement period. The Office shall serve a 
copy of any such reassessment and of the worksheet showing the 
computation of the reassessment in the manner provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, within 30 days after the date the violation is abated.

[45 FR 58783, Sept. 4, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 28445, June 20, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 723.18  Procedures for assessment conference.

    (a) The Office shall arrange for a conference to review the proposed 
assessment or reassessment, upon written request of the person to whom 
the notice or order was issued, if the request is received within 30 
days from the date the proposed assessment or reassessment is received.
    (b)(1) The Office shall assign a conference officer to hold the 
assessment conference. The assessment conference shall not be governed 
by section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code, regarding 
requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings. The assessment conference 
shall be held within 60 days from the date the conference request is 
received or the end of the abatement period, whichever is later.
    (2) The Office shall post notice of the time and place of the 
conference at the regional, district or field office closest to the mine 
at least 5 days before the conference. Any person shall have a right to 
attend and participate in the conference.
    (3) The conference officer shall consider all relevant information 
on the violation. Within 30 days after the conference is held, the 
conference officer shall either:
    (i) Settle the issues, in which case a settlement agreement shall be 
prepared and signed by the conference officer on behalf of the Office 
and by the person assessed; or
    (ii) Affirm, raise, lower, or vacate the penalty.
    (4) An increase or reduction of a proposed civil penalty assessment 
of more than 25 percent and more than $500 shall not be final and 
binding on the Secretary, until approved by the Director or his 
designee.
    (c) The conference officer shall promptly serve the person assessed 
with a notice of his or her action in the manner provided in 30 CFR 
723.17(b) and shall include a worksheet if the penalty has been raised 
or lowered. The reasons for the conference officer's action shall be 
fully documented in the file.
    (d)(1) If a settlement agreement is entered into, the person 
assessed will be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of 
the violation or penalty in question, except as otherwise expressly 
provided for in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement shall 
contain a clause to this effect.
    (2) If full payment of the amount specified in the settlement 
agreement is not received by the Office within 30 days after the date of 
signing, the Office may enforce the agreement or rescind it and proceed 
according to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days from 
the date of the rescission.
    (e) The conference officer may terminate the conference when he 
determines that the issues cannot be resolved or that the person 
assessed is not diligently working toward resolution of the issues.

[[Page 119]]


<R05>
Sec. 723.19  Request for hearing.

    (a) The person charged with the violation may contest the proposed 
penalty or the fact of the violation by submitting a petition and an 
amount equal to the proposed penalty or, if a conference has been held, 
the reassessed or affirmed penalty to the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(to be held in escrow as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) 
within 30 days from receipt of the proposed assessment or reassessment 
or 30 days from the date of service of the conference officer's action, 
whichever is later. The fact of the violation may not be contested, if 
it has been decided in a review proceeding commenced under section 525 
of the Act and 43 CFR part 4.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall transfer all funds 
submitted under paragraph (a) of this section to the Office, which shall 
hold them in escrow pending completion of the administrative and 
judicial review process, at which time it shall disburse them as 
provided in 30 CFR 723.20.

[45 FR 58783, Sept. 4, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 10063, Mar. 8, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 723.20  Final assessment and payment of penalty.

    (a) If the person to whom a notice of violation or cessation order 
is issued fails to request a hearing as provided in 30 CFR 723.19, the 
proposed assessment shall become a final order of the Secretary and the 
penalty assessed shall become due and payable upon expiration of the 
time allowed to request a hearing.
    (b) If any party requests judicial review of a final order of the 
Secretary, the proposed penalty shall continue to be held in escrow 
until completion of the review. Otherwise, subject to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the escrowed funds shall be transferred to the Office in 
payment of the penalty, and the escrow shall end.
    (c) If the final decision in the administrative and judicial review 
results in an order or eliminating the proposed penalty assessed under 
this part, the Office shall within 30 days of receipt of the order 
refund to the person assessed all or part of the escrowed account, with 
interest from the date of payment into escrow to the date of the refund 
at the rate of 6 percent or at the prevailing Department of the Treasury 
rate, whichever is greater.
    (d) If the review results in an order increasing the penalty, the 
person to whom the notice or order was issued shall pay the difference 
to the Office within 15 days after the order is mailed to such person.

officer or agent of a corporate permittee who knowingly and willfully 
authorized, ordered or carried out a violation, failure or refusal.
    (b) The Office shall not assess an individual civil penalty in

unabated for 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 724.14  Amount of individual civil penalty.

    (a) In determining the amount of an individual civil penalty 
assessed under Sec. 724.12, the Office shall consider the criteria 
specified in Sec. 518(a) of the Act, including:
    (1) The individual's history of authorizing, ordering or carrying

    (3) The demonstrated good faith of the individual charged in 
attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notice of the violation, 
failure or refusal.
    (b) The penalty shall not exceed $5,500 for each violation. Each day 
of a continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation and the 
Office may assess a separate individual civil penalty for each day the 
violation, failure or refusal continues, from the date of service of the 
underlying notice of violation, cessation order or other order 
incorporated in a final decision issued by the Secretary, until 
abatement or compliance is achieved.

[53 FR 3674, Feb. 8, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 63276, Nov. 28, 1997]

the penalty, the amount to be assessed, and a copy of any underlying 
notice of violation and cessation order.
    (b) Final order and opportunity for review. The notice of proposed 
individual civil penalty assessment shall become a final order of the 
Secretary 30 days after service upon the individual unless:
    (1) The individual files within 30 days of service of the notice of 
proposed individual civil penalty assessment a petition for review with

FR 5204, Feb. 5, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 724.18  Payment of penalty.

    (a) No abatement or appeal. If a notice of proposed individual civil 
penalty assessment becomes a final order in the absence of a petition 
for review or abatement agreement, the penalty shall be due upon 
issuance of the final order.
    (b) Appeal. If an individual named in a notice of proposed 
individual civil penalty assessment files a petition for review in 
accordance with 43 CFR 4.1300 et seq., the penalty shall be due upon 
issuance of a final administrative order affirming, increasing or 
decreasing the proposed penalty.
    (c) Abatement agreement. Where the Office and the corporate 
permittee or individual have agreed in writing on a plan for the 
abatement of or compliance with the unabated order, an individual named 
in a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment may postpone 
payment until receiving either a final order from the Office stating 
that the penalty is due on the date of such final order, or written 
notice that abatement or compliance is satisfactory and the penalty has 
been withdrawn.
    (d) Delinquent payment. Following the expiration of 30 days after 
the issuance of a final order assessing an individual civil penalty, any 
delinquent penalty shall be subject to interest at the rate established 
quarterly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for use in applying 
late charges on late payments to the Federal Government, pursuant to 
Treasury Financial Manual 6-8020.20.

[[Page 121]]

The Treasury current value of funds rate is published by the Fiscal 
Service in the notices section of the Federal Register. Interest on 
unpaid penalties will run from the date payment first was due until the 
date of payment. Failure to pay overdue penalties may result in one or 
more of the actions specified in Sec. Sec. 870.15 (e)(1) through (e)(5) 
of this chapter. Delinquent penalties are subject to late payment 
penalties specified in Sec. 870.15(f) of this chapter and processing 
and handling charges specified in Sec. 870.15(g) of this chapter.

requirements:
    (1) The notice shall include the date of the submission of the 
program and a summary of the program's contents. It shall also indicate

submission.
    (2) The notice shall afford interested persons an opportunity to 
submit written comments. The comment period shall end on a date 
following the public hearing scheduled to be held under paragraph (b) of 
this section and that date shall be specified in the notice.

at which the Office will hold the public hearing under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) A public hearing shall be held by the Director no sooner than 40 
days following the publication of the notice required by paragraph (a) 
of this section. The hearing shall be informal and follow legislative 
procedures.
    (1) The format and the rules of procedure for each hearing shall be 
determined by the Director and published in the Federal Register notice 
required by paragraph (a).
    (2) When the program is submitted, State laws and regulations must 
be submitted in their final form or in the form in which they are

[[Page 132]]

laws and regulations must be enacted by the date of program approval.
    (c) Copies of written comments shall be available for public 
inspection and copying at the OSM State Office and the offices of the 
State agency responsible for submitting the program.

[47 FR 26365, June 17, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 732.13  Decision by the Secretary.

    (a) After consideration of the information accompanying the 
Director's recommendation and the Director's recommendation and 
findings, the Secretary shall issue to the State in writing, either a 
decision approving or an initial decision disapproving the State 
program, in whole or in part.
    (b) A program shall not be approved until the Secretary has--
    (1) Solicited and publicly disclosed the views of the Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Agriculture, 
and the heads of other Federal agencies concerned with or having special 
expertise relevant to the program as proposed; and
    (2) Obtained written concurrence of the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency with respect to those aspects of a State 
program which relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under 
the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33

program for consideration.
    (f) If the Secretary disapproves a program, in whole or in part, the 
State shall have 60 days from the date of publication of the Federal 
Register notice to submit a revised program to the Director for

program in its entirety.
    (h) If a revised State program is not submitted by a State within 60 
days of an initial disapproval under paragraph (a) of this section, the

Secretary. This decision and the basis for it shall be published in the 
Federal Register.
    (i) A decision by the Secretary approving a program submission 
establishes a State program for the State which submitted it and 
constitutes the final decision by the Department. The State program

Federal Register unless otherwise specified by the Secretary. The 
Secretary shall not give his approval unless the program submission can 
be approved in whole, except as provided in paragraph (j) of this 
section.
    (j) The Secretary may conditionally approve a State program where 
the program is found to have minor deficiencies, provided:
    (1) The deficiencies are of such a size and nature so as to render 
no part of a proposed State program incomplete;
    (2) The State has initiated and is actively proceeding with steps to 
correct the deficiencies;
    (3) The State agrees in writing to correct such deficiencies within 
a time established by the Secretary and stated in the conditional 
approval; and

[[Page 133]]

    (4) If the deficiencies have not been corrected by the date set 
forth in the Secretary's decision under paragraph (j)(3) of this 
section, the Director shall notify the Secretary that the deficiencies 
have not been corrected and shall within 30 days--
    (i) Withdraw approval of the State program in whole or in part, and 
specify the extent to which approval of the State program is being 
withdrawn;
    (ii) Substitute direct Federal enforcement of those portions of the 
permanent regulatory program that the State has failed to implement;
    (iii) Initiate procedures in accordance with parts 733 and 736 of 
this chapter to withdraw State program approval and implement a Federal 
program for the State, including specifying necessary remedial actions 
to correct continued deficiencies; or

[47 FR 26366, June 17, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 733.11  General requirements for maintaining State programs.

    States with an approved State program shall implement, administer, 
enforce and maintain it in accordance with the Act, this chapter and the 
provisions of the approved State program.


<R05>
Sec. 733.12  Procedures for substituting Federal enforcement of State 
programs or withdrawing approval of State programs.

    (a) Evaluation. (1) The Director shall evaluate the administration 
of each state program at least annually.
    (2) Any interested person may request the Director to evaluate a 
State program. The request shall set forth a concise statement of the 
facts which the person believes establishes the need for evaluation. The 
Director shall verify the allegations and determine within 60 days 
whether or not the evaluation shall be made and mail a written decision 
to the requestor.
    (b) If the Director has reason to believe that a State is not 
effectively implementing, administering, maintaining or enforcing any 
part of its approved State program, the Director shall promptly notify 
the State regulatory authority in writing. The Director's notice shall--
    (1) Provide sufficient information to allow the State regulatory 
authority to determine what portions of the program the Director 
believes are not being effectively implemented, administered, 
maintained, or enforced;
    (2) State the reasons for such belief; and
    (3) Specify the time period for the State regulatory authority to 
accomplish any necessary remedial actions.
    (c) The Director shall provide the State regulatory authority an 
opportunity for an informal conference if the State requests an informal 
conference within 15 days after the expiration of the time period 
specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The informal conference 
may pertain to the facts or the time period for accomplishing remedial 
actions as specified by the Director's notification.
    (d) If an informal conference is not held under paragraph (c) of 
this section, or if, following such a conference, the Director still has 
reason to believe

[[Page 138]]

that the State is failing to adequately implement, administer, maintain 
or enforce a part or all of a State program, the Director shall give 
notice to the State and to the public, specifying the basis for that 
belief and shall hold a public hearing in the State within 30 days of 
the expiration of the time period specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section or as modified at the informal conference held under paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (e) The State will continue to enforce its approved program unless 
upon completion of the hearing under paragraph (d) of this section and 
based upon the review of all available information, including the 
hearing transcript, written presentations and written comments, the 
Director finds that the State has failed to implement, administer, 
maintain or enforce effectively all or part of its approved State 
program. If the Director finds further that the State has not 
demonstrated its capability and intent to administer the State program, 
the Director shall either--
    (1) Substitute for the State regulatory authority direct Federal 
enforcement of all or part of the State program in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section; or
    (2) Recommend to the Secretary that he or she withdraw approval of 
the State program, in whole or in part, in accordance with paragraph (g) 
of this section. The recommendation shall be accompanied by all relevant 
information and shall include the reasons for the recommendation.
    (f) Substituted Federal enforcement. (1) The Director shall give 
public notice of a finding under paragraph (e) of this section and 
specify the extent to which the Director is instituting direct Federal 
enforcement of a State program.
    (2) During the period beginning with the public notice and ending 
when the State satisfies the Director that it will enforce the State 
program effectively, the Director shall enforce those portions of the 
State program and any additional regulations that the Office has adopted 
as necessary to enable the Director to perform his or her duties. To the 
extent the Director has assumed direct Federal enforcement of the State 
program, the Director shall--
    (i) Enforce any permit condition required under the Act;
    (ii) Issue any new or revised permit pursuant to any additional 
regulation that the Director may promulgate at the time of assumed 
enforcement; and
    (iii) Conduct inspections and issue notices, orders and assessments 
of penalties as may be necessary for compliance with those permit 
conditions, the Act and the State program in accordance with subchapter 
L.
    (3) In the case of a State permittee who has met his or her 
obligations under an existing State permit and who did not willfully 
secure the issuance of that permit through fraud or collusion, the 
Director shall give the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing 
surface mining and reclamation operations to the requirements of the 
Act, before suspending or revoking the State permit.
    (g) Withdrawing approval of State program. (1) Upon recommending 
withdrawal of approval of a State program to the Secretary, the Director 
shall institute direct Federal enforcement in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Upon receipt of the Director's recommendation and accompanying 
information under paragraph (e)(2) of this section the Secretary shall 
either--
    (i) Withdraw approval of the State program in whole or in part if 
the Secretary finds that failure by the State to administer or enforce 
part or all of its State program cannot effectively be remedied by 
substitution of direct Federal enforcement for all or part of the State 
program, or
    (ii) Instruct the Director to continue direct Federal enforcement in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) The Secretary shall give public notice of a finding under 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, and specify the extent to which 
approval of a State program is being withdrawn. Not later than the 
issuance of the notice, the Director shall propose promulgation of, and 
thereafter promulgate and implement a Federal program for the affected 
State, in accordance with 30 CFR part 736.

approval or adjusting to new circumstances, in accordance with 
requirements of the Act and this chapter, the hearings transcripts,

Bureau of Land Management and the appropriate Federal land management 
agency to determine whether the permit revision constitutes a mining 
plan modification requiring the Secretary's approval under Sec. 746.18 
of this chapter.
    (3) The regulatory authority shall consult with the Federal land 
management agency to determine whether any permit revision will 
adversely affect Federal resources other than coal and whether the 
revision is consistent with that agency's land use plans for other 
Federal laws, regulations and executive orders for which it is 
responsible.
    (e) Transfer, assignment or sale of rights. (1) The regulatory 
authority, before approving or disapproving an application for transfer, 
assignment or sale of rights granted under a permit issued pursuant to 
this subchapter, shall consult with the appropriate Federal land 
management agency and the Bureau of Land Management, as applicable.
    (2) Approval of a transfer, assignment or sale of rights granted 
under a permit

[[Page 158]]

issued pursuant to this subchapter shall not be construed to constitute 
a transfer or assignment of leasehold interests. Leasehold interests may 
be transferred or assigned only in accordance with 43 CFR part 3453.
    (f) Suspension or revocation of permits. (1) A permit to conduct 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands may be 
suspended or revoked by the regulatory authority in accordance with part 
843 of this chapter and the applicable regulatory program.
    (2) If a permit to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on lands containing leased Federal coal is suspended or 
revoked, the regulatory authority shall notify the Bureau of Land 
Management so that the Bureau of Land Management can determine whether 
action should be taken to cancel the Federal lease. This section does 
not release the Federal lessee from the diligent development or 
continued operation requirements of 43 CFR parts 3400.

    (a) Federal lease bonds. (1) Each holder of a Federal coal lease 
that is covered by a Federal lease bond required under 43 CFR part 3474 
may apply to the authorized officer for release of liability for that 
portion of the Federal lease bond that covers reclamation requirements.
    (2) The authorized officer may release the liability for that 
portion of the Federal lease bond that covers reclamation requirements 
if:
    (i) The lessee has secured a suitable performance bond covering the 
permit area under this part;
    (ii) There are no pending actions or unresolved claims against 
existing bonds; and
    (iii) The authorized officer has received concurrence from OSM and 
the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) Performance bonds. Where the State is the regulatory authority

operations on Federal lands shall be made payable to the United States 
and the State. Where OSM is the regulatory authority, such bonds shall 
be payable only to the United States.
    (c) Federal lessee protection bonds. (1) Where leased Federal coal 
is to be mined and the surface of the land is subject to a lease or 
permit issued by the United States for purposes other than surface coal 
mining, the applicant for a mining permit, if unable to obtain the 
written consent of the permittee or lessee of the surface to enter and 
commence surface coal mining operations, shall submit to the regulatory 
authority with his application evidence of execution of a bond or 
undertaking which meets the requirements of this section. The Federal 
lessee protection bond is in addition to the performance bond required 
by a regulatory program. This section does not apply to permits or 
licenses for the use of the surface that do not convey to the permittee 
or licensee the right of transfer, sale or consent to other uses.
    (2) The bond shall be payable to the United States and, as 
applicable, the State for the use and benefit of the permittee or lessee 
of the surface lands involved.
    (3) The bond shall secure payment to the surface estate for any 
damage which the surface coal mining and reclamation operation causes to 
the crops or tangible improvements of the permittee or lessee of the 
surface lands.
    (4) The amount of the bond shall be determined either by the 
applicant and the Federal lessee or permittee or as determined in an 
action brought against the person conducting surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations or upon the bond in a court of competent 
jurisdiction.
    (d) Release of bonds. (1) A Federal lease bond may be released upon 
satisfactory compliance with all applicable requirements of 43 CFR Group 
3400 and after the release is concurred in by the Bureau of Land 
Management.
    (2) A Federal lessee protection bond shall be released upon the 
written consent of the permittee or lessee.
    (3) Where surface coal mining and reclamation operations are subject 
to an approved mining plan, a performance bond shall be released by the

<R05>
Sec. 761.1  Scope.

    This part establishes the procedures and standards to be followed in 
determining whether a proposed surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation can be authorized in light of the prohibitions and limitations 
in section 522(e) of the Act for those types of operations on certain 
Federal, public and private lands.


<R05>
Sec. 761.3  Authority.

    The State regulatory authority or the Secretary is authorized by 
section 522(e) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) to prohibit or limit 
surface coal mining operations on or near certain private, Federal, and 
other public lands, subject to valid existing rights and except for 
those operations which existed on August 3, 1977.


<R05>
Sec. 761.5  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part--
    Cemetery means any area of land where human bodies are interred.
    Community or institutional building means any structure, other than 
a public building or an occupied dwelling, which is used primarily for 
meetings, gatherings or functions of local civic organizations or other 
community groups; functions as an educational, cultural, historic, 
religious, scientific, correctional, mental-health or physical health 
care facility; or is used for public services, including, but not 
limited to, water supply, power generation or sewage treatment.
    Occupied dwelling means any building that is currently being used on 
a regular or temporary basis for human habitation.
    Public building means any structure that is owned or leased, and 
principally used by a governmental agency for public business or 
meetings.
    Public park means an area or portion of an area dedicated or 
designated by any Federal, State, or local agency primarily for public 
recreational use, whether or not such use is limited to certain times or 
days, including any land leased, reserved, or held open to the public 
because of that use.
    Public road means a road (a) which has been designated as a public 
road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located; 
(b) which is maintained with public funds in a manner similar to other 
public roads of the same classification within the jurisdiction; (c) for 
which there is substantial (more than incidental) public use; and (d) 
which meets road construction standards for other public roads of the 
same classification in the local jurisdiction.
    Publicly-owned park means a public park that is owned by a Federal, 
State or local governmental entity.
    Significant forest cover means an existing plant community 
consisting predominantly of trees and other woody vegetation. The 
Secretary of Agriculture shall decide on a case-by-case basis whether 
the forest cover is significant within those national forests west of 
the 100th meridian.

[[Page 176]]

    Significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values 
incompatible with surface coal mining operations means those values to 
be evaluated for their significance which could be damaged by, and are 
not capable of existing together with, surface coal mining operations 
because of the undesirable effects mining would have on those values, 
either on the area included in the permit application or on other 
affected areas. Those values to be evaluated for their importance 
include:
    (a) Recreation, including hiking, boating, camping, skiing or other 
related outdoor activities;
    (b) Timber manager and silviculture;
    (c) Agriculture, aquaculture or production of other natural, 
processed or manufactured products which enter commerce;
    (d) Scenic, historic, archeologic, esthetic, fish, wildlife, plants 
or cultural interests.
    Surface operations and impacts incident to an underground coal mine 
means all activities involved in or related to underground coal mining 
which are either conducted on the surface of the land, produce changes 
in the land surface or disturb the surface, air or water resources of 
the area, including all activities listed in section 701(28) of the Act 
and the definition of surface coal mining operations appearing in Sec. 
700.5 of this chapter.
    Valid existing rights means a set of circumstances under which a 
person may, subject to regulatory authority approval, conduct surface 
coal mining operations on lands where 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) and Sec. 761.11 
would otherwise prohibit such operations. Possession of valid existing 
rights only confers an exception from the prohibitions of Sec. 761.11 
and 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). A person seeking to exercise valid existing 
rights must comply with all other pertinent requirements of the Act and 
the applicable regulatory program.
    (a) Property rights demonstration. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this definition, a person claiming valid existing rights must 
demonstrate that a legally binding conveyance, lease, deed, contract, or 
other document vests that person, or a predecessor in interest, with the 
right to conduct the type of surface coal mining operations intended. 
This right must exist at the time that the land came under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). Applicable State 
statutory or case law will govern interpretation of documents relied 
upon to establish property rights, unless Federal law provides 
otherwise. If no applicable State law exists, custom and generally 
accepted usage at the time and place that the documents came into 
existence will govern their interpretation.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this definition, a person 
claiming valid existing rights also must demonstrate compliance with one 
of the following standards:
    (1) Good faith/all permits standard. All permits and other 
authorizations required to conduct surface coal mining operations had 
been obtained, or a good faith effort to obtain all necessary permits 
and authorizations had been made, before the land came under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). At a minimum, an 
application must have been submitted for any permit required under 
subchapter G of this chapter or its State program counterpart.
    (2) Needed for and adjacent standard. The land is needed for and 
immediately adjacent to a surface coal mining operation for which all 
permits and other authorizations required to conduct surface coal mining 
operations had been obtained, or a good faith attempt to obtain all 
permits and authorizations had been made, before the land came under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). To meet this standard, 
a person must demonstrate that prohibiting expansion of the operation 
onto that land would unfairly impact the viability of the operation as 
originally planned before the land came under the protection of Sec. 
761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). Except for operations in existence before 
August 3, 1977, or for which a good faith effort to obtain all necessary 
permits had been made before August 3, 1977, this standard does not 
apply to lands already under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 
1272(e) when the regulatory authority approved the permit for the 
original operation or when the good faith effort to obtain all necessary 
permits for the

[[Page 177]]

original operation was made. In evaluating whether a person meets this 
standard, the agency making the determination may consider factors such 
as:
    (i) The extent to which coal supply contracts or other legal and 
business commitments that predate the time that the land came under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) depend upon use of that 
land for surface coal mining operations.
    (ii) The extent to which plans used to obtain financing for the 
operation before the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 
30 U.S.C. 1272(e) rely upon use of that land for surface coal mining 
operations.
    (iii) The extent to which investments in the operation before the 
land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) rely 
upon use of that land for surface coal mining operations.
    (iv) Whether the land lies within the area identified on the life-
of-mine map submitted under Sec. 779.24(c) or Sec. 783.24(c) of this 
chapter before the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11.
    (c) Roads. A person who claims valid existing rights to use or 
construct a road across the surface of lands protected by Sec. 761.11 
or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) must demonstrate that one or more of the following 
circumstances exist if the road is included within the definition of 
``surface coal mining operations'' in Sec. 700.5 of this chapter:
    (1) The road existed when the land upon which it is located came 
under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and the 
person has a legal right to use the road for surface coal mining 
operations.
    (2) A properly recorded right of way or easement for a road in that 
location existed when the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 
or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and, under the document creating the right of way 
or easement, and under subsequent conveyances, the person has a legal 
right to use or construct a road across the right of way or easement for 
surface coal mining operations.
    (3) A valid permit for use or construction of a road in that 
location for surface coal mining operations existed when the land came 
under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (4) Valid existing rights exist under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
definition.
    We, us, and our refer to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation 
and Enforcement.
    You and your refer to a person who claims or seeks to obtain an 
exception or waiver authorized by Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).

Sec. 761.10  Information collection.

    (a) In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection 
requirements of this part. The OMB clearance number is 1029-0111. The 
regulatory authority or other responsible agency will use this 
information to determine whether a person has valid existing rights or 
qualifies for one of the other waivers or exemptions from the general 
prohibition on conducting surface coal mining operations in the areas 
listed in 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). Persons seeking to conduct surface coal 
mining operations on these lands must respond to obtain a benefit in 
accordance with 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (b) We estimate that the public reporting and recordkeeping burden 
for this part will average 15 hours per response under Sec. 761.13, 0.5 
hour per response under Sec. 761.14, 2 hours per response under Sec. 
761.15, 14 hours per response under Sec. 761.16, 2 hours per response 
under Sec. 761.17(c), and 2 hours per response under Sec. 761.17(d), 
including time spent reviewing instructions, searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. The burden for Sec. 761.16 
includes 6 hours for the person seeking the determination and 8 hours 
for the agency processing the request. Send comments regarding this 
burden estimate or any other aspect of these information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement,

<R05>
Sec. 761.11  Areas where surface coal mining operations are prohibited 
or limited.

    You may not conduct surface coal mining operations on the following 
lands unless you either have valid existing rights, as determined under 
Sec. 761.16, or qualify for the exception for existing operations under 
Sec. 761.12:
    (a) Any lands within the boundaries of:
    (1) The National Park System;
    (2) The National Wildlife Refuge System;
    (3) The National System of Trails;
    (4) The National Wilderness Preservation System;
    (5) The Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including study rivers 
designated under section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 
U.S.C. 1276(a), or study rivers or study river corridors established in 
any guidelines issued under that Act; or
    (6) National Recreation Areas designated by Act of Congress.
    (b) Any Federal lands within a national forest. This prohibition 
does not apply if the Secretary finds that there are no significant 
recreational, timber, economic, or other values that may be incompatible 
with surface coal mining operations, and:
    (1) Any surface operations and impacts will be incident to an 
underground coal mine; or
    (2) With respect to lands that do not have significant forest cover 
within national forests west of the 100th meridian, the Secretary of 
Agriculture has determined that surface mining is in compliance with the 
Act, the Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. 528-531; 
the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1975, 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.; 
and the National Forest Management Act of 1976, 16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq. 
This provision does not apply to the Custer National Forest.
    (c) Any lands where the operation would adversely affect any 
publicly owned park or any place in the National Register of Historic 
Places. This prohibition does not apply if, as provided in Sec. 
761.17(d), the regulatory authority and the Federal, State, or local 
agency with jurisdiction over the park or place jointly approve the 
operation.
    (d) Within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of the outside right-of-
way line of any public road. This prohibition does not apply:
    (1) Where a mine access or haul road joins a public road, or
    (2) When, as provided in Sec. 761.14, the regulatory authority (or 
the appropriate public road authority designated by the regulatory 
authority) allows the public road to be relocated or closed, or the area 
within the protected zone to be affected by the surface coal mining 
operation, after:
    (i) Providing public notice and opportunity for a public hearing; 
and
    (ii) Finding in writing that the interests of the affected public 
and landowners will be protected.
    (e) Within 300 feet, measured horizontally, of any occupied 
dwelling. This prohibition does not apply when:
    (1) The owner of the dwelling has provided a written waiver 
consenting to surface coal mining operations within the protected zone, 
as provided in Sec. 761.15; or
    (2) The part of the operation to be located closer than 300 feet to 
the dwelling is an access or haul road that connects with an existing 
public road on the side of the public road opposite the dwelling.
    (f) Within 300 feet, measured horizontally, of any public building, 
school, church, community or institutional building, or public park.
    (g) Within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of a cemetery. This 
prohibition does not apply if the cemetery is relocated in accordance 
with all applicable laws and regulations.

Sec. 761.13  Procedures for compatibility findings for surface coal 
mining operations on Federal lands in national forests.

    (a) If you intend to rely upon the exception provided in Sec. 
761.11(b) to conduct surface coal mining operations on Federal lands 
within a national forest, you must request that we obtain the 
Secretarial findings required by Sec. 761.11(b).
    (b) You may submit a request to us before preparing and submitting 
an application for a permit or boundary revision. If you do, you must 
explain how the proposed operation would not damage the values listed in 
the definition of ``significant recreational, timber, economic, or other 
values incompatible with surface coal mining operations'' in Sec. 
761.5. You must include a map and sufficient information about the 
nature of the proposed operation for the Secretary to make adequately 
documented findings. We may request that you provide any additional 
information that we determine is needed to make the required findings.
    (c) When a proposed surface coal mining operation or proposed 
boundary revision for an existing surface coal mining operation includes 
Federal lands within a national forest, the regulatory authority may not 
issue the permit or approve the boundary revision before the Secretary 
makes the findings required by Sec. 761.11(b).

    (2) Close a public road; or
    (3) Conduct surface coal mining operations within 100 feet, measured 
horizontally, of the outside right-of-way line of a public road.
    (c) Before approving an action proposed under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the regulatory authority, or a public road authority that it 
designates, must determine that the interests of the public and affected 
landowners will be protected. Before making this determination, the 
authority must:
    (1) Provide a public comment period and opportunity to request a 
public hearing in the locality of the proposed operation;
    (2) If a public hearing is requested, publish appropriate advance 
notice at least two weeks before the hearing in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the affected locality; and
    (3) Based upon information received from the public, make a written 
finding as to whether the interests of the public and affected 
landowners will be protected. If a hearing was held, the authority must 
make this finding within 30 days after the hearing. If no hearing was 
held, the authority must make this finding within 30 days after the end 
of the public comment period.

Sec. 761.15  Procedures for waiving the prohibition on surface coal 
mining operations within the buffer zone of an occupied dwelling.

    (a) This section does not apply to:
    (1) Lands for which a person has valid existing rights, as 
determined under Sec. 761.16.
    (2) Lands within the scope of the exception for existing operations 
in Sec. 761.12.
    (3) Access or haul roads that connect with an existing public road 
on the side of the public road opposite the dwelling, as provided in 
Sec. 761.11(e)(2).
    (b) If you propose to conduct surface coal mining operations within 
300 feet, measured horizontally, of any occupied dwelling, the permit 
application must include a written waiver by lease, deed, or other 
conveyance from the owner of the dwelling. The waiver must clarify that 
the owner and signator had the legal right to deny mining and knowingly 
waived that right. The waiver will act as consent to surface coal mining 
operations within a closer distance of the dwelling as specified.
    (c) If you obtained a valid waiver before August 3, 1977, from the 
owner of an occupied dwelling to conduct operations within 300 feet of 
the dwelling, you need not submit a new waiver.
    (d) If you obtain a valid waiver from the owner of an occupied 
dwelling, that waiver will remain effective against subsequent 
purchasers who had actual or constructive knowledge of the existing 
waiver at the time of purchase. A subsequent purchaser will be deemed to 
have constructive knowledge if the waiver has been properly filed in 
public property records pursuant to State laws or if surface coal mining 
operations have entered the 300-foot zone before the date of purchase.

    (b) What you must submit as part of a request for a valid existing 
rights determination. You must submit a request for a valid existing 
rights determination to the appropriate agency under paragraph (a) of 
this section if you intend to conduct surface coal mining operations on 
the basis of valid existing rights under Sec. 761.11 or wish to confirm 
the right to do so. You may submit this request before preparing and 
submitting an application for a permit or boundary revision for the 
land, unless the applicable regulatory program provides otherwise.
    (1) Requirements for property rights demonstration. You must provide 
a property rights demonstration under

[[Page 181]]

paragraph (a) of the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5 
if your request relies upon the good faith/all permits standard or the 
needed for and adjacent standard in paragraph (b) of the definition of 
valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5. This demonstration must include 
the following items:
    (i) A legal description of the land to which your request pertains.
    (ii) Complete documentation of the character and extent of your 
current interests in the surface and mineral estates of the land to 
which your request pertains.
    (iii) A complete chain of title for the surface and mineral estates 
of the land to which your request pertains.
    (iv) A description of the nature and effect of each title instrument 
that forms the basis for your request, including any provision 
pertaining to the type or method of mining or mining-related surface 
disturbances and facilities.
    (v) A description of the type and extent of surface coal mining 
operations that you claim the right to conduct, including the method of 
mining, any mining-related surface activities and facilities, and an 
explanation of how those operations would be consistent with State 
property law.
    (vi) Complete documentation of the nature and ownership, as of the 
date that the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 
U.S.C. 1272(e), of all property rights for the surface and mineral 
estates of the land to which your request pertains.
    (vii) Names and addresses of the current owners of the surface and 
mineral estates of the land to which your request pertains.
    (viii) If the coal interests have been severed from other property 
interests, documentation that you have notified and provided reasonable 
opportunity for the owners of other property interests in the land to 
which your request pertains to comment on the validity of your property 
rights claims.
    (ix) Any comments that you receive in response to the notification 
provided under paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section.
    (2) Requirements for good faith/all permits standard. If your 
request relies upon the good faith/all permits standard in paragraph 
(b)(1) of the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, you 
must submit the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. You also must submit the following information about permits, 
licenses, and authorizations for surface coal mining operations on the 
land to which your request pertains:
    (i) Approval and issuance dates and identification numbers for any 
permits, licenses, and authorizations that you or a predecessor in 
interest obtained before the land came under the protection of Sec. 
761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (ii) Application dates and identification numbers for any permits, 
licenses, and authorizations for which you or a predecessor in interest 
submitted an application before the land came under the protection of 
Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (iii) An explanation of any other good faith effort that you or a 
predecessor in interest made to obtain the necessary permits, licenses, 
and authorizations as of the date that the land came under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (3) Requirements for needed for and adjacent standard. If your 
request relies upon the needed for and adjacent standard in paragraph 
(b)(2) of the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, you 
must submit the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. In addition, you must explain how and why the land is needed 
for and immediately adjacent to the operation upon which your request is 
based, including a demonstration that prohibiting expansion of the 
operation onto that land would unfairly impact the viability of the 
operation as originally planned before the land came under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (4) Requirements for standards for mine roads. If your request 
relies upon one of the standards for roads in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(c)(3) of the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, you 
must submit satisfactory documentation that:
    (i) The road existed when the land upon which it is located came 
under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and you have 
a legal right to

[[Page 182]]

use the road for surface coal mining operations;
    (ii) A properly recorded right of way or easement for a road in that 
location existed when the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 
or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and, under the document creating the right of way 
or easement, and under any subsequent conveyances, you have a legal 
right to use or construct a road across that right of way or easement to 
conduct surface coal mining operations; or
    (iii) A valid permit for use or construction of a road in that 
location for surface coal mining operations existed when the land came 
under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
    (c) Initial review of request. (1) The agency must conduct an 
initial review to determine whether your request includes all applicable 
components of the submission requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section. This review pertains only to the completeness of the request, 
not the legal or technical adequacy of the materials submitted.
    (2) If your request does not include all applicable components of 
the submission requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the agency 
must notify you and establish a reasonable time for submission of the 
missing information.
    (3) When your request includes all applicable components of the 
submission requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the agency 
must implement the notice and comment requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (4) If you do not provide information that the agency requests under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section within the time specified or as 
subsequently extended, the agency must issue a determination that you 
have not demonstrated valid existing rights, as provided in paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section.
    (d) Notice and comment requirements and procedures. (1) When your 
request satisfies the completeness requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section, the agency must publish a notice in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the county in which the land is located. This notice must 
invite comment on the merits of the request. Alternatively, the agency 
may require that you publish this notice and provide the agency with a 
copy of the published notice. We will publish a similar notice in the 
Federal Register if your request involves Federal lands within an area 
listed in Sec. 761.11(a) or (b). Each notice must include:
    (i) The location of the land to which the request pertains.
    (ii) A description of the type of surface coal mining operations 
planned.
    (iii) A reference to and brief description of the applicable 
standard(s) under the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 
761.5.
    (A) If your request relies upon the good faith/all permits standard 
or the needed for and adjacent standard in paragraph (b) of the 
definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, the notice also must 
include a description of the property rights that you claim and the 
basis for your claim.
    (B) If your request relies upon the standard in paragraph (c)(1) of 
the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, the notice also 
must include a description of the basis for your claim that the road 
existed when the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 
U.S.C. 1272(e). In addition, the notice must include a description of 
the basis for your claim that you have a legal right to use that road 
for surface coal mining operations.
    (C) If your request relies upon the standard in paragraph (c)(2) of 
the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, the notice also 
must include a description of the basis for your claim that a properly 
recorded right of way or easement for a road in that location existed 
when the land came under the protection of Sec. 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 
1272(e). In addition, the notice must include a description of the basis 
for your claim that, under the document creating the right of way or 
easement, and under any subsequent conveyances, you have a legal right 
to use or construct a road across the right of way or easement to 
conduct surface coal mining operations.
    (iv) If your request relies upon one or more of the standards in 
paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the definition of valid existing 
rights in Sec. 761.5, a statement that the agency will not make a 
decision on the merits of your request if, by the close of the comment 
period

[[Page 183]]

under this notice or the notice required by paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, a person with a legal interest in the land initiates 
appropriate legal action in the proper venue to resolve any differences 
concerning the validity or interpretation of the deed, lease, easement, 
or other documents that form the basis of your claim.
    (v) A description of the procedures that the agency will follow in 
processing your request.
    (vi) The closing date of the comment period, which must be a minimum 
of 30 days after the publication date of the notice.
    (vii) A statement that interested persons may obtain a 30-day 
extension of the comment period upon request.
    (viii) The name and address of the agency office where a copy of the 
request is available for public inspection and to which comments and 
requests for extension of the comment period should be sent.
    (2) The agency must promptly provide a copy of the notice required 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to:
    (i) All reasonably locatable owners of surface and mineral estates 
in the land included in your request.
    (ii) The owner of the feature causing the land to come under the 
protection of Sec. 761.11, and, when applicable, the agency with 
primary jurisdiction over the feature with respect to the values causing 
the land to come under the protection of Sec. 761.11. For example, both 
the landowner and the State Historic Preservation Officer must be 
notified if surface coal mining operations would adversely impact any 
site listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As another 
example, both the surface owner and the National Park Service must be 
notified if the request includes non-Federal lands within the authorized 
boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.
    (3) The letter transmitting the notice required under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section must provide a 30-day comment period, starting 
from the date of service of the letter, and specify that another 30 days 
is available upon request. At its discretion, the agency responsible for 
the determination of valid existing rights may grant additional time for 
good cause upon request. The agency need not necessarily consider 
comments received after the closing date of the comment period.
    (e) How a decision will be made. (1) The agency responsible for 
making the determination of valid existing rights must review the 
materials submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, comments 
received under paragraph (d) of this section, and any other relevant, 
reasonably available information to determine whether the record is 
sufficiently complete and adequate to support a decision on the merits 
of the request. If not, the agency must notify you in writing, 
explaining the inadequacy of the record and requesting submittal, within 
a specified reasonable time, of any additional information that the 
agency deems necessary to remedy the inadequacy.
    (2) Once the record is complete and adequate, the responsible agency 
must determine whether you have demonstrated valid existing rights. The 
decision document must explain how you have or have not satisfied all 
applicable elements of the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 
761.5. It must contain findings of fact and conclusions, and it must 
specify the reasons for the conclusions.
    (3) Impact of property rights disagreements. This paragraph applies 
only when your request relies upon one or more of the standards in 
paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the definition of valid existing 
rights in Sec. 761.5.
    (i) The agency must issue a determination that you have not 
demonstrated valid existing rights if your property rights claims are 
the subject of pending litigation in a court or administrative body with 
jurisdiction over the property rights in question. The agency will make 
this determination without prejudice, meaning that you may refile the 
request once the property rights dispute is finally adjudicated. This 
paragraph applies only to situations in which legal action has been 
initiated as of the closing date of the comment period under paragraph 
(d)(1) or (d)(3) of this section.

[[Page 184]]

    (ii) If the record indicates disagreement as to the accuracy of your 
property rights claims, but this disagreement is not the subject of 
pending litigation in a court or administrative agency of competent 
jurisdiction, the agency must evaluate the merits of the information in 
the record and determine whether you have demonstrated that the 
requisite property rights exist under paragraph (a), (c)(1), or (c)(2) 
of the definition of valid existing rights in Sec. 761.5, as 
appropriate. The agency must then proceed with the decision process 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) The agency must issue a determination that you have not 
demonstrated valid existing rights if you do not submit information that 
the agency requests under paragraph (c)(2) or (e)(1) of this section 
within the time specified or as subsequently extended. The agency will 
make this determination without prejudice, meaning that you may refile a 
revised request at any time.
    (5) After making a determination, the agency must:
    (i) Provide a copy of the determination, together with an 
explanation of appeal rights and procedures, to you, to the owner or 
owners of the land to which the determination applies, to the owner of 
the feature causing the land to come under the protection of Sec. 
761.11, and, when applicable, to the agency with primary jurisdiction 
over the feature with respect to the values that caused the land to come 
under the protection of Sec. 761.11.
    (ii) Publish notice of the determination in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the county in which the land is located. Alternatively, 
the agency may require that you publish this notice and provide a copy 
of the published notice to the agency. We will publish the 
determination, together with an explanation of appeal rights and 
procedures, in the Federal Register if your request includes Federal 
lands within an area listed in Sec. 761.11(a) or (b).
    (f) Administrative and judicial review. A determination that you 
have or do not have valid existing rights is subject to administrative 
and judicial review under Sec. Sec. 775.11 and 775.13 of this chapter.
    (g) Availability of records. The agency responsible for processing a 
request subject to notice and comment under paragraph (d) of this 
section must make a copy of that request available to the public in the 
same manner as the agency, when acting as the regulatory authority, must 
make permit applications available to the public under Sec. 773.13(d) 
of this chapter. In addition, the agency must make records associated 
with that request, and any subsequent determination under paragraph (e) 
of this section, available to the public in accordance with the 
requirements and procedures of Sec. 840.14 or Sec. 842.16 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 761.17  Regulatory authority obligations at time of permit 
application review.

    (a) Upon receipt of an administratively complete application for a 
permit for a surface coal mining operation, or an administratively 
complete application for revision of the boundaries of a surface coal 
mining operation permit, the regulatory authority must review the 
application to determine whether the proposed surface coal mining 
operation would be located on any lands protected under Sec. 761.11.
    (b) The regulatory authority must reject any portion of the 
application that would locate surface coal mining operations on land 
protected under Sec. 761.11 unless:
    (1) The site qualifies for the exception for existing operations 
under Sec. 761.12;
    (2) A person has valid existing rights for the land, as determined 
under Sec. 761.16;
    (3) The applicant obtains a waiver or exception from the 
prohibitions of Sec. 761.11 in accordance with Sec. Sec. 761.13 
through 761.15; or
    (4) For lands protected by Sec. 761.11(c), both the regulatory 
authority and the agency with jurisdiction over the park or place 
jointly approve the proposed operation in accordance with paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (c) Location verification. If the regulatory authority has 
difficulty determining whether an application includes land within an 
area specified in

[[Page 185]]

Sec. 761.11(a) or within the specified distance from a structure or 
feature listed in Sec. 761.11(f) or (g), the regulatory authority must 
request that the Federal, State, or local governmental agency with 
jurisdiction over the protected land, structure, or feature verify the 
location.
    (1) The request for location verification must:
    (i) Include relevant portions of the permit application.
    (ii) Provide the agency with 30 days after receipt to respond, with 
a notice that another 30 days is available upon request.
    (iii) Specify that the regulatory authority will not necessarily 
consider a response received after the comment period provided under 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) If the agency does not respond in a timely manner, the 
regulatory authority may make the necessary determination based on 
available information.
    (d) Procedures for joint approval of surface coal mining operations 
that will adversely affect publicly owned parks or historic places.
    (1) If the regulatory authority determines that the proposed surface 
coal mining operation will adversely affect any publicly owned park or 
any place included in the National Register of Historic Places, the 
regulatory authority must request that the Federal, State, or local 
agency with jurisdiction over the park or place either approve or object 
to the proposed operation. The request must:
    (i) Include a copy of applicable parts of the permit application.
    (ii) Provide the agency with 30 days after receipt to respond, with 
a notice that another 30 days is available upon request.
    (iii) State that failure to interpose an objection within the time 
specified under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section will constitute 
approval of the proposed operation.
    (2) The regulatory authority may not issue a permit for a proposed 
operation subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless all 
affected agencies jointly approve.
    (3) Paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section do not apply to:
    (i) Lands for which a person has valid existing rights, as 
determined under Sec. 761.16.
    (ii) Lands within the scope of the exception for existing operations 
in Sec. 761.12.

Sec. 761.200  Interpretative rule related to subsidence due to 
underground coal mining in areas designated by Act of Congress.

    OSM has adopted the following interpretation of rules promulgated in 
part 761.
    (a) Interpretation of Sec. 761.11--Areas where mining is prohibited 
or limited. Subsidence due to underground coal mining is not included in 
the definition of surface coal mining operations under section 701(28) 
of the Act and Sec. 700.5 of this chapter and therefore is not 
prohibited in areas protected under section 522(e) of the Act.

Sec. 762.1  Scope.

    This part establishes the minimum criteria to be used in determining 
whether lands should be designated as unsuitable for all or certain 
types of surface coal mining operations.

[[Page 186]]


<R05>
Sec. 762.4  Responsibility.

    The regulatory authority or OSM shall use the criteria in this part 
for the evaluation of each petition for the designation of areas as 
unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.


<R05>
Sec. 762.5  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    Fragile lands means areas containing natural, ecologic, scientific, 
or esthetic resources that could be significantly damaged by surface 
coal mining operations. Examples of fragile lands include valuable 
habitats for fish or wildlife, critical habitats for endangered or 
threatened species of animals or plants, uncommon geologic formations, 
paleontological sites, National Natural Landmarks, areas where mining 
may result in flooding, environmental corridors containing a 
concentration of ecologic and esthetic features, and areas of 
recreational value due to high environmental quality.
    Historic lands means areas containing historic, cultural, or 
scientific resources. Examples of historic lands include archeological 
sites, properties listed on or eligible for listing on a State or 
National Register of Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks, 
properties having religious or cultural significance to Native Americans 
or religious groups, and properties for which historic designation is 
pending.
    Natural hazard lands means geographic areas in which natural 
conditions exist which pose or, as a result of surface coal mining 
operations, may pose a threat to the health, safety or welfare of 
people, property or the environment, including areas subject to 
landslides, cave-ins, large or encroaching sand dunes, severe wind or 
soil erosion, frequent flooding, avalanches and areas of unstable 
geology.
    Renewable resource lands means geographic areas which contribute 
significantly to the long-range productivity of water supply or of food 
or fiber products, such lands to include aquifers and aquifer recharge 
areas.
    Substantial legal and financial commitments in a surface coal mining 
operation means significant investments that have been made on the basis 
of a long-term coal contract in power plants, railroads, coal-handling, 
preparation, extraction or storage facilities, and other capital-
intensive activities. Costs of acquiring the coal in place, or the right 
to mine it alone without other significant investments, as described 
above, are not sufficient to constitute substantial legal and financial 
commitments.

[48 FR 41350, Sept. 14, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 18795, May 19, 1987; 
53 FR 26584, July 13, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 762.11  Criteria for designating lands as unsuitable.

    (a) Upon petition an area shall be designated as unsuitable for all 
or certain types of surface coal mining operations, if the regulatory 
authority determines that reclamation is not technologically and 
economically feasible under the Act, this chapter or an approved State 
program.
    (b) Upon petition an area may be (but is not required to be) 
designated as unsuitable for certain types of surface coal mining 
operations, if the operations will--
    (1) Be incompatible with existing State or local land use plans or 
programs;
    (2) Affect fragile or historic lands in which the operations could 
result in significant damage to important historic, cultural, 
scientific, or esthetic values or natural systems;
    (3) Affect renewable resource lands in which the operations could 
result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range productivity of 
water supply or of food or fiber products; or
    (4) Affect natural hazard lands in which the operations could 
substantially endanger life and property, such lands to include areas 
subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology.

Sec. 762.12  Additional criteria.

    (a) A State regulatory authority may establish additional or more 
stringent criteria for determining whether lands within the State should 
be designated as unsuitable for coal mining operations. Such criteria 
shall be approved pursuant to subchapter C of this chapter.
    (b) The Secretary may establish additional criteria for determining 
whether Federal lands should be designated as

[[Page 187]]

unsuitable for surface mining operations.
    (c) Additional criteria will be determined to be more stringent on 
the basis of whether they provide for greater protection of the public 
health, safety and welfare or the environment, such that areas beyond 
those specified in the criteria of this part would be designated as 
unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.


<R05>
Sec. 762.13  Land exempt from designation as unsuitable for surface 
coal mining operations.

    The requirements of this part do not apply to--
    (a) Lands on which surface coal mining operations were being 
conducted on the date of enactment of the Act;
    (b) Lands covered by a permit issued under the Act; or
    (c) Lands where substantial legal and financial commitments in 
surface coal mining operations were in existence prior to January 4, 
1977.


<R05>
Sec. 762.14  Applicability to lands designated as unsuitable by Congress.

    Pursuant to appropriate petitions, lands listed in Sec. 761.11 of 
this chapter are subject to designation as unsuitable for all or certain 
types of surface coal mining operations under this part and parts 764 
and 769 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 762.15  Exploration on land designated as unsuitable for surface 
coal mining operations.

    Designation of any area as unsuitable for all or certain types of 
surface coal mining operations pursuant to section 522 of the Act and 
regulations of this subchapter does not prohibit coal exploration 
operations in the area, if conducted in accordance with the Act, this 
chapter, any approved State or Federal program, and other applicable 
requirements. Exploration operations on any lands designated unsuitable 
for surface coal mining operations must be approved by the regulatory 
authority under part 772 of this chapter, to ensure that exploration 
does not interfere with any value for which the area has been designated 
unsuitable for surface coal mining.

<R05>
Sec. 764.1  Scope.

    This part establishes minimum procedures and standards to be 
included in each approved State program for designating non-Federal and 
non-Indian lands in a State as unsuitable for all or certain types of 
surface coal mining operations and for terminating designations.


<R05>
Sec. 764.10  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements contained in Sec. Sec. 
764.21 and 764.25(b) have been approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1029-0030. The 
information required in Sec. 764.21 is necessary to allow the 
regulatory authority to develop a data base and inventory system to 
evaluate whether reclamation is feasible in areas covered by petitions. 
The information required in Sec. 764.25(b) is necessary to allow the 
regulatory authority to determine, when a permit application is filed, 
whether it includes any areas designated as unsuitable for surface coal 
mining.

[[Page 188]]


<R05>
Sec. 764.11  General process requirements.

    Each State shall establish a process enabling objective decisions to 
be made on which, if any, land areas of the State are unsuitable for all 
or certain types of surface coal mining operations. These decisions 
shall be based on competent, scientifically sound data and other 
relevant information. This process shall include the requirements listed 
in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 764.13  Petitions.

    (a) Right to petition. Any person having an interest which is or may 
be adversely affected has the right to petition the regulatory authority 
to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining 
operations, or to have an existing designation terminated. For the 
purpose of this Action, a person having an interest which is or may be 
adversely affected must demonstrate how he or she meets an ``injury in 
fact'' test by describing the injury to his or her specific affected 
interests and demonstrate how he or she is among the injured.
    (b) Designation. The regulatory authority shall determine what 
information must be provided by the petitioner to have an area 
designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
    (1) At a minimum, a complete petition for designation shall 
include--
    (i) The petitioner's name, address, telephone number, and notarized 
signature;
    (ii) Identification of the petitioned areas, including its location 
and size, and a U.S. Geological Survey topographic map outlining the 
perimeter of the petitioned area;
    (iii) An identification of the petitioner's interest which is or may 
be adversely affected by surface coal mining operations, including a 
statement demonstrating how the petitioner satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section;
    (iv) A description of how mining of the area has affected of may 
adversely affect people, land, air, water, or other resources, including 
the petitioner's interests; and
    (v) Allegations of fact and supporting evidence, covering all lands 
in the petition area, which tend to establish that the area is 
unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, 
pursuant to specific criteria of sections 522(a) (2) and (3) of the Act, 
assuming that contemporary mining practices required under applicable 
regulatory programs would be followed if the area were to be mined. Each 
of the allegations of fact should be specific as to the mining 
operation, if known, and the portion(s) of the petitioned area and 
petitioner's interests to which the allegation applies and be supported 
by evidence that tends to establish the validity of the allegations for 
the mining operation or portion of the petitioned areas.
    (2) The regulatory authority may request that the petitioner provide 
other supplementary information which is readily available.
    (c) Termination. The regulatory authority shall determine what 
information must be provided by the petitioner to terminate designations 
of lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
    (1) At a minimum, a complete petition for termination shall 
include--
    (i) The petitioner's name, address, telephone number, and notarized 
signature;
    (ii) Identification of the petitioned area, including its location 
and size and a U.S. Geological Survey topographic map outlining the 
perimeter of the petitioned area to which the termination petition 
applies;
    (iii) An identification of the petitioner's interest which is or may 
be adversely affected by the designation that the area is unsuitable for 
surface coal mining operations including a statement demonstrating how 
the petitioner satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (iv) Allegations of facts covering all lands for which the 
termination is proposed. Each of the allegations of fact shall be 
specific as to the mining operation, if any, and to portions of the 
petitioned area and petitioner's interests to which the allegation 
applies. The allegations shall be supported by evidence, not contained 
in the record of the designation proceeding, that tends to establish the 
validity of the allegations for the mining operation or portion of the 
petitioned area, assuming

[[Page 189]]

that contemporary mining practices required under applicable regulatory 
programs would be followed were the area to be mined. For areas 
previously and unsuccessfully proposed for termination, significant new 
allegations of facts and supporting evidence must be presented in the 
petition. Allegations and supporting evidence should also be specific to 
the basis for which the designation was made and tend to establish that 
the designation should be terminated on the following bases:
    (A) Nature or abundance of the protected resource or condition or 
other basis of the designation if the designation was based on criteria 
found in Sec. 762.11(b) of this chapter;
    (B) Reclamation now being technologically and economically feasible 
if the designation was based on the criteria found in Sec. 762.11(a) of 
this chapter; or
    (C) Resources or conditions not being affected by surface coal 
mining operations, or in the case of land use plans, not being 
incompatible with surface coal mining operations during and after 
mining, if the designation was based on the criteria found in Sec. 
762.11(b) of this chapter;
    (2) The State regulatory authority may request that the petitioner 
provide other supplementary information which is readily available.


<R05>
Sec. 764.15  Initial processing, recordkeeping, and notification 
requirements.

    (a)(1) Within 30 days of receipt of a petition, the regulatory 
authority shall notify the petitioner by certified mail whether the 
petition is complete under Sec. 764.13 (b) or (c). Complete, for a 
designation or termination petition, means that the information required 
under Sec. 764.13 (b) or (c) has been provided.
    (2) The regulatory authority shall determine whether any identified 
coal resources exist in the area covered by the petition, without 
requiring any showing from the petitioner. If the regulatory authority 
finds there are not any identified coal resources in that area, it shall 
return the petition to the petitioner with a statement of the findings.
    (3) If the regulatory authority determines that the petition is 
incomplete, frivolous, or that the petitioner does not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 764.13(a), it shall return the petition to the 
petitioner with a written statement of the reasons for the determination 
and the categories of information needed to make the petition complete. 
A frivolous petition is one in which the allegations of harm lack 
serious merit.
    (4) When considering a petition for an area which was previously and 
unsuccessfully proposed for designation, the regulatory authority shall 
determine if the new petition presents significant new allegations of 
facts with evidence which tends to establish the allegations. If the 
petition does not contain such material, the regulatory authority may 
choose not to consider the petition and may return the petition to the 
petitioner, with a statement of its findings and a reference to the 
record of the previous designation proceedings where the facts were 
considered.
    (5) The regulatory authority shall notify the person who submits a 
petition of any application for a permit received which includes any 
area covered by the petition.
    (6) The regulatory authority may determine not to process any 
petition received insofar as it pertains to lands for which an 
administratively complete permit application has been filed and the 
first newspaper notice has been published. Based on such a 
determination, the regulatory authority may issue a decision on a 
complete and accurate permit application and shall inform the petitioner 
why the regulatory authority cannot consider the part of the petition 
pertaining to the proposed permit area.
    (b)(1) Promptly after a petition is received, the regulatory 
authority shall notify the general public of the receipt of the petition 
by a newspaper advertisement placed in the locale of the area covered by 
the petition, in the newspaper providing broadest circulation in the 
region of the petitioned area and in any official State register of 
public notices. The regulatory authority shall make copies of the 
petition available to the public and shall provide copies of the 
petition to other

[[Page 190]]

interested governmental agencies, intervenors, persons with an ownership 
interest of record in the property, and other persons known to the 
regulatory authority to have an interest in the property. Proper notice 
to persons with an ownership interest of record in the property shall 
comply with the requirements of applicable State law.
    (2) Promptly after the determination that a petition is complete, 
the regulatory authority shall request submissions from the general 
public of relevant information by a newspaper advertisement placed once 
a week for two consecutive weeks in the locale of the area covered by 
the petition, in the newspaper providing broadest circulation in the 
region of the petitioned area, and in any offical State register of 
public notices.
    (c) Until three days before the regulatory authority holds a hearing 
under Sec. 764.17, any person may intervene in the proceeding by filing 
allegations of facts describing how the designation determination 
directly affects the intervenor, supporting evidence, a short statement 
identifying the petition to which the allegations pertain, and the 
intervenor's name, address and telephone number.
    (d) Beginning from the date a petition is filed, the regulatory 
authority shall compile and maintain a record consisting of all 
documents relating to the petition filed with or prepared by the 
regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall make the record 
available to the public for inspection free of charge and for copying at 
reasonable cost during all normal hours at the main office of the 
regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall also maintain 
information at or near the area in which the petitioned land is located 
and make this information available to the public for inspection free of 
charge and for copying at reasonable cost during all normal business 
hours. At a minimum, this information shall include a copy of the 
petition.

1987]


<R05>
Sec. 764.17  Hearing requirements.

    (a) Within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition, the 
regulatory authority shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the 
area covered by the petition. If all petitioners and intervenors agree, 
the hearing need not be held. The regulatory authority may subpoena 
witnesses as necessary. The hearing may be conducted with cross-
examination of expert witnesses only. A record of the hearing shall be 
made and preserved according to State law. No person shall bear the 
burden of proof or persuasion. All relevant parts of the data base and 
inventory system and all public comments received during the public 
comment period shall be included in the record and considered by the 
regulatory authority in its decision on the petition.
    (b)(1) The regulatory authority shall give notice of the date, time, 
and location of the hearing to:
    (i) Local, State, and Federal agencies which may have an interest in 
the decision on the petition;
    (ii) The petitioner and the intervenors; and
    (iii) Any person known by the regulatory authority to have a 
property interest in the petitioned area. Proper notice to persons with 
an ownership interest of record shall comply with the requirements of 
applicable State law.
    (2) Notice of the hearing shall be sent by certified mail to 
petitioners and intervenors, and by regular mail to government agencies 
and property owners involved in the proceeding, and postmarked not less 
than 30 days before the scheduled date of the hearing.
    (c) The regulatory authority shall notify the general public of the 
date, time, and location of the hearing by placing a newspaper 
advertisement once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in the locale of the 
area covered by the petition and once during the week prior to the 
public hearing. The consecutive weekly advertisement must begin between 
4 and 5 weeks before the scheduled date of the public hearing.
    (d) The regulatory authority may consolidate in a single hearing the 
hearings required for each of several petitions which relate to areas in 
the same locale.
    (e) Prior to designating any land areas as unsuitable for surface 
coal

[[Page 191]]

mining operations, the regulatory authority shall prepare a detailed 
statement, using existing and available information on the potential 
coal resources of the area, the demand for coal resources, and the 
impact of such designation on the environment, the economy, and the 
supply of coal.
    (f) In the event that all petitioners and intervenors stipulate 
agreement prior to the hearing, the petition may be withdrawn from 
consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 764.19  Decision.

authority, including a statemtent of reasons, within 60 days of 
completion of the public hearing, or, if no public hearing is held, then 
within 12 months after receipt of the complete petition. The regulatory 
authority shall simultaneously send the decision by certified mail to 
the petitioner and intervenors and by regular mail to all other persons 
involved in the proceeding.
    (c) The decision of the State regulatory authority with respect to a 
petition, or the failure of the regulatory authority to act within the 
time limits set forth in this section, shall be subject to judicial 
review by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with State law 
under section 526(e) of the Act and Sec. 775.13 of this chapter. All 
relevant portions of the data base, inventory system, and public 
comments received during the public comment period set by the regulatory 
authority shall be considered and included in the record of the 
administrative proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 764.21  Data base and inventory system requirements.

    (a) The regulatory authority shall develop a data base and inventory 
system which will permit evaluation of whether reclamation is feasible 
in areas covered by petitions.
    (b) The regulatory authority shall include in the system information 
relevant to the criteria in Sec. 762.11 of this chapter, including, but 
not limited to, information received from the United States Fish and

<R05>
Sec. 769.1  Scope.

    This part establishes minimum procedures and standards for 
designating Federal lands as unsuitable for all or certain types of 
surface coal mining operations and for terminating designations pursuant 
to petition.


<R05>
Sec. 769.10  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements in this part do not require 
approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
because there are fewer than 10 respondents annually.


<R05>
Sec. 769.11  Who may submit a petition.

    Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected 
by surface coal mining operations to be conducted on Federal lands may 
petition the Secretary to have an area designated as unsuitable for all 
or certain types of surface coal mining operations, or to have an 
existing designation terminated. This right does not apply to areas set 
aside from surface coal mining operations under laws other than the Act. 
For the purpose of this section, a person having an interest which is or 
may be adversely affected must demonstrate how he or she meets an 
``injury in fact'' test by describing the injury to his or her specific 
affected interests and demonstrate how he or she is among the injured.


<R05>
Sec. 769.12  Where to submit petitions.

    Each petition to have an area of Federal lands designated as 
unsuitable or to terminate an existing designation shall be submitted to 
the Director of the OSM Field Office responsible for that area where the 
Federal lands are located.


<R05>
Sec. 769.13  Contents of petitions.

    (a) Designation. The only information that a petitioner need provide 
to designate lands is that required under Sec. 764.13(b) of this 
chapter.
    (b) Termination. The only information that a petitioner need provide 
to terminate a designation is that required by Sec. 764.13(c) of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 769.14  Initial processing, recordkeeping, and notification 
requirements.

    (a)(1) Within 30 days of receipt of a petition, OSMRE shall 
determine whether the petition is complete and not frivolous. OSMRE may 
request other supplementary information that is readily available to be 
provided by the petitioner. Any request for such supplementary 
information from the petitioner shall not affect OSMRE's determination 
that the petition is complete for further processing.
    (2) Complete, (i) for a designation petition, means that (A) all 
information required under Sec. 764.13(b) of this chapter has been 
provided and (B) the information submitted by the petitioner contains 
significant new allegations of fact and supporting evidence not 
considered in any previous unsuccessful

[[Page 193]]

petition of Federal lands review conducted under Section 522(b) of the 
Act, that tends to establish that the lands are unsuitable for surface 
coal mining operations; and (ii) for a termination petition, means that 
all information required under Sec. 764.13(c) has been provided.
    (3) Frivolous, for a designation or termination petition, means 
that:
    (i) The allegations of harm lack serious merit; or
    (ii) Available information shows that no ``mineable'' coals 
resources exist in the petitioned area or that the petitioned area is 
not or could not be subject to related surface coal mining operations 
and surface impacts incident to an underground coal mine or an adjoining 
surface mine (mineable coal is coal with development potential as mapped 
or reported by the Bureau of Land Management under 43 CFR 3420.1-
4(e)(1); and privately owned coal under land owned by the United 
States).
    (b) When the Director finds that the petition is incomplete or 
frivolous, he or she shall reject the petition with a written statement 
of reasons and advise the petitioner, via certified mail, that the 
petition may be reconsidered upon resubmittal with deficiencies cured.
    (c) When the Director finds that the petition is complete and not 
frivolous, he or she shall initiate the petition review and so advise 
the petitioner via certified mail.
    (d)(1) Within 2 weeks after accepting the petition for further 
processing, OSM shall send a copy of the petition to the authorized 
officer of the land management agency for the officer's recommendation 
on the petition.
    (2) The authorized officer of the appropriate Federal land 
management agency shall furnish a recommendation on the petition to OSM 
within 30 days of its receipt, if the area covered by the petition has 
been included in a completed Federal lands review or within 9 months, if 
the area has not been included in a Federal lands review.
    (e) Promptly after accepting a petition for further processing, OSM 
shall circulate copies of the petition to, and request submissions of 
relevant information from, other interested governmental agencies, the 
petitioner, intervenors, and any person, known to OSM to have an 
ownership interest in the property.
    (f) Where lands administered by the Department of the Interior and 
other Federal land management agencies are contiguous or intermingled or 
where the Department's resource management could affect resources on the 
other's land, the Director of OSM shall refer a copy of the petition to 
the other Federal land management agency and shall consider the agency's 
recommendations about designating those lands unsuitable for all or 
certain types of surface coal mining or terminating such designations.
    (g) OSM may determine not to process any petition received insofar 
as it pertains to lands for which an administratively complete permit 
application has been filed and the first newspaper notice has been 
published. Based on such a determination, OSM may issue a decision on a 
complete and accurate permit application and shall inform the petitioner 
why OSM cannot consider the part of the petition pertaining to the 
proposed permit area.

[48 FR 41354, Sept. 14, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 49324, Dec. 30, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 769.15  Intervention.

    Up to 3 days before the OSM holds a hearing on a petition under 
Sec. 769.17, any person may intervene in the proceeding by filing a 
statement describing how the designation directly affects the 
intervenor, allegations of facts and supporting evidence, a short 
statement identifying the petition to which the allegations pertain, and 
the intervenor's name, address and telephone number.


<R05>
Sec. 769.16  Public information.

    (a) Promptly after determining that a petition is complete, the 
Director shall notify the general public of the receipt of the petition 
and request submissions of the relevant information by a newspaper 
advertisement placed once a week for two consecutive weeks in the 
newspaper providing broadest circulation in the region of the petitioned 
area, and in the Federal Register. The advertisement and Federal

[[Page 194]]

Register notice shall include a description of the boundaries of the 
petitioned area, the allegations of fact, and information regarding 
where the petition is available for public review.
    (b)(1) Beginning immediately after a petition is filed, OSM shall 
compile and maintain a record consisting of all documents relating to 
the petition filed with or prepared by OSM with the exception of that 
information excluded under Sec. 769.16(b)(2). OSM shall make the record 
available to the public for inspection free of charge and for copying at 
a reasonable cost during all normal business hours at its Washington, 
D.C. office. OSM shall also maintain information in or near the area in 
which the petitioned land is located; this information shall be 
available for public inspection, free of charge, and for copying at 
reasonable cost during all normal business hours. At a minimum, this 
information shall include a copy of the petition.
    (2) OSM need not make available to any person or entity the specific 
location of property proposed to be nominated to be listed or listed in 
the National Register of Historic Places if it is determined that 
disclosure of that information would create a risk of destruction or 
harm to such properties. Withheld information must be disclosed when a 
designation of unsuitability would rest primarily on an allegation based 
on that information.


<R05>
Sec. 769.17  Hearing requirements.

    (a) Within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition, OSM shall 
hold a public hearing in the locality of the area covered by the 
petition. If all petitioners and intervenors agree, the hearing need not 
be held. OSM may subpoena witnesses as necessary. The hearing may be 
conducted with cross-examination of expert witnesses only. A record of 
the hearing shall be made and preserved. No person shall bear the burden 
of proof or persuasion. All relevant parts of the data base and 
inventory system and all public comments received during the public 
comment period shall be included in the record and considered by OSM in 
deciding the petition.

<R05>
Sec. 772.13  Coal exploration compliance duties.

    (a) All coal exploration and reclamation activities that 
substantially disturb the natural land surface shall be conducted in 
accordance with the coal exploration requirements of this part, part 815 
of this chapter, the regulatory program, and any exploration permit term 
or condition imposed by the regulatory authority.
    (b) Any person who conducts any coal exploration in violation of the 
provisions of this part, part 815 of this chapter, the regulatory 
program, or any exploration permit term or condition imposed by the 
regulatory authority shall be subject to the provisions of section 518 
of the Act, subchapter L of this chapter, and the applicable inspection 
and enforcement provisions of the regulatory program.


<R05>
Sec. 772.14  Commercial use or sale.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. Sec. 772.14(b) and 700.11(a)(5), 
any person who intends to commercially use or sell coal extracted during 
coal exploration operations under an exploration permit, shall first 
obtain a permit to conduct surface coal mining operations for those 
operations from the regulatory authority under parts 773 through 785 of 
this chapter.
    (b) With the prior written approval of the regulatory authority, no 
permit to conduct surface coal mining operations is required for the 
sale or commercial use of coal extracted during exploration operations 
if such sale or commercial use is for coal testing purposes only. The 
person conducting the exploration shall file an application for such 
approval with the regulatory authority. The application shall 
demonstrate that the coal testing is necessary for the development of a 
surface coal mining and reclamation operation for which a surface coal 
mining operations permit application is to be submitted in the near 
future, and that the proposed commercial use or sale of coal extracted 
during exploration operations is solely for the purpose of testing the 
coal. The application shall contain the following:
    (1) The name of the testing firm and the locations at which the coal 
will be tested.
    (2) If the coal will be sold directly to, or commercially used 
directly by, the intended end user, a statement from the intended end 
user, or if the coal is sold indirectly to the intended end user through 
an agent or broker, a statement from the agent or broker. The statement 
shall include:
    (i) The specific reason for the test, including why the coal may be 
so different from the intended user's other coal supplies as to require 
testing;
    (ii) The amount of coal necessary for the test and why a lesser 
amount is not sufficient; and
    (iii) A description of the specific tests that will be conducted.
    (3) Evidence that sufficient reserves of coal are available to the 
person conducting exploration or its principals for future commercial 
use or sale to the intended end user, or agent or broker of such user 
identified above, to

[[Page 200]]

demonstrate that the amount of coal to be removed is not the total 
reserve, but is a sampling of a larger reserve.
    (4) An explanation as to why other means of exploration, such as 
core drilling, are not adequate to determine the quality of the coal 
and/or the feasibility of developing a surface coal mining operation.

[53 FR 52949, Dec. 29, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 772.15  Public availability of information.

information submitted to the regulatory authority under this part shall 
be made available for public inspection and copying at the local offices 
of the regulatory authority closest to the exploration area.
    (b) The regulatory authority shall keep information confidential if 
the person submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, 
that it be kept confidential and the information concerns trade secrets 
or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the 
competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.
    (c) Information requested to be held as confidential under paragraph 
(b) of this section shall not be made publicly available until after 
notice and opportunity to be heard is afforded persons both seeking and 
opposing disclosure of the information.

Sec. 773.4  Requirements to obtain permits.

    (a) All operations. On and after 8 months from the effective date of 
a permanent regulatory program within a State, no person shall engage in 
or carry out any surface coal mining operations, unless such person has 
first obtained a permit issued by the regulatory authority except as 
provided for in paragraph (b) of this section. A permittee need not 
renew the permit if no surface coal mining operations will be conducted 
under the permit and solely reclamation activities remain to be done. 
Obligations established under a permit continue until completion of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations, regardless of whether 
the authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired 
or has been terminated, revoked, or suspended.
    (b) Continuation of initial program operations. (1) If a State 
program receives final disapproval under part 732 of this chapter, 
including judicial review of the disapproval, existing surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations may continue pursuant to the 
provisions of subchapter B of this chapter and section 502 of the Act 
until promulgation of a complete Federal program for the State. During 
this period, no new permits for surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations shall be issued by the State. Permits that lapse during this 
period may continue in full force and effect within the specified permit 
area until promulgation of a Federal program for the State.
    (2) Except for coal preparation plants separately authorized to 
operate under 30 CFR 785.21(e), a person conducting surface coal mining 
operations, under a permit issued or amended by the regulatory authority 
in accordance with the requirements of section 502 of the Act, may 
conduct such operations beyond the period prescribed in paragraph (a) of 
this section if--
    (i) Not later than 2 months following the effective date of a 
permanent regulatory program, regardless of litigation contesting that 
program, an application for a permanent regulatory program permit is 
filed for any operation to be conducted after the expiration of 8 months 
from such effective date in accordance with the provisions of the 
regulatory program;
    (ii) The regulatory authority has not yet rendered an initial 
administrative decision approving or disapproving the permit; and
    (iii) The surface coal mining and reclamation operation is conducted 
in compliance with the requirements of the Act, subchapter B of this 
chapter, applicable State statutes and regulations, and all terms and 
conditions of the initial program authorization or permit.
    (3) No new initial program permits may be issued after the effective 
date of a State program unless the application was received prior to 
such date.
    (c) Continued operations under Federal program permits. (1) A permit 
issued by the Director pursuant to a Federal program for a State shall 
be valid under any superseding State program approved by the Secretary.
    (2) The Federal permittee shall have the right to apply to the State 
regulatory authority for a State permit to supersede the Federal permit.
    (3) The State regulatory authority may review a permit issued 
pursuant to the superseded Federal program to determine that the 
requirements of the Act and the approved State program are not violated 
by the Federal permit, and to the extent that the approved State program 
contains additional requirements not contained in the Federal program 
for the State, the State regulatory authority shall--
    (i) Inform the permittee in writing;
    (ii) Provide the permittee an opportunity for a hearing;

[[Page 202]]

    (iii) Provide the permittee a reasonable opportunity to resubmit the 
permit application in whole or in part, as appropriate; and
    (iv) Provide the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations to the requirements of 
the State program.
    (d) Continued operations under State program permits. (1) A permit 
issued pursuant to a previously approved or conditionally approved State 
program shall be valid under a superseding Federal program.
    (2) Immediately following promulgation of a Federal program, the 
Director shall review the permits issued under the previously approved 
State program to determine that the requirements of the Act, this 
chapter, and the Federal program are not violated. If the Director 
determines that a permit was granted contrary to the requirments of this 
Act, the Director shall--
    (i) Inform the permittee in writing;
    (ii) Provide the permittee an opportunity for a hearing;
    (iii) Provide the permittee a reasonable opportunity to resubmit the 
permit application in whole or in part, as appropriate; and
    (iv) Provide the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations to the requirements of

Sec. 773.12  Permit eligibility determination.

    Based on the reviews required under Sec. Sec. 773.9 through 773.11 
of this part, we, the regulatory authority, will determine whether you, 
the applicant, are eligible for a permit under section 510(c) of the

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 773.13 and 773.14 of this part, 
you are not eligible for a permit if we find that any surface coal 
mining operation that--
    (1) You directly own or control has an unabated or uncorrected 
violation;
    (2) You or your operator indirectly own or control, regardless of 
when the ownership or control began, has an unabated or uncorrected 
violation cited on or after November 2, 1988; or
    (3) You or your operator indirectly own or control has an unabated 
or uncorrected violation, regardless of the date the violation was 
cited, and your ownership or control was established on or after 
November 2, 1988.
    (b) You are eligible to receive a permit under section 510(c) of the 
Act if any surface coal mining operation you or your operator indirectly 
own or control has an unabated or uncorrected violation and both the 
violation and your assumption of ownership or control occurred before 
November 2, 1988. However, you are not eligible to receive a permit if 
there was an established legal basis, independent of authority under 
section 510(c) of the Act, to deny the permit at the time you or your 
operator assumed indirect ownership or control or at the time the 
violation was cited, whichever is earlier.
    (c) We will not issue you a permit if you or your operator are 
permanently ineligible to receive a permit under Sec. 774.11(c) of this 
subchapter.
    (d) After we approve your permit under Sec. 773.15 of this part, we 
will not issue the permit until you comply with the information update 
and certification requirement of Sec. 778.9(d) of this subchapter. 
After you complete that requirement, we will again request a compliance 
history report from AVS to determine if there are any unabated or 
uncorrected violations which affect your permit eligibility under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. We will request this report no 
more than five business days before permit issuance under Sec. 773.19 
of this part.
    (e) If you are ineligible for a permit under this section, we will 
send you written notification of our decision. The notice will tell you 
why you are ineligible and include notice of your appeal rights under 
part 775 of this subchapter and 43 CFR 4.1360 through 4.1369.

    (2) Resulted from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface 
coal mining and reclamation operation on lands that are eligible for 
remining under a permit that was--
    (i) Issued before September 30, 2004, including subsequent renewals; 
and
    (ii) Held by the person applying for the new permit.
    (b) For permits issued under Sec. 785.25 of this subchapter, an 
event or condition is presumed to be unanticipated for the purpose of 
this section if it--
    (1) Arose after permit issuance;
    (2) Was related to prior mining; and
    (3) Was not identified in the permit application.

or the State regulatory program equivalent for which the abatement 
period has not yet expired; or
    (2) A violation that is unabated or uncorrected beyond the abatement 
or correction period.
    (b) We, the regulatory authority, may find you eligible for a 
provisionally issued permit if you demonstrate that one or more of the 
following circumstances exists with respect to all violations listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section--
    (1) For violations meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, you certify that the violation is being abated to the 
satisfaction of the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the 
violation, and we have no evidence to the contrary.
    (2) As applicable, you, your operator, and operations that you or 
your operator own or control are in compliance with the terms of any 
abatement plan (or, for delinquent fees or penalties, a payment 
schedule) approved by the agency with jurisdiction over the violation.
    (3) You are pursuing a good faith--
    (i) Challenge to all pertinent ownership or control listings or 
findings under Sec. Sec. 773.25 through 773.27 of this part; or
    (ii) Administrative or judicial appeal of all pertinent ownership or 
control listings or findings, unless there is an initial judicial 
decision affirming the listing or finding and that decision remains in 
force.
    (4) The violation is the subject of a good faith administrative or 
judicial appeal contesting the validity of the violation, unless there 
is an initial judicial decision affirming the violation and that 
decision remains in force.
    (c) We will consider a provisionally issued permit to be 
improvidently issued, and we must immediately initiate procedures under 
Sec. Sec. 773.22 and 773.23 of this part to suspend or rescind that 
permit, if--
    (1) Violations included in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not 
abated within the specified abatement period;
    (2) You, your operator, or operations that you or your operator own 
or control do not comply with the terms of an abatement plan or payment 
schedule mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
    (3) In the absence of a request for judicial review, the disposition 
of a challenge and any subsequent administrative review referenced in 
paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section affirms the validity of the 
violation or the ownership or control listing or finding; or
    (4) The initial judicial review decision referenced in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) or (4) of this section affirms the validity of the violation 
or the ownership or control listing or finding.

Sec. 773.15  Written findings for permit application approval.

    No permit application or application for a significant revision of a 
permit shall be approved unless the application affirmatively 
demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds, in writing, on the 
basis of information set forth in the application or from information 
otherwise available that is documented in the approval, the following:
    (a) The application is accurate and complete and the applicant has 
complied with all requirements of the Act and the regulatory program.
    (b) The applicant has demonstrated that reclamation as required by 
the Act and the regulatory program can be accomplished under the 
reclamation plan contained in the permit application.
    (c) The proposed permit area is--
    (1) Not within an area under study or administrative proceedings 
under a petition, filed pursuant to parts 764 and 769 of this chapter, 
to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining 
operations, unless the applicant demonstrates that before January 4, 
1977, he has made substantial legal and financial commitments in 
relation to the operation covered by the permit application; or
    (2) Not within an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal 
mining operations under parts 762 and 764 or 769

[[Page 208]]

of this chapter or within an area subject to the prohibitions of Sec. 
761.11 of this chapter.
    (d) For mining operations where the private mineral estate to be 
mined has been severed from the private surface estate, the applicant 
has submitted to the regulatory authority the documentation required 
under Sec. 778.15(b) of this chapter.
    (e) The regulatory authority has made an assessment of the probable 
cumulative impacts of all anticipated coal mining on the hydrologic 
balance in the cumulative impact area and has determined that the 
proposed operation has been designed to prevent material damage to the 
hydrologic balance outside the permit area.
    (f) The applicant has demonstrated that any existing structure will 
comply with Sec. 701.11(d), and the applicable performance standards of 
subchapter B or K of this chapter.
    (g) The applicant has paid all reclamation fees from previous and 
existing operations as required by subchapter R of this chapter.
    (h) The applicant has satisfied the applicable requirements of part 
785 of this chapter.
    (i) The applicant has, if applicable, satisfied the requirements for 
approval of a long-term, intensive agricultural postmining land use, in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 816.111(d) or Sec. 
817.111(d).
    (j) The operation would not affect the continued existence of 
endangered or threatened species or result in destruction or adverse 
modification of their critical habitats, as determined under the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).
    (k) The regulatory authority has taken into account the effect of 
the proposed permitting action on properties listed on and eligible for 
listing on the National Register of Historic Places. This finding may be 
supported in part by inclusion of appropriate permit conditions or 
changes in the operation plan protecting historic resources, or a 
documented decision that the regulatory authority has determined that no 
additional protection measures are necessary.
    (l) For a proposed remining operation where the applicant intends to 
reclaim in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 816.106 or Sec. 
817.106 of this chapter, the site of the operation is a previously mined 
area as defined in Sec. 701.5 of this chapter.
    (m) For permits to be issued under Sec. 785.25 of this chapter, the 
permit application must contain:
    (i) Lands eligible for remining;
    (ii) An identification of the potential environmental and safety 
problems related to prior mining activity which could reasonably be 
anticipated to occur at the site; and
    (iii) Mitigation plans to sufficiently address these potential 
environmental and safety problems so that reclamation as required by the 
applicable requirements of the regulatory program can be accomplished.
    (n) The applicant is eligible to receive a permit, based on the 
reviews under Sec. Sec. 773.7 through 773.14 of this part.

Sec. 773.21  Initial review and finding requirements for improvidently 
issued permits.

    (a) If we, the regulatory authority, have reason to believe that we 
improvidently issued a permit to you, the permittee, we must review the 
circumstances under which the permit was issued. We will make a 
preliminary finding that your permit was improvidently issued if, under 
the permit eligibility criteria of the applicable regulations 
implementing section 510(c) of the Act in effect at the time of permit 
issuance, your permit should not have been issued because you or your 
operator owned or controlled a surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation with an unabated or uncorrected violation.
    (b) We will make a finding under paragraph (a) of this section only 
if you or your operator--
    (1) Continue to own or control the operation with the unabated or 
uncorrected violation;
    (2) The violation remains unabated or uncorrected; and
    (3) The violation would cause you to be ineligible under the permit 
eligibility criteria in our current regulations.
    (c) When we make a preliminary finding under paragraph (a) of this 
section, we must--
    (1) Serve you with a written notice of the preliminary finding; and
    (2) Post the notice at our office closest to the permit area and on 
the AVS Office Internet home page (Internet address: http://
www.avs.osmre.gov).
    (d) Within 30 days of receiving a notice under paragraph (c) of this 
section, you may challenge the preliminary finding by providing us with 
evidence as to why the permit was not improvidently issued under the 
criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) The provisions of Sec. Sec. 773.25 through 773.27 of this part 
apply when a challenge under paragraph (d) of this section concerns a 
preliminary finding under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section that 
you or your operator currently own or control, or owned or controlled, a 
surface coal mining operation.

Sec. 778.1  Scope and purpose.

    This part establishes the minimum requirements for the permit 
applications for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under a 
State or Federal program. This part covers minimum legal, financial, and 
compliance requirements and general information that must be contained 
in permit applications. This part applies to any person who submits an 
application to a regulatory authority for a permit to conduct surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations.


<R05>
Sec. 778.8  Information collection.

    (a) Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of 
this part. Section 507(b) of the Act provides that persons applying for 
a permit to conduct surface coal mining operations

must submit to the regulatory authority certain information regarding 
the applicant and affiliated entities, their compliance status and 
history, property ownership and other property rights, violation 
information, right of entry, liability insurance, the status of 
unsuitability claims, and proof of publication of a newspaper notice. 
The regulatory authority uses this information to ensure that all legal, 
financial and compliance requirements are satisfied before issuance of a 
permit. Persons seeking to conduct surface coal mining operations must 
respond to obtain a benefit. A Federal agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The 
OMB clearance number for this part is 1029-0117.
    (b) We estimate that the public reporting and record keeping burden 
for this part averages 27 hours per response, including time spent 
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and 
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection 
of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any 
other aspect of these information collection and record keeping 
requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the 
Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Information 
Collection Clearance Officer, 1951 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington,

authority shall provide an assessment of the probable cumulative 
hydrologic impacts (CHIA) of the proposed operation and all anticipated 
mining upon surface- and ground-water systems in the cumulative impact 
area. The CHIA shall be sufficient to determine, for purposes of permit 
approval, whether

[[Page 234]]

the proposed operation has been designed to prevent material damage to 
the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. The regulatory authority 
may allow the applicant to submit data and analyses relevant to the CHIA 
with the permit application.
    (2) An application for a permit revision shall be reviewed by the

    (a) Pre-subsidence survey. Each application must include:
    (1) A map of the permit and adjacent areas at a scale of 1:12,000, 
or larger if determined necessary by the regulatory authority, showing 
the location and type of structures and renewable resource lands that 
subsidence may materially damage or for which the value or reasonably 
foreseeable use may be diminished by subsidence, and showing the 
location and type of drinking, domestic, and residential water supplies 
that could be contaminated, diminished, or interrupted by subsidence.
    (2) A narrative indicating whether subsidence, if it occurred, could 
cause material damage to or diminish the value or reasonably foreseeable 
use of such structures or renewable resource lands or could contaminate, 
diminish, or interrupt drinking, domestic, or residential water 
supplies.
    (3) A survey of the condition of all non-commercial buildings or 
occupied residential dwellings and structures related thereto, that may 
be materially damaged or for which the reasonably foreseeable use may be

of such structures or lands, and no contamination, diminution, or 
interruption of such water supplies would occur as a result of mine 
subsidence, and if the regulatory authority agrees with this conclusion, 
no further information need be provided under this section. If the 
survey shows that structures, renewable resource lands, or water 
supplies exist and that subsidence could cause material damage or 
diminution in value or reasonably foreseeable use, or contamination, 
diminution, or interruption of protected water supplies, or if the 
regulatory authority determines that damage, diminution in value or 
foreseeable use, or contamination, diminution, or interruption could 
occur, the application must include a subsidence control plan that 
contains the following information:
    (1) A description of the method of coal removal, such as longwall 
mining, room-and-pillar removal or hydraulic mining, including the size, 
sequence and timing of the development of underground workings;

prevent or minimize subsidence and subsidence-related damage; and, when 
applicable, to correct subsidence-related material damage;
    (3) A description of the physical conditions, such as depth of 
cover, seam thickness and lithology of overlaying strata, that affect 
the likelihood or extent of subsidence and subsidence-related damage;
    (4) A description of the monitoring, if any, needed to determine the 
commencement and degree of subsidence so that, when appropriate, other 
measures can be taken to prevent, reduce or correct material damage in 
accordance with Sec. 817.121(c) of this chapter;
    (5) Except for those areas where planned subsidence is projected to 
be used, a detailed description of the subsidence control measures that

    (a) This section applies to any person who conducts or intends to 
conduct surface mining activities by mountaintop removal mining.
    (b) Mountaintop removal mining means surface mining activities, 
where the mining operation removes an entire coal seam or seams running 
through the upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill, except as 
provided for in 30 CFR 824.11(a)(6), by removing substantially all of 
the overburden off the bench and creating a level plateau or a gently 
rolling contour, with no highwalls remaining, and capable of supporting 
postmining land uses in accordance with the requirements of this 
section.
    (c) The regulatory authority may issue a permit for mountaintop 
removal mining, without regard to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
816.102, 816.104, 816.105, and 816.107 of this chapter to restore the 
lands disturbed by such mining to their approximate original contour, if 
it first finds, in writing, on the basis of a complete application, that 
the following requirements are met:
    (1) The proposed postmining land use of the lands to be affected 
will be an industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or public 
facility (including recreational facilities) use and, if--
    (i) After consultation with the appropriate land-use planning 
agencies, if any, the proposed land use is deemed by the regulatory 
authority to constitute an equal or better economic or public use of the 
affected land compared with the pre-mining use;
    (ii) The applicant demonstrates compliance with the requirements for 
acceptable alternative postmining land uses of paragraphs (a) through 
(c) of Sec. 816.133 of this chapter;
    (iii) The applicant has presented specific plans for the proposed 
postmining land use and appropriate assurances that such use will be--
    (A) Compatible with adjacent land uses;
    (B) Obtainable according to data regarding expected need and market;
    (C) Assured of investment in necessary public facilities;
    (D) Supported by commitments from public agencies where appropriate;

completion of the proposed use;
    (F) Planned pursuant to a schedule attached to the reclamation plan 
so as to integrate the mining operation and reclamation with the 
postmining land use; and
    (G) Designed by a registered engineer in conformance with 
professional standards established to assure the stability, drainage, 
and configuation necessary for the intended use of the site.
    (iv) The proposed use would be consistent with adjacent land use and 
existing State and local land use plans and programs; and
    (v) The regulatory authority has provided, in writing, an 
opportunity of not more than 60 days to review and comment on such 
proposed use to the governing body of general purpose government in 
whose jurisdiction the land is located and any State or Federal agency 
which the regulatory authority, in its discretion, determines to have an 
interest in the proposed use.
    (2) The applicant demonstrates that in place of restoration of the 
land to be affected to the approximate original contour under Sec. Sec. 
816.102, 816.104, 816.105, and 816.107 of this chapter, the operation 
will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of part 824 of 
this chapter.
    (3) The requirements of 30 CFR 824 are made a specific condition of 
the permit.
    (4) All other requirements of the Act, this chapter, and the 
regulatory program are met by the proposed operations.
    (5) The permit is clearly identified as being for mountaintop 
removal mining.
    (d)(1) Any permits incorporating a variance issued under this 
section shall be reviewed by the regulatory authority to evaluate the 
progress and development of mining activities to establish that the 
operator is proceeding in

[[Page 261]]

accordance with the terms of the variance--
    (i) Within the sixth month preceding the third year from the date of 
its issuance;
    (ii) Before each permit renewal; and
    (iii) Not later than the middle of each permit term.
    (2) Any review required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section need 
not be held if the permittee has demonstrated and the regulatory 
authority finds, in writing, within three months before the scheduled 
review, that all operations under the permit are proceeding and will 
continue to be conducted in accordance with the terms of the permit and 
requirements of the Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program.
    (3) The terms and conditions of a permit for mountaintop removal 
mining may be modified at any time by the regulatory authority, if it 
determines that more stringent measures are necessary to insure that the 
operation involved is conducted in compliance with the requirements of 
the Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program.

<R05>
Sec. 785.16  Permits incorporating variances from approximate original 
contour restoration requirements for steep slope mining.

    (a) The regulatory authority may issue a permit for non-mountaintop 
removal, steep slope, surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
which includes a variance from the requirements to restore the disturbed 
areas to their approximate original contour that are contained in 
Sec. Sec. 816.102, 816.104, 816.105, and 816.107, or Sec. Sec. 817.102 
and 817.107 of this chapter. The permit may contain such a variance only 
if the regulatory authority finds, in writing, that the applicant has 
demonstrated, on the basis of a complete application, that the following 
requirments are met:
    (1) After reclamation, the lands to be affected by the variance 
within the permit area will be suitable for an industrial, commercial, 
residential, or public postmining land use (including recreational 
facilities).
    (2) The requirements of Sec. 816.133 or Sec. 817.133 of this 
chapter will be met.
    (3) The watershed of lands within the proposed permit and adjacent 
areas will be improved by the operations when compared with the 
condition of the watershed before mining or with its condition if the 
approximate original contour were to be restored. The watershed will be 
deemed improved only if--
    (i) The amount of total suspended solids or other pollutants 
discharged to ground or surface water from the permit area will be 
reduced, so as to improve the public or private uses or the ecology of 
such water, or flood hazards within the watershed containing the permit 
area will be reduced by reduction of the peak flow discharge from 
precipitation events or thaws;
    (ii) The total volume of flow from the proposed permit area, during 
every season of the year, will not vary in a way that adversely affects 
the ecology of

[[Page 262]]

any surface water or any existing or planned use of surface or ground 
water; and
    (iii) The appropriate State environmental agency approves the plan.
    (4) The owner of the surface of the lands within the permit area has 
knowingly requested, in writing, as part of the application, that a 
variance be granted. The request shall be made separately from any 
surface owner consent given for the operations under Sec. 778.15 of 
this chapter and shall show an understanding that the variance could not 
be granted without the surface owner's request.
    (b) If a variance is granted under this section--
    (1) The requirements of Sec. 816.133(d) or Sec. 817.133(d) of this 
chapter shall be included as a specific condition of the permit; and
    (2) The permit shall be specifically marked as containing a variance 
from approximate original contour.
    (c) A permit incorporating a variance under this section shall be 
reviewed by the regulatory authority at least every 30 months following 
the issuance of the permit to evaluate the progress and development of 
the surface coal mining and reclamation operations to establish that the 
operator is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the variance.
    (d) If the permittee demonstrates to the regulatory authority that 
the operations have been, and continue to be, conducted in compliance 
with the terms and conditions of the permit, the requirements of the 
Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program, the review specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section need not be held.
    (e) The terms and conditions of a permit incorporating a variance 
under this section may be modified at any time by the regulatory 
authority, if it determines that more stringent measures are necessary 
to ensure that the operations involved are conducted in compliance with 
the requirements of the Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program.
    (f) The regulatory authority may grant variances in accordance with 
this section only if it has promulgated specific rules to govern the 
granting of variances in accordance with the provisions of this section 
and any necessary, more stringent requirements.

Sec. 785.17  Prime farmland.

    (a) This section applies to any person who conducts or intends to 
conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on prime 
farmlands historically used for cropland. This section does not apply 
to:
    (1) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
are conducted pursuant to any permit issued prior to August 3, 1977; or
    (2) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
are conducted pursuant to any renewal or revision of a permit issued 
prior to August 3, 1977; or
    (3) Lands included in any existing surface coal mining operations 
for which a permit was issued for all or any part thereof prior to 
August 3, 1977, provided that:
    (i) Such lands are part of a single continuous surface coal mining 
operation begun under a permit issued before August 3, 1977; and
    (ii) The permittee had a legal right to mine the lands prior to 
August 3, 1977, through ownership, contract, or lease but not including 
an option to buy, lease, or contract; and
    (iii) The lands contain part of a continuous recoverable coal seam 
that was being mined in a single continuous mining pit (or multiple pits 
if the lands are proven to be part of a single continuous surface coal 
mining operation) begun under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977.
    (4) For purposes of this section:
    (i) ``Renewal'' of a permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory 
authority to extend the time by which the permittee may complete mining 
within the boundaries of the original permit, and ``revision'' of the 
permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to allow 
changes in the method of mining operations within the original permit 
area, or the decision of the regulatory authority to allow incidental 
boundary changes to the original permit;

[[Page 263]]

    (ii) A pit shall be deemed to be a single continuous mining pit even 
if portions of the pit are crossed by a road, pipeline, railroad, or 
powerline or similar crossing;
    (iii) A single continuous surface coal mining operation is presumed 
to consist only of a single continuous mining pit under a permit issued 
prior to August 3, 1977, but may include non-contiguous parcels if the 
operator can prove by clear and convincing evidence that, prior to 
August 3, 1977, the non-contiguous parcels were part of a single 
permitted operation. For the purposes of this paragraph, clear and 
convincing evidence includes, but is not limited to, contracts, leases, 
deeds or other properly executed legal documents (not including options) 
that specifically treat physically separate parcels as one surface coal 
mining operation.
    (b) Application contents--Reconnaissance inspection. (1) All permit 
applications, whether or not prime farmland is present, shall include 
the results of a reconnaissance inspection of the proposed permit area 
to indicate whether prime farmland exists. The regulatory authority in 
consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service shall determine the 
nature and extent of the required reconnaissance inspection.
    (2) If the reconnaissance inspection establishes that no land within 
the proposed permit area is prime farmland historically used for 
cropland, the applicant shall submit a statement that no prime farmland 
is present. The statement shall identify the basis upon which such a 
conclusion was reached.
    (3) If the reconnaissance inspection indicates that land within the 
proposed permit area may be prime farmland historically used for 
cropland, the applicant shall determine if a soil survey exists for 
those lands and whether soil mapping units in the permit area have been 
designated as prime farmland. If no soil survey exists, the applicant 
shall have a soil survey made of the lands within the permit area which 
the reconnaissance inspection indicates could be prime farmland. Soil 
surveys of the detail used by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service for 
operational conservation planning shall be used to identify and locate 
prime farmland soils.
    (i) If the soil survey indicates that no prime farmland soils are 
present within the proposed permit area, paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section shall apply.
    (ii) If the soil survey indicates that prime farmland soils are 
present within the proposed permit area, paragraph (c) of this section 
shall apply.
    (c) Application contents--Prime farmland. All permit applications 
for areas in which prime farmland has been identified within the 
proposed permit area shall include the following:
    (1) A soil survey of the permit area according to the standards of 
the National Cooperative Soil Survey and in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436

November 16, 1982. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service establishes the 
standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey and maintains a 
National Soils Handbook which gives current acceptable procedures for 
conducting soil surveys. This National Soils Handbook is available for 
review at area and State SCS offices.
    (i) U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and 18 are 
incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of adoption of this 
section. Notices of changes made to these publications will be 
periodically published by OSM in the Federal Register. The handbooks are 
on file and available for inspection at the OSM Central Office, U.S. 
Department of the Interior, 1951 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, 
DC, at each OSM Technical Center and Field Office, and at the central 
office of the applicable State regulatory authority, if any. Copies of 
these documents are also available from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock Nos. 001-

regulations/ibr--locations.html. Incorporation by reference provisions 
were approved by the Director of the Federal Register on June 29, 1981.
    (ii) The soil survey shall include a description of soil mapping 
units and a representative soil profile as determined by the U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service, including, but not limited to, soil-horizon 
depths, pH, and the range of soil densities for each prime farmland soil 
unit within the permit area. Other representative soil-profile 
descriptions from the locality, prepared according to the standards of 
the National Cooperative Soil Survey, may be used if their use is 
approved by the State Conservationist, U.S. Soil Conservation Service. 
The regulatory authority may request the operator to provide information 
on other physical and chemical soil properties as needed to make a 
determination that the operator has the technological capability to 
restore the prime farmland within the permit area to the soil-
reconstruction standards of Part 823 of this chapter.
    (2) A plan for soil reconstruction, replacement, and stabilization 
for the purpose of establishing the technological capability of the mine 
operator to comply with the requirements of part 823 of this chapter.
    (3) Scientific data, such as agricultural-school studies, for areas 
with comparable soils, climate, and management that demonstrate that the 
proposed method of reclamation, including the use of soil mixtures or 
substitutes, if any, will achieve, within a reasonable time, levels of 
yield equivalent to, or higher than, those of nonmined prime farmland in 
the surrounding area.
    (4) The productivity prior to mining, including the average yield of 
food, fiber, forage, or wood products obtained under a high level of 
management.
    (d) Consultation with Secretary of Agriculture. (1) The Secretary of 
Agriculture has responsibilities with respect to prime farmland soils 
and has assigned the prime farmland responsibilities arising under the 
Act to the Chief of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service shall carry out consultation and review through the 
State Conservationist located in each State.
    (2) The State Conservationist shall provide to the regulatory 
authority a list of prime farmland soils, their location, physical and 
chemical characteristics, crop yields, and associated data necessary to 
support adequate prime farmland soil descriptions.
    (3) The State Conservationist shall assist the regulatory authority 
in describing the nature and extent of the reconnaissance inspection 
required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) Before any permit is issued for areas that include prime 
farmland, the regulatory authority shall consult with the State 
Conservationist. The State Conservationist shall provide for the review 
of, and comment on, the proposed method of soil reconstruction in the 
plan submitted under paragraph (c) of this section. If the State 
Conservationist considers those methods to be inadequate, he or she 
shall suggest revisions to the regulatory authority which result in more 
complete and adequate reconstruction.
    (e) Issuance of permit. A permit for the mining and reclamation of 
prime farmland may be granted by the regulatory authority, if it first 
finds, in writing, upon the basis of a complete application, that--
    (1) The approved proposed postmining land use of these prime 
farmlands will be cropland;
    (2) The permit incorporates as specific conditions the contents of 
the plan submitted under paragraph (c) of this section, after 
consideration of any revisions to that plan suggested by the State 
Conservationist under paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
    (3) The applicant has the technological capability to restore the 
prime farmland, within a reasonable time, to equivalent or higher levels 
of yield as

<R05>
Sec. 785.19  Surface coal mining and reclamation operations on areas 

or adjacent to areas including alluvial valley floors in the arid and 
semiarid areas west 
          of the 100th meridian.

    (a) Alluvial valley floor determination. (1) Permit applicants who 
propose to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within 
a valley holding a stream or in a location where the permit area or 
adjacent area includes any stream, in the arid and semiarid regions of 
the United States, as an initial step in the permit process, may request 
the regulatory authority to make an alluvial valley floor determination 
with respect to that valley floor. The applicant shall demonstrate and 
the regulatory authority shall determine, based on either available data 
or field studies submitted by the applicant, or a combination of 
available data and field studies, the presence or absence of an alluvial 
valley floor. Studies shall include sufficiently detailed geologic, 
hydrologic, land use, soils, and vegetation data and analysis to 
demonstrate the probable existence of an alluvial valley floor in the 
area. The regulatory authority may require additional data collection 
and analysis or other supporting documents, maps, and illustrations in 
order to make the determination.
    (2) The regulatory authority shall make a written determination as 
to the extent of any alluvial valley floors within the area. The 
regulatory authority shall determine that an alluvial valley floor 
exists if it finds that--
    (i) Unconsolidated streamlaid deposits holding streams are present; 
and
    (ii) There is sufficient water available to support agricultural 
activities as evidenced by--
    (A) The existence of current flood irrigation in the area in 
question;
    (B) The capability of an area to be flood irrigated, based on 
evaluations of typical regional agricultural practices, historical flood 
irrigation, streamflow, water quality, soils, and topography; or
    (C) Subirrigation of the lands in question derived from the ground-
water system of the valley floor.
    (3) If the regulatory authority determines in writing that an 
alluvial valley does not exist pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, no further consideration of this section is required.
    (b) Applicability of statutory exclusions. (1) If an alluvial valley 
floor is identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the 
proposed surface coal mining operation may affect this alluvial valley 
floor or waters that supply the alluvial valley floor, the applicant may 
request the regulatory authority, as a preliminary step in the permit 
application process, to separately determine the applicability of the 
statutory exclusions set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 
regulatory authority may make such a determination

[[Page 267]]

based on the available data, may require additional data collection and 
analysis in order to make the determination, or may require the 
applicant to submit a complete permit application and not make the 
determination until after the complete application is evaluated.
    (2) An applicant need not submit the information required in 
paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section and a regulatory 
authority is not required to make the findings of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) 
and (ii) of this section when the regulatory authority determines that 
one of the following circumstances, heretofore called statutory 
exclusions, exist:
    (i) The premining land use is undeveloped rangeland which is not 
significant to farming;
    (ii) Any farming on the alluvial valley floor that would be affected 
by the surface coal mining operation is of such small acreage as to be 
of negligible impact on the farm's agricultural production. Negligible 
impact of the proposed operation on farming will be based on the 
relative importance of the affected farmland areas of the alluvial 
valley floor area to the farm's total agricultural production over the 
life of the mine; or
    (iii) The circumstances set forth in Sec. 822.12(b) (3) or (4) of 
this chapter exist.
    (3) For the purpose of this section, a farm is one or more land 
units on which farming is conducted. A farm is generally considered to 
be the combination of land units with acreage and boundaries in 
existence prior to August 3, 1977, or if established after August 3, 
1977, with those boundaries based on enhancement of the farm's 
agricultural productivity and not related to surface coal operations.
    (c) Summary denial. If the regulatory authority determines that the 
statutory exclusions are not applicable and that any of the required 
findings of paragraph (e)(2) of this section cannot be made, the 
regulatory authority may, at the request of the applicant:
    (1) Determine that mining is precluded on the proposed permit area 
and deny the permit without the applicant filing any additional 
information required by this section; or
    (2) Prohibit surface coal mining and reclamation operations in all 
or parts of the area to be affected by mining.
    (d) Application contents for operations affecting designated 
alluvial valley floors. (1) If land within the permit area or adjacent 
area is identified as an alluvial valley floor and the proposed surface 
coal mining operation may affect an alluvial valley floor or waters 
supplied to an alluvial valley floor, the applicant shall submit a 
complete application for the proposed surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations to be used by the regulatory authority together 
with other relevant information as a basis for approval or denial of the 
permit. If an exclusion of paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, 
then the applicant need not submit the information required in 
paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (2) The complete application shall include detailed surveys and 
baseline data required by the regulatory authority for a determination 
of--
    (i) The essential hydrologic functions of the alluvial valley floor 
which might be affected by the mining and reclamation process. The 
information required by this subparagraph shall evaluate those factors 
which contribute to the collecting, storing, regulating and making the 
natural flow of water available for agricultural activities on the 
alluvial valley floor and shall include, but are not limited to:
    (A) Factors contributing to the function of collecting water, such 
as amount, rate and frequency of rainfall and runoff, surface roughness, 
slope and vegetative cover, infiltration, and evapotranspiration, 
relief, slope and density of drainage channels;
    (B) Factors contributing to the function of storing water, such as 
permeability, infiltration, porosity, depth and direction of ground 
water flow, and water holding capacity;
    (C) Factors contributing to the function of regulating the flow of 
surface and ground water, such as the longitudinal profile and slope of 
the valley and channels, the sinuosity and cross-sections of the 
channels, interchange of water between streams and associated alluvial 
and bedrock aquifers, and rates and amount of water supplied by these 
aquifers; and

[[Page 268]]

    (D) Factors contributing to water availability, such as the presence 
of flood plains and terraces suitable for agricultural activities.
    (ii) Whether the operation will avoid during mining and reclamation 
the interruption, discontinuance, or preclusion of farming on the 
alluvial valley floor;
    (iii) Whether the operation will cause material damage to the 
quantity or quality of surface or ground waters supplied to the alluvial 
valley floor;
    (iv) Whether the reclamation plan is in compliance with requirements 
of the Act, this chapter, and regulatory program; and
    (v) Whether the proposed monitoring system will provide sufficient 
information to measure compliance with part 822 of this chapter during 
and after mining and reclamation operations.
    (e) Findings. (1) The findings of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section are not required with regard to alluvial valley floors to 
which are applicable any of the exclusions of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) No permit or permit revision application for surface coal mining 
and reclamation operations on lands located west of the 100th meridian 
west longitude shall be approved by the regulatory authority unless the 
application demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds in writing, 
on the basis of information set forth in the application, that--
    (i) The proposed operations will not interrupt, discontinue, or 
preclude farming on an alluvial valley floor;
    (ii) The proposed operations will not materially damage the quantity 
or quality of water in surface and underground water systems that supply 
alluvial valley floors; and
    (iii) The proposed operations will comply with part 822 of this 
chapter and the other applicable requirements of the Act and the 
regulatory program.

[56 FR 59994, Nov. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 800.11  Requirement to file a bond.

    (a) After a permit application under subchapter G of this chapter 
has been approved, but before a permit is issued, the applicant shall 
file with the regulatory authority, on a form prescribed and furnished 
by the regulatory authority, a bond or bonds for performance made 
payable to the regulatory authority and conditioned upon the faithful 
performance of all the requirements of the Act, the regulatory program, 
the permit, and the reclamation plan.
    (b)(1) The bond or bonds shall cover the entire permit area, or an 
identified increment of land within the permit area upon which the 
operator will initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations during the initial term of the permit.
    (2) As surface coal mining and reclamation operations on succeeding 
increments are initiated and conducted within the permit area, the 
permittee shall file with the regulatory authority an additional bond or 
bonds to cover such increments in accordance with this section.
    (3) The operator shall identify the initial and successive areas or 
increments for bonding on the permit application map submitted for 
approval as provided in the application (under parts 780 and 784 of this 
chapter), and shall specify the bond amount to be provided for each area 
or increment.
    (4) Independent increments shall be of sufficient size and 
configuration to provide for efficient reclamation operations should 
reclamation by the regulatory authority become necessary pursuant to 
Sec. 800.50.
    (c) An operator shall not disturb any surface areas, succeeding 
increments, or extend any underground shafts, tunnels or operations 
prior to acceptance by the regulatory authority of the required 
performance bond.
    (d) The applicant shall file, with the approval of the regulatory 
authority, a bond or bonds under one of the following schemes to cover 
the bond

[[Page 277]]

amounts for the permit area as determined in accordance with Sec. 
800.14:
    (1) A performance bond or bonds for the entire permit area;
    (2) A cumulative bond schedule and the performance bond required for 
full reclamation of the initial area to be disturbed; or
    (3) An incremental bond schedule and the performance bond required 
for the first increment in the schedule.
    (e) OSM may approve, as part of a State or Federal program, an 
alternative bonding system, if it will achieve the following objectives 
and purposes of the bonding program:
    (1) The alternative must assure that the regulatory authority will 
have available sufficient money to complete the reclamation plan for any 
areas which may be in default at any time; and
    (2) The alternative must provide a substantial economic incentive 
for the permittee to comply with all reclamation provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 800.12  Form of the performance bond.

    The regulatory authority shall prescribe the form of the performance 
bond. The regulatory authority may allow for:
    (a) A surety bond;
    (b) A collateral bond;
    (c) A self-bond; or
    (d) A combination of any of these bonding methods.


<R05>
Sec. 800.13  Period of liability.

    (a)(1) Performance bond liability shall be for the duration of the 
surface coal mining and reclamation operation and for a period which is 
coincident with the operator's period of extended responsibility for 
successful revegetation provided in Sec. 816.116 or Sec. 817.116 of 
this chapter or until achievement of the reclamation requirements of the 
Act, regulatory programs, and permit, whichever is later.
    (2) With the approval of regulatory authority, a bond may be posted 
and approved to guarantee specific phases of reclamation within the 
permit area provided the sum of phase bonds posted equals or exceeds the 
total amount required under Sec. Sec. 800.14 and 800.15. The scope of 
work to be guaranteed and the liability assumed under each phase bond 
shall be specified in detail.
    (b) Isolated and clearly defined portions of the permit area 
requiring extended liability may be separated from the original area and 
bonded separately with the approval of the regulatory authority. Such 
areas shall be limited in extent and not constitute a scattered, 
intermittent, or checkerboard pattern of failure. Access to the 
separated areas for remedial work may be included in the area under 
extended liability if deemed necessary by the regulatory authority.
    (c) If the regulatory authority approves a long-term, intensive 
agricultural postmining land use, in accordance with Sec. 816.133 or 
Sec. 817.133 of this chapter, the applicable 5 or 10 year period of 
liability shall commence at the date of initial planting for such long-
term agricultural use.
    (d)(1) The bond liability of the permittee shall include only those 
actions which he or she is obligated to take under the permit, including 
completion of the reclamation plan, so that the land will be capable of 
supporting the postmining land use approved under Sec. 816.133 or Sec. 
817.133 of this chapter.
    (2) Implementation of an alternative postmining land use approved 
under Sec. Sec. 816.133(c) and 817.133(c) which is beyond the control 
of the permittee, need not be covered by the bond. Bond liability for 
prime farmland shall be as specified in Sec. 800.40(c)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 800.14  Determination of bond amount.

    (a) The amount of the bond required for each bonded area shall:
    (1) Be determined by the regulatory authority;
    (2) Depend upon the requirements of the approved permit and 
reclamation plan;
    (3) Reflect the probable difficulty of reclamation, giving 
consideration to such factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and 
revegetation potential; and
    (4) Be based on, but not limited to, the estimated cost submitted by 
the permit applicant.
    (b) The amount of the bond shall be sufficient to assure the 
completion of the reclamation plan if the work has to

[[Page 278]]

be performed by the regulatory authority in the event of forfeiture, and 
in no case shall the total bond initially posted for the entire area 
under one permit be less than $10,000.
    (c) An operator's financial responsibility under Sec. 817.121(c) of 
this chapter for repairing material damage resulting from subsidence may 
be satisfied by the liability insurance policy required under Sec. 
800.60.


<R05>
Sec. 800.15  Adjustment of amount.

    (a) The amount of the bond or deposit required and the terms of the 
acceptance of the applicant's bond shall be adjusted by the regulatory 
authority from time to time as the area requiring bond coverage is 
increased or decreased or where the cost of future reclamation changes. 
The regulatory authority may specify periodic times or set a schedule 
for reevaluating and adjusting the bond amount to fulfill this 
requirement.
    (b) The regulatory authority shall--
    (1) Notify the permittee, the surety, and any person with a property 
interest in collateral who has requested notification under Sec. 
800.21(f) of any proposed adjustment to the bond amount; and
    (2) Provide the permittee an opportunity for an informal conference 
on the adjustment.
    (c) A permittee may request reduction of the amount of the 
performance bond upon submission of evidence to the regulatory authority 
proving that the permittee's method of operation or other circumstances 
reduces the estimated cost for the regulatory authority to reclaim the 
bonded area. Bond adjustments which involve undisturbed land or revision 
of the cost estimate of reclamation are not considered bond release 
subject to procedures of Sec. 800.40.
    (d) In the event that an approved permit is revised in accordance 
with subchapter G of this chapter, the regulatory authority shall review 
the bond for adequacy and, if necessary, shall require adjustment of the 
bond to conform to the permit as revised.


<R05>
Sec. 800.16  General terms and conditions of bond.

    (a) The performance bond shall be in an amount determined by the 
regulatory authority as provided in Sec. 800.14.
    (b) The performance bond shall be payable to the regulatory 
authority.
    (c) The performance bond shall be conditioned upon faithful 
performance of all the requirements of the Act, this chapter, the 
regulatory program, and the approved permit, including completion of the 
reclamation plan.
    (d) The duration of the bond shall be for the time period provided 
in Sec. 800.13.
    (e)(1) The bond shall provide a mechanism for a bank or surety 
company to give prompt notice to the regulatory authority and the 
permittee of any action filed alleging the insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the surety company, the bank, or the permittee, or alleging any 
violations which would result in suspension or revocation of the surety 
or bank charter or license to do business.
    (2) Upon the incapacity of a bank or surety company by reason of 
bankruptcy, insolvency, or suspension or revocation of a charter or 
license, the permittee shall be deemed to be without bond coverage and 
shall promptly notify the regulatory authority. The regulatory 
authority, upon notification received through procedures of paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section or from the permittee, shall, in writing, notify 
the operator who is without bond coverage and specify a reasonable 
period, not to exceed 90 days, to replace bond coverage. If an adequate 
bond is not posted by the end of the period allowed, the operator shall 
cease coal extraction and shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 
816.132 or Sec. 817.132 of this chapter and shall immediately begin to 
conduct reclamation operations in accordance with the reclamation plan. 
Mining operations shall not resume until the regulatory authority has 
determined that an acceptable bond has been posted.


<R05>
Sec. 800.17  Bonding requirements for underground coal mines and 
long-term coal-related surface facilities and structures.

    (a) Responsibilities. The regulatory authority shall require bond 
coverage, in an amount determined under Sec. 800.14, for long-term 
surface facilities and structures, and for areas disturbed by surface 
impacts incident to underground mines, for which a permit is required. 
Specific reclamation techniques required for underground mines

[[Page 279]]

and long-term facilities shall be considered in determining the amount 
of bond to complete the reclamation.
    (b) Long-term period of liability. (1) The period of liability for 
every bond covering long-term surface disturbances shall commence with 
the issuance of a permit, except that to the extent that such 
disturbances will occur on a succeeding increment to be bonded, such 
liability will commence upon the posting of the bond for that increment 
before the initial surface disturbance of that increment. The liability 
period shall extend until all reclamation, restoration, and abatement 
work under the permit has been completed and the bond is released under 
the provisions of Sec. 800.40, or until the bond has been replaced or 
extended in accordance with Sec. 800.17(b)(3).
    (2) Long-term surface disturbances shall include long-term coal-
related surface facilities and structures, and surface impacts incident 
to underground coal mining, which disturb an area for a period that 
exceeds 5 years. Long-term surface disturbances include, but are not 
limited to: surface features of shafts and slope facilities, coal refuse 
areas, powerlines, bore-holes, ventilation shafts, preparation plants, 
machine shops, roads, and loading and treatment facilities.
    (3) To achieve continuous bond coverage for long-term surface 
disturbances, the bond shall be conditioned upon extension, replacement, 
or payment in full, 30 days prior to the expiration of the bond term.
    (4) Continuous bond coverage shall apply throughout the period of 
extended responsibility for successful revegetation and until the 
provisions of Sec. 800.40 have been met.
    (c) Bond forfeiture. The regulatory authority shall take action to 
forfeit a bond pursuant to this section, if 30 days prior to bond 
expiration, the operator has not filed: (1) A performance bond for a new 
term as required for continuous coverage, or (2) a performance bond 
providing coverage for the period of liability, including the period of 
extended responsibility for successful revegetation.


<R05>
Sec. 800.20  Surety bonds.

    (a) A surety bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate 
surety licensed to do business in the State where the operation is 
located.
    (b) Surety bonds shall be noncancellable during their terms, except 
that surety bond coverage for lands not disturbed may be cancelled with 
the prior consent of the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority 
shall advise the surety, within 30 days after receipt of a notice to 
cancel bond, whether the bond may be cancelled on an undisturbed area.


<R05>
Sec. 800.21  Collateral bonds.

assigned, the regulatory authority shall require the banks issuing these 
certificates to waive all rights of setoff or liens against those 
certificates.
    (4) The regulatory authority shall not accept an individual 
certificate of deposit in an amount in excess of $100,000 or the maximum 
insurable amount as determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.

    (2) Letters of credit shall be irrevocable during their terms. A 
letter of credit used as security in areas requiring continuous bond 
coverage shall be forfeited and shall be collected by the regulatory 
authority if not replaced by other suitable bond or letter of credit

[[Page 280]]

at least 30 days before its expiration date.
    (3) The letter of credit shall be payable to the regulatory 
authority upon demand, in part or in full, upon receipt from the 
regulatory authority of a notice of forfeiture issued in accordance with 
Sec. 800.50.
    (c) Real property posted as a collateral bond shall meet the 
following conditions:
    (1) The applicant shall grant the regulatory authority a first 
mortgage, first deed of trust, or perfected first-lien security interest 
in real property with a right to sell or otherwise dispose of the 
property in the event of forfeiture under Sec. 800.50.
    (2) In order for the regulatory authority to evaluate the adequacy

mortgaged or pledged to secure the obligations under the indemnity 
agreement. The list shall include--
    (i) A description of the property;
    (ii) The fair market value as determined by an independent appraisal 
conducted by a certified appraiser; and
    (iii) Proof of possession and title to the real property.

however, land pledged as collateral for a bond under this section shall 
not be disturbed under any permit while it is serving as security under 
this section.
    (d) Cash accounts shall be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The regulatory authority may authorize the operator to 
supplement the bond through the establishment of a cash account in one 
or more federally-insured or equivalently protected accounts made

authority. The total bond including the cash account shall not be less 
than the amount required under terms of performance bonds including any 
adjustments, less amounts released in accordance with Sec. 800.40.
    (2) Any interest paid on a cash account shall be retained in the 
account and applied to the bond value of the account unless the 
regulatory authority has approved the payment of interest to the

    (e)(1) The estimated bond value of all collateral posted as 
assurance under this section shall be subject to a margin which is the 
ratio of bond value to market value, as determined by the regulatory 
authority. The margin shall reflect legal and liquidation fees, as well 
as value depreciation, marketability, and fluctuations which might 
affect the net cash available to the regulatory authority to complete 
reclamation.
    (2) The bond value of collateral may be evaluated at any time but it 
shall be evaluated as part of permit renewal and, if necessary, the 
performance bond amount increased or decreased. In no case shall the 
bond value of collateral exceed the market value.
    (f) Persons with an interest in collateral posted as a bond, and who 
desire notification of actions pursuant to the bond, shall request the 
notification in writing to the regulatory authority at the time

mean that business was conducted over a period of 5 years immediately 
preceding the time of application.
    (i) The regulatory authority may allow a joint venture or syndicate 
with less than 5 years of continuous operation to qualify under this 
requirement, if each member of the joint venture or syndicate has been 
in continuous operation for at least 5 years immediately preceding the 
time of application.
    (ii) When calculating the period of continuous operation, the 
regulatory authority may exclude past periods of interruption to the 
operation of the business entity that were beyond the applicant's 
control and that do not affect the applicant's likelihood of remaining 
in business during the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations.
    (3) The applicant submits financial information in sufficient detail 
to show that the applicant meets one of the following criteria:
    (i) The applicant has a current rating for its most recent bond 
issuance of ``A'' or higher as issued by either Moody's Investor Service 
or Standard and Poor's Corporation;
    (ii) The applicant has a tangible net worth of at least $10 million, 
a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of 2.5 times or less, and a 
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.2 times or greater; 
or
    (iii) The applicant's fixed assets in the United States total at 
least $20 million, and the applicant has a ratio of total liabilities to 
net worth of 2.5 times or less, and a ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities of 1.2 times or greater.
    (4) The applicant submits;
    (i) Financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year 
accompanied by a report prepared by an independent certified public 
accountant in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
and containing the accountant's audit opinion or review opinion of the 
financial statements with no adverse opinion;
    (ii) Unaudited financial statements for completed quarters in the 
current fiscal year; and
    (iii) Additional unaudited information as requested by the 
regulatory authority.
    (c)(1) The regulatory authority may accept a written guarantee for 
an applicant's self-bond from a parent corporation guarantor, if the 
guarantor meets the conditions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of 
this section as if it were the applicant. Such a written guarantee shall 
be referred to as a ``corporate guarantee.'' The terms of the corporate 
guarantee shall provide for the following:
    (i) If the applicant fails to complete the reclamation plan, the 
guarantor shall do so or the guarantor shall be liable under the 
indemnity agreement to provide funds to the regulatory authority 
sufficient to complete the reclamation plan, but not to exceed the bond 
amount.
    (ii) The corporate guarantee shall remain in force unless the 
guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the 
applicant and to the regulatory authority at least 90 days in advance of 
the cancellation date, and the regulatory authority accepts the 
cancellation.
    (iii) The cancellation may be accepted by the regulatory authority 
if the applicant obtains suitable replacement bond before the 
cancellation date or if the lands for which the self-bond, or portion 
thereof, was accepted have not been disturbed.

[[Page 282]]

    (2) The regulatory authority may accept a written guarantee for an 
applicant's self-bond from any corporate guarantor, whenever the 
applicant meets the conditions of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(4) 
of this section, and the guarantor meets the conditions of paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. Such a written guarantee shall be 
referred to as a ``non-parent corporate guarantee.'' The terms of this 
guarantee shall provide for compliance with the conditions of paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section. The regulatory authority 
may require the applicant to submit any information specified in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section in order to determine the financial 
capabilities of the applicant.
    (d) For the regulatory authority to accept an applicant's self-bond, 
the total amount of the outstanding and proposed self-bonds of the 
applicant for surface coal mining and reclamation operations shall not 
exceed 25 percent of the applicant's tangible net worth in the United 
States. For the regulatory authority to accept a corporate guarantee, 
the total amount of the parent corporation guarantor's present and 
proposed self-bonds and guaranteed self-bonds for surface coal mining 
and reclamation operations shall not exceed 25 percent of the 
guarantor's tangible net worth in the United States. For the regulatory 
authority to accept a non-parent corporate guarantee, the total amount 
of the non-parent corporate guarantor's present and proposed self-bonds 
and guaranteed self-bonds shall not exceed 25 percent of the guarantor's 
tangible net worth in the United States.
    (e) If the regulatory authority accepts an applicant's self-bond, an 
indemnity agreement shall be submitted subject to the following 
requirements:
    (1) The indemnity agreement shall be executed by all persons and 
parties who are to be bound by it, including the parent corporation 
guarantor, and shall bind each jointly and severally.
    (2) Corporations applying for a self-bond, and parent and non-parent 
corporations guaranteeing an applicant's self-bond shall submit an 
indemnity agreement signed by two corporate officers who are authorized 
to bind their corporations. A copy of such authorization shall be 
provided to the regulatory authority along with an affidavit certifying 
that such an agreement is valid under all applicable Federal and State 
laws. In addition, the guarantor shall provide a copy of the corporate 
authorization demonstrating that the corporation may guarantee the self-
bond and execute the indemnity agreement.
    (3) If the applicant is a partnership, joint venture or syndicate, 
the agreement shall bind each partner or party who has a beneficial 
interest, directly or indirectly, in the applicant.
    (4) Pursuant to Sec. 800.50, the applicant, parent or non-parent 
corporate guarantor shall be required to complete the approved 
reclamation plan for the lands in default or to pay to the regulatory 
authority an amount necessary to complete the approved reclamation plan, 
not to exceed the bond amount. If permitted under State law, the 
indemnity agreement when under forfeiture shall operate as a judgment 
against those parties liable under the indemnity agreement.
    (f) A regulatory authority may require self-bonded applicants, 
parent and non-parent corporate guarantors to submit an update of the 
information required under paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section 
within 90 days after the close of each fiscal year following the 
issuance of the self-bond or corporate guarantee.
    (g) If at any time during the period when a self-bond is posted, the 
financial conditions of the applicant, parent or non-parent corporate 
guarantor change so that the criteria of paragraphs (b)(3) and (d) of 
this section are not satisfied, the permittee shall notify the 
regulatory authority immediately and shall within 90 days post an 
alternate form of bond in the same amount as the self-bond. Should the 
permittee fail to post an adequate substitute bond, the provisions of 
Sec. 800.16(e) shall apply.

<R05>
Sec. 800.30  Replacement of bonds.

    (a) The regulatory authority may allow a permittee to replace 
existing bonds with other bonds that provide equivalent coverage.

[[Page 283]]

    (b) The regulatory authority shall not release existing performance 
bonds until the permittee has submitted, and the regulatory authority 
has approved, acceptable replacement performance bonds. Replacement of a 
performance bond pursuant to this section shall not constitute a release 
of bond under Sec. 800.40.


<R05>
Sec. 800.40  Requirement to release performance bonds.

    (a) Bond release application. (1) The permittee may file an 
application with the regulatory authority for the release of all or part 
of a performance bond. Applications may be filed only at times or during 
seasons authorized by the regulatory authority in order to properly 
evaluate the completed reclamation operations. The times or seasons 
appropriate for the evaluation of certain types of reclamation shall be 
established in the regulatory program or identified in the mining and 
reclamation plan required in subchapter G of this chapter and approved 
by the regulatory authority.
    (2) Within 30 days after an application for bond release has been 
filed with the regulatory authority, the permittee shall submit a copy 
of an advertisement placed at least once a week for four successive 
weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the 
surface coal mining operation. The advertisement shall be considered 
part of any bond release application and shall contain the permittee's 
name, permit number and approval date, notification of the precise 
location of the land affected, the number of acres, the type and amount 
of the bond filed and the portion sought to be released, the type and 
appropriate dates of reclamation work performed, a description of the 
results achieved as they relate to the permittee's approved reclamation 
plan, and the name and address of the regulatory authority to which 
written comments, objections, or requests for public hearings and 
informal conferences on the specific bond release may be submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 800.40 (f) and (h). In addition, as part of any bond 
release application, the permittee shall submit copies of letters which 
he or she has sent to adjoining property owners, local governmental 
bodies, planning agencies, sewage and water treatment authorities, and 
water companies in the locality in which the surface coal mining and 
reclamation operation took place, notifying them of the intention to 
seek release from the bond.
    (3) The permittee shall include in the application for bond release 
a notarized statement which certifies that all applicable reclamation 
activities have been accomplished in accordance with the requirements of 
the Act, the regulatory program, and the approved reclamation plan. Such 
certification shall be submitted for each application or phase of bond 
release.
    (b) Inspection by regulatory authority. (1) Upon receipt of the bond 
release application, the regulatory authority shall, within 30 days, or 
as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit, conduct an inspection 
and evaluation of the reclamation work involved. The evaluation shall 
consider, among other factors, the degree of difficulty to complete any 
remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and subsurface water 
is occurring, the probability of future occurrence of such pollution, 
and the estimated cost of abating such pollution. The surface owner, 
agent, or lessee shall be given notice of such inspection and may 
participate with the regulatory authority in making the bond release 
inspection. The regulatory authority may arrange with the permittee to 
allow access to the permit area, upon request by any person with an 
interest in bond release, for the purpose of gathering information 
relevant to the proceeding.
    (2) Within 60 days from the filing of the bond release application, 
if no public hearing is held pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, 
or, within 30 days after a public hearing has been held pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section, the regulatory authority shall notify in 
writing the permittee, the surety or other persons with an interest in 
bond collateral who have requested notification under Sec. 800.21(f), 
and the persons who either filed objections in writing or objectors who 
were a party to the hearing proceedings, if any, of its decision to 
release or not to release all or part of the performance bond.

[[Page 284]]

    (c) The regulatory authority may release all or part of the bond for 
the entire permit area or incremental area if the regulatory authority 
is satisfied that all the reclamation or a phase of the reclamation 
covered by the bond or portion thereof has been accomplished in 
accordance with the following schedules for reclamation of Phases I, II, 
and III:
    (1) At the completion of Phase I, after the operator completes the 
backfilling, regrading (which may include the replacement of topsoil) 
and drainage control of a bonded area in accordance with the approved 
reclamation plan, 60 percent of the bond or collateral for the 
applicable area.
    (2) At the completion of Phase II, after revegetation has been 
established on the regraded mined lands in accordance with the approved 
reclamation plan, an additional amount of bond. When determining the 
amount of bond to be released after successful revegetation has been 
established, the regulatory authority shall retain that amount of bond 
for the revegetated area which would be sufficient to cover the cost of 
reestablishing revegetation if completed by a third party and for the 
period specified for operator responsibility in section 515 of the Act 
for reestablishing revegetation. No part of the bond or deposit shall be 
released under this paragraph so long as the lands to which the release 
would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or 
runoff outside the permit area in excess of the requirements set by 
section 515(b)(10) of the Act and by subchapter K of this chapter or 
until soil productivity for prime farmlands has returned to the 
equivalent levels of yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the 
surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined 
from the soil survey performed pursuant to section 507(b)(16) of the Act 
and part 823 of this chapter. Where a silt dam is to be retained as a 
permanent impoundment pursuant to subchapter K of this chapter, the 
Phase II portion of the bond may be released under this paragraph so 
long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the 
landowner have been made with the regulatory authority.
    (3) At the completion of Phase III, after the operator has completed 
successfully all surface coal mining and reclamation activities, the 
release of the remaining portion of the bond, but not before the 
expiration of the period specified for operator responsibility in Sec. 
816.116 or Sec. 817.116 of this chapter. However, no bond shall be 
fully released under provisions of this section until reclamation 
requirements of the Act and the permit are fully met.
    (d) If the regulatory authority disapproves the application for 
release of the bond or portion thereof, the regulatory authority shall 
notify the permittee, the surety, and any person with an interest in 
collateral as provided for in Sec. 800.21(f), in writing, stating the 
reasons for disapproval and recommending corrective actions necessary to 
secure the release and allowing an opportunity for a public hearing.
    (e) When any application for total or partial bond release is filed 
with the regulatory authority, the regulatory authority shall notify the 
municipality in which the surface coal mining operation is located by 
certified mail at least 30 days prior to the release of all or a portion 
of the bond.
    (f) Any person with a valid legal interest which might be adversely 
affected by release of the bond, or the responsible officer or head of 
any Federal, State, or local governmental agency which has jurisdiction 
by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental, social, 
or economic impact involved in the operation or which is authorized to 
develop and enforce environmental standards with respect to such 
operations, shall have the right to file written objections to the 
proposed release from bond with the regulatory authority within 30 days 
after the last publication of the notice required by Sec. 800.40(a)(2). 
If written objections are filed and a hearing is requested, the 
regulatory authority shall inform all the interested parties of the time 
and place of the hearing, and shall hold a public hearing within 30 days 
after receipt of the request for the hearing. The date, time, and 
location of the public hearing shall be advertised by

[[Page 285]]

the regulatory authority in a newspaper of general circulation in the 
locality for two consecutive weeks. The public hearing shall be held in 
the locality of the surface coal mining operation from which bond 
release is sought, at the location of the regulatory authority office, 
or at the State capital, at the option of the objector.
    (g) For the purpose of the hearing under paragraph (f) of this 
section, the regulatory authority shall have the authority to administer 
oaths, subpoena witnesses or written or printed material, compel the 
attendance of witnesses or the production of materials, and take 
evidence including, but not limited to, inspection of the land affected 
and other surface coal mining operations carried on by the applicant in 
the general vicinity. A verbatim record of each public hearing shall be 
made, and a transcript shall be made available on the motion of any 
party or by order of the regulatory authority.
    (h) Without prejudice to the right of an objector or the applicant, 
the regulatory authority may hold an informal conference as provided in 
section 513(b) of the Act to resolve such written objections. The 
regulatory authority shall make a record of the informal conference 
unless waived by all parties, which shall be accessible to all parties. 
The regulatory authority shall also furnish all parties of the informal 
conference with a written finding of the regulatory authority based on 
the informal conference, and the reasons for said finding.

<R05>
Sec. 800.50  Forfeiture of bonds.

    (a) If an operator refuses or is unable to conduct reclamation of an 
unabated violation, if the terms of the permit are not met, or if the 
operator defaults on the conditions under which the bond was accepted, 
the regulatory authority shall take the following action to forfeit all 
or part of a bond or bonds for any permit area or an increment of a 
permit area:
    (1) Send written notification by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, to the permittee and the surety on the bond, if any, 
informing them of the determination to forfeit all or part of the bond, 
including the reasons for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited. 
The amount shall be based on the estimated total cost of achieving the 
reclamation plan requirements.
    (2) Advise the permittee and surety, if applicable, of the 
conditions under which forfeiture may be avoided. Such conditions may 
include, but are not limited to--
    (i) Agreement by the permittee or another party to perform 
reclamation operations in accordance with a compliance schedule which 
meets the conditions of the permit, the reclamation plan, and the 
regulatory program and a demonstration that such party has the ability 
to satisfy the conditions; or
    (ii) The regulatory authority may allow a surety to complete the 
reclamation plan, or the portion of the reclamation plan applicable to 
the bonded phase or increment, if the surety can demonstrate an ability 
to complete the reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation 
plan. Except where the regulatory authority may approve partial release 
authorized under Sec. 800.40, no surety liability shall be released 
until successful completion of all reclamation under the terms of the 
permit, including applicable liability periods of Sec. 800.13.
    (b) In the event forfeiture of the bond is required by this section, 
the regulatory authority shall--
    (1) Proceed to collect the forfeited amount as provided by 
applicable laws for the collection of defaulted bonds or other debts if 
actions to avoid forfeiture have not been taken, or if rights of appeal, 
if any, have not been exercised within a time established by the 
regulatory authority, or if such appeal, if taken, is unsuccessful.
    (2) Use funds collected from bond forfeiture to complete the 
reclamation plan, or portion thereof, on the permit area or increment, 
to which bond coverage applies.
    (c) Upon default, the regulatory authority may cause the forfeiture 
of any and all bonds deposited to complete reclamation for which the 
bonds were posted. Unless specifically limited, as provided in Sec. 
800.11(b), bond liability shall extend to the entire permit area under 
conditions of forfeiture.

[[Page 286]]

    (d)(1) In the event the estimated amount forfeited is insufficient 
to pay for the full cost of reclamation, the operator shall be liable 
for remaining costs. The regulatory authority may complete, or authorize 
completion of, reclamation of the bonded area and may recover from the 
operator all costs of reclamation in excess of the amount forfeited.
    (2) In the event the amount of performance bond forfeited was more 
than the amount necessary to complete reclamation, the unused funds 
shall be returned by the regulatory authority to the party from whom 
they were collected.

<R05>
Sec. 800.60  Terms and conditions for liability insurance.

    (a) The regulatory authority shall require the applicant to submit 
as part of its permit application a certificate issued by an insurance 
company authorized to do business in the United States certifying that 
the applicant has a public liability insurance policy in force for the 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which the permit is 
sought. Such policy shall provide for personal injury and property 
damage protection in an amount adequate to compensate any persons 
injured or property damaged as a result of the surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations, including the use of explosives, and who are 
entitled to compensation under the applicable provisions of State law. 
Minimum insurance coverage for bodily injury and property damage shall 
be $300,000 for each occurrence and $500,000 aggregate.
    (b) The policy shall be maintained in full force during the life of 
the permit or any renewal thereof and the liability period necessary to 
complete all reclamation operations under this Chapter.
    (c) The policy shall include a rider requiring that the insurer 
notify the regulatory authority whenever substantive changes are made in 
the policy including any termination or failure to renew.
    (d) The regulatory authority may accept from the applicant, in lieu 
of a certificate for a public liability insurance policy, satisfactory 
evidence from the applicant that it satisfies applicable State self-
insurance requirements approved as part of the regulatory program and 
the requirements of this section.

on areas disturbed by coal exploration activities as necessary to assure 
successful revegetation or as required by the regulatory authority.
    (e) All areas disturbed by coal exploration activities shall be 
revegetated in a manner that encourages prompt revegetation and recovery 
of a diverse, effective, and permanent vegetative cover. Revegetation 
shall be accomplished in accordance with the following:

[[Page 289]]

    (1) All areas disturbed by coal exploration activities shall be 
seeded or planted to the same seasonal variety native to the areas 
disturbed. If the land use of the exploration area is intensive 
agriculture, planting of the crops normally grown will meet the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (2) The vegetative cover shall be capable of stabilizing the soil 
surface from erosion.
    (f) Diversions of overland flows and ephemeral, perennial, or 
intermittent streams shall be made in accordance with Sec. 816.43 of

    (g) Each exploration hole, borehole, well, or other exposed 
underground opening created during exploration shall be reclaimed in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.13 through 816.15 of this chapter.
    (h) All facilities and equipment shall be promptly removed from the 
exploration area when they are no longer needed for exploration, except 
for those facilities and equipment that the regulatory authority 
determines may remain to--
    (1) Provide additional environmental data,
    (2) Reduce or control the onsite and offsite effects of the 
exploration activities, or
    (3) Facilitate future surface mining and reclamation operations by 
the person conducting the exploration.
    (i) Coal exploration shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes 
disturbance of the prevailing hydrologic balance in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 816.41 through 816.49 of this chapter. The regulatory 
authority may specify additional measures which shall be adopted by the 
person engaged in coal exploration.
    (j) Acid- or toxic-forming materials shall be handled and disposed 
of in accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.41(b), 816.41(f), and 816.102(e) of 
this chapter. The regulatory authority may specify additional measures 
which shall be adopted by the person engaged in coal exploration.

to the mine workings by people, livestock, fish and wildlife, and 
machinery, and to keep acid or other toxic drainage from entering ground 
or surface waters.

[44 FR 15395, Mar. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 43990, Sept. 26, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 816.22  Topsoil and subsoil.

    (a) Removal. (1)(i) All topsoil shall be removed as a separate layer 
from the area to be disturbed, and segregated.
    (ii) Where the topsoil is of insufficient quantity or poor quality 
for sustaining vegetation, the materials approved by the regulatory 
authority in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
removed as a separate layer from the area to be disturbed, and 
segregated.
    (2) If topsoil is less than 6 inches thick, the operator may remove 
the topsoil and the unconsolidated materials immediately below the 
topsoil and treat the mixture as topsoil.
    (3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the removal 
of topsoil for minor disturbances which--
    (i) Occur at the site of small structures, such as power poles, 
signs, or fence lines; or
    (ii) Will not destroy the existing vegetation and will not cause 
erosion.
    (4) Timing. All material to be removed under this section shall be 
removed after the vegetative cover that would interfere with its salvage 
is cleared from the area to be disturbed, but before any drilling, 
blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance takes place.

[[Page 292]]

    (b) Substitutes and supplements. Selected overburden materials may 
be substituted for, or used as a supplement to topsoil if the operator 
demonstrates to the regulatory authority that the resulting soil medium 
is equal to, or more suitable for sustaining vegetation than, the 
existing topsoil, and the resulting soil medium is the best available in 
the permit area to support revegetation.
    (c) Storage. (1) Materials removed under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be segregated and stockpiled when it is impractical to 
redistribute such materials promptly on regraded areas.
    (2) Stockpiled materials shall--
    (i) Be selectively placed on a stable site within the permit area;
    (ii) Be protected from contaminants and unnecessary compaction that 
would interfere with revegetation;
    (iii) Be protected from wind and water erosion through prompt 
establishment and maintenance of an effective, quick growing vegetative 
cover or through other measures approved by the regulatory authority; 
and
    (iv) Not be moved until required for redistribution unless approved 
by the regulatory authority.
    (3) Where long-term surface disturbances will result from facilities 
such as support facilities and preparation plants and where stockpiling 
of materials removed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section would be 
detrimental to the quality or quantity of those materials, the 
regulatory authority may approve the temporary distribution of the soil 
materials so removed to an approved site within the permit area to 
enhance the current use of that site until needed for later reclamation, 
provided that--
    (i) Such action will not permanently diminish the capability of the 
topsoil of the host site; and
    (ii) The material will be retained in a condition more suitable for 
redistribution than if stockpiled.
    (d) Redistribution. (1) Topsoil materials removed under paragraph 
(a) of this section shall be redistributed in a manner that--
    (i) Achieves an approximately uniform, stable thickness consistent 
with the approved postmining land use, contours, and surface-water 
drainage systems;
    (ii) Prevents excess compaction of the materials; and
    (iii) Protects the materials from wind and water erosion before and 
after seeding and planting.
    (2) Before redistribution of the material removed under paragraph 
(a) of this section the regraded land shall be treated if necessary to 
reduce potential slippage of the redistributed material and to promote 
root penetration. If no harm will be caused to the redistributed 
material and reestablished vegetation, such treatment may be conducted 
after such material is replaced.
    (3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the 
redistribution of topsoil or topsoil substitutes on the approved 
postmining embankments of permanent impoundments or of roads if it 
determines that--
    (i) Placement of topsoil or topsoil substitutes on such embankments 
is inconsistent with the requirement to use the best technology 
currently available to prevent sedimentation, and
    (ii) Such enbankments will be otherwise stabilized.
    (4) Nutrients and soil amendments. Nutrients and soil amendments 
shall be applied to the initially redistributed material when necessary 
to establish the vegetative cover.
    (e) Subsoil segregation. The regulatory authority may require that 
the B horizon, C horizon, or other underlying strata, or portions 
thereof, be removed and segrgated, stockpiled, and redistributed as 
subsoil in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section if it finds that such subsoil layers are necessary to 
comply with the revegetation requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.111, 
816.113, 816.114, and 816.116 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 816.41  Hydrologic-balance protection.

    (a) General. All surface mining and reclamation activities shall be 
conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within the 
permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material

[[Page 293]]

damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area, to assure the 
protection or replacement of water rights, and to support approved 
postmining land uses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
approved permit and the performance standards of this part. The 
regulatory authority may require additional preventative, remedial, or 
monitoring measures to assure that material damage to the hydrologic 
balance outside the permit area is prevented. Mining and reclamation 
practices that minimize water pollution and changes in flow shall be 
used in preference to water treatment.
    (b) Ground-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic 
balance, surface mining activities shall be conducted according to the 
plan approved under Sec. 780.21(h) of this chapter and the following:
    (1) Ground-water quality shall be protected by handling earth 
materials and runoff in a manner that minimizes acidic, toxic, or other 
harmful infiltration to ground-water systems and by managing excavations 
and other disturbances to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants 
into the ground water.
    (2) Ground-water quantity shall be protected by handling earth 
materials and runoff in a manner that will restore the approximate 
premining recharge capacity of the reclaimed area as a whole, excluding 
coal mine waste disposal areas and fills, so as to allow the movement of 
water to the ground-water system.
    (c) Ground-water monitoring. (1) Ground-water monitoring shall be 
conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under 
Sec. 780.21(i) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require 
additional monitoring when necessary.
    (2) Ground-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months 
to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the 
regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical 
results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the 
analysis of any ground-water sample indicates noncompliance with the 
permit conditions, then the operator shall promptly notify the 
regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in 
Sec. Sec. 773.17(e) and 780.21(h) of this chapter.
    (3) Ground-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and 
continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with the 
procedures of Sec. 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may 
modify the monitoring requirements, including the parameters covered and 
the sampling frequency, if the operator demonstrates, using the 
monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that--
    (i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic 
balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage 
to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and 
quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and the 
water rights of other users have been protected or replaced; or
    (ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set 
forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 780.21(i) of this 
chapter.
    (4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjuction with 
monitoring the quality and quantity of ground water onsite and offsite 
shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be 
removed by the operator when no longer needed.
    (d) Surface-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic 
balance, surface mining activities shall be conducted according to the 
plan approved under Sec. 780.21(h) of this chapter, and the following:
    (1) Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth 
materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that 
minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the 
extent possible using the best technology currently available, 
additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the 
permit area; and otherwise prevents water pollution. If drainage 
control, restabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas, diversion 
of runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial practices are not 
adequate to meet the requirements of this section and Sec. 816.42, the 
operator shall use and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities 
or water quality controls.

[[Page 294]]

    (2) Surface-water quality and flow rates shall be protected by 
handling earth materials and runoff in accordance with the steps 
outlined in the plan approved under Sec. 780.21(h) of this chapter.
    (e) Surface-water monitoring. (1) Surface-water monitoring shall be 
conducted according to the surface-water monitoring plan approved under 
Sec. 780.21(j) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require 
additional monitoring when necessary.
    (2) Surface-water monitoring data shcll be submitted every 3 months 
to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the 
regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical 
results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the 
analysis of any surface-water sample indicates noncompliance with the 
permit conditions, the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory 
authority and immediately take the actions provided for in Sec. Sec. 
773.17(e) and 780.21(h) of this chapter. The reporting requirements of 
this paragraph do not exempt the operator from meeting any National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) reporting requirements.
    (3) Surface-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and 
continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with Sec. 
774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the 
monitoring requirements, except those required by the NPDES permitting 
authority, including the parameters covered and sampling frequency if 
the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this 
paragraph, that--
    (i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic 
balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage 
to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and 
quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and the 
water rights of other users have been protected or replaced; or
    (ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set 
forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 780.21(j) of this 
chapter.
    (4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction 
with monitoring the quality and quantity of surface water onsite and 
offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall 
be removed by the operator when no longer needed.
    (f) Acid- and toxic-forming materials. (1) Drainage from acid- and 
toxic-forming materials into surface water and ground water shall be 
avoided by--
    (i) Identifying and burying and/or treating, when necessary, 
materials which may adversely affect water quality, or be detrimental to 
vegetation or to public health and safety if not buried and/or treated, 
and
    (ii) Storing materials in a manner that will protect surface water 
and ground water by preventing erosion, the formation of polluted 
runoff, and the infiltration of polluted water. Storage shall be limited 
to the period until burial and/or treatment first become feasible, and 
so long as storage will not result in any risk of water pollution or 
other environmental damage.
    (2) Storage, burial or treatment practices shall be consistent with 
other material handling and disposal provisions of this chapter.
    (g) Transfer of wells. Before final release of bond, exploratory or 
monitoring wells shall be sealed in a safe and environmentally sound 
manner in accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.13 to 816.15. With the prior 
approval of the regulatory authority, wells may be transferred to 
another party for further use. At a minimum, the conditions of such 
transfer shall comply with State and local law and the permittee shall 
remain responsible for the proper management of the well until bond 
release in accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.13 to 816.15.
    (h) Water rights and replacement. Any person who conducts surface 
mining activities shall replace the water supply of an owner of interest 
in real property who obtains all or part of his or her supply of water 
for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other legitimate use from an 
underground or surface source, where the water supply has been adversely 
impacted by contamination, diminution, or interruption proximately 
resulting from the surface mining activities. Baseline hydrologic 
information required in Sec. Sec. 780.21 and

[[Page 295]]

780.22 of this chapter shall be used to determine the extent of the 
impact of mining upon ground water and surface water.
    (i) Discharges into an underground mine. (1) Discharges into an 
underground mine are prohibited, unless specifically approved by the 
regulatory authority after a demonstration that the discharge will--
    (i) Minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance on the permit 
area, prevent material damage outside the permit area and otherwise 
eliminate public hazards resulting from surface mining activities;
    (ii) Not result in a violation of applicable water quality standards 
or effluent limitations;
    (iii) Be at a known rate and quality which shall meet the effluent 
limitations of Sec. 816.42 for pH and total suspended solids, except 
that the pH and total suspended-solids limitations may be exceeded, if 
approved by the regulatory authority; and
    (iv) Meet with the approval of the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration.
    (2) Discharges shall be limited to the following:
    (i) Water;
    (ii) Coal processing waste;
    (iii) Fly ash from a coal-fired facility;
    (iv) Sludge from an acid-mine-drainage treatment facility;
    (v) Flue-gas desulfurization sludge;
    (vi) Inert materials used for stabilizing underground mines; and
    (vii) Underground mine development wastes.

<R05>
Sec. 816.42  Hydrologic balance: Water quality standards and effluent 
limitations.

    Discharges of water from areas disturbed by surface mining 
activities shall be made in compliance with all applicable State and 
Federal water quality laws and regulations and with the effluent 
limitations for coal mining promulgated by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency set forth in 40 CFR part 434.

[47 FR 47222, Oct. 22, 1982, as amended at 48 FR 44051, Sept. 26, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 816.43  Diversions.

    (a) General requirements. (1) With the approval of the regulatory 
authority, any flow from mined areas abandoned before May 3, 1978, and 
any flow from undisturbed areas or reclaimed areas, after meeting the 
criteria of Sec. 816.46 for siltation structure removal, may be 
diverted from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent 
diversions. All diversions shall be designed to minimize adverse impacts 
to the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas, to 
prevent material damage outside the permit area and to assure the safety 
of the public. Diversions shall not be used to divert water into 
underground mines without approval of the regulatory authority under 
Sec. 816.41(i).
    (2) The diversion and its appurtenant structures shall be designed, 
located, constructed, maintained and used to--
    (i) Be stable;
    (ii) Provide protection against flooding and resultant damage to 
life and property;
    (iii) Prevent, to the extent possible using the best technology 
currently available, additional contributions of suspended solids to 
streamflow outside the permit area; and
    (iv) Comply with all applicable local, State, and Federal laws and 
regulations.
    (3) Temporary diversions shall be removed promptly when no longer 
needed to achieve the purpose for which they were authorized. The land 
disturbed by the removal process shall be restored in accordance with 
this part. Before diversions are removed, downstream water-treatment 
facilities previously protected by the diversion shall be modified or 
removed, as necessary, to prevent overtopping or failure of the 
facilities. This requirement shall not relieve the operator from 
maintaining water-treatment facilities as otherwise required. A 
permanent diversion or a stream channel reclaimed after the removal of a 
temporary diversion shall be designed and constructed so as to restore 
or approximate the premining characteristics of the original stream 
channel including the natural riparian vegetation to promote the 
recovery and the enhancement of the aquatic habitat.

[[Page 296]]

    (4) The regulatory authority may specify design criteria for 
diversions to meet the requirements of this section.
    (b) Diversion of perennial and intermittent streams. (1) Diversion 
of perennial and intermittent streams within the permit area may be

control.

    (a) Blasting signs. Blasting signs shall meet the specifications of 
Sec. 816.11. The operator shall--
    (1) Conspicuously place signs reading ``Blasting Area'' along the 
edge of any blasting area that comes within 100 feet of any public road 
right-of-way, and at the point where any other road provides access to 
the blasting area; and
    (2) At all entrances to the permit area from public roads or 
highways, place conspicuous signs which state ``Warning! Explosives in 
Use,'' which clearly list and describe the meaning of the audible blast 
warning and all-clear signals that are in use, and which explain the 
marking of blasting areas and charged holes awaiting firing within the 
permit area.
    (b) Warnings. Warning and all-clear signals of different character 
or pattern that are audible within a range of \1/2\ mile from the point 
of the blast shall be given. Each person within the permit area and each 
person who resides or regularly works within \1/2\ mile of the permit 
area shall be notified of the meaning of the signals in the blasting 
schedule.
    (c) Access control. Access within the blasting area shall be 
controlled to prevent presence of livestock or unauthorized persons 
during blasting and until an authorized representative of the operator 
has reasonably determined that--
    (1) No unusual hazards, such as imminent slides or undetonated 
charges, exist; and
    (2) Access to and travel within the blasting area can be safely 
resumed.

  Particle velocity shall be recorded in three mutually perpendicular
  directions. The maximum allowable peak particle velocity shall apply
  to each of the three measurements.
\2\ Applicable to the scaled-distance equation of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of
  this section.

    (ii) A seismographic record shall be provided for each blast.
    (3) Scale-distance equation. (i) An operator may use the scaled-
distance equation, W=(D/Ds) \2\, to determine the allowable charge 
weight of explosives to be detonated in any 8-millisecond period, 
without seismic monitoring; where W=the maximum weight of explosives, in 
pounds; D=the distance, in feet, from the blasting site to the nearest 
protected structure; and Ds=the scaled-distance factor, which may 
initially be approved by the regulatory authority using the values for 
scaled-distance factor listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) The development of a modified scaled-distance factor may be 
authorized by the regulatory authority on receipt of a written request 
by the operator, supported by seismographic records of blasting at the 
minesite. The modified scale-distance factor shall be determined such 
that the particle velocity of the predicted ground vibration will not 
exceed the prescribed maximum allowable peak particle velocity of 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, at a 95-percent confidence level.
    (4) Blasting-level chart. (i) An operator may use the ground-
vibration limits in Figure 1 to determine the maximum allowable ground 
vibration.

[[Page 305]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC21OC91.025

    (ii) If the Figure 1 limits are used, a seismographic record 
including both particle velocity and vibration-frequency levels shall be 
provided for each blast. The method for the analysis of the predominant 
frequency contained in the blasting records shall be approved by the 
regulatory authority before application of this alternative blasting 
criterion.
    (5) The maximum allowable ground vibration shall be reduced by the 
regulatory authority beyond the limits otherwise provided by this 
section, if determined necessary to provide damage protection.
    (6) The regulatory authority may require an operator to conduct 
seismic monitoring of any or all blasts or may specify the location at 
which the measurements are taken and the degree of detail necessary in 
the measurement.
    (e) The maximum airblast and ground-vibration standards of 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section shall not apply at the following 
locations:
    (1) At structures owned by the permittee and not leased to another 
person.
    (2) At structures owned by the permittee and leased to another 
person, if a written waiver by the lessee is submitted to the regulatory 
authority before blasting.

Sec. 816.71  Disposal of excess spoil: General requirements.

    (a) General. Excess spoil shall be placed in designated disposal 
areas within the permit area, in a controlled manner to--
    (1) Minimize the adverse effects of leachate and surface water 
runoff from the fill on surface and ground waters;
    (2) Ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement during and after 
construction; and
    (3) Ensure that the final fill is suitable for reclamation and 
revegetation compatible with the natural surroundings and the approved 
postmining land use.
    (b) Design certification. (1) The fill and appurtenant structures 
shall be designed using current, prudent engineering practices and shall 
meet any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. A 
qualified registered professional engineer experienced in the design of 
earth and rock fills shall certify the design of the fill and 
appurtenant structures.
    (2) The fill shall be designed to attain a minimum long-term static 
safety factor of 1.5. The foundation and abutments of the fill must be 
stable under all conditions of construction.
    (c) Location. The disposal area shall be located on the most 
moderately sloping and naturally stable areas available, as approved by 
the regulatory authority, and shall be placed, where possible, upon or 
above a natural terrace, bench, or berm, if such placement provides 
additional stability and prevents mass movement.
    (d) Foundation. (1) Sufficient foundation investigations, as well as 
any necessary laboratory testing of foundation material, shall be 
performed in order to determine the design requirements for foundation 
stability. The analyses of foundation conditions shall take into 
consideration the effect of underground mine workings, if any, upon the 
stability of the fill and appurtenant structures.
    (2) Where the slope in the disposal area is in excess of 2.8h:1v (36 
percent), or such lesser slope as may be designated by the regulatory 
authority based on local conditions, keyway cuts (excavations to stable 
bedrock) or rock toe buttresses shall be constructed to

[[Page 307]]

ensure stability of the fill. Where the toe of the spoil rests on a 
downslope, stability analyses shall be performed in accordance with 
Sec. 780.35(c) of this chapter to determine the size of rock toe 
buttresses and keyway cuts.
    (e) Placement of excess spoil. (1) All vegetative and organic 
materials shall be removed from the disposal area prior to placement of 
the excess spoil. Topsoil shall be removed, segregated and stored or 
redistributed in accordance with Sec. 816.22. If approved by the 
regulatory authority, organic material may be used as mulch or may be 
included in the topsoil to control erosion, promote growth of vegetation 
or increase the moisture retention of the soil.
    (2) Excess spoil shall be transported and placed in a controlled 
manner in horizontal lifts not exceeding 4 feet in thickness; 
concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass stability and to 
prevent mass movement during and after construction; graded so that 
surface and subsurface drainage is compatible with the natural 
surroundings; and covered with topsoil or substitute material in 
accordance with Sec. 816.22 of this chapter. The regulatory authority 
may approve a design which incorporates placement of excess spoil in 
horizontal lifts other than 4 feet in thickness when it is demonstrated 
by the operator and certified by a qualified registered professional 
engineer that the design will ensure the stability of the fill and will 
meet all other applicable requirements.
    (3) The final configuration of the fill shall be suitable for the 
approved postmining land use. Terraces may be constructed on the 
outslope of the fill if required for stability, control of erosion, to 
conserve soil moisture, or to facilitate the approved postmining land 
use. The grade of the outslope between terrace benches shall not be 
steeper than 2h: 1v (50 percent).
    (4) No permanent impoundments are allowed on the completed fill. 
Small depressions may be allowed by the regulatory authority if they are 
needed to retain moisture, minimize erosion, create and enhance wildlife 
habitat, or assist revegetation; and if they are not incompatible with 
the stability of the fill.
    (5) Excess spoil that is acid- or toxic-forming or combustible shall 
be adequately covered with nonacid, nontoxic and noncombustible 
material, or treated, to control the impact on surface and ground water 
in accordance with Sec. 816.41, to prevent sustained combustion, and to 
minimize adverse effects on plant growth and the approved postmining 
land use.
    (f) Drainage control. (1) If the disposal area contains springs, 
natural or manmade water courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design 
shall include diversions and underdrains as necessary to control 
erosion, prevent water infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability.
    (2) Diversions shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 816.43.
    (3) Underdrains shall consist of durable rock or pipe, be designed 
and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices and meet 
any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. The 
underdrain system shall be designed to carry the anticipated seepage of 
water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil fill and from seeps and 
springs in the foundation of the disposal area and shall be protected 
from piping and contamination by an adequate filter. Rock underdrains 
shall be constructed of durable, nonacid-,nontoxic-forming rock (e.g., 
natural sand and gravel, sandstone, limestone, or other durable rock) 
that does not slake in water or degrade to soil material, and which is 
free of coal, clay or other nondurable material. Perforated pipe 
underdrains shall be corrosion resistant and shall have characteristics 
consistent with the long-term life of the fill.
    (g) Surface area stabilization. Slope protection shall be provided 
to minimize surface erosion at the site. All disturbed areas, including 
diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected, shall 
be revegetated upon completion of construction.
    (h) Inspections. A qualified registered professional engineer, or 
other qualified professional specialist under the direction of the 
professional engineer,

[[Page 308]]

shall periodically inspect the fill during construction. The 
professional engineer or specialist shall be experienced in the 
construction of earth and rock fills.
    (1) Such inspections shall be made at least quarterly throughout 
construction and during critical construction periods. Critical 
construction periods shall include at a minimum:
    (i) Foundation preparation, including the removal of all organic 
material and topsoil; (ii) placement of underdrains and protective 
filter systems; (iii) installation of final surface drainage systems; 
and (iv) the final graded and revegetated fill. Regular inspections by 
the engineer or specialist shall also be conducted during placement and 
compaction of fill materials.
    (2) The qualified registered professional engineer shall provide a 
certified report to the regulatory authority promptly after each 
inspection that the fill has been constructed and maintained as designed 
and in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. The report 
shall include appearances of instability, structural weakness, and other 
hazardous conditions.
    (3)(i) The certified report on the drainage system and protective 
filters shall include color photographs taken during and after 
construction, but before underdrains are covered with excess spoil. If 
the underdrain system is constructed in phases, each phase shall be 
certified separately.
    (ii) Where excess durable rock spoil is placed in single or multiple 
lifts such that the underdrain system is constructed simultaneously with 
excess spoil placement by the natural segregation of dumped materials, 
in accordance with Sec. 816.73, color photographs shall be taken of the 
underdrain as the underdrain system is being formed.
    (iii) The photographs accompanying each certified report shall be 
taken in adequate size and number with enough terrain or other physical 
features of the site shown to provide a relative scale to the 
photographs and to specifically and clearly identify the site.
    (4) A copy of each inspection report shall be retained at or near 
the mine site.
    (i) Coal mine waste. Coal mine waste may be disposed of in excess 
spoil fills if approved by the regulatory authority and, if such waste 
is--
    (1) Placed in accordance with Sec. 816.83;
    (2) Nontoxic and nonacid forming; and
    (3) Of the proper characteristics to be consistent with the design 
stability of the fill.
    (j) Underground disposal. Excess spoil may be disposed of in 
underground mine workings, but only in accordance with a plan approved 
by the regulatory authority and MSHA under Sec. 784.25 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 816.72  Disposal of excess spoil: Valley fills/head-of-hollow fills.

    Valley fills and head-of-hollow fills shall meet the requirements of 
Sec. 816.71 and the additional requirements of this section.
    (a) Drainage control. (1) The top surface of the completed fill 
shall be graded such that the final slope after settlement will be 
toward properly designed drainage channels. Uncontrolled surface 
drainage may not be directed over the outslope of the fill.
    (2) Runoff from areas above the fill and runoff from the surface of 
the fill shall be diverted into stabilized diversion channels designed 
to meet the requirements of Sec. 816.43 and, in addition, to safely 
pass the runoff from a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event.
    (b) Rock-core chimney drains. A rock-core chimney drain may be used 
in a head-of-hollow fill, instead of the underdrain and surface 
diversion system normally required, as long as the fill is not located 
in an area containing intermittent or perennial streams. A rock-core 
chimney drain may be used in a valley fill if the fill does not exceed 
250,000 cubic yards of material and upstream drainage is diverted around 
the fill. The alternative rock-core chimney drain system shall be 
incorporated into the design and construction of the fill as follows.
    (1) The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main 
buried stream channel or rill, a vertical core of durable rock at least 
16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of 
the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill.

[[Page 309]]

A system of lateral rock underdrains shall connect this rock core to 
each area of potential drainage or seepage in the disposal area. The 
underdrain system and rock core shall be designed to carry the 
anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil 
fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area. 
Rocks used in the rock core and underdrains shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 816.71(f).
    (2) A filter system to ensure the proper long-term functioning of 
the rock core shall be designed and constucted using current, prudent 
engineering practices.
    (3) Grading may drain surface water away from the outslope of the 
fill and toward the rock core. In no case, however, may intermittent or 
perennial streams be diverted into the rock core. The maximum slope of 
the top of the fill shall be 33h:1v (3 percent). A drainage pocket may 
be maintained at the head of the fill during and after construction, to 
intercept surface runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the 
rock drain, if stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall 
this pocket or sump have a potential capacity for impounding more than 
10,000 cubic feet of water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a 
3 to 5 percent grade toward the fill and a 1 percent slope toward the 
rock core.

<R05>
Sec. 816.73  Disposal of excess spoil: Durable rock fills.

    The regulatory authority may approve the alternative method of 
disposal of excess durable rock spoil by gravity placement in single or 
multiple lifts, provided the following conditions are met:
    (a) Except as provided in this section, the requirements of Sec. 
816.71 are met.
    (b) The excess spoil consists of at least 80 percent, by volume, 
durable, nonacid- and nontoxic-forming rock (e.g., sandstone or 
limestone) that does not slake in water and will not degrade to soil 
material. Where used, noncemented clay shale, clay spoil, soil or other 
nondurable excess spoil materials shall be mixed with excess durable 
rock spoil in a controlled manner such that no more than 20 percent of 
the fill volume, as determined by tests performed by a registered 
engineer and approved by the regulatory authority, is not durable rock.
    (c) A qualified registered professional engineer certifies that the 
design will ensure the stability of the fill and meet all other 
applicable requirements.
    (d) The fill is designed to attain a minimum long-term static safety 
factor of 1.5, and an earthquake safety factor of 1.1.
    (e) The underdrain system may be constructed simultaneously with 
excess spoil placement by the natural segregation of dumped materials, 
provided the resulting underdrain system is capable of carrying 
anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil 
fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area 
and the other requirements for drainage control are met.
    (f) Surface water runoff from areas adjacent to and above the fill 
is not allowed to flow onto the fill and is diverted into stabilized 
diversion channels designed to meet the requirements of Sec. 816.43 and 
to safely pass the runoff from a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event.

<R05>
Sec. 816.74  Disposal of excess spoil: Preexisting benches.

    (a) The regulatory authority may approve the disposal of excess 
spoil through placement on a preexisting bench if the affected portion 
of the preexisting bench is permitted and the standards set forth in 
Sec. Sec. 816.102(c), (e) through (h), and (j), and the requirements of 
this section are met.
    (b) All vegetation and organic materials shall be removed from the 
affected portion of the preexisting bench prior to placement of the 
excess spoil. Any available topsoil on the bench shall be removed, 
stored and redistributed in accordance with Sec. 816.22 of this part. 
Substitute or supplemental materials may be used in accordance with 
Sec. 816.22(b) of this part.
    (c) The fill shall be designed and constructed using current, 
prudent engineering practices. The design will be certified by a 
registered professional engineer. The spoil shall be placed on

[[Page 310]]

the solid portion of the bench in a controlled manner and concurrently 
compacted as necessary to attain a long term static safety factor of 1.3 
for all portions of the fill. Any spoil deposited on any fill portion of 
the bench will be treated as excess spoil fill under Sec. 816.71.
    (d) The preexisting bench shall be backfilled and graded to--
    (1) Achieve the most moderate slope possible which does not exceed 
the angle of repose;
    (2) Eliminate the highwall to the maximum extent technically 
practical;
    (3) Minimize erosion and water pollution both on and off the site; 
and
    (4) If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade water 
courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design shall include diversions 
and underdrains as necessary to control erosion, prevent water 
infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability.
    (e) All disturbed areas, including diversion channels that are not 
riprapped or otherwise protected, shall be revegetated upon completion 
of construction.
    (f) Permanent impoundments may not be constructed on preexisting 
benches backfilled with excess spoil under this regulation.
    (g) Final configuration of the backfill must be compatible with the 
natural drainage patterns and the surrounding area, and support the 
approved postmining land use.
    (h) Disposal of excess spoil from an upper actively mined bench to a 
lower preexisting bench by means of gravity transport may be approved by 
the regulatory authority provided that--
    (1) The gravity transport courses are determined on a site-specific 
basis by the operator as part of the permit application and approved by 
the regulatory authority to minimize hazards to health and safety and to 
ensure that damage will be minimized between the benches, outside the 
set course, and downslope of the lower bench should excess spoil 
accidentally move;
    (2) All gravity transported excess spoil, including that excess 
spoil immediately below the gravity transport courses and any 
preexisting spoil that is disturbed, is rehandled and placed in 
horizontal lifts in a controlled manner, concurrently compacted as 
necessary to ensure mass stability and to prevent mass movement, and 
graded to allow surface and subsurface drainage to be compatible with 
the natural surroundings and to ensure a minimum long-term static safety 
factor of 1.3. Excess spoil on the bench prior to the current mining 
operation that is not disturbed need not be rehandled except where 
necessary to ensure stability of the fill;
    (3) A safety berm is constructed on the solid portion of the lower 
bench prior to gravity transport of the excess spoil. Where there is 
insufficient material on the lower bench to construct a safety berm, 
only that amount of excess spoil necessary for the construction of the 
berm may be gravity transported to the lower bench prior to construction 
of the berm.
    (4) Excess spoil shall not be allowed on the downslope below the 
upper bench except on designated gravity transport courses properly 
prepared according to Sec. 816.22. Upon completion of the fill, no

Sec. 816.83  Coal mine waste: Refuse piles.

    Refuse piles shall meet the requirements of Sec. 816.81, the 
additional requirements of this section, and the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 77.214 and 77.215 of this title.
    (a) Drainage control. (1) If the disposal area contains springs, 
natural or manmade water courses, or wet weather seeps, the design shall 
include diversions and underdrains as necessary to control erosion, 
prevent water infiltration into the disposal facility and ensure 
stability.
    (2) Uncontrolled surface drainage may not be diverted over the 
outslope of the refuse piles. Runoff from the areas above the refuse 
pile and runoff from the surface of the refuse pile shall be diverted 
into stabilized diversion channels designed to meet the requirements of 
Sec. 816.43 to safely pass the runoff from a 100-year, 6-hour 
precipitation event. Runoff diverted from undisturbed areas need not be 
commingled with runoff from the surface of the refuse pile.
    (3) Underdrains shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 
816.71(f)(3).
    (b) Surface area stabilization. Slope protection shall be provided 
to minimize surface erosion at the site. All disturbed areas, including 
diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected, shall 
be revegetated upon completion of construction.
    (c) Placement. (1) All vegetative and organic materials shall be 
removed

[[Page 312]]

from the disposal area prior to placement of coal mine waste. Topsoil 
shall be removed, segregated and stored or redistributed in accordance 
with Sec. 816.22. If approved by the regulatory authority, organic 
material may be used as mulch, or may be included in the topsoil to 
control erosion, promote growth of vegetation or increase the moisture 
retention of the soil.
    (2) The final configuration of the refuse pile shall be suitable for 
the approved postmining land use. Terraces may be constructed on the 
outslope of the refuse pile if required for stability, control or 
erosion, conservation of soil moisture, or facilitation of the approved 
postmining land use. The grade of the outslope between terrace benches 
shall not be steeper than 2h:1v (50 percent).
    (3) No permanent impoundments shall be allowed on the completed 
refuse pile. Small depressions may be allowed by the regulatory 
authority if they are needed to retain moisture, minimize erosion, 
create and enhance wildlife habitat, or assist revegetation, and if they 
are not incompatible with stability of the refuse pile.
    (4) Following final grading of the refuse pile, the coal mine waste 
shall be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of the best available, 
nontoxic and noncombustible material, in a manner that does not impede 
drainage from the underdrains. The regulatory authority may allow less 
than 4 feet of cover material based on physical and chemical analyses 
which show that the requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.111 through 816.116 
will be met.
    (d) Inspections. A qualified registered professional engineer, or 
other qualified professional specialist under the direction of the 
professional engineer, shall inspect the refuse pile during 
construction. The professional engineer or specialist shall be 
experienced in the construction of similar earth and waste structures.
    (1) Such inspections shall be made at least quarterly throughout 
construction and during critical construction periods. Critical 
construction periods shall include at a minimum:
    (i) Foundation preparation including the removal of all organic 
material and topsoil; (ii) placement of underdrains and protective 
filter systems; (iii) installation of final surface drainage systems; 
and (iv) the final graded and revegetated facility. Regular inspections 
by the engineer or specialist shall also be conducted during placement 
and compaction of coal mine waste materials. More frequent inspections 
shall be conducted if a danger of harm exists to the public health and 
safety or the environment. Inspections shall continue until the refuse 
pile has been finally graded and revegetated or until a later time as 
required by the regulatory authority.
    (2) The qualified registered professional engineer shall provide a 
certified report to the regulatory authority promptly after each 
inspection that the refuse pile has been constructed and maintained as 
designed and in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. The 
report shall include appearances of instability, structural weakness, 
and other hazardous conditions.
    (3) The certified report on the drainage system and protective 
filters shall include color photographs taken during and after 
construction, but before underdrains are covered with coal mine waste. 
If the underdrain system is constructed in phases, each phase shall be 
certified separately. The photographs accompanying each certified report 
shall be taken in adequate size and number with enough terrain or other 
physical features of the site shown to provide a relative scale to the 
photographs and to specifically and clearly identify the site.
    (4) A copy of each inspection report shall be retained at or near 
the minesite.

Sec. 816.104  Backfilling and grading: Thin overburden.

    (a) Definition. Thin overburden means insufficient spoil and other 
waste materials available from the entire permit area to restore the 
disturbed area to its approximate original contour. Insufficient spoil 
and other waste materials occur where the overburden thickness times the 
swell factor, plus the thickness of other available waste materials, is 
less than the combined thickness of the overburden and coal bed prior to 
removing the coal, so that after backfilling and grading the surface 
configuration of the reclaimed area would not:
    (1) Closely resemble the surface configuration of the land prior to 
mining; or
    (2) Blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the 
surrounding terrain.
    (b) Performance standards. Where thin overburden occurs within the 
permit area, the permittee at a minimum shall:
    (1) Use all spoil and other waste materials available from the 
entire permit area to attain the lowest practicable grade, but not more 
than the angle of repose; and
    (2) Meet the requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.102(a)(2) through (j) of

Sec. 816.105  Backfilling and grading: Thick overburden.

    (a) Definition. Thick overburden means more than sufficient spoil 
and other waste materials available from the entire permit area to 
restore the disturbed area to its approximate original contour. More 
than sufficient spoil and other waste materials occur where the 
overburden thickness times the swell factor exceeds the combined 
thickness of the overburden and coal bed prior to removing the coal, so 
that after backfilling and grading the surface configuration of the 
reclaimed area would not:
    (1) Closely resemble the surface configuration of the land prior to 
mining; or
    (2) Blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the 
surrounding terrain.
    (b) Performance standards. Where thick overburden occurs within the 
permit area, the permittee at a minimum shall:
    (1) Restore the approximate original contour and then use the 
remaining spoil and other waste materials to attain the lowest 
practicable grade, but not more than the angle of repose;
    (2) Meet the requirements of Sec. Sec. 816. 102(a)(2) through (j)

<R05>
Sec. 816.116  Revegetation: Standards for success.

    (a) Success of revegetation shall be judged on the effectiveness of 
the vegetation for the approved postmining land use, the extent of cover 
compared to the cover occurring in natural vegetation of the area, and 
the general requirements of Sec. 816.111.
    (1) Standards for success and statistically valid sampling 
techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory 
authority and included in an approved regulatory program.
    (2) Standards for success shall include criteria representative of 
unmined lands in the area being reclaimed to evaluate the appropriate 
vegetation parameters of ground cover, production, or stocking. Ground 
cover, production, or stocking shall be considered equal to the approved 
success standard when they are not less than 90 percent of the success 
standard. The sampling techniques for measuring success shall use a 90-
percent statistical confidence interval (i.e., one-sided test with a 
0.10 alpha error).
    (b) Standards for success shall be applied in accordance with the 
approved postmining land use and, at a minimum, the following 
conditions:
    (1) For areas developed for use as grazing land or pasture land, the 
ground cover and production of living plants on the revegetated area 
shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or such other 
success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
    (2) For areas developed for use as cropland, crop production on the 
revegetated area shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or 
such other success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
    (3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, 
recreation, shelter belts, or forest products, success of vegetation 
shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and 
vegetative ground cover. Such parameters are described as follows:
    (i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by 
the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions 
and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies 
responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. 
Consultation and approval may occur on either a programwide or a permit-
specific basis.
    (ii) Trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success 
of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall have utility 
for the approved postmining land use. Trees and shrubs counted in 
determining such success shall be healthy and have been in place for not 
less than two growing seasons. At the time of bond release, at least 80 
percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine such success shall 
have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable minimum period of 
responsibility.
    (iii) Vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required 
to achieve the approved postmining land use.
    (4) For areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or 
residential use less than 2 years after regrading is completed, the 
vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to control 
erosion.
    (5) For areas previously disturbed by mining that were not reclaimed 
to the requirements of this subchapter and that are remined or otherwise 
redisturbed by surface coal mining operations, as a minimum, the 
vegetative ground cover shall be not less than the ground cover existing 
before redisturbance and shall be adequate to control erosion.
    (c)(1) The period of extended responsibility for successful 
revegetation shall begin after the last year of augmented seeding, 
fertilizing, irrigation, or other work, excluding husbandry practices 
that are approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (2) In areas of more than 26.0 inches of annual average 
precipitation, the period of responsibility shall continue for a period 
of not less than:

[[Page 320]]

    (i) Five full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section. The vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of 
this section for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or 
exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any 2 
years of the responsibility period, except the first year. Areas 
approved for the other uses identified in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing 
season of the last year of the responsibility period.
    (ii) Two full years for lands eligible for remining included in 
permits issued before September 30, 2004, or any renewals thereof. To 
the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, the lands shall equal or exceed the standards 
during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
    (3) In areas of 26.0 inches or less average annual precipitation, 
the period of responsibility shall continue for a period of not less 
than:
    (i) Ten full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) 
below. Vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall equal or exceed the approved success standard for at least the 
last two consecutive years of the responsibility period.
    (ii) Five full years for lands eligible for remining included in 
permits issued before September 30, 2004, or any renewals thereof. To 
the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, the lands shall equal or exceed the standards 
during the growing seasons of the last two consecutive years of the 
responsibility period.
    (4) The regulatory authority may approve selective husbandry 
practices, excluding augmented seeding, fertilization, or irrigation, 
provided it obtains prior approval from the Director in accordance with 
Sec. 732.17 of this chapter that the practices are normal husbandry 
practices, without extending the period of responsibility for 
revegetation success and bond liability, if such practices can be 
expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or if 
discontinuance of the practices after the liability period expires will 
not reduce the probability of permanent revegetation success. Approved 
practices shall be normal husbandry practices within the region for 
unmined lands having land uses similar to the approved postmining land 
use of the disturbed area, including such practices as disease, pest, 
and vermin control; and any pruning, reseeding, and transplanting 
specifically necessitated by such actions.

Sec. 816.131  Cessation of operations: Temporary.

    (a) Each person who conducts surface mining activities shall 
effectively secure surface facilities in areas in which there are no 
current operations, but in which operations are to be resumed under an 
approved permit. Temporary abandonment shall not relieve a person of 
their obligation to comply with any provisions of the approved permit.
    (b) Before temporary cessation of mining and reclamation operations 
for a period of thirty days or more, or as soon as it is known that a 
temporary cessation will extend beyond 30 days, persons who conduct 
surface mining activities shall submit to the regulatory authority a 
notice of intention to cease or abandon mining and reclamation 
operations. This notice shall include a statement of the exact number of 
acres which will have been affected in the permit area, prior to such 
temporary cessation, the extent and kind of reclamation of those areas 
which will have been accomplished, and identification of the 
backfilling, regrading, revegetation, environmental monitoring, and 
water treatment activities that will continue during the temporary 
cessation.


<R05>
Sec. 816.132  Cessation of operations: Permanent.

    (a) Persons who cease surface mining activities permanently shall 
close or backfill or otherwise permanently reclaim all affected areas, 
in accordance with this chapter and the permit approved by the 
regulatory authority.
    (b) All underground openings, equipment, structures, or other 
facilities not

[[Page 321]]

required for monitoring, unless approved by the regulatory authority as 
suitable for the postmining land use or environmental monitoring, shall 
be removed and the affected land reclaimed.


<R05>
Sec. 816.133  Postmining land use.

    (a) General. All disturbed areas shall be restored in a timely 
manner to conditions that are capable of supporting--
    (1) The uses they were capable of supporting before any mining; or
    (2) Higher or better uses.
    (b) Determining premining uses of land. The premining uses of land 
to which the postmining land use is compared shall be those uses which 
the land previously supported, if the land has not been previously mined 
and has been properly managed. The postmining land use for land that has 
been previously mined and not reclaimed shall be judged on the basis of 
the land use that existed prior to any mining: Provided that, if the 
land cannot be reclaimed to the land use that existed prior to any 
mining because of the previously mined condition, the postmining land 
use shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be 
achieved which is compatible with surrounding areas and does not require 
the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining.
    (c) Criteria for alternative postmining land uses. Higher or better 
uses may be approved by the regulatory authority as alternative 
postmining land uses after consultation with the landowner or the land 
management agency having jurisdiction over the lands, if the proposed 
uses meet the following criteria:
    (1) There is a reasonable likelihood for achievement of the use.
    (2) The use does not present any actual or probable hazard to public 
health or safety, or threat of water diminution or pollution.
    (3) The use will not--
    (i) Be impractical or unreasonable;
    (ii) Be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans;
    (iii) Involve unreasonable delay in implementation; or
    (iv) Cause or contribute to violation of Federal, State, or local 
law.
    (d) Approximate original contour: Criteria for variance. Surface 
coal mining operations that meet the requirements of this paragraph may 
be conducted under a variance from the requirement to restore disturbed 
areas to their approximate original contour, if the following 
requirements are satisfied:
    (1) The regulatory authority grants the variance under a permit 
issued in accordance with Sec. 785.16 of this chapter.
    (2) The alternative postmining land use requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section are met.
    (3) All applicable requirements of the Act and the regulatory 
program, other than the requirement to restore disturbed areas to their 
approximate original contour, are met.
    (4) After consultation with the appropriate land use planning 
agencies, if any, the potential use is shown to constitute an equal or 
better economic or public use.
    (5) The proposed use is designed and certified by a qualified 
registered professional engineer in conformance with professional 
standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and 
configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.
    (6) After approval, where required, of the appropriate State 
environmental agencies, the watershed of the permit and adjacent areas 
is shown to be improved.
    (7) The highwall is completely backfilled with spoil material, in a 
manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3, using 
standard geotechnical analysis.
    (8) Only the amount of spoil as is necessary to achieve the 
postmining land use, ensure the stability of spoil retained on the 
bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act and this chapter is 
placed off the mine bench. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be 
placed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 816.71-816.74 of this chapter.
    (9) The surface landowner of the permit area has knowingly 
requested, in writing, that a variance be granted, so as to render the 
land, after reclamation, suitable for an industrial, commercial, 
residential, or public use (including recreational facilities).
    (10) Federal, State, and local government agencies with an interest 
in the

[[Page 322]]

proposed land use have an adequate period in which to review and comment 
on the proposed use.

<R05>
Sec. 817.22  Topsoil and subsoil.

    (a) Removal. (1)(i) All topsoil shall be removed as a separate layer 
from the area to be disturbed, and segregated.
    (ii) Where the topsoil is of insufficient quantity or of poor 
quality for sustaining vegetation, the materials approved by the 
regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section 
shall be removed as a separate layer from the area to be disturbed, and 
segregated.

[[Page 327]]

    (2) If topsoil is less than 6 inches thick, the operator may remove 
the topsoil and the unconsolidated materials immediately below the 
topsoil and treat the mixture as topsoil.
    (3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the removal 
of topsoil for minor disturbances which--
    (i) Occur at the site of small structures, such as power poles, 
signs, or fence lines; or
    (ii) Will not destroy the existing vegetation and will not cause 
erosion.
    (4) Timing. All materials to be removed under this section shall be 
removed after the vegetative cover that would interfere with its salvage 
is cleared from the area to be disturbed, but before any drilling, 
blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance takes place.
    (b) Substitutes and supplements. Selected overburden materials may 
be substituted for, or used as a supplement to, topsoil if the operator 
demonstrates to the regulatory authority that the resulting soil medium 
is equal to, or more suitable for sustaining vegetation than, the 
existing topsoil, and the resulting soil medium is the best available in 
the permit area to support revegetation.
    (c) Storage. (1) Materials removed under Paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be segregated and stockpiled when it is impractical to 
redistribute such materials promptly on regraded areas.
    (2) Stockpiled materials shall--
    (i) Be selectively placed on a stable site within the permit area;
    (ii) Be protected from contaminants and unnecessary compaction that 
would interfere with revegetation;
    (iii) Be protected from wind and water erosion through prompt 
establishment and maintenance of an effective, quick growing vegetative 
cover or through other measures approved by the regulatory authority; 
and
    (iv) Not be moved until required for redistribution unless approved 
by the regulatory authority.
    (3) Where long-term surface disturbances will result from facilities 
such as support facilities and preparation plants and where stockpiling 
of materials removed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section would be 
detrimental to the quality or quantity of those materials, the 
regulatory authority may approve the temporary distribution of the soil 
materials so removed to an approved site within the permit area to 
enhance the current use of that site until needed for later reclamation, 
provided that--
    (i) Such action will not permanently diminish the capability of the 
topsoil of the host site; and
    (ii) The material will be retained in a condition more suitable for 
redistribution than if stockpiled.
    (d) Redistribution. (1) Topsoil materials removed under paragraph 
(a) of this section shall be redistributed in a manner that--
    (i) Achieves an approximately uniform, stable thickness consistent 
with the approved postmining land use, contours, and surface-water 
drainage systems;
    (ii) Prevents excess compaction of the materials; and
    (iii) Protects the materials from wind and water erosion before and 
after seeding and planting.
    (2) Before redistribution of the material removed under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the regraded land shall be treated if necessary to 
reduce potential slippage of the redistributed material and to promote 
root penetration. If no harm will be caused to the redistributed 
material and reestablished vegetation, such treatment may be conducted 
after such material is replaced.
    (3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the 
redistribution of topsoil or topsoil substitutes on the approved 
postmining embankments of permanent impoundments or of roads if it 
determines that--
    (i) Placement of topsoil or topsoil substitutes on such embankments 
is inconsistent with the requirement to use the best technology 
currently available to prevent sedimentation, and
    (ii) Such embankments will be otherwise stabilized.
    (4) Nutrients and soil amendments. Nutrients and soil amendments 
shall be applied to the initially redistributed material when necessary 
to establish the vegetative cover.

[[Page 328]]

    (e) Subsoil segregation. The regulatory authority may require that 
the B horizon, C horizon, or other underlying strata, or portions 
thereof, be removed and segregated, stockpiled, and redistributed as 
subsoil in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section if it finds that such subsoil layers are necessary to 
comply with the revegetation requirements of Sec. Sec. 817.111, 
817.113, 817.114, and 817.116 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 817.41  Hydrologic-balance protection.

    (a) General. All underground mining and reclamation activities shall 
be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within 
the permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material damage to the 
hydrologic balance outside the permit area, and to support approved 
postmining land uses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
approved permit and the performance standards of this part. The 
regulatory authority may require additional preventative, remedial, or 
monitoring measures to assure that material damage to the hydrologic 
balance outside the permit area is prevented. Mining and reclamation 
practices that minimize water pollution and changes in flow shall be 
used in preference to water treatment.
    (b) Ground-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic 
balance underground mining activities shall be conducted according to 
the plan approved under Sec. 784.14(g) of this chapter and the 
following.
    (1) Ground-water quality shall be protected by handling earth 
materials and runoff in a manner that minimizes acidic, toxic, or other 
harmful infiltration to ground-water systems and by managing excavations 
and other disturbances to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants 
into the ground water.
    (c) Ground-water monitoring. (1) Ground-water monitoring shall be 
conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under 
Sec. 784.14(h) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require 
additional monitoring when necessary.
    (2) Ground-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months 
to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the 
regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical 
results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the 
analysis of any ground-water sample indicates noncompliance with the 
permit conditions, then the operator shall promptly notify the 
regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in 
Sec. Sec. 773.17(e) and 784.14(g) of this chapter.
    (3) Ground-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and 
continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with the 
procedures of Sec. 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may 
modify the monitoring requirements including the parameters covered and 
the sampling frequency if the operator demonstrates, using the 
monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that--
    (i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the prevailing 
hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented 
material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water 
quantity and quality are suitable to support approved postmining land 
uses; or
    (ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set 
forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(h) of this 
chapter.
    (4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction 
with monitoring the quality and quantity of ground water onsite and 
offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall 
be removed by the operator when no longer needed.
    (d) Surface-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic 
balance, underground mining activities shall be conducted according to 
the plan approved under Sec. 784.14(g) of this chapter, and the 
following:
    (1) Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth 
materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that 
minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the 
extent possible using the best technology currently available, 
additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the 
permit

[[Page 329]]

area; and otherwise prevent water pollution. If drainage control, 
restabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas, diversion of 
runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial practices are not 
adequate to meet the requirements of this section and Sec. 817.42, the 
operator shall use and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities 
or water quality controls.
    (2) Surface-water quantity and flow rates shall be protected by 
handling earth materials and runoff in accordance with the steps 
outlined in the plan approved under Sec. 784.14(g) of this chapter.
    (e) Surface-water monitoring. (1) Surface-water monitoring shall be 
conducted according to the surface-water monitoring plan approved under 
Sec. 784.14(i) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require 
additional monitoring when necessary.
    (2) Surface-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months 
to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the 
regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical 
results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the 
analysis of any surface-water sample indicates noncompliance with the 
permit conditions, the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory 
authority and immediately take the actions provided for in Sec. Sec. 
773.17(e) and 784.14(g) of this chapter. The reporting requirements of 
this paragraph do not exempt the operator from meeting any National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) reporting requirements.
    (3) Surface-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and 
continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with Sec. 
774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the 
monitoring requirements, except those required by the NPDES permitting 
authority, including the parameters covered and sampling frequency if 
the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this 
paragraph, that--
    (i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic 
balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage 
to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and 
quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and
    (ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set 
forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(i) of this 
chapter.
    (4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction 
with monitoring the quality and quantity of surface water onsite and 
offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall 
be removed by the operator when no longer needed.
    (f) Acid- and toxic-forming materials. (1) Drainage from acid- and 
toxic-forming materials and underground development waste into surface 
water and ground water shall be avoided by--
    (i) Identifying and burying and/or treating, when necessary, 
materials which may adversely affect water quality, or be detrimental to 
vegetation or to public health and safety if not buried and/or treated, 
and
    (ii) Storing materials in a manner that will protect surface water 
and ground water by preventing erosion, the formation of polluted 
runoff, and the infiltration of polluted water. Storage shall be limited 
to the period until burial and/or treatment first become feasible, and 
so long as storage will not result in any risk of water pollution or 
other environmental damage.
    (2) Storage, burial or treatment practices shall be consistent with 
other material handling and disposal provisions of this chapter.
    (g) Transfer of wells. Before final release of bond, exploratory or 
monitoring wells shall be sealed in a safe and environmentally sound 
manner in accordance with Sec. Sec. 817.13 and 817.15. With the prior 
approval of the regulatory authority, wells may be transferred to 
another party for further use. However, at a minimum, the conditions of 
such transfer shall comply with State and local laws and the permittee 
shall remain responsible for the proper management of the well until 
bond release in accordance with Sec. Sec. 817.13 to 817.15.
    (h) Discharges into an underground mine. (1) Discharges into an 
underground mine are prohibited, unless specifically approved by the 
regulatory

[[Page 330]]

authority after a demonstration that the discharge will--
    (i) Minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance on the permit 
area, prevent material damage outside the permit area and otherwise 
eliminate public hazards resulting from underground mining activities;
    (ii) Not result in a violation of applicable water quality standards 
or effluent limitations;
    (iii) Be at a known rate and quality which shall meet the effluent 
limitations of Sec. 817.42 for pH and total suspended solids, except 
that the pH and total suspended solids limitations may be exceeded, if 
approved by the regulatory authority; and
    (iv) Meet with the approval of the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration.
    (2) Discharges shall be limited to the following:
    (i) water;
    (ii) Coal-processing waste;
    (iii) Fly ash from a coal-fired facility;
    (iv) Sludge from an acid-mine-drainage treatment facility;
    (v) Flue-gas desulfurization sludge;
    (vi) Inert materials used for stabilizing underground mines; and
    (vii) Underground mine development wastes.
    (3) Water from one underground mine may be diverted into other 
underground workings according to the requirements of this section.
    (i) Gravity discharges from underground mines. (1) Surface entries 
and accesses to underground workings shall be located and managed to 
prevent or control gravity discharge of water from the mine. Gravity 
discharges of water from an underground mine, other than a drift mine 
subject to paragraph (i)(2) of this section, may be allowed by the 
regulatory authority if it is demonstrated that the untreated or treated 
discharge complies with the performance standards of this part and any 
additional NPDES permit requirements.
    (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (i)(1) of 
this section, the surface entries and accesses of drift mines first used 
after the implementation of a State, Federal, or Federal Lands Program 
and located in acid-producing or iron-producing coal seams shall be 
located in such a manner as to prevent any gravity discharge from the 
mine.
    (j) Drinking, domestic or residential water supply. The permittee 
must promptly replace any drinking, domestic or residential water supply 
that is contaminated, diminished or interrupted by underground mining 
activities conducted after October 24, 1992, if the affected well or 
spring was in existence before the date the regulatory authority 
received the permit application for the activities causing the loss, 
contamination or interruption. The baseline hydrologic information 
required in Sec. Sec. 780.21 and 784.14 of this chapter and the 
geologic information concerning baseline hydrologic conditions required 
in Sec. Sec. 780.21 and 784.22 of this chapter will be used to 
determine the impact of mining activities upon the water supply.

Sec. 817.43  Diversions.

    (a) General requirements. (1) With the approval of the regulatory 
authority, any flow from mined areas abandoned before May 3, 1978, and 
any flow from undisturbed areas or reclaimed areas, after meeting the 
criteria of Sec. 817.46 for siltation structure removal, may be 
diverted from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent 
diversions. All diversions shall be designed to minimize adverse impacts 
to the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas, to 
prevent material damage outside the permit area and to assure the safety 
of the public. Diversions shall not be used to divert water

[[Page 331]]

into underground mines without approval of the regulatory authority in 
accordance with Sec. 817.41(h).
    (2) The diversion and its appurtenant structures shall be designed, 
located, constructed, and maintained to--
    (i) Be stable;
    (ii) Provide protection against flooding and resultant damage to 
life and property;
    (iii) Prevent, to the extent possible using the best technology 
currently available, additional contributions of suspended solids to 
streamflow outside the permit area; and
    (iv) Comply with all applicable local, State, and Federal laws and 
regulations.
    (3) Temporary diversions shall be removed when no longer needed to 
achieve the purpose for which they were authorized. The land disturbed 
by the removal process shall be restored in accordance with this part. 
Before diversions are removed, downstream water-treatment facilities 
previously protected by the diversion shall be modified or removed, as 
necessary, to prevent overtopping or failure of the facilities. This 
requirement shall not relieve the operator from maintaining water-
treatment facilities as otherwise required. A permanent diversion or a 
stream channel reclaimed after the removal of a temorary diversion shall 
be designed and constructed so as to restore or approximate the 
premining characteristics of the original stream channel including the 
natural riparian vegetation to promote the recovery and the enhancement 
of the aquatic habitat.
    (4) The regulatory authority may specify additional design criteria 
for diversions to meet the requirements of this section.
    (b) Diversion of perennial and intermittent streams. (1) Diversion 
of perennial and intermittent streams within the permit area may be 
approved by the regulatory authority after making the finding relating 
to stream buffer zones called for in 30 CFR 817.57 that the diversions 
will not adversely affect the water quantity and quality and related 
environmental resources of the stream.
    (2) The design capacity of channels for temporary and permanent 
stream channel diversions shall be at least equal to the capacity of the 
unmodified stream channel immediately upstream and downstream from the 
diversion.
    (3) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall 
be met when the temporary and permanent diversions for perennial and 
intermittent streams are designed so that the combination of channel, 
bank and flood-plain configuration is adequate to pass safely the peak 
runoff of a 10-year, 6-hour precipitation event for a temporary 
diversion and a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event for a permanent 
diversion.
    (4) The design and construction of all stream channel diversions of 
perennial and intermittent streams shall be certified by a qualified 
registered professional engineer as meeting the performance standards of 
this part and any design criteria set by the regulatory authority.
    (c) Diversion of miscellaneous flows. (1) Miscellaneous flows, which 
consist of all flows except for perennial and intermittent streams, may 
be diverted away from disturbed areas if required or approved by the 
regulatory authority. Miscellaneous flows shall include ground-water 
discharges and ephemeral streams.
    (2) The design, location, construction, maintenance, and removal of 
diversions of miscellaneous flows shall meet all of the performance 
standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall 
be met when the temporary and permanent diversions for miscellaneous 
flows are designed so that the combination of channel, bank and flood-
plain configuration is adequate to pass safely the peak runoff of a 2-
year, 6-hour precipitation event for a temporary diversion and a 10-
year, 6-hour precipitation event for a permanent diversion.

Sec. 817.45  Hydrologic balance: Sediment control measures.

    (a) Appropriate sediment control measures shall be designed, 
constructed, and maintained using the best technology currently 
available to:
    (1) Prevent, to the extent possible, additional contributions of 
sediment to

[[Page 332]]

stream flow or to runoff outside the permit area,
    (2) Meet the more stringent of applicable State or Federal effluent 
limitations,
    (3) Minimize erosion to the extent possible.
    (b) Sediment control measures include practices carried out within 
and adjacent to the disturbed area. The sedimentation storage capacity 
of practices in and downstream from the disturbed areas shall reflect 
the degree to which successful mining and reclamation techniques are 
applied to reduce erosion and control sediment. Sediment control 
measures consist of the utilization of proper mining and reclamation 
methods and sediment control practices, singly or in combination. 
Sediment control methods include but are not limited to--
    (1) Disturbing the smallest practicable area at any one time during 
the mining operation through progressive backfilling, grading, and 
prompt revegetation as required in Sec. 817.111(b);
    (2) Stabilizing the backfilled material to promote a reduction of 
the rate and volume of runoff in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 817.102;
    (3) Retaining sediment within disturbed areas;
    (4) Diverting runoff away from disturbed areas;
    (5) Diverting runoff using protected channels or pipes through 
disturbed areas so as not to cause additional erosion;
    (6) Using straw dikes, riprap, check dams, mulches, vegetative 
sediment filters, dugout ponds, and other measures that reduce overland 
flow velocity, reduce runoff volume, or trap sediment;
    (7) Treating with chemicals; and
    (8) Treating mine drainage in underground sumps.

Sec. 817.71  Disposal of excess spoil: General requirements.

    (a) General. Excess spoil shall be placed in designated disposal 
areas within the permit area, in a controlled manner to--
    (1) Minimize the adverse effects of leachate and surface water 
runoff from the fill on surface and ground waters;
    (2) Ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement during and after 
construction; and
    (3) Ensure that the final fill is suitable for reclamation and 
revegetation compatible with the natural surroundings and the approved 
postmining land use.
    (b) Design certification. (1) The fill and appurtenant structures 
shall be designed using current, prudent engineering practices and shall 
meet any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. A 
qualified registered professional engineer experienced in the design of 
earth and rock fills shall certify the design of the fill and 
appurtenant structures.
    (2) The fill shall be designed to attain a minimum long-term static 
safety factor of 1.5. The foundation and abutments of the fill must be 
stable under all conditions of construction.
    (c) Location. The disposal area shall be located on the most 
moderately sloping and naturally stable areas available, as approved by 
the regulatory authority, and shall be placed, where possible, upon or 
above a natural terrace, bench, or berm, if such placement provides 
additional stability and prevents mass movement.
    (d) Foundation. (1) Sufficient foundation investigations, as well as 
any necessary laboratory testing of foundation material, shall be 
performed in order to determine the design requirements for foundation 
stability. The analyses of foundation conditions shall take into 
consideration the effect of underground mine workings, if any, upon the 
stability of the fill and appurtenant structures.

[[Page 342]]

    (2) When the slope in the disposal area is in excess of 2.8h:lv (36 
percent), or such lesser slope as may be designated by the regulatory 
authority based on local conditions, keyway cuts (excavations to stable 
bedrock) or rock toe buttresses shall be constructed to ensure stability 
of the fill. Where the toe of the spoil rests on a downslope, stability 
analyses shall be performed in accordance with Sec. 784.19 of this 
chapter to determine the size of rock toe buttresses and keyway cuts.
    (e) Placement of excess spoil. (1) All vegetative and organic 
materials shall be removed from the disposal area prior to placement of 
excess spoil. Topsoil shall be removed, segregated and stored or 
redistributed in accordance with Sec. 817.22. If approved by the 
regulatory authority, organic material may be used as mulch or may be 
included in the topsoil to control erosion, promote growth of vegetation 
or increase the moisture retention of the soil.
    (2) Excess spoil shall be transported and placed in a controlled 
manner in horizontal lifts not exceeding 4 feet in thickness; 
concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass stability and to 
prevent mass movement during and after construction; graded so that 
surface and subsurface drainage is compatible with the natural 
surroundings; and covered with topsoil or substitute material in 
accordance with Sec. 817.22 of this chapter. The regulatory authority 
may approve a design which incorporates placement of excess spoil in 
horizontal lifts other than 4 feet in thickness when it is demonstrated 
by the operator and certified by a qualified registered professional 
engineer that the design will ensure the stability of the fill and will 
meet all other applicable requirements.
    (3) The final configuration of the fill shall be suitable for the 
approved postmining land use. Terraces may be constructed on the 
outslope of the fill if required for stability, control of erosion, to 
conserve soil moisture, or to facilitate the approved postmining land 
use. The grade of the outslope between terrace benches shall not be 
steeper than 2h:lv (50 percent).
    (4) No permanent impoundments are allowed on the completed fill. 
Small depressions may be allowed by the regulatory authority if they are 
needed to retain moisture, minimize erosion, create and enhance wildlife 
habitat, or assist revegetation; and if they are not incompatible with 
the stability of the fill.
    (5) Excess spoil that is acid- or toxic-forming or combustible shall 
be adequately covered with nonacid, nontoxic and noncombustible 
material, or treated, to control the impact on surface and ground water 
in accordance with Sec. 817.41, to prevent sustained combustion, and to 
minimize adverse effects on plant growth and the approved postmining 
land use.
    (f) Drainage control. (1) If the disposal area contains springs, 
natural or manmade water courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design 
shall include diversions and underdrains as necessary to control 
erosion, prevent water infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability.
    (2) Diversions shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 817.43.
    (3) Underdrains shall consist of durable rock or pipe, be designed 
and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices and meet 
any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. The 
underdrain system shall be designed to carry the anticipated seepage of 
water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil fill and from seeps and 
springs in the foundation of the disposal area and shall be protected 
from piping and contamination by an adequate filter. Rock underdrains 
shall be constructed of durable, nonacid-, nontoxic-forming rock (e.g., 
natural sand and gravel, sandstone, limestone, or other durable rock) 
that does not slake in water or degrade to soil materials, and which is 
free of coal, clay or other nondurable material. Perforated pipe 
underdrains shall be corrosion resistant and shall have characteristics 
consistent with the long-term life of the fill.
    (g) Surface area stabilization. Slope protection shall be provided 
to minimize surface erosion at the site. All disturbed areas, including 
diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected, shall 
be revegetated upon completion of construction.
    (h) Inspections. A qualified registered professional engineer or 
other qualified

[[Page 343]]

professional specialist under the direction of the professional 
engineer, shall periodically inspect the fill during construction. The 
professional engineer or specialist shall be experienced in the 
construction of earth and rock fills.
    (1) Such inspections shall be made at least quarterly throughout 
construction and during critical construction periods. Critical 
construction periods shall include at a minimum: (i) Foundation 
preparation, including the removal of all organic material and topsoil; 
(ii) placement of underdrains and protective filter systems; (iii) 
installation of final surface drainage systems; and (iv) the final 
graded and revegetated fill. Regular inspections by the engineer or 
specialist shall also be conducted during placement and compaction of 
fill materials.
    (2) The qualified registered professional engineer shall provide a 
certified report to the regulatory authority promptly after each 
inspection that the fill has been constructed and maintained as designed 
and in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. The report 
shall include appearances of instability, structural weakness, and other 
hazardous conditions.
    (3)(i) The certified report on the drainage system and protective 
filters shall include color photographs taken during and after 
construction, but before underdrains are covered with excess spoil. If 
the underdrain system is constructed in phases, each phase shall be 
certified separately.
    (ii) Where excess durable rock spoil is placed in single or multiple 
lifts such that the underdrain system is constructed simultaneously with 
excess spoil placement by the natural segregation of dumped materials, 
in accordance with Sec. 817.73, color photographs shall be taken of the 
underdrain as the underdrain system is being formed.
    (iii) The photographs accompanying each certified report shall be 
taken in adequate size and number with enough terrain or other physical 
features of the site shown to provide a relative scale to the 
photographs and to specifically and clearly identify the site.
    (4) A copy of each inspection report shall be retained at or near 
the mine site.
    (i) Coal mine waste. Coal mine waste may be disposed of in excess 
spoil fills if approved by the regulatory authority and, if such waste 
is--
    (1) Placed in accordance with Sec. 817.83;
    (2) Nontoxic and nonacid forming; and
    (3) Of the proper characteristics to be consistent with the design 
stability of the fill.
    (j) Underground disposal. Excess spoil may be disposed of in 
underground mine workings, but only in accordance with a plan approved 
by the regulatory authority and MSHA under Sec. 784.25 of this chapter.
    (k) Face-up operations. Spoil resulting from face-up operations for 
underground coal mine development may be placed at drift entries as part 
of a cut and fill structure, if the structure is less than 400 feet in 
horizontal length, and designed in accordance with Sec. 817.71.

<R05>
Sec. 817.72  Disposal of excess spoil: Valley fill/head-of-hollow fills.

    Valley fills and head-of-hollow fills shall meet the requirements of 
Sec. 817.71 and the additional requirements of this section.
    (a) Drainage control. (1) The top surface of the completed fill 
shall be graded such that the final slope after settlement will be 
toward properly designed drainage channels. Uncontrolled surface 
drainage may not be directed over the outslope of the fill.
    (2) Runoff from areas above the fill and runoff from the surface of 
the fill shall be diverted into stabilized diversion channels designed 
to meet the requirements of Sec. 817.43 and to safely pass the runoff 
from a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event.
    (b) Rock-core chimney drains. A rock-core chimney drain may be used 
in a head-of-hollow fill, instead of the underdrain and surface 
diversion system normally required, as long as the fill is not located 
in an area containing intermittent or perennial streams. A rock-core 
chimney drain may be used in a valley fill if the fill does not exceed 
250,000 cubic yards of material and upstream drainage is diverted around 
the fill. The alternative rock-core

[[Page 344]]

chimney drain system shall be incorporated into the design and 
construction of the fill as follows:
    (1) The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main 
buried stream channel or rill, a vertical core of durable rock at least 
16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of 
the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill. A 
system of lateral rock underdrains shall connect this rock core to each 
area of potential drainage or seepage in the disposal area. The 
underdrain system and rock core shall be designed to carry the 
anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil 
fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area. 
Rocks used in the rock core and underdrains shall meet the requirements 
of Sec. 817.71(f).
    (2) A filter system to ensure the proper long-term functioning of 
the rock core shall be designed and constructed using current, prudent 
engineering practices.
    (3) Grading may drain surface water away from the outslope of the 
fill and toward the rock core. In no case, however, may intermittent or 
perennial streams be diverted into the rock core. The maximum slope of 
the top of the fill shall be 33h:lv (3 percent). A drainage pocket may 
be maintained at the head of the fill during and after construction, to 
intercept surface runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the 
rock drain, if stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall 
this pocket or sump have a potential capacity for impounding more than 
10,000 cubic feet of water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a 
3 to 5 percent grade toward the fill and a 1 percent slope toward the 
rock core.

multiple lifts, provided the following conditions are met:
    (a) Except as provided in this section, the requirements of Sec. 
817.71 are met.
    (b) The excess spoil consists of at least 80 percent, by volume, 
durable, nonacid- and nontoxic-forming rock (e.g., sandstone or 
limestone) that does not slake in water and will not degrade to soil 
material. Where used, noncemented clay shale, clay spoil, soil or other 
nondurable excess spoil material shall be mixed with excess durable rock 
spoil in a controlled manner such that no more than 20 percent of the 
fill volume, as determined by tests performed by a registered engineer 
and approved by the regulatory authority, is not durable rock.
    (c) A qualified registered professional engineer certifies that the 
design will ensure the stability of the fill and meet all other 
applicable requirements.
    (d) The fill is designed to attain a minimum long-term static safety 
factor of 1.5, and an earthquake safety factor of 1.1.
    (e) The underdrain system may be constructed simultaneously with 
excess spoil placement by the natural segregation of dumped materials, 
provided the resulting underdrain system is capable of carrying 
anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil 
fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area 
and the other requirements for drainage control are met.
    (f) Surface water runoff from areas adjacent to and above the fill 
is not allowed to flow onto the fill and is diverted into stabilized 
diversion channels designed to meet the requirements of Sec. 817.43 and 
to safely pass the runoff from a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event.

spoil through placement on a preexisting bench if the affected portion 
of the preexisting bench is permitted and the standards set forth in 
Sec. 817.102 (c), (e) through (h), and (j), and the requirements of 
this section are met.
    (b) All vegetation and organic materials shall be removed from the 
affected portion of the preexisting bench prior to placement of the 
excess spoil. Any available topsoil on the bench

[[Page 345]]

shall be removed, stored and redistributed in accordance with Sec. 
817.22 of this part. Substitute or supplemental materials may be used in 
accordance with Sec. 817.22(b) of this part.
    (c) The fill shall be designed and constructed using current, 
prudent engineering practices. The design will be certified by a 
registered professional engineer. The spoil shall be placed on the solid 
portion of the bench in a controlled manner and concurrently compacted 
as necessary to attain a long term static safety factor of 1.3 for all 
portions of the fill. Any spoil deposited on any fill portion of the 
bench will be treated as excess spoil fill under Sec. 817.71.
    (d) The preexisting bench shall be backfilled and graded to--
    (1) Achieve the most moderate slope possible which does not exceed 
the angle of repose;
    (2) Eliminate the highwall to the maximum extent technically 
practical;
    (3) Minimize erosion and water pollution both on and off the site; 
and
    (4) If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade water 
courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design shall include diversions 
and underdrains as necessary to control erosion, prevent water 
infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability.
    (e) All disturbed areas, including diversion channels that are not 
riprapped or otherwise protected, shall be revegetated upon completion 
of construction.
    (f) Permanent impoundments may not be constructed on preexisting 
benches backfilled with excess spoil under this regulation.
    (g) Final configuration of the backfill must be compatible with the 
natural drainage patterns and the surrounding area, and support the 
approved postmining land use.
    (h) Disposal of excess spoil from an upper actively mined bench to a 
lower preexisting bench by means of gravity transport may be approved by 
the regulatory authority provided that--
    (1) The gravity transport courses are determined on a site-specific 
basis by the operator as part of the permit application and approved by 
the regulatory authority to minimize hazards to health and safety and to 
ensure that damage will be minimized between the benches, outside the 
set course, and downslope of the lower bench should excess spoil 
accidentally move;
    (2) All gravity transported excess spoil, including that excess 
spoil immediately below the gravity transport courses and any 
preexisting spoil that is disturbed, is rehandled and placed in 
horizontal lifts in a controlled manner, concurrently compacted as 
necessary to ensure mass stability and to prevent mass movement, and 
graded to allow surface and subsurface drainage to be compatible with 
the natural surroundings and to ensure a minimum long-term static safety 
factor of 1.3. Excess spoil on the bench prior to the current mining 
operation that is not disturbed need not be rehandled except where 
necessary to ensure stability of the fill;
    (3) A safety berm is constructed on the solid portion of the lower 
bench prior to gravity transport of the excess spoil. Where there is 
insufficient material on the lower bench to construct a safety berm, 
only that amount of excess spoil necessary for the construction of the 
berm may be gravity transported to the lower bench prior to construction 
of the berm;
    (4) Excess spoil shall not be allowed on the downslope below the 
upper bench except on designated gravity transport courses properly 
prepared according to Sec. 817.22. Upon completion of the fill, no 
excess spoil shall be allowed to remain on the designated gravity 
transport course between the two benches and each transport course shall 
be reclaimed in accordance with the requirements of this part.

the approved postmining land use. Terraces may be constructed on the 
outslope of the refuse pile if required for stability, control of 
erosion, conservation of soil moisture, or facilitation of the approved 
postmining land use. The grade of the outslope between terrace benches 
shall not be steeper than 2h:1v (50 percent).
    (3) No permanent impoundments shall be allowed on the completed 
refuse pile. Small depressions may be allowed by the regulatory 
authority if they are needed to retain moisture, minimize erosion, 
create and enhance wildlife habitat, or assist revegetation, and if they 
are not incompatible with stability of the refuse pile.
    (4) Following final grading of the refuse pile, the coal mine waste 
shall be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of the best available, 
nontoxic and noncombustible material, in a manner that does not impede 
drainage from the underdrains. The regulatory authority may allow less 
than 4 feet of cover material based on physical and chemical analyses 
which show that the requirements of Sec. Sec. 817.111 through 817.116 
will be met.
    (d) Inspections. A qualified registered professional engineer, or 
other qualified professional specialist under the direction of the 
professional engineer, shall inspect the refuse pile during 
construction. The professional engineer or specialist shall be 
experienced in the construction of similar earth and waste structures.
    (1) Such inspection shall be made at least quarterly throughout 
construction and during critical construction periods. Critical 
construction periods shall include at a minimum: (i) Foundation 
preparation including the removal of all organic material and topsoil; 
(ii) placement of underdrains and protective filter systems; (iii) 
installation of final surface drainage systems; and (iv) the final 
graded and revegetated facility. Regular inspections by the engineer or 
specialist shall also be conducted during placement and compaction of 
coal mine waste materials. More frequent inspections shall be conducted 
if a danger of harm exists to the public health and safety or the 
environment. Inspections shall continue until the refuse pile has been 
finally graded and revegetated or until a later time as required by the 
regulatory authority.
    (2) The qualified registered professional engineer shall provide a 
certified report to the regulatory authority promptly after each 
inspection that the refuse pile has been constructed and maintained as 
designed and in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. The 
report shall include appearances of instability, structural weakness, 
and other hazardous conditions.
    (3) The certified report on the drainage system and protective 
filters shall include color photographs taken during and after 
construction, but before underdrains are covered with coal mine waste. 
If the underdrain system is constructed in phases, each phase shall be 
certified separately. The photographs accompanying each certified report 
shall be taken in adequate size and number with enough terrain or other 
physical features of the site shown to provide a relative scale to the 
photographs and to specifically and clearly identify the site.
    (4) A copy of each inspection report shall be retained at or near 
the minesite.

authority and included in an approved regulatory program.
    (2) Standards for success shall include criteria representative of 
unmined lands in the area being reclaimed to evaluate the appropriate 
vegetation parameters of ground cover, production, or stocking. Ground 
cover, production, or stocking shall be considered equal to the approved 
success standard when they are not less than 90 percent of the success 
standard. The sampling techniques for measuring success shall use a 90-
percent statistical confidence interval (i.e., a one-sided test with a 
0.10 alpha error).
    (b) Standards for success shall be applied in accordance with the 
approved postmining land use and, at a minimum, the following 
conditions:
    (1) For areas developed for use as grazing land or pasture land, the 
ground cover and production of living plants on the revegetated area 
shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or such other 
success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
    (2) For areas developed for use as cropland, crop production on the 
revegetated area shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or 
such other success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
    (3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, 
recreation, shelter belts, or forest products, success of vegetation 
shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and 
vegetative ground cover. Such parameters are described as follows:
    (i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by 
the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions 
and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies 
responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. 
Consultation and approval may occur on either a programwide or a permit-
specific basis.
    (ii) Trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success 
of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall have utility 
for the approved postmining land use. Trees and shrubs counted in 
determining such success shall be healthy and have been in place for not 
less than two growing seasons. At the time of bond release, at least 80 
percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine such success shall 
have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable minimum period of 
responsibility.
    (iii) Vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required 
to achieve the approved postmining land use.
    (4) For areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or 
residential use less than 2 years after regrading is

[[Page 354]]

completed, the vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that 
required to control erosion.
    (5) For areas previously disturbed by mining that were not reclaimed 
to the requirements of this subchapter and that are remined or otherwise 
redisturbed by surface coal mining operations, as a minimum, the 
vegetative ground cover shall be not less than the ground cover existing 
before redisturbance and shall be adequate to control erosion.
    (c)(1) The period of extended responsibility for successful 
revegetation shall begin after the last year of augmented seeding, 
fertilizing, irrigation, or other work, excluding husbandry practices 
that are approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (2) In areas of more than 26.0 inches of annual average 
precipitation, the period of responsibility shall continue for a period 
of not less than:
    (i) Five full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section. The vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of 
this section for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or 
exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any 2 
years of the responsibility period, except the first year. Areas 
approved for the other uses identified in paragraph (b) of this section 
shall equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing 
season of the last year of the responsibility period.
    (ii) Two full years for lands eligible for remining included in 
permits issued before September 30, 2004, or any renewals thereof. To 
the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, the lands shall equal or exceed the standards 
during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
    (3) In areas of 26.0 inches or less average annual precipitation, 
the period of responsibility shall continue for a period of not less 
than:
    (i) Ten full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of 
this section. Vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of this 
section shall equal or exceed the approved success standard for at least 
the last two consecutive years of the responsibility period.
    (ii) Five full years for lands eligible for remining included in 
permits issued before September 30, 2004, or any renewals thereof. To 
the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, the lands shall equal or exceed the standards 
during the growing seasons of the last two consecutive years of the 
responsibility period.
    (4) The regulatory authority may approve selective husbandry 
practices, excluding augmented seeding, fertilization, or irrigation, 
provided it obtains prior approval from the Director in accordance with 
Sec. 732.17 of this chapter that the practices are normal husbandry 
practices, without extending the period of responsibility for 
revegetation success and bond liability, if such practices can be 
expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or if 
discontinuance of the practices after the liability period expires will 
not reduce the probability of permanent revegetation success. Approved 
practices shall be normal husbandry practices within the region for 
unmined lands having land uses similar to the approved postmining land 
use of the disturbed area, including such practices as disease, pest, 
and vermin control; and any pruning, reseeding, and transplanting 
specifically necessitated by such actions.

Sec. 817.121  Subsidence control.

    (a) Measures to prevent or minimize damage. (1) The permittee must 
either adopt measures consistent with known technology that prevent 
subsidence from causing material damage to the extent technologically 
and economically feasible, maximize mine stability, and maintain the 
value and reasonably foreseeable use of surface lands or adopt mining 
technology that provides for planned subsidence in a predictable and 
controlled manner.
    (2) If a permittee employs mining technology that provides for 
planned subsidence in a predictable and controlled manner, the permittee 
must take necessary and prudent measures,

[[Page 355]]

consistent with the mining method employed, to minimize material damage 
to the extent technologically and economically feasible to non-
commercial buildings and occupied residential dwellings and structures 
related thereto except that measures required to minimize material 
damage to such structures are not required if:
    (i) The permittee has the written consent of their owners or
    (ii) Unless the anticipated damage would constitute a threat to 
health or safety, the costs of such measures exceed the anticipated 
costs of repair.
    (3) Nothing in this part prohibits the standard method of room-and-
pillar mining.
    (b) The operator shall comply with all provisions of the approved 
subsidence control plan prepared pursuant to Sec. 784.20 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Repair of damage--(1) Repair of damage to surface lands. The 
permittee must correct any material damage resulting from subsidence 
caused to surface lands, to the extent technologically and economically 
feasible, by restoring the land to a condition capable of maintaining 
the value and reasonably foreseeable uses that it was capable of 
supporting before subsidence damage.
    (2) Repair or compensation for damage to non-commercial buildings 
and dwellings and related structures. The permittee must promptly 
repair, or compensate the owner for, material damage resulting from 
subsidence caused to any non-commercial building or occupied residential 
dwelling or structure related thereto that existed at the time of 
mining. If repair option is selected, the permittee must fully 
rehabilitate, restore or replace the damaged structure. If compensation 
is selected, the permittee must compensate the owner of the damaged 
structure for the full amount of the decrease in value resulting from 
the subsidence-related damage. The permittee may provide compensation by 
the purchase, before mining, of a non-cancelable premium-prepaid 
insurance policy. The requirements of this paragraph apply only to 
subsidence-related damage caused by underground mining activities 
conducted after October 24, 1992.
    (3) Repair or compensation for damage to other structures. The 
permittee must, to the extent required under applicable provisions of 
State law, either correct material damage resulting from subsidence 
caused to any structures or facilities not protected by paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section by repairing the damage or compensate the owner of the 
structures or facilities for the full amount of the decrease in value 
resulting from the subsidence. Repair of damage includes rehabilitation, 
restoration, or replacement of damaged structures or facilities. 
Compensation may be accomplished by the purchase before mining of a non-
cancelable premium-prepaid insurance policy.
    (4) Rebuttable presumption of causation by subsidence--(i) 
Rebuttable presumption of causation for damage within angle of draw. If 
damage to any non-commercial building or occupied residential dwelling 
or structure related thereto occurs as a result of earth movement within 
an area determined by projecting a specified angle of draw from the 
outermost boundary of any underground mine workings to the surface of 
the land, a rebuttable presumption exists that the permittee caused the 
damage. The presumption will normally apply to a 30-degree angle of 
draw. A State regulatory authority may amend its program to apply the 
presumption to a different angle of draw if the regulatory authority 
shows in writing that the angle has a more reasonable basis than the 30-
degree angle of draw, based on geotechnical analysis of the factors 
affecting potential surface impacts of underground coal mining 
operations in the State.
    (ii) Approval of site-specific angle of draw. A permittee or permit 
applicant may request that the presumption apply to an angle of draw 
different from that established in the regulatory program. The 
regulatory authority may approve application of the presumption to a 
site-specific angle of draw different than that contained in the State 
or Federal program based on a site-specific analysis submitted by an 
applicant. To establish a site-specific angle of draw, an applicant must 
demonstrate and the regulatory authority must determine in writing that 
the

[[Page 356]]

proposed angle of draw has a more reasonable basis than the standard set 
forth in the State or Federal program, based on a site-specific 
geotechnical analysis of the potential surface impacts of the mining 
operation.
    (iii) No presumption where access for pre-subsidence survey is 
denied. If the permittee was denied access to the land or property for 
the purpose of conducting the pre-subsidence survey in accordance with 
Sec. 784.20(a) of this chapter, no rebuttable presumption will exist.
    (iv) Rebuttal of presumption. The presumption will be rebutted if, 
for example, the evidence establishes that: The damage predated the 
mining in question; the damage was proximately caused by some other 
factor or factors and was not proximately caused by subsidence; or the 
damage occurred outside the surface area within which subsidence was 
actually caused by the mining in question.
    (v) Information to be considered in determination of causation. In 
any determination whether damage to protected structures was caused by 
subsidence from underground mining, all relevant and reasonably 
available information will be considered by the regulatory authority.
    (5) Adjustment of bond amount for subsidence damage. When 
subsidence-related material damage to land, structures or facilities 
protected under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section occurs, 
or when contamination, diminution, or interruption to a water supply 
protected under Sec. 817.41 (j) occurs, the regulatory authority must 
require the permittee to obtain additional performance bond in the 
amount of the estimated cost of the repairs if the permittee will be 
repairing, or in the amount of the decrease in value if the permittee 
will be compensating the owner, or in the amount of the estimated cost 
to replace the protected water supply if the permittee will be replacing 
the water supply, until the repair, compensation, or replacement is 
completed. If repair, compensation, or replacement is completed within 
90 days of the occurrence of damage, no additional bond is required. The 
regulatory authority may extend the 90-day time frame, but not to exceed 
one year, if the permittee demonstrates and the regulatory authority 
finds in writing that subsidence is not complete, that not all probable 
subsidence-related material damage has occurred to lands or protected 
structures, or that not all reasonably anticipated changes have occurred 
affecting the protected water supply, and that therefore it would be 
unreasonable to complete within 90 days the repair of the subsidence-
related material damage to lands or protected structures, or the 
replacement of protected water supply.
    (d) Underground mining activities shall not be conducted beneath or 
adjacent to (1) public buildings and facilities; (2) churches, schools, 
and hospitals; or (3) impoundments with a storage capacity of 20 acre-
feet or more or bodies of water with a volume of 20 acre-feet or more, 
unless the subsidence control plan demonstrates that subsidence will not 
cause material damage to, or reduce the reasonably foreseeable use of, 
such features or facilities. If the regulatory authority determines that 
it is necessary in order to minimize the potential for material damage 
to the features or facilities described above or to any aquifer or body 
of water that serves as a significant water source for any public water 
supply system, it may limit the percentage of coal extracted under or 
adjacent thereto.
    (e) If subsidence causes material damage to any of the features or 
facilities covered by paragraph (d) of this section, the regulatory 
authority may suspend mining under or adjacent to such features or 
facilities until the subsidence control plan is modified to ensure 
prevention of further material damage to such features or facilities.
    (f) The regulatory authority shall suspend underground mining 
activities under urbanized areas, cities, towns, and communities, and 
adjacent to industrial or commercial buildings, major impoundments, or 
perennial streams, if imminent danger is found to inhabitants of the 
urbanized areas, cities, towns, or communities.
    (g) Within a schedule approved by the regulatory authority, the 
operator shall submit a detailed plan of the underground workings. The 
detailed plan shall include maps and descriptions, as

[[Page 357]]

appropriate, of significant features of the underground mine, including 
the size, configuration, and approximate location of pillars and 
entries, extraction ratios, measure taken to prevent or minimize 
subsidence and related damage, areas of full extraction, and other 
information required by the regulatory authority. Upon request of the 
operator, information submitted with the detailed plan may be held as 
confidential, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 773.6(d) of 
this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 817.122  Subsidence control: Public notice.

    At least 6 months prior to mining, or within that period if approved 
by the regulatory authority, the underground mine operator shall mail a 
notification to all owners and occupants of surface property and 
structures above the underground workings. The notification shall 
include, at a minimum, identification of specific areas in which mining 
will take place, dates that specific areas will be undermined, and the 
location or locations where the operator's subsidence control plan may 
be examined.

[48 FR 24652, June 1, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 817.131  Cessation of operations: Temporary.

    (a) Each person who conducts underground mining activities shall 
effectively support and maintain all surface access openings to 
underground operations, and secure surface facilities in areas in which 
there are no current operations, but operations are to be resumed under 
an approved permit. Temporary abandonment shall not relieve a person of 
his or her obligation to comply with any provisions of the approved 
permit.
    (b) Before temporary cessation of mining and reclamation operations 
for a period of thirty days or more, or as soon as it is known that a 
temporary cessation will extend beyond 30 days, each person who conducts 
underground mining activities shall submit to the regulatory authority a 
notice of intention to cease or abandon operations. This notice shall 
include a statement of the exact number of surface acres and the 
horizontal and vertical extent of sub-surface strata which have been in 
the permit area prior to cessation or abandonment, the extent and kind 
of reclamation of surface area which will have been accomplished, and 
identification of the backfilling, regrading, revegetation, 
environmental monitoring, underground opening closures and water 
treatment activities that will continue during the temporary cessation.


<R05>
Sec. 817.132  Cessation of operations: Permanent.

    (a) The person who conducts underground mining activities shall 
close or backfill or otherwise permanently reclaim all affected areas, 
in accordance with this chapter and according to the permit approved by 
the regulatory authority.
    (b) All surface equipment, structures, or other facilities not 
required for continued underground mining activities and monitoring, 
unless approved as suitable for the postmining land use or environmental 
monitoring, shall be removed and the affected lands reclaimed.


<R05>
Sec. 817.133  Postmining land use.

    (a) General. All disturbed areas shall be restored in a timely 
manner to conditions that are capable of supporting--
    (1) The uses they were capable of supporting before any mining; or
    (2) Higher or better uses.
    (b) Determining premining uses of land. The premining uses of land 
to which the postmining land use is compared shall be those uses which 
the land previously supported, if the land has not been previously mined 
and has been properly managed. The postmining land use for land that has 
been previously mined and not reclaimed shall be judged on the basis of 
the land use that existed prior to any mining: Provided that, if the 
land cannot be reclaimed to the land use that existed prior to any 
mining because of the previously mined condition, the postmining land 
use shall be judged on

[[Page 358]]

the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is 
compatible with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance 
of areas previously unaffected by mining.
    (c) Criteria for alternative postmining land uses. Higher or better 
uses may be approved by the regulatory authority as alternative 
postmining land uses after consultation with the landowner or the land 
management agency having jurisdiction over the lands, if the proposed 
uses meet the following criteria:
    (1) There is a reasonable likelihood for achievement of the use.
    (2) The use does not present any actual or probable hazard to public 
health and safety, or threat of water diminution or pollution.
    (3) The use will not--
    (i) Be impractical or unreasonable;
    (ii) Be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans;
    (iii) Involve unreasonable delay in implementation; or
    (iv) Cause or contribute to violation of Federal, State, or local 
law.
    (d) Approximate original contour: Criteria for variance. Surface 
coal mining operations that meet the requirements of this paragraph may 
be conducted under a variance from the requirement to restore disturbed 
areas to their approximate original contour, if the following 
requirements are satisfied:
    (1) The regulatory authority grants the variance under a permit 
issued in accordance with Sec. 785.16 of this chapter.
    (2) The alternative postmining land use requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section are met.
    (3) All applicable requirements of the Act and the regulatory 
program, other than the requirement to restore disturbed areas to their 
approximate original contour, are met.
    (4) After consultation with the appropriate land use planning 
agencies, if any, the potential use is shown to constitute an equal or 
better economic or public use.
    (5) The proposed use is designed and certified by a qualified 
registered professional engineer in conformance with professional 
standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and 
configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.
    (6) After approval, where required, of the appropriate State 
environmental agencies, the watershed of the permit and adjacent areas 
is shown to be improved.
    (7) The highwall is completely backfilled with spoil material, in a 
manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3, using 
standard geotechnical analysis.
    (8) Only the amount of spoil as is necessary to achieve the 
postmining land use, ensure the stability of spoil retained on the 
bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act and this chapter is 
placed off the mine bench. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be 
placed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 817.71 through 817.74 of this 
chapter.
    (9) The surface landowner of the permit area has knowingly 
requested, in writing, that a variance be granted, so as to render the 
land, after reclamation, suitable for an industrial, commercial, 
residential, or public use (including recreational facilities).
    (10) Federal, State, and local government agencies with an interest 
in the proposed land use have an adequate period in which to review and 
comment on the proposed use.

performance standards of this part and any additional criteria specified 
by the regulatory authority;
    (2) A road damaged by a catastrophic event, such as a flood or 
earthquake, shall be repaired as soon as is practicable after the damage 
has occurred.
    (f) Reclamation. A road not to be retained under an approved 
postmining land use shall be reclaimed in accordance with the approved 
reclamation plan as soon as practicable after it is no longer needed for 
mining and reclamation operations. This reclamation shall include:
    (1) Closing the road to traffic;
    (2) Removing all bridges and culverts unless approved as part of the 
postmining land use;
    (3) Removing or otherwise disposing of road-surfacing materials that 
are incompatible with the postmining land use and revegetation 
requirements;
    (4) Reshaping cut and fill slopes as necessary to be compatible with 
the postmining land use and to complement the natural drainage pattern 
of the surrounding terrain;
    (5) Protecting the natural drainage patterns by installing dikes or 
cross drains as necessary to control surface runoff and erosion; and
    (6) Scarifying or ripping the roadbed, replacing topsoil or 
substitute material and revegetating disturbed surfaces in accordance 
with Sec. Sec. 817.22 and 817.111 through 817.116 of this chapter.

Sec. 817.151  Primary roads.

    Primary roads shall meet the requirements of Sec. 817.150 and the 
additional requirements of this section.
    (a) Certification. The construction or reconstruction of primary 
roads shall be certified in a report to the regulatory authority by a 
qualified registered professional engineer, or in any State which 
authorizes land surveyors to certify the construction or reconstruction 
of primary roads, a qualified registered professional land surveyor, 
with experience in the design and construction of roads. The report 
shall indicate that the primary road has been constructed or 
reconstructed as designed and in accordance with the approved plan.

[[Page 360]]

    (b) Safety factor. Each primary road embankment shall have a minimum 
static factor of 1.3 or meet the requirements established under Sec. 
784.24(c).
    (c) Location. (1) To minimize erosion, a primary road shall be 
located, insofar as is practicable, on the most stable available 
surface.
    (2) Fords of perennial or intermittent streams by primary roads are 
prohibited unless they are specifically approved by the regulatory 
authority as temporary routes during periods of road construction.
    (d) Drainage control. In accordance with the approved plan--
    (1) Each primary road shall be constructed or reconstructed, and 
maintained to have adequate drainage control, using structures such as, 
but not limited to bridges, ditches, cross drains, and ditch relief 
drains. The drainage control system shall be designed to safely pass the 
peak runoff from a 10-year, 6-hour precipitation event, or greater event 
as specified by the regulatory authority;
    (2) Drainage pipes and culverts shall be installed as designed, and 
maintained in a free and operating condition and to prevent or control 
erosion at inlets and outlets;
    (3) Drainage ditches shall be constructed and maintained to prevent 
uncontrolled drainage over the road surface and embankment;
    (4) Culverts shall be installed and maintained to sustain the 
vertical soil pressure, the passive resistance of the foundation, and 
the weight of vehicles using the road;
    (5) Natural stream channels shall not be altered or relocated 
without the prior approval of the regulatory authority in accordance 
with applicable Sec. Sec. 816.41 through 816.43 and 816.57 of this 
chapter; and
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
structures for perennial or intermittent stream channel crossings shall 
be made using bridges, culverts, low-water crossings, or other 
structures designed, constructed, and maintained using current, prudent 
engineering practices. The regulatory authority shall ensure that low-
water crossings are designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent 
erosion of the structure or streambed and additional contributions of 
suspended solids to streamflow.
    (e) Surfacing. Primary roads shall be surfaced with material 
approved by the regulatory authority as being sufficiently durable for 
the anticipated volume of traffic and the weight and speed of vehicles 
using the road.

standards.

    The following interpretations of rules promulgated in part 817 of 
this chapter have been adopted by the Office of Surface Mining 
Reclamation and Enforcement.
    (a)-(b) [Reserved]

[[Page 361]]

    (c) Interpretation of Sec. 816.22(e)--Topsoil Removal. (1) Results 
of physical and chemical analyses of overburden and topsoil to 
demonstrate that the resulting soil medium is equal to or more suitable 
for sustaining revegetation than the available topsoil, provided that 
trials, and tests are certified by an approved laboratory in accordance 
with 30 CFR 816.22(e)(1)(ii), may be obtained from any one or a 
combination of the following sources:
    (i) U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service 
published data based on established soil series;
    (ii) U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service 
Technical Guides;
    (iii) State agricultural agency, university, Tennessee Valley 
Authority, Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Forest Service published data based on soil series properties and 
behavior, or
    (iv) Results of physical and chemical analyses, field site trials, 
or greenhouse tests of the topsoil and overburden materials (soil 
series) from the permit area.
    (2) If the operator demonstrates through soil survey or other data 
that the topsoil and unconsolidated material are insufficient and 
substitute materials will be used, only the substitute materials must be 
analyzed in accordance with 30 CFR 816.22(e)(1)(i).
    (d) Interpretation of Sec. 817.133: Postmining land use. (1) The 
requirements of 30 CFR 784.15(a)(2), for approval of an alternative 
postmining land use, may be met by requesting approval through the 
permit revision procedures of 30 CFR 774.13 rather than requesting such 
approval through the permit application. The original permit 
application, however, must demonstrate that the land will be returned to 
its premining land use capability as required by 30 CFR 817.133(a).

An application for a permit revision of this type, (i) must be submitted 
in accordance with the filing deadlines of 30 CFR 774.13, (ii) shall 
constitute a significant alteration from the mining operations 
contemplated by the original permit, and (iii) shall be subject to the 
requirements of 30 CFR part 773 and 775.

Sec. 819.13  Auger mining: Coal recovery.

    (a) Auger mining shall be conducted so as to maximize the 
utilization and conservation of the coal in accordance with Sec. 816.59 
of this chapter.
    (b) Auger mining shall be planned and conducted to maximize 
recoverability of mineral reserves remaining after the operation and 
reclamation are complete.
    (c) Each person who conducts auger mining operations shall leave 
areas of undisturbed coal, as approved by the regulatory authority, to 
provide access

[[Page 362]]

for future underground mining activities to coal reserves remaining 
after augering is completed, unless it is established that the coal 
reserves have been depleted or are so limited in thickness or extent 
that it will not be practicable to recover the remaining coal. This 
determination shall be made by the regulatory authority upon 
presentation of appropriate technical evidence by the operator.


<R05>
Sec. 819.15  Auger mining: Hydrologic balance.

    (a) Auger mining shall be planned and conducted to minimize 
disturbances of the prevailing hydrologic balance in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.41 and 816.42 of this chapter.
    (b) All auger holes, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be--
    (1) Sealed within 72 hours after completion with an impervious and 
noncombustible material, if the holes are discharging water containing 
acid-or toxic-forming material. If sealing is not possible within 72 
hours, the discharge shall be treated commencing within 72 hours after 
completion to meet applicable effluent limitations and water-quality 
standards until the holes are sealed; and
    (2) Sealed with an impervious noncombustible material, as 
contemporaneously as practicable with the augering operation, as 
approved by the regulatory authority, if the holes are not discharging 
water containing acid-or toxic-forming material.
    (c) Auger holes need not be sealed with an impervious material so as 
to prevent drainage if the regulatory authority determines that--
    (1) The resulting impoundment of water may create a hazard to the 
environment or public health or safety, and
    (2) The drainage from the auger holes will--
    (i) Not pose a threat of pollution to surface water, and
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.41 and 816.42 of 
this chapter.


<R05>

backfilling and grading requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.102 and 816.104 
through 816.106 of this chapter.
    (b) Remining. Where auger mining operations affect previously mined 
areas that were not reclaimed to the standards of this chapter and the 
volume of all reasonably available spoil is demonstrated in writing to 
the regulatory authority to be insufficient to completely backfill the 
highwall, the highwall shall be eliminated to the maximum extent 
technically practical in accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) The person who conducts the auger mining operation shall 
demonstrate to the regulatory authority that the backfill, designed by a 
qualified registered professional engineer, has a minimum static safety 
factor for the stability of the backfill of at least 1.3.
    (2) All spoil generated by the auger mining operation and any 
associated surface coal mining and reclamation operation, and any other 
reasonably available spoil shall be used to backfill the area. 
Reasonably available spoil shall include spoil generated by the mining 
operation and other spoil located in the permit area that is accessible 
and available for use and that when rehandled will not cause a hazard to 
the public safety or significant damage to the environment. For this 
purpose, the permit area shall include spoil in the immediate vicinity 
of the auger mining operation.
    (3) The coal seam mined shall be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of 
nonacid-, nontoxic-forming material and the backfill graded to a slope 
which is compatible with the approved postmining land use and which 
provides adequate drainage and long-term stability.
    (4) Any remnant of the highwall shall be stable and not pose a 
hazard to the

[[Page 363]]

public health and safety or to the environment.
    (5) Spoil placed on the outslope during previous mining operations 
shall not be disturbed if such disturbances will cause instability of 
the remaining spoil or otherwise increase the hazard to the public 
health and safety or to the environment.

paragraph (a) was suspended ``insofar as it excludes from the 
requirements of part 823 those coal preparation plants, support 
facilities, and roads that are surface mining activities''.


<R05>
Sec. 823.12  Soil removal and stockpiling.

    (a) Prime farmland soils shall be removed from the areas to be 
disturbed before drilling, blasting, or mining.
    (b) The minimum depth of soil and soil materials to be removed and 
stored for use in the reconstruction of prime farmland shall be 
sufficient to meet the requirements of Sec. 823.14(b).
    (c) Soil removal and stockpiling operations on prime farmland shall 
be conducted to--
    (1) Separately remove the topsoil, or remove other suitable soil 
materials where such other soil materials will create a final soil 
having a greater productive capacity than that which exist prior to 
mining. If not utilized immediately, this material shall be placed in 
stockpiles separate from the spoil and all other excavated materials; 
and
    (2) Separately remove the B or C soil horizon or other suitable soil 
material to provide the thickness of suitable soil required by Sec. 
823.14(b), except as approved by the regulatory authority where the B or 
C soil horizons would not otherwise be removed and where soil 
capabilities can be retained. If not utilized immediately, each horizon 
or other material shall be stockpiled separately from the spoil and all 
other excavated materials. Where combinations of such soil materials 
created by mixing have been shown to be equally or more favorable for 
plant growth than the B horizon, separate handling is not necessary.
    (d) Stockpiles shall be placed within the permit area where they 
will not be disturbed or be subject to excessive erosion. If left in 
place for more than 30 days, stockpiles shall meet the requirements of 
Sec. 816.22 or Sec. 817.22 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 823.14  Soil replacement.

    (a) Soil reconstruction specifications established by the U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service shall be based upon the standards of the National 
Cooperative Soil Survey and shall include, as a minimum, physical and 
chemical characteristics of reconstructed soils and soil descriptions 
containing soil-horizon depths, soil densities, soil pH, and other 
specifications such that reconstructed soils will have the capability of 
achieving levels of yield equal to, or higher than, those of nomined 
prime farmland in the surrounding area.
    (b) The minimum depth of soil and substitute soil material to be 
reconstructed shall be 48 inches, or a lesser depth equal to the depth 
to a subsurface horizon in the natural soil that inhibits or prevents 
root penetration, or a greater depth if determined necessary to restore 
the original soil productive capacity. Soil horizons shall be considered 
as inhibiting or preventing root penetration if their physical or 
chemical properties or water-supplying capacities cause them to restrict 
or

[[Page 366]]

prevent penetration by roots of plants common to the vicinity of the 
permit area and if these properties or capacities have little or no 
beneficial effect on soil productive capacity.
    (c) The operator shall replace and regrade the soil horizons or 
other root-zone material with proper compaction and uniform depth.
    (d) The operator shall replace the B horizon, C horizon, or other 
suitable material specified in Sec. 823.12(c)(2) to the thickness 
needed to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. In 
those areas where the B or C horizons were not removed but may have been 
compacted or otherwise damaged during the mining operation, the operator 
shall engage in deep tilling or other appropriate means to restore pre-
mining capabilities.
    (e) The operator shall replace the topsoil or other suitable soil 
materials specified in Sec. 823.12(c)(1) as the final surface soil 
layer. This surface soil layer shall equal or exceed the thickness of 
the original surface soil layer, as determined by the soil survey.

<R05>
Sec. 823.15  Revegetation and restoration of soil productivity.

    (a) Following prime farmland soil replacement, the soil surface 
shall be stabilized with a vegetative cover or other means that 
effectively controls soil loss by wind and water erosion.
    (b) Prime farmland soil productivity shall be restored in accordance 
with the following provisions:
    (1) Measurement of soil productivity shall be initiated within 10 
years after completion of soil replacement.
    (2) Soil productivity shall be measured on a representative sample 
or on all of the mined and reclaimed prime farmland area using the 
reference crop determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A 
statistically valid sampling technique at a 90-percent or greater 
statistical confidence level shall be used as approved by the regulatory 
authority in consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
    (3) The measurement period for determining average annual crop 
production (yield) shall be a minimum of 3 crop years prior to release 
of the operator's performance bond.
    (4) The level of management applied during the measurement period 
shall be the same as the level of management used on nonmined prime 
farmland in the surrounding area.
    (5) Restoration of soil productivity shall be considered achieved 
when the average yield during the measurement period equals or exceeds 
the average yield of the reference crop established for the same period 
for nonmined soils of the same or similar texture or slope phase of the 
soil series in the surrounding area under equivalent management 
practices.
    (6) The reference crop on which restoration of soil productivity is 
proven shall be selected from the crops most commonly produced on the 
surrounding prime farmland. Where row crops are the dominant crops grown 
on prime farmland in the area, the row crop requiring the greatest 
rooting depth shall be chosen as one of the reference crops.
    (7) Reference crop yields for a given crop season are to be 
determined from--
    (i) The current yield records of representative local farms in the 
surrounding area, with concurrence by the U.S. Soil Conservation 
Service; or
    (ii) The average county yields recognized by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, which have been adjusted by the U.S. Soil Conservation 
Service for local yield variation within the county that is associated 
with differences between nonmined prime farmland soil and all other 
soils that produce the reference crop.
    (8) Under either procedure in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the 
average reference crop yield may be adjusted, with the concurrence of 
the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, for--
    (i) Disease, pest, and weather-induced seasonal variations; or
    (ii) Differences in specific management practices where the overall 
management practices of the crops being compared are equivalent.

original contour, if--
    (1) The regulatory authority grants the variance under a permit, in 
accordance with 30 CFR 785.14;
    (2) The activities involve the mining of an entire coal seam running 
through the upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill, by removing 
all of the overburden and creating a level plateau or gently rolling 
contour with no highwalls remaining;
    (3) An industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or public 
facility (including recreational facilities) use is proposed and 
approved for the affected land;
    (4) The alternative land use requirements of Sec. 816.133(a) 
through (c) of this chapter are met;
    (5) All applicable requirements of this subchapter and the 
regulatory program, other than the requirement to restore affected areas 
to their approximate original contour, are met;
    (6) An outcrop barrier of sufficient width, consisting of the toe of 
the lowest coal seam, and its associated overburden, are retained to 
prevent slides and erosion, except that the regulatory authority may 
permit an exemption to the retention of the coal barrier requirement if 
the following conditions are satisfied:
    (i) The proposed mine site was mined prior to May 3, 1978, and the 
toe of the lowest seam has been removed; or
    (ii) A coal barrier adjacent to a head-of-hollow fill may be removed 
after the elevation of a head-of-hollow fill attains the elevation of 
the coal barrier if the head-of-hollow fill provides the stability 
otherwise ensured by the retention of a coal barrier;
    (7) The final graded slopes on the mined area are less than 1v:5h, 
so as to create a level plateau or gently rolling configuration, and the 
outslopes of the plateau do not exceed 1v:2h except where engineering 
data substantiates, and the regulatory authority finds, in writing, and 
includes in the permit under 30 CFR 785.14, that a minimum static safety 
factor of 1.5 will be attained;
    (8) The resulting level or gently rolling contour is graded to drain 
inward from the outslope, except at specified points where it drains 
over the out slope in stable and protected channels. The drainage shall 
not be through or over a valley or head-of-hollow fill.
    (9) Natural watercourses below the lowest coal seam mined are not 
damaged;
    (10) All waste and acid-forming or toxic-forming materials, 
including the strata immediately below the coal seam, are covered with 
non-toxic spoil to prevent pollution and achieve the approved postmining 
land use; and
    (11) Spoil is placed on the mountaintop bench as necessary to 
achieve the postmining land use approved under

[59 FR 60883, Nov. 28, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 840.11  Inspections by State regulatory authority.

    (a) The State regulatory authority shall conduct an average of at 
least one partial inspection per month of each active surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation under its jurisdiction, and shall 
conduct such partial inspections of each inactive surface coal mining 
and reclamation operation under its jurisdiction as are necessary to 
ensure effective enforcement of the approved State program. A partial 
inspection is an on-site or aerial review of a person's compliance with 
some of the permit conditions and requirements imposed under an approved 
State program.
    (b) The State regulatory authority shall conduct an average of at 
least one complete inspection per calendar quarter of each active or 
inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation under its 
jurisdiction. A complete inspection is an on-site review of a person's 
compliance with all permit conditions and requirements imposed under the 
State program, within the entire area disturbed or affected by the 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
    (c) The State regulatory authority shall conduct such inspections of 
coal explorations as are necessary to ensure compliance with the 
approved State program.
    (d)(1) Aerial inspections shall be conducted in a manner which 
reasonably ensures the identification and documentation of conditions at 
each surface coal mining and reclamation site inspected.

[[Page 372]]

    (2) Any potential violation observed during an aerial inspection 
shall be investigated on site within three days: provided, that any 
indication of a condition, practice or violation constituting cause for 
the issuance of a cessation order under section 521(a)(2) of the Act 
shall be investigated on site immediately, And provided further, That an 
on-site investigation of a potential violation observed during an aerial 
inspection shall not be considered to be an additional partial or 
complete inspection for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (e) The inspections required under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) 
of this section shall:
    (1) Be carried out on an irregular basis, so as to monitor 
compliance at all operations, including those which operate nights, 
weekends, or holidays;
    (2) Occur without prior notice to the permittee or any agent or 
employee of such permittee, except for necessary on-site meetings; and
    (3) Include the prompt filing of inspection reports adequate to 
enforce the requirements of the approved State program.
    (f) For the purposes of this section, an inactive surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation is one for which:
    (1) The State regulatory authority has secured from the permittee 
the written notice provided for under Sec. 816.131(b) or Sec. 
817.131(b) of this chapter; or
    (2) Reclamation Phase II as defined at Sec. 800.40 of this chapter 
has been completed and the liability of the permittee has been reduced 
by the State regulatory authority in accordance with the State program.
    (g) Abandoned site means a surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation for which the regulatory authority has found in writing that:
    (1) All surface and underground coal mining and reclamation 
activities at the site have ceased;
    (2) The regulatory authority or the Office has issued at least one 
notice of violation or the initial program equivalent, and either:
    (i) Is unable to serve the notice despite diligent efforts to do so; 
or
    (ii) The notice was served and has progressed to a failure-to-abate 
cessation order or the initial program equivalent;
    (3) The regulatory authority:
    (i) Is taking action to ensure that the permittee and operator, and 
owners and controllers of the permittee and operator, will be precluded 
from receiving future permits while violations continue at the site; and
    (ii) Is taking action pursuant to section 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) 
or 521(c) of the Act or their regulatory program counterparts to ensure 
that abatement occurs or that there will not be a recurrence of the 
failure-to-abate, except where after evaluating the circumstances it 
concludes that further enforcement offers little or no likelihood of 
successfully compelling abatement or recovering any reclamation costs; 
and
    (4) Where the site is, or was, permitted and bonded:
    (i) The permit has either expired or been revoked; and
    (ii) The regulatory authority has initiated and is diligently 
pursuing forfeiture of, or has forfeited, any available performance 
bond.
    (h) In lieu of the inspection frequency established in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section, the regulatory authority shall inspect each 
abandoned site on a set frequency commensurate with the public health 
and safety and environmental considerations present at each specific 
site, but in no case shall the inspection frequency be set at less than 
one complete inspection per calendar year.
    (1) In selecting an alternate inspection frequency authorized under 
the paragraph above, the regulatory authority shall first conduct a 
complete inspection of the abandoned site and provide public notice 
under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Following the inspection and 
public notice, the regulatory authority shall prepare and maintain for 
public review a written finding justifying the alternative inspection 
frequency selected. This written finding shall justify the new 
inspection frequency by affirmatively addressing in detail all of the 
following criteria:
    (i) How the site meets each of the criteria under the definition of 
an abandoned site under paragraph (g) of this

[[Page 373]]

section and thereby qualifies for a reduction in inspection frequency;
    (ii) Whether, and to what extent, there exist on the site 
impoundments, earthen structures or other conditions that pose, or may 
reasonably be expected to ripen into, imminent dangers to the health or 
safety of the public or significant environmental harms to land, air, or 
water resources;
    (iii) The extent to which existing impoundments or earthen 
structures were constructed and certified in accordance with prudent 
engineering designs approved in the permit;
    (iv) The degree to which erosion and sediment control is present and 
functioning;
    (v) The extent to which the site is located near or above urbanized 
areas, communities, occupied dwellings, schools and other public or 
commercial buildings and facilities;
    (vi) The extent of reclamation completed prior to abandonment and 
the degree of stability of unreclaimed areas, taking into consideration 
the physical characteristics of the land mined and the extent of 
settlement or revegetation that has occurred naturally with them; and
    (vii) Based on a review of the complete and partial inspection 
report record for the site during at least the last two consecutive 
years, the rate at which adverse environmental or public health and 
safety conditions have and can be expected to progressively deteriorate.
    (2) The public notice and opportunity to comment required under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall be provided as follows:
    (i) The regulatory authority shall place a notice in the newspaper 
with the broadest circulation in the locality of the abandoned site 
providing the public with a 30-day period in which to submit written 
comments.
    (ii) The public notice shall contain the permittee's name, the 
permit number, the precise location of the land affected, the inspection 
frequency proposed, the general reasons for reducing the inspection 
frequency, the bond status of the permit, the telephone number and 
address of the regulatory authority where written comments on the 
reduced inspection frequency may be submitted, and the closing date of 
the comment period.

Sec. 840.12  Right of entry.

    (a) Within its jurisdiction, the State regulatory authority shall 
have authority that grants its representatives a right of entry to, 
upon, and through any coal exploration or surface coal mining and 
reclamation operation without advance notice upon presentation of 
appropriate credentials. No search warrant shall be required, except 
that a State may provide for its use with respect to entry into a 
building.
    (b) The State regulatory authority shall have authority that 
authorizes its representatives to inspect any monitoring equipment or 
method of exploration or operation and to have access to and copy any 
records required under the approved State program. This authority shall 
provide that the representatives may exercise such rights at reasonable 
times, without advance notice, upon presentation of appropriate 
credentials. No search warrant shall be required, except that a State 
may provide for its use with respect to entry into a building.


<R05>
Sec. 840.13  Enforcement authority.

Sec. 842.1  Scope.

    This part sets forth general procedures governing Federal 
inspections under the permanent regulatory program.


<R05>
Sec. 842.11  Federal inspections and monitoring.

    (a) Authorized representatives of the Secretary shall conduct 
inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation operations as 
necessary--
    (1) To monitor and evaluate the administration of approved State 
programs. Such monitoring and evaluation inspections shall be conducted 
jointly with the State regulatory authority where practical and where 
the State so requests;
    (2) To develop or enforce Federal programs and Federal lands 
programs;
    (3) To enforce those requirements and permit conditions imposed 
under a State program not being enforced by a State, under section 
504(b) or section 521(b) of the Act, part 733 of this chapter, or as 
provided in this section; and
    (4) To determine whether any notice of violation or cessation order 
issued during an inspection authorized under this section has been 
complied with.
    (b)(1) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall 
immediately conduct a Federal inspection:
    (i) When the authorized representative has reason to believe on the 
basis of information available to him or her (other than information 
resulting from a previous Federal inspection) that there exists a 
violation of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, or any 
condition of a permit or an exploration approval, or that there exists 
any condition, practice, or violation which creates an imminent danger 
to the health or safety of the public or is causing or could reasonably 
be expected to cause a significant, imminent environmental harm to land, 
air or water resources and--
    (ii)(A) There is no State regulatory authority or the Office is 
enforcing the State program under section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act 
and part 733 of this chapter; or
    (B)(1) The authorized representative has notified the state 
regulatory authority of the possible violation and more than ten days 
have passed since notification and the State regulatory authority has 
failed to take appropriate action to cause the violation to be corrected 
or to show good cause for such failure and to inform the authorized 
representative of its response. After receiving a response from the 
State regulatory authority, before inspection, the authorized 
representative shall determine in writing whether the standards for 
appropriate action or good cause for such failure have been met. Failure 
by the State regulatory authority to respond within the ten days shall 
not prevent the authorized representative from making the determination, 
and will constitute a waiver of the state regulatory authority's right 
to request review under paragraph (b)(i)(iii) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this subchapter, an action or response by a 
State regulatory authority that is not arbitrary, capricious, or an 
abuse of discretion

[[Page 376]]

under the state program shall be considered ``appropriate action'' to 
cause a violation to be corrected or ``good cause'' for failure to do 
so.
    (3) Appropriate action includes enforcement or other action 
authorized under the State program to cause the violation to be 
corrected.
    (4) Good cause includes: (i) Under the State program, the possible 
violation does not exist; (ii) the State regulatory authority requires a 
reasonable and specified additional time to determine whether a 
violation of the State program does exist; (iii) the State regulatory 
authority lacks jurisdiction under the State program over the possible 
violation or operation; (iv) the State regulatory authority is precluded 
by an administrative or judicial order from an administrative body or 
court of competent jurisdiction from acting on the possible violation, 
where that order is based on the violation not existing or where the 
temporary relief standards of section 525(c) or 525(c) of the Act have 
been met; or (v) with regard to abandoned sites as defined in Sec. 
840.11(g) of this chapter, the State regulatory authority is diligently 
pursuing or has exhausted all appropriate enforcement provisions of the 
State program.
    (C) The person supplying the information supplies adequate proof 
that an imminent danger to the public health and safety or a 
significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources 
exists and that the State regulatory authority has failed to take 
appropriate action.
    (iii)(A) The authorized representative shall immediately notify the 
state regulatory authority in writing when in response to a ten-day 
notice the state regulatory authority fails to take appropriate action 
to cause a violation to be corrected or to show good cause for such 
failure. If the State regulatory authority disagrees with the authorized 
representative's written determination, it may file a request, in 
writing, for informal review of that written determination by the Deputy 
Director. Such a request for informal review may be submitted to the 
appropriate OSMRE field office or to the office of the Deputy Director 
in Washington, DC. The request must be received by OSMRE within 5 days 
from receipt of OSMRE's written determination.
    (B) Unless a cessation order is required under Sec. 843.11, or 
unless the state regulatory authority has failed to respond to the ten-
day notice, no Federal inspection action shall be taken or notice of 
violation issued regarding the ten-day notice until the time to request 
informal review as provided in Sec. 842.11(b)(1)(iii)(A) has expired 
or, if informal review has been requested, until the Deputy Director has 
completed such review.
    (C) After reviewing the written determination of the authorized 
representative and the request for informal review submitted by the 
State regulatory authority, the Deputy Director shall, within 15 days, 
render a decision on the request for informal review. He shall affirm, 
reverse, or modify the written determination of the authorized 
representative. Should the Deputy Director decide that the State 
regulatory authority did not take appropriate action or show good cause, 
he shall immediately order a Federal inspection or reinspection. The 
Deputy Director shall provide to the State regulatory authority and to 
the permittee a written explanation of his decision, and if the ten-day 
notice resulted from a request for a Federal inspection under Sec. 
842.12 of this part, he shall send written notification of his decision 
to the person who made the request.
    (2) An authorized representative shall have reason to believe that a 
violation, condition or practice exists if the facts alleged by the 
informant would, if true, constitute a condition, practice or violation 
referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (c) The Office, when acting as the regulatory authority under a 
Federal program or a Federal lands program and when enforcing a State 
program, in whole or in part, pursuant to section 504(b) of section 
521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter, shall conduct 
inspections of all coal exploration and surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations under its jurisdiction. The Office shall--
    (1) With respect to active surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations:
    (i) Conduct an average of at least one partial inspection per month 
of each

[[Page 377]]

active surface coal mining and reclamation operation. A partial 
inspection is an on-site or aerial review of a person's compliance with 
some of the permit requirements and conditions imposed under an 
applicable program.
    (A) Aerial inspections shall be conducted in a manner which 
reasonably ensures the identification and documentation of conditions at 
each surface coal mining and reclamation site inspected.
    (B) Any potential violation observed during an aerial inspection 
shall be investigated on site within three calendar days: Provided, That 
any indication of a condition, practice or violation constituting cause 
for issuance of a cessation order under section 521(a)(2) shall be 
investigated on site immediately, And provided further, That an on-site 
investigation of a potential violation observed during an aerial 
inspection shall not be considered to be an additional partial or 
complete inspection for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (ii) Conduct an average of at least one complete inspection per 
calendar quarter of each active surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation. A complete inspection is an on-site review of a person's 
compliance with all permit conditions and requirements imposed under the 
applicable program within the entire area disturbed or affected by 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
    (2) With respect to inactive surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations:
    (i) Conduct an average of at least one complete inspection per 
calendar quarter of each inactive surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation; and
    (ii) Conduct such partial inspections of each inactive surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation as are necessary to ensure effective 
enforcement of the regulatory program and the Act.
    (iii) For purposes of this section, an inactive surface coal mining 
and reclamation operation is one for which--
    (A) The Office has secured from the permittee the written notice 
provided for under Sec. Sec. 816.131(b) or 817.131(b) of this chapter; 
or,
    (B) Reclamation Phase II as defined at Sec. 800.40 of this chapter 
has been completed.
    (3) With respect to coal exploration operations, conduct such 
inspections as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Act by those 
coal explorations which substantially disturb the natural land surface.
    (d) The inspections required under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section shall:
    (1) Be carried out on an irregular basis, so as to monitor 
compliance at all operations, including those which operate nights, 
weekends, or holidays;
    (2) Occur without prior notice to the permittee or any agent or 
employee of such permittee, except for necessary on-site meetings; and
    (3) Include the prompt filing of inspection reports adequate to 
enforce the requirements of the applicable program.
    (e) Abandoned site means a surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation for which the Office has found in writing that:
    (1) All surface and underground coal mining and reclamation 
activities at the site have ceased;
    (2) The Office has issued at least one notice of violation or the 
initial program equivalent, and either:
    (i) Is unable to serve the notice despite diligent efforts to do so; 
or
    (ii) The notice was served and has progressed to a failure-to-abate 
cessation order or the initial program equivalent;
    (3) The Office:
    (i) Is taking action to ensure that the permittee and operator, and 
owners and controllers of the permittee and operator, will be precluded 
from receiving future permits while violations continue at the site; and
    (ii) Is taking action pursuant to sections 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) 
or 521(c) of the Act or their regulatory program counterparts to ensure 
that abatement occurs or that there will not be a recurrence of the 
failure-to-abate, except where after evaluating the circumstances it 
concludes that further enforcement offers little or no likelihood of 
successfully compelling abatement or recovering any reclamation costs; 
and

[[Page 378]]

    (4) Where the site is, or was, permitted or bonded:
    (i) The permit has either expired or been revoked; and
    (ii) The Office has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture 
of, or has forfeited, any available performance bond.
    (f) In lieu of the inspection frequency established in paragraph (c) 
of this section, the office shall inspect each abandoned site on a set 
frequency commensurate with the public health and safety and 
environmental considerations present at each specific site, but in no 
case shall the inspection frequency be set at less than one complete 
inspection per calendar-year.
    (1) In selecting an alternate inspection frequency authorized under 
the paragraph above, the office shall first conduct a complete 
inspection of the abandoned site and provide public notice under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Following the inspection and public 
notice, the office shall prepare and maintain for public review a 
written finding justifying the alternative inspection frequency 
selected. This written finding shall justify the new inspection 
frequency by affirmatively addressing in detail all of the following 
criteria:
    (i) How the site meets each of the criteria under the definition of 
an abandoned site under paragraph (e) of this section and thereby 
qualifies for a reduction inspection frequency;
    (ii) Whether, and to what extent, there exist on the site 
impoundments, earthen structures or other conditions that pose, or may 
reasonably be expected to ripen into, imminent dangers to the health or 
safety of the public or significant environmental harms to land, air or 
water resources;
    (iii) The extent to which existing impoundments or earthen 
structures were constructed and certified in accordance with prudent 
engineering designs approved in the permit;
    (iv) The degree to which erosion and sediment control is present and 
functioning;
    (v) The extent to which the site is located near or above urbanized 
areas, communities, occupied dwellings, schools and other public or 
commercial buildings and facilities;
    (vi) The extent of reclamation completed prior to abandonment and 
the degree of stability of unreclaimed areas, taking into consideration 
the physical characteristics of the land mined and the extent of 
settlement or revegetation that has occurred naturally with time; and
    (vii) Based on a review of the complete and partial inspection 
report record for the site during at least the last two consecutive 
years, the rate at which adverse environmental or public health and 
safety conditions have and can be expected to progressively deteriorate.
    (2) The public notice and opportunity to comment required under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be provided as follows:
    (i) The office shall place a notice in the newspaper with the 
broadest circulation in the locality of the abandoned site providing the 
public with a 30-day period in which to submit written comments.
    (ii) The public notice shall contain the permittee's name, the 
permit number, the precise location of the land affected, the inspection 
frequency proposed, the general reasons for reducing the inspection 
frequency, the bond status of the permit, the telephone number and 
address of the office where written comments on the reduced inspection 
frequency may be submitted, and the closing date of the comment period.

disclosure is required under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
552) or other Federal law.
    (c) If a Federal inspection is conducted as a result of information 
provided to the Office by a person as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, the person shall be notified as far in advance as practicable 
when the inspection is to occur and shall be allowed to accompany the 
authorized representative of the Secretary during the inspection. Such 
person has a right of entry to, upon and through the coal exploration or 
surface coal mining and reclamation operation about which he or she 
supplied information, but only if he or she is in the presence of and is 
under the control, direction and supervision of the authorized 
representative while on the mine property. Such right of entry does not 
include a right to enter buildings without consent of the person in 
control of the building or without a search warrant.
    (d) Within ten days of the Federal inspection or, if there is no 
Federal inspection, within 15 days of receipt of the person's written 
statement, the Office shall send the person the following.
    (1) If a Federal inspection was made, a description of the 
enforcement action taken, which may consist of copies of the Federal 
inspection report and all notices of violation and cessation orders 
issued as a result of the inspection, or an explanation of why no 
enforcement action was taken;
    (2) If no Federal inspection was conducted, an explanation of the 
reason why; and
    (3) An explanation of the person's right, if any, to informal review 
of the action or inaction of the Office under Sec. 842.15.
    (e) The Office shall give copies of all materials in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section within the time limits specified in 
those paragraphs to the person alleged to be in violation, except that 
the name of the person supplying information shall be removed unless 
disclosure of his or her identity is permitted under paragraph (b) of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 842.13  Right of entry.

    (a) Each authorized representative of the Secretary conducting a 
Federal inspection under Sec. 842.11:
    (1) Shall have a right of entry to, upon, and through any coal 
exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation without 
advance notice or a search warrant, upon presentation of appropriate 
credentials;
    (2) May, at reasonable times and without delay, have access to and 
copy any records, and inspect any monitoring equipment or method of 
exploration or operation required under the applicable program; and,
    (3) Shall have a right to gather physical and photographic evidence 
to document conditions, practices or violations at the site.
    (b) No search warrant shall be required with respect to any activity 
under paragraph (a) of this section, except that a search warrant may be 
required for entry into a building.


<R05>
Sec. 842.14  Review of adequacy and completeness of inspections.

    Any person who is or may be adversely affected by a surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation or a coal exploration operation may 
notify the Director or his or her designee in writing of any alleged 
failure on the part of the Office to make adequate and complete or 
periodic Federal inspections. The notification shall include sufficient 
information to create a reasonable belief that the regulations of this 
part are not being complied with and to demonstrate that the person is 
or may be adversely affected. The Director or his or her designee shall 
within 15 days of receipt of the notification determine whether adequate 
and complete or periodic inspections have been made. The Director or his 
or her designee shall furnish the complainant

[[Page 380]]

with a written statement of the reasons for such determination and the 
actions, if any, taken to remedy the noncompliance.


<R05>
Sec. 842.15  Review of decision not to inspect or enforce.

    (a) Any person who is or may be adversely affected by a coal 
exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation may ask the 
Director or his or her designee to review informally an authorized 
representative's decision not to inspect or take appropriate enforcement 
action with respect to any violation alleged by that person in a request 
for Federal inspection under Sec. 842.12. The request for review shall 
be in writing and include a statement of how the person is or may be 
adversely affected and why the decision merits review.
    (b) The Director or his or her designee shall conduct the review and 
inform the person, in writing, of the results of the review within 30 
days of his or her receipt of the request. The person alleged to be in 
violation shall also be given a copy of the results of the review, 
except that the name of the person who is or may be adversely affected 
shall not be disclosed unless confidentiality has been waived or 
disclosure is required under the Freedom of Information Act or other 
Federal law.
    (c) Informal review under this section shall not affect any right to 
formal review under section 525 of the Act or to a citizen's suit under 
section 520 of the Act.
    (d) Any determination made under paragraph (b) of this section shall 
constitute a decision of OSM within the meaning of 43 CFR 4.1281 and 
shall contain a right of appeal to the Office of Hearings and Appeals in 
accordance with 43 CFR part 4.


<R05>
Sec. 842.16  Availability of records.

    (a) Copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, or 
information obtained by the Office under Title V of the Act, this 
chapter, a Federal program or Federal lands program, and a State program 
being enforced by the Office under section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act 
and part 733 of this chapter or Sec. Sec. 842.11 or 842.12 shall be 
made immediately available to the public in the area of mining until at 
least five years after expiration of the period during which the subject 
operation is active or is covered by any portion of a reclamation bond 
so that they are conveniently available to residents of that area, 
except--
    (1) As otherwise provided by Federal law; and
    (2) For information not required to be made available under Sec. 
772.15, Sec. 773.6(d), or Sec. 840.14(d) of this chapter.
    (b) The Office shall ensure compliance with paragraph (a) of this 
section by either:
    (1) Making copies of all such records, reports, inspection 
materials, and other information available for public inspection at a 
Federal, State or local government office in the county where the mining 
is occurring or is proposed to occur; or
    (2) At the Office's option and expense, providing copies of such 
information promptly by mail at the request of any resident of the area 
where the mining is occurring or is proposed to occur, provided that the 
Office shall maintain for public inspection at a Federal, State, or 
local government office in the county where the mining is occurring or 
is proposed to occur a description of the information available for 
mailing and the procedure for obtaining such information.
    (c) Copies of documents and information required to be made

Sec. 843.1  Scope.

    This part sets forth general rules regarding enforcement by the 
Office of the Act, this chapter, any Federal program, the Federal lands 
program, State programs being enforced by the Office in whole or in part 
under section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter 
and (in limited circumstances) under Sec. 842.11 or Sec. 842.12 of 
this chapter, and all conditions of permits and coal exploration 
approvals or permits imposed under any of these programs, the Act, or 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 843.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following terms have the specified 
meanings:
    Unwarranted failure to comply means the failure of a permittee to 
prevent the occurrence of any violation of his or her permit or any 
requirement of the Act due to indifference, lack of diligence, or lack 
of reasonable care, or the failure to abate any violation of such permit 
of the Act due to indifference, lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable 
care.

[47 FR 35637, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 65 FR 79670, Dec. 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 843.11  Cessation orders.

    (a)(1) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall 
immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations or of the relevant portion thereof, if he or she finds, on 
the basis of any Federal inspection, any condition or practice, or any 
violation of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or any 
condition of an exploration approval or permit imposed under any such 
program, the Act, or this chapter which:
    (i) Creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the 
public; or
    (ii) Is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, 
imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.
    (2) Surface coal mining operations conducted by any person without a 
valid surface coal mining permit constitute a condition or practice 
which causes or can reasonably be expected to cause significant imminent 
environmental harm to land, air, or water resources unless such 
operations:
    (i) Are an integral, uninterrupted extension of previously permitted 
operations, and the person conducting such operations has filed a timely 
and complete application for a permit to conduct such operations; or
    (ii) Were conducted lawfully without a permit under the interim 
regulatory program because no permit has been required for such 
operations by the State in which the operations were conducted.
    (3) If the cessation ordered under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
will not completely abate the imminent danger or harm in the most 
expeditious manner physically possible, the authorized representative of 
the Secretary shall impose affirmative obligations on the permittee to 
abate the imminent danger or significant environmental harm. The order 
shall specify the time by which abatement shall be accomplished.
    (b)(1) When a notice of violation has been issued under Sec. 
843.12(a) and the permittee fails to abate the violation within the 
abatement period fixed or subsequently extended by the authorized 
representative, the authorized representative of the Secretary shall 
immediately order a cessation of coal exploration or surface coal mining 
and reclamation operations, or of the portion relevant to the violation.
    (2) A cessation order issued under this paragraph (b) shall require 
the permittee to take all steps the authorized representative of the 
Secretary deems necessary to abate the violations covered by the order 
in the most expeditious manner physically possible.
    (c) A cessation order issued under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this 
section shall be in writing, signed by the authorized representative who 
issues it, and shall set forth with reasonable

[[Page 382]]

specificity: (1) The nature of the condition, practice or violation; (2) 
the remedial action or affirmative obligation required, if any, 
including interim steps, if appropriate; (3) the time established for 
abatement, if appropriate; and (4) a reasonable description of the 
portion of the coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation to which it applies. The order shall remain in effect until 
the condition, practice or violation resulting in the issuance of the 
cessation order has been abated or until vacated, modified or terminated 
in writing by an authorized representative of the Secretary, or until 
the order expires pursuant to section 521(a)(5) of the Act and Sec. 
843.15.
    (d) Reclamation operations and other activities intended to protect 
public health and safety and the environment shall continue during the 
period of any order unless otherwise provided in the order.
    (e) An authorized representative of the Secretary may modify, 
terminate or vacate a cessation order for good cause, and may extend the 
time for abatement if the failure to abate within the time previously 
set was not caused by lack of diligence on the part of the permittee.
    (f) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a 
cessation order by written notice to the permittee when he or she 
determines that all conditions, practices or violations listed in the 
order have been abated. Termination shall not affect the right of the 
Office to assess civil penalties for those violations under part 845 of 
this chapter.
    (g) Within 60 days after issuing a cessation order, OSM will notify 
in writing the permittee, the operator, and any person who has been 
listed or identified by the applicant, permittee, or OSM as an owner or 
controller of the operation, as defined in Sec. 701.5 of this chapter.

19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 843.12  Notices of violation.

    (a)(1) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall issue a 
notice of violation if, on the basis of a Federal inspection carried out 
during the enforcement of a Federal program or Federal lands program or 
during Federal enforcement of a State program under section 504(b) or 
521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter, he finds a violation of 
the Act, this chapter, the applicable program or any condition of a 
permit or an exploration approval imposed under such program, the Act, 
or this Chapter, which does not create an imminent danger or harm for 
which a cessation order must be issued under Sec. 843.11.
    (2) When, on the basis of any Federal inspection other than one 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an authorized 
representative of the Secretary determines that there exists a violation 
of the Act, the State program, or any condition of a permit or 
exploration approval required by the Act which does not create an 
imminent danger or harm for which a cessation order must be issued under 
Sec. 843.11, the authorized representative shall give a written report 
of the violation to the State and to the permittee so that appropriate 
action can be taken by the State. Where the State fails within ten days 
after notification to take appropriate action to cause the violation to 
be corrected, or to show good cause for such failure, subject to the 
procedures of Sec. 842.11(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, the authorized 
representative shall reinspect and, if the violation continues to exist, 
shall issue a notice of violation or cessation order, as appropriate. No 
additional notification to the State by the Office is required before 
the issuance of a notice of violation if previous notification was given 
under Sec. 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(B) of this chapter.
    (b) A notice of violation issued under this section shall be in 
writing signed by the authorized representative who issues it, and shall 
set forth with reasonable specificity:
    (1) The nature of the violation;
    (2) The remedial action required, which may include interim steps;
    (3) A reasonable time for abatement, which may include time for 
accomplishment of interim steps; and
    (4) A reasonable description of the portion of the coal exploration 
or surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which it applies.

[[Page 383]]

    (c) An authorized representative of the Secretary may extend the 
time set for abatement or for accomplishment of an interim step, if the 
failure to meet the time previously set was not caused by lack of 
diligence on the part of the permittee. The total time for abatement 
under a notice of violation, including all extensions, shall not exceed 
90 days from the date of issuance, except upon a showing by the 
permittee that it is not feasible to abate the violation within 90 
calendar days due to one or more of the circumstances in paragraph (f) 
of this section. An extended abatement date pursuant to this section 
shall not be granted when the permittee's failure to abate within 90 
days has been caused by a lack of diligence or intentional delay by the 
permittee in completing the remedial action required.
    (d)(1) If the permittee fails to meet the time set for abatement the 
authorized representative shall issue a cessation order under Sec. 
843.11(b).
    (2) If the permittee fails to meet the time set for accomplishment 
of any interim step the authorized representative may issue a cessation 
order under Sec. 843.11(b).
    (e) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a 
notice of violation by written notice to the permittee when he 
determines that all violations listed in the notice of violation have 
been abated. Termination shall not affect the right of the Office to 
assess civil penalties for those violations under 30 CFR part 845.
    (f) Circumstances which may qualify a surface coal mining operation 
for an abatement period of more than 90 days are:
    (1) Where the permittee of an ongoing permitted operation has timely 
applied for and diligently pursued a permit renewal or other necessary 
approval of designs or plans but such permit or approval has not been or 
will not be issued within 90 days after a valid permit expires or is 
required, for reasons not within the control of the permittee;
    (2) Where there is a valid judicial order precluding abatement 
within 90 days as to which the permittee has diligently pursued all 
rights of appeal and as to which he or she has no other effective legal 
remedy;
    (3) Where the permittee cannot abate within 90 days due to a labor 
strike;
    (4) Where climatic conditions preclude abatement within 90 days, or 
where, due to climatic conditions, abatement within 90 days clearly 
would cause more environmental harm than it would prevent; or
    (5) Where abatement within 90 days requires action that would 
violate safety standards established by statute or regulation under the 
Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
    (g) Whenever an abatement time in excess of 90 days is permitted, 
interim abatement measures shall be imposed to the extent necessary to 
minimize harm to the public or the environment.
    (h) If any of the conditions in paragraph (f) of this section 
exists, the permittee may request the authorized representative to grant 
an abatement period exceeding 90 days. The authorized representative 
shall not grant such an abatement period without the concurrence of the 
Director or his or her designee and the abatement period granted shall 
not exceed the shortest possible time necessary to abate the violation. 
The permittee shall have the burden of establishing by clear and 
convincing proof that he or she is entitled to an extension under the 
provisions of Sec. 843.12(c) and (f). In determining whether or not to 
grant an abatement period exceeding 90 days the authorized 
representative may consider any relevant written or oral information 
from the permittee or any other source. The authorized representative 
shall promptly and fully document in the file his or her reasons for 
granting or denying the request. The authorized representative's 
immediate supervisor shall review this document before concurring in or 
disapproving the extended abatement date and shall promptly and fully 
document the reasons for his or her concurrence or disapproval in the 
file.
    (i) Any determination made under paragraph (h) of this section shall 
contain a right of appeal to the Office of Hearings and Appeals in 
accordance with 43 CFR 4.1281 and the regulations at 43 CFR part 4.

[[Page 384]]

    (j) No extension granted under paragraph (h) of this section may 
exceed 90 days in length. Where the condition or circumstance which 
prevented abatement within 90 days exists at the expiration of any such 
extension, the permittee may request a further extension in accordance 
with the procedures of paragraph (h) of this section.

Sec. 843.13  Suspension or revocation of permits: Pattern of violations.

    (a)(1) The Director shall issue an order to a permittee requiring 
him or her to show cause why his or her permit and right to mine under 
the Act should not be suspended or revoked, if the Director determines 
that a pattern of violations of any requirements of the Act, this 
chapter, the applicable program, or any permit condition required by the 
Act exists or has existed, and that the violations were caused by the 
permittee willfully or through unwarranted failure to comply with those 
requirements or conditions. Violations by any person conducting surface 
coal mining operations on behalf of the permittee shall be attributed to 
the permittee, unless the permittee establishes that they were acts of 
deliberate sabotage. The Director shall promptly file a copy of any 
order to show cause with the Office of Hearings and Appeals and the 
State regulatory authority, if any.
    (2) The Director may determine that a pattern of violations exists 
or has existed, based upon two or more Federal inspections of the permit 
area within any 12-month period, after considering the circumstances, 
including:
    (i) The number of violations, cited on more than one occasion, of 
the same or related requirements of the Act, this chapter, the 
applicable program, or the permit;
    (ii) The number of violations, cited on more than one occasion, of 
different requirements of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, 
or the permit; and
    (iii) The extent to which the violations were isolated departures 
from lawful conduct.
    (3) The Director shall promptly review the history of violations of 
any permittee who has been cited for violations of the same or related 
requirements of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, or the 
permit during three or more Federal inspections of the permit area 
within any 12-month period. If, after such review, the Director 
determines that a pattern of violations exists or has existed, he or she 
shall issue an order to show cause as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section.
    (4)(i) In determining the number of violations within any 12-month 
period, the Director shall consider only violations issued as a result 
of a Federal inspection carried out--
    (A) During enforcement of a Federal program or a Federal lands 
program;
    (B) During the interim program and before the applicable State 
program was approved pursuant to section 502 or 504 of the Act; or
    (C) During Federal enforcement of a State program in accordance with 
section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act.
    (ii) The Director may not consider violations issued as a result of 
inspections other than those mentioned in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section in determining whether to exercise his or her discretion under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except as evidence of the willful or 
unwarranted nature of the permittee's failure to comply.
    (b) If the permittee files an answer to the show cause order and 
requests a hearing under 43 CFR part 4, a public hearing shall be 
provided as set forth in that part. The Office of Hearings and Appeals 
shall give thirty days written notice of the date, time and place of the 
hearing to the Director, the permittee, the State regulatory authority, 
if any, and any intervenor. Upon receipt of the notice, the Director 
shall publish it, if practicable, in a newspaper of general circulation 
in the area of the surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and 
shall post it at the State or field office closest to those operations.
    (c) Within sixty days after the hearing, and within the time limits 
set forth in 43 CFR part 4, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall 
issue a written determination as to whether a pattern of violations 
exists and, if appropriate, an order. If the Office of

[[Page 385]]

Hearings and Appeals revokes or suspends the permit and the permittee's 
right to mine under the Act, the permittee shall immediately cease 
surface coal mining operations on the permit area and shall:
    (1) If the permit and the right to mine under the Act are revoked, 
complete reclamation within the time specified in the order; or
    (2) If the permit and the right to mine under the Act are suspended, 
complete all affirmative obligations to abate all conditions, practices, 
or violations as specified in the order.
    (d) Whenever a permittee fails to abate a violation contained in a 
notice of violation or cessation order within the abatement period set 
in the notice or order or as subsequently extended, the Director shall 
review the permittee's history of violations to determine whether a 
pattern of violations exists pursuant to this section, and shall issue 
an order to show cause as appropriate pursuant to Sec. 845.15(b)(2) of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 843.14  Service of notices of violation, cessation orders, and 
show cause orders.

    (a) A notice of violation, cessation order, or show cause order 
shall be served on the person to whom it is directed or his or her 
designated agent promptly after issuance, as follows:
    (1) By tendering a copy at the coal exploration or surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation to the designated agent or to the 
individual who, based upon reasonable inquiry, appears to be in charge. 
If no such individual can be located at the site, a copy may be tendered 
to any individual at the site who appears to be an employee or agent of 
the person to whom the notice or order is issued. Service shall be 
complete upon tender of the notice or order and shall not be deemed 
incomplete because of refusal to accept.
    (2) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, service 
may be made by sending a copy of the notice or order by certified mail 
or by hand to the permittee or his or her designated agent, or by any 
means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and 
complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service 
shall be complete upon tender of the notice or order or of the certified 
mail and shall not be deemed incomplete because of refusal to accept.
    (b) Designation by any person of an agent for service of notices and 
orders shall be made in writing to the appropriate State or field office 
of the Office.
    (c) The Office shall furnish copies of notices and orders to the 
State regulatory authority, if any, promptly after their issuance. The 
Office may furnish copies to any person having an interest in the coal 
exploration, surface coal mining and reclamation operation, or the 
permit area.

<R05>
Sec. 843.15  Informal public hearing.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a 
notice of violation or cessation order which requires cessation of 
mining, expressly or by necessary implication, shall expire within 30 
days after it is served unless an informal public hearing has been held 
within that time. The hearing shall be held at or reasonably close to 
the mine site so that it may be viewed during the hearing or at any 
other location acceptable to the Office and the person to whom the 
notice or order was issued. The Office of Surface Mining office nearest 
to the mine site shall be deemed to be reasonably close to the mine site 
unless a closer location is requested and agreed to by the Office. 
Expiration of a notice or order shall not affect the Office's right to 
assess civil penalties with respect to the period during which the 
notice or order was in effect. No hearing will be required where the 
condition, practice, or violation in question has been abated or the 
hearing has been waived. For purposes of this section only, ``mining'' 
includes (1) extracting coal from the earth or from coal waste piles and 
transporting it within or from the permit area, and (2) the processing, 
cleaning, concentrating, preparing or loading of coal where such 
operations occur at a place other than at a mine site.
    (b) A notice of violation or cessation order shall not expire as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section if the informal public hearing 
has been waived, or if, with the consent of the person to

[[Page 386]]

whom the notice or order was issued, the informal public hearing is held 
later than 30 days after the notice or order was served. For purposes of 
this subsection:
    (1) The informal public hearing will be deemed waived if the person 
to whom the notice or order was issued:
    (i) Is informed, by written notice served in the manner provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that he or she will be deemed to have 
waived an informal public hearing unless he or she requests one within 
30 days after service of the notice; and
    (ii) Fails to request an informal public hearing within that time.
    (2) The written notice referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall be delivered to such person by an authorized 
representative or sent by certified mail to such person no later than 5 
days after the notice or order is served on such person.
    (3) The person to whom the notice or order is issued shall be deemed 
to have consented to an extension of the time for holding the informal 
public hearing if his or her request is received on or after the 21st 
day after service of the notice or order. The extension of time shall be 
equal to the number of days elapsed after the 21st day.
    (c) The Office shall give as much advance notice as is practicable 
of the time, place, and subject matter of the informal public hearing 
to:
    (1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
    (2) Any person who filed a report which led to that notice or order; 
and
    (3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
    (d) The Office shall also post notice of the hearing at the State or 
field office closest to the mine site and, where practicable, publish it 
in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the mine.
    (e) Section 554 of Title 5 of the United States Code, regarding 
requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings, shall not govern informal 
public hearings. An informal public hearing shall be conducted by a 
representative of the Office, who may accept oral or written arguments 
and any other relevant information from any person attending.
    (f) Within five days after the close of the informal public hearing, 
the Office shall affirm, modify, or vacate the notice or order in 
writing. The decision shall be sent to--
    (1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
    (2) Any person who filed a report which led to the notice or order; 
and
    (3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
    (g) The granting or waiver of an informal public hearing shall not 
affect the right of any person to formal review under section 518(b), 
521(a)(4), or 525 of the Act.
    (h) The person conducting the hearing for the Office shall determine 
whether or not the mine site should be viewed during the hearing. In 
making this determination the only consideration shall be whether a view 
of the mine site will assist the person conducting the hearing in 
reviewing the appropriateness of the enforcement action or of the 
required remedial action.


<R05>
Sec. 843.16  Formal review of citations.

    (a) A person issued a notice of violation or cessation order under 
Sec. 843.11 or Sec. 843.12, or a person having an interest which is or 
may be adversely affected by the issuance, modification, vacation or 
termination of a notice or order, may request review of that action by 
filing an application for review and request for hearing under 43 CFR 
part 4, within 30 days after receiving notice of the action.
    (b) The filing of an application for review and request for a 
hearing under this Section shall not operate as a stay of any notice or 
order, or of any modification, termination or vacation of either.


<R05>
Sec. 843.17  Failure to give notice and lack of information.

    No notice of violation, cessation order, show cause order, or order 
revoking or suspending a permit may be vacated for failure to give the 
notice to the State regulatory authority required under Sec. 
842.11(b)(1)(ii)(B) of this chapter or because it is subsequently 
determined that the Office did not have information sufficient, under 
Sec. Sec. 842.11(b)(1) and 842.11(b)(2) of this chapter, to justify an 
inspection.

[[Page 387]]


<R05>
Sec. 843.18  Inability to comply.

    (a) No cessation order or notice of violation issued under this part 
may be vacated because of inability to comply.
    (b) Inability to comply may not be considered in determining whether 
a pattern of violations exists.
    (c) Unless caused by lack of diligence, inability to comply may be 
considered only in mitigation of the amount of civil penalty under part 
845 of this chapter and of the duration of the suspension of a permit 
under Sec. 843.13(c).


<R05>
Sec. 843.20  Compliance conference.

    (a) A permittee may request an on-site compliance conference with an 
authorized representative to review the compliance status of any 
condition or practice proposed at any coal exploration or surface coal 
mining and reclamation operation. Any such conference shall not 
constitute an inspection within the meaning of section 517 of the Act 
and Sec. 842.11.
    (b) The Office may accept or refuse any request to conduct a 
compliance conference under paragraph (a). Where the Office accepts such 
a request, reasonable notice of the scheduled date and time of the 
compliance conference shall be given to the permittee.
    (c) The authorized representative at any compliance conference shall 
review such proposed conditions and practices as the permittee may 
request in order to determine whether any such condition or practice may 
become a violation of any requirement of the Act of any applicable 
permit or exploration approval.
    (d) Neither the holding of a compliance conference under this 
section nor any opinion given by the authorized representative at such a 
conference shall affect:
    (1) Any rights or obligations of the Office or of the permittee with 
respect to any inspection, notice of violation or cessation order, 
whether prior or subsequent to such conference; or
    (2) The validity of any notice of violation or cessation order 
issued with respect to any condition or practice reviewed at the 
compliance conference.


<R05>
Sec. 843.21  Procedures for improvidently issued State permits.

    (a) Initial notice. If we, OSM, on the basis of any information 
available to us, including information submitted by any person, have 
reason to believe that a State-issued permit meets the criteria for an 
improvidently issued permit under Sec. 773.21 of this chapter, or the 
State regulatory program equivalent, and the State has failed to take 
appropriate action on the permit under the State regulatory program 
equivalents of Sec. Sec. 773.21 through 773.23 of this chapter, we 
must--
    (1) Issue a notice, by certified mail, to the State, to you, the 
permittee, and to any person providing information under paragraph (a) 
of this section. The notice will state in writing the reasons for our 
belief that your permit was improvidently issued. The notice also will 
request the State to take appropriate action, as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section, within 10 days.
    (2) Post the notice at our office closest to the permit area and on 
the AVS Office Internet home page (Internet address: http://
www.avs.osmre.gov).
    (b) State response. Within 10 days after receiving notice under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the State must demonstrate to us in 
writing that either--
    (1) The permit does not meet the criteria of Sec. 773.21 of this 
chapter or the State regulatory program equivalent;
    (2) The State is in compliance with the State regulatory program 
equivalents of Sec. Sec. 773.21 through 773.23 of this chapter; or
    (3) The State has good cause for not complying with the State 
regulatory program equivalents of Sec. Sec. 773.21 through 773.23 of 
this chapter. For purposes of this section, good cause has the same 
meaning as in Sec. 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(B)(4) of this chapter, except that 
good cause does not include the lack of State program equivalents of 
Sec. Sec. 773.21 through 773.23 of this chapter.
    (c) Notice of Federal inspection. If we find that the State has 
failed to make the demonstration required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, we must initiate a Federal inspection under paragraph (d) of 
this section to determine if your permit was improvidently issued under 
the criteria in Sec. 773.21 of this

[[Page 388]]

chapter or the State regulatory program equivalent. We must also--
    (1) Issue a notice to you and the State by certified mail. The 
notice will state in writing the reasons for our finding under this 
section and our intention to initiate a Federal inspection.
    (2) Post the notice at our office closest to the permit area and on 
the AVS Office Internet home page (Internet address: http://
www.avs.osmre.gov).
    (3) Notify any person who provides information under paragraph (a) 
of this section that leads to a Federal inspection that he or she may 
accompany the inspector on any inspection of the minesite.
    (d) Federal inspection and written finding. No less than 10 days but 
no more than 30 days after providing notice under paragraph (c) of this 
section, we will conduct an inspection and make a written finding as to 
whether your permit was improvidently issued under the criteria in Sec. 
773.21 of this chapter. In making that finding, we will consider all 
available information, including information submitted by you, the 
State, or any other person. We will post that finding at our office 
closest to the permit area and on the AVS Office Internet home page 
(Internet address: http://www.avs.osmre.gov). If we find that your 
permit was improvidently issued, we must issue a notice to you and the 
State by certified mail. The notice will state in writing the reasons 
for our finding under this section.
    (e) Federal enforcement. If we find that your permit was 
improvidently issued under paragraph (d) of this section, we must--
    (1) Issue a notice of violation to you or your agent consistent with 
Sec. 843.12(b) of this part and provide opportunity for a public 
hearing under Sec. Sec. 843.15 and 843.16.
    (2) Issue a cessation order to you or your agent consistent with 
Sec. 843.11(c), if a notice of violation issued under paragraph (e)(1) 
is not remedied under paragraph (f) of this section within the abatement 
period, and provide opportunity for a public hearing under Sec. Sec. 
843.15 and 843.16.
    (f) Remedies to notice of violation or cessation order. Upon receipt 
of information from any person concerning a notice of violation or 
cessation order issued under paragraph (e) of this section, we will 
review the information and--
    (1) Vacate the notice or order if it resulted from an erroneous 
conclusion under this section; or
    (2) Terminate the notice or order if--
    (i) The violation has been abated or corrected to the satisfaction 
of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation;
    (ii) You or your operator no longer own or control the relevant 
operation;
    (iii) The violation is the subject of a good faith administrative or 
judicial appeal (unless there is an initial judicial decision affirming 
the violation, and that decision remains in force);
    (iv) The violation is the subject of an abatement plan or payment 
schedule that is being met to the satisfaction of the agency with 
jurisdiction over the violation; or
    (v) You are pursuing a good faith challenge or administrative or 
judicial appeal of the relevant ownership or control listing or finding 
(unless there is an initial judicial decision affirming the listing or 
finding, and that decision remains in force).
    (g) No civil penalty. We will not assess a civil penalty for a 
notice of violation issued under this section.

Sec. 843.22  Enforcement actions at abandoned sites.

    The Office may refrain from issuing a notice of violation or 
cessation order for a violation at an abandoned site, as defined in 
Sec. 842.11(e) of this chapter, if abatement of the violation is 
required under any previously issued notice or order.

Sec. 843.25  Energy Policy Act enforcement in States with approved 
State programs.

    (a) State-by-State determinations. By July 31, 1995, OSM will 
determine for each State with an approved State regulatory program 
whether:
    (1) Direct Federal enforcement of the Energy Policy Act and 
implementing Federal regulations will occur under

[[Page 389]]

paragraph (b) of this section with respect to some or all surface coal 
mining operations in each State, or
    (2) The procedures of Sec. Sec. 843.11 and 843.12(a)(2) will apply 
to State enforcement of the Energy Policy Act, or
    (3) A combination of direct Federal enforcement and State 
enforcement will occur.
    (4) Before making this determination, OSM will consult with each 
affected State and provide an opportunity for public comment. OSM will 
publish its determination in the Federal Register.
    (b) Interim Federal enforcement. (1) If OSM determines under 
paragraph (a) that direct Federal enforcement is necessary, Sec. Sec. 
817.41(j), 817.121(c)(2), and 817.121(c)(4) of this chapter will apply 
to each underground mining operation subject to that determination that 
is conducted in a State with an approved State regulatory program.
    (2) If OSM determines under paragraph (a) of this section that 
direct Federal enforcement is necessary, the provisions of Sec. 
843.12(a)(2) will not apply to direct Federal enforcement actions under 
this paragraph (b). When, on the basis of any Federal inspection under 
this paragraph, an authorized representative determines that a violation 
of Sec. 817.41(j) or Sec. 817.121(c)(2) exists, the authorized 
representative must issue a notice of violation or cessation order, as 
appropriate.
    (3) This paragraph (b) will remain effective in a State with an 
approved State regulatory program until the State adopts, and OSM 
approves, under Part 732 of this chapter, provisions consistent with 
Sec. Sec. 817.41(j) and 817.121(c)(2) of this chapter. After these 
provisions are approved, this paragraph will remain effective only for 
violations of Sec. Sec. 817.41(j) and 817.121(c)(2) that are not 
regulated by the State regulatory authority.

Sec. 845.1  Scope.

    This part covers the assessment of civil penalties under section 518 
of the Act with respect to cessation orders and notices of violation 
issued under part 843 (Federal Enforcement), except for the assessment 
of individual civil penalties under section 518(f), which is covered in 
part 846.

[53 FR 3675, Feb. 8, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 845.2  Objective.

    Civil penalties are assessed under section 518 of the Act and this 
part to deter violations and to ensure maximum compliance with the terms 
and purposes of the Act on the part of the coal mining industry.


<R05>
Sec. 845.11  How assessments are made.

    The Office shall review each notice of violation and cessation order 
in accordance with the assessment procedures described in 30 CFR 845.12, 
845.13, 845.14, 845.15, and 845.16 to determine whether a civil penalty 
will be assessed, the amount of the penalty, and whether each day of a 
continuing violation will be deemed a separate violation for purposes of 
the total penalty assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 845.12  When penalty will be assessed.

    (a) The Office shall assess a penalty for each cessation order.
    (b) The Office shall assess a penalty for each notice of violation, 
if the violation is assigned 31 points or more under the point system 
described in 30 CFR 845.13.
    (c) The Office may assess a penalty for each notice of violation 
assigned 30

[[Page 390]]

points or less under the point system described in 30 CFR 845.13. In 
determining whether to assess a penalty, the Office shall consider the 
factors listed in 30 CFR 845.13(b).


<R05>
Sec. 845.13  Point system for penalties.

    (a) The Office shall use the point system described in this section 
to determine the amount of the penalty and, in the case of notices of 
violation, whether a mandatory penalty should be assessed as provided in 
30 CFR 845.12(b).
    (b) Points shall be assigned as follows:
    (1) History of previous violations. The Office shall assign up to 30 
points based on the history of previous violations. One point shall be 
assigned for each past violation contained in a notice of violation. 
Five points shall be assigned for each violation (but not a condition or 
practice) contained in a cessation order. The history of previous 
violations, for the purpose of assigning points, shall be determined and 
the points assigned with respect to a particular coal exploration or 
surface coal mining operation. Points shall be assigned as follows:
    (i) A violation shall not be counted, if the notice or order is the 
subject of pending administrative or judicial review or if the time to 
request such review or to appeal any administrative or judicial decision 
has not expired, and thereafter it shall be counted for only one year.
    (ii) No violation for which the notice or order has been vacated 
shall be counted; and
    (iii) Each violation shall be counted without regard to whether it 
led to a civil penalty assessment.
    (2) Seriousness. The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on 
the seriousness of the violation, as follows:
    (i) Probability of occurrence. The Office shall assign up to 15 
points based on the probability of the occurrence of the event which a 
violated standard is designed to prevent. Points shall be assessed 
according to the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Probability of Occurrence                     Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
None............................................................       0
Insignificant...................................................     1-4
Unlikely........................................................     5-9
Likely..........................................................   10-14
Occurred........................................................      15
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Extent of potential or actual damage. The Office shall assign 
up to 15 points, based on the extent of the potential or actual damage, 
in terms of area and impact on the public or environment, as follows:
    (A) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed 
to prevent would remain within the coal exploration or permit area, the 
Office shall assign zero to seven points, depending on the duration and 
extent of the damage or impact.
    (B) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed 
to prevent would extend outside the coal exploration or permit area, the 
Office shall assign eight to fifteen points, depending on the duration 
and extent of the damage or impact
    (iii) Alternative. In the case of a violation of an administrative 
requirement, such as a requirement to keep records, the Office shall, in 
lieu of paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii), assign up to 15 points for 
seriousness, based upon the extent to which enforcement is obstructed by 
the violation.
    (3) Negligence. (i) The Office shall assign up to 25 points based on 
the degree of fault of the person to whom the notice or order was issued 
in causing or failing to correct the violation, condition, or practice 
which led to the notice or order, either through act or omission. Points 
shall be assessed as follows:
    (A) A violation which occurs through no negligence shall be assigned 
no penalty points for negligence;
    (B) A violation which is caused by negligence shall be assigned 12 
points or less, depending on the degree of negligence;
    (C) A violation which occurs through a greater degree of fault than 
negligence shall be assigned 13 to 25 points, depending on the degree of 
fault.
    (ii) In determining the degree of negligence involved in a violation 
and the number of points to be assigned, the following definitions 
apply:
    (A) No negligence means an inadvertent violation which was 
unavoidable by the exercise of reasonable care.

[[Page 391]]

    (B) Negligence means the failure of a permittee to prevent the 
occurrence of any violation of his or her permit or any requirement of 
the Act or this Chapter due to indifference, lack or diligence, or lack 
of reasonable care, or the failure to abate any violation of such permit 
or the Act due to indifference, lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable 
care.
    (C) A greater degree of fault than negligence means reckless, 
knowing, or intentional conduct.
    (iii) In calculating points to be assigned for negligence, the acts 
of all persons working on the coal exploration or surface coal mining 
and reclamation site shall be attributed to the person to whom the 
notice or order was issued, unless that person establishes that they 
were acts of deliberate sabotage.
    (4) Good faith in attempting to achieve compliance.
    (i) The Office shall add points based on the degree of good faith of 
the person to whom the notice or order was issued in attempting to 
achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. Points 
shall be assigned as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Degree of good faith                        Points
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid compliance............................  -1 to -10.
Normal compliance...........................  0.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The following definitions shall apply under paragraph (b)(4)(i) 
of this section:
    (A) Rapid compliance means that the person to whom the notice or 
order was issued took extraordinary measures to abate the violation in 
the shortest possible time and that abatement was achieved before the 
time set for abatement.
    (B) Normal compliance means the person to whom the notice or order 
was issued abated the violation within the time given for abatement.
    (iii) If the consideration of this criterion is impractical because 
of the length of the abatement period, the assessment may be made 
without considering this criterion and may be reassessed after the 
violation has been abated.


<R05>
Sec. 845.14  Determination of amount of penalty.

    The Office shall determine the amount of any civil penalty by 
converting the total number of points assigned under 30 CFR 845.13 to a 
dollar amount, according to the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Points                              Dollars

<R05>
Sec. 845.15  Assessment of separate violations for each day.

    (a) The Office may assess separately a civil penalty for each day 
from the date of issuance of the notice of violation or cessation order 
to the date set for abatement of the violation. In determining whether 
to make such an assessment, the Office shall consider the factors listed 
in 30 CFR 845.13 and may consider the extent to which the person to whom 
the notice or order was issued gained any economic benefit as a result 
of a failure to comply. For any violation which continues for two or 
more days and which is assigned more than 70 points under Sec. 
845.13(b), the Office shall assess a penalty for a minimum of two 
separate days.
    (b) In addition to the civil penalty provided for in paragraph (a), 
whenever a violation contained in a notice of violation or cessation 
order has not been abated within the abatement period set in the notice 
or order or as subsequently extended pursuant to section 521(a) of the 
Act, a civil penalty of not less than $925 shall be assessed for each 
day during which such failure to abate continues, except that:
    (1)(i) If suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or 
order is ordered in a temporary relief proceeding under section 525(c) 
of the Act, after a determination that the person to whom the notice or 
order was issued will suffer irreparable loss or damage from the 
application of the requirements, the period permitted for abatement 
shall not end until the date on which the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
issues a final order with respect to the violation in question; and
    (ii) If the person to whom the notice or order was issued initiates 
review proceedings under section 526 of the Act with respect to the 
violation, in which the obligations to abate are suspended by the court 
pursuant to section 526(c) of the Act, the daily assessment of a penalty 
shall not be made for any period before entry of a final order by the 
court;
    (2) Such penalty for the failure to abate the violation shall not be 
assessed for more than 30 days for each such violation. If the permittee 
has not abated the violation within the 30-day period, the Office shall 
take appropriate action pursuant to section 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4), 
or 521(c) of the Act within 30 days to ensure that abatement occurs or 
to ensure that there will not be a reoccurrence of the failure to abate.

<R05>
Sec. 845.16  Waiver of use of formula to determine civil penalty.

    (a) The Director, upon his own initiative or upon written request 
received within 15 days of issuance of a notice of violation or a 
cessation order, may waive the use of the formula contained in 30 CFR 
845.13 to set the civil penalty, if he or she determines that, taking 
into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the 
penalty is demonstrably unjust. However, the Director shall not waive 
the use of the formula or reduce the proposed assessment on the basis of 
an argument that a reduction in the proposed penalty could be used to 
abate violations of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or 
any condition of any permit or exploration approval. The basis for every 
waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the 
case.
    (b) If the Director waives the use of the formula, he or she shall 
use the criteria set forth in 30 CFR 845.13(b) to determine the 
appropriate penalty. When the Director has elected to waive the use of 
the formula, he or she shall give a written explanation of the basis for 
the assessment made to the person to whom the notice or order was 
issued.


<R05>
Sec. 845.17  Procedures for assessment of civil penalties.

    (a) Within 15 days of service of a notice or order, the person to 
whom it

[[Page 393]]

was issued may submit written information about the violation to the 
Office and to the inspector who issued the notice of violation or 
cessation order. The Office shall consider any information so submitted 
in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the 
penalty.
    (b) The Office shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment and of 
the work sheet showing the computation of the proposed assessment on the 
person to whom the notice or order was issued, by certified mail, or by 
any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a 
summons or complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice or order.
    (1) If a copy of the proposed assessment and work sheet or the 
certified mail is tendered at the address of that person required under 
30 CFR 816.11, or at any address at which that person is in fact 
located, and he or she refuses to accept delivery of or to collect such 
documents, the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed to have 
been complied with upon such tender.
    (2) Failure by the Office to serve any proposed assessment within 30 
days shall not be grounds for dismissal of all or part of such 
assessment unless the person against whom the proposed penalty has been 
assessed--
    (i) Proves actual prejudice as a result of the delay; and,
    (ii) Makes a timely objection to the delay. An objection shall be 
timely only if made in the normal course of administrative review.
    (c) Unless a conference has been requested, the Office shall review 
and reassess any penalty if necessary to consider facts which were not 
reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment 
because of the length of the abatement period. The Office shall serve a 
copy of any such reassessment and of the worksheet showing the 
computation of the reassessment in the manner provided in paragraph (b), 
within 30 days after the date the violation is abated.

<R05>
Sec. 845.18  Procedures for assessment conference.

    (a) The Office shall arrange for a conference to review the proposed 
assessment or reassessment, upon written request of the person to whom 
the notice or order was issued, if the request is received within 30 
days from the date the proposed assessment or reassessment is received.
    (b)(1) The Office shall assign a conference officer to hold the 
assessment conference. The assessment conference shall not be governed 
by section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code, regarding 
requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings. The assessment conference 
shall be held within 60 days from the date the conference request is 
received or the end of the abatement period, whichever is later: 
Provided, That a failure by the Office to hold such conference within 60 
days shall not be grounds for dismissal of all or part of an assessment 
unless the person against whom the proposed penalty has been assessed 
proves actual prejudice as a result of the delay.
    (2) The Office shall post notice of the time and place of the 
conference at the State or field office closest to the mine at least 5 
days before the conference. Any person shall have a right to attend and 
participate in the conference.
    (3) The conference officer shall consider all relevant information 
on the violation. Within 30 days after the conference is held, the 
conference officer shall either:
    (i) Settle the issues, in which case a settlement agreement shall be 
prepared and signed by the conference officer on behalf of the Office 
and by the person assessed; or
    (ii) Affirm, raise, lower, or vacate the penalty.
    (4) An increase or reduction of a proposed civil penalty assessment 
of more than 25 percent and more than $500 shall not be final and 
binding on the Secretary, until approved by the Director or his or her 
designee.
    (c) The conference officer shall promptly serve the person assessed 
with a notice of his or her action in the manner provided in 30 CFR 
845.17(b) and shall include a worksheet if the penalty has been raised 
or lowered. The

[[Page 394]]

reasons for the conference officer's action shall be fully documented in 
the file.
    (d)(1) If a settlement agreement is entered into, the person 
assessed will be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of 
the violation or penalty in question, except as otherwise expressly 
provided for in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement shall 
contain a clause to this effect.
    (2) If full payment of the amount specified in the settlement 
agreement is not received by the Office within 30 days after the date of 
signing, the Office may enforce the agreement or rescind it and proceed 
according to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) within 30 days from the date of the 
rescission.
    (e) The conference officer may terminate the conference when he or 
she determines that the issues cannot be resolved or that the person 
assessed is not diligently working toward resolution of the issues.
    (f) At formal review proceedings under sections 518, 521(a)(4), and 
525 of the Act, no evidence as to statements made or evidence produced 
by one party at a conference shall be introduced as evidence by another 
party or to impeach a witness.

<R05>
Sec. 845.19  Request for hearing.

    (a) The person charged with the violation may contest the proposed 
penalty or the fact of the violation by submitting a petition and an 
amount equal to the proposed penalty or, if a conference has been held, 
the reassessed or affirmed penalty to the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(to be held in escrow as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) 
within 30 days from receipt of the proposed assessment or reassessment 
or 30 days from the date of service of the conference officer's action, 
whichever is later. The fact of the violation may not be contested if it 
has been decided in a review proceeding commenced under 30 CFR 843.16.
    (b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall transfer all funds 
submitted under paragraph (a) of this section to the Office, which shall 
hold them in escrow pending completion of the administrative and 
judicial review process, at which time it shall disburse them as 
provided in 30 CFR 845.20.

<R05>
Sec. 845.20  Final assessment and payment of penalty.

    (a) If the person to whom a notice of violation or cessation order 
is issued fails to request a hearing as provided in Sec. 845.19, the 
proposed assessment shall become a final order of the Secretary and the 
penalty assessed shall become due and payable upon expiration of the 
time allowed to request a hearing.
    (b) If any party requests judicial review of a final order of the 
Secretary, the proposed penalty shall continue to be held in escrow 
until completion of the review. Otherwise, subject to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the escrowed funds shall be transferred to the Office in 
payment of the penalty, and the escrow shall end.
    (c) If the final decision in the administrative and judicial review 
results in an order reducing or eliminating the proposed penalty 
assessed under this part, the Office shall within 30 days of receipt of 
the order refund to the person assessed all or part of the escrowed 
amount, with interest from the date of payment into escrow to the date 
of the refund at the rate of 6 percent or at the prevailing Department 
of the Treasury rate, whichever is greater.
    (d) If the review results in an order increasing the penalty, the 
person to whom the notice or order was issued shall pay the difference 
to the Office within 15 days after the order is mailed to such person.


<R05>
Sec. 845.21  Use of civil penalties for reclamation.

    (a) To the extent authorized in the applicable annual appropriations 
act or other relevant statute, the Director of OSMRE may utilize money 
collected by the United States pursuant to the assessment of civil 
penalties under section 518 of the Act for reclamation of lands 
adversely affected by coal mining practices after August 3, 1977, until 
such funds are expended.
    (b) The Director may allocate funds at his discretion for 
reclamation projects on lands within any State or

Sec. 846.1  Scope.

    This part covers the assessment of individual civil penalties under 
section 518(f) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 846.12  When an individual civil penalty may be assessed.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Office 
may assess an individual civil penalty against any corporate director, 
officer or agent of a corporate permittee who knowingly and willfully 
authorized, ordered or carried out a violation, failure or refusal.
    (b) The Office shall not assess an individual civil penalty in 
situations resulting from a permit violation by a corporate permittee 
until a cessation order has been issued by the Office to the corporate 
permittee for the violation, and the cessation order has remained 
unabated for 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 846.14  Amount of individual civil penalty.

    (a) In determining the amount of an individual civil penalty 
assessed under Sec. 846.12, the Office shall consider the criteria 
specified in section 518(a) of the Act, including:
    (1) The individual's history of authorizing, ordering or carrying 
out previous violations, failures or refusals at the particular surface 
coal mining operation;
    (2) The seriousness of the violation, failure or refusal (as 
indicated by the extent of damage and/or the cost of reclamation), 
including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the 
health or safety of the public; and
    (3) The demonstrated good faith of the individual charged in 
attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notice of the violation, 
failure or refusal.
    (b) The penalty shall not exceed $5,500 for each violation. Each day 
of a continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation and the 
Office may assess a separate individual civil penalty for each day the 
violation, failure or refusal continues, from the date of service of the 
underlying notice of violation, cessation order or other order 
incorporated in a final decision issued by the Secretary, until 
abatement or compliance is achieved.

performed on the individual to be assessed an individual civil penalty, 
by certified mail, or by any alternative means consistent with the rules

issuance of a final administrative order affirming, increasing or 
decreasing the proposed penalty.
    (c) Abatement agreement. Where the Office and the corporate 
permittee or individual have agreed in writing on a plan for the 
abatement of or compliance with the unabated order, an individual named 
in a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment may postpone 
payment until receiving either a final order from the Office stating 
that the penalty is due on the date of such final order, or written 
notice that abatement or compliance is satisfactory and the penalty has 
been withdrawn.
    (d) Delinquent payment. Following the expiration of 30 days after 
the issuance of a final order assessing an individual civil penalty, any 
delinquent penalty shall be subject to interest at the rate established 
quarterly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for use in applying 
late charges on late payments to the Federal Government, pursuant to 
Treasury Financial Manual 6-8020.20. The Treasury current value of funds 
rate is published by the Fiscal Service in the notices section of the 
Federal Register. Interest on unpaid penalties will run from the date 
payment first was due until the date of payment. Failure to pay overdue 
penalties may result in one or more of the actions specified in 
Sec. Sec. 870.15 (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this chapter. Delinquent 
penalties are subject to late payment penalties specified in Sec. 
870.15(f) of this chapter and processing and handling charges specified

Sec. 870.1  Scope.

    This part sets out the procedures for the collection of fees for the 
Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 870.5  Definitions.

    As used in part 870 through 888 of this subchapter--
    Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund or Fund means a special fund 
established on the books of the U.S. Treasury for the purpose of 
accumulating revenues designated for reclamation of abandoned mine lands 
and other activities authorized by Title IV of the Act.
    Agency means the State agency designated by the Governor, or in the 
case of Indian tribes, the Tribal agency designated by the equivalent 
head of an Indian tribe, to administer the State/Indian tribe 
reclamation program and to receive and administer grants under this 
part.
    Allocate means the administrative identification in the records of 
OSM of moneys in the fund for a specific purpose, e.g., identification 
of moneys for exclusive use by a State.
    Anthracite, bituminous and subbituminous coal means all coals other 
than lignite coal.
    Calendar quarter means a 3-month period within a calendar year. The 
first calendar quarter begins on January 1 of the calendar year and ends 
on the last day of March. The second calendar quarter begins on the 
first day of April and ends on the last day of June. The third calendar 
quarter begins on the first day of July and ends on the last day of 
September. The fourth calendar quarter begins on the first day of 
October and ends on the last day of December.
    Eligible lands and water means land and water eligible for 
reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures which were mined for coal 
or which were affected by such mining, wastebanks, coal processing, or 
other coal mining processes and left or abandoned in either an 
unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition prior to August 3, 1977, 
and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility. 
Provided, however, that lands and water damaged by coal mining 
operations after that date and on or before November 5, 1990, may also 
be eligible for reclamation if they meet the requirements specified in 
30 CFR 874.12 (d) and (e). Following certification of the completion of 
all known coal problems, eligible lands and water for noncoal 
reclamation purposes are those sites that meet the eligibility 
requirements specified in 30 CFR 874.14. For additional eligibility 
requirements for water projects, see 30 CFR 874.14, and for lands 
affected by remining operations, see Section 404 of the Act.
    Emergency means a sudden danger or impairment that presents a high 
probability of substantial physical harm to the health, safety, or 
general welfare of people before the danger can be abated under normal 
program operation procedures.
    Excess moisture means the difference between total moisture and 
inherent moisture, calculated according to

[[Page 405]]

Sec. 870.19 for high-rank coals or the difference between total 
moisture and inherent moisture calculated according to Sec. 870.20 for 
low-rank coals.
    Expended means that moneys have been obligated, encumbered, or 
committed for reclamation by contract by the OSM, State, or Tribe for 
work to be accomplished or services to be rendered.
    Extreme danger means a condition that could reasonably be expected 
to cause substantial physical harm to persons, property, or the 
environment and to which persons or improvements on real property are 
currently exposed.
    Fee compliance officer means any person authorized by the Secretary 
to exercise authority in matters relating to this part.
    In situ coal mining means activities conducted on the surface or 
underground in connection with in-place distillation, retorting, 
leaching or other chemical or physical processing of coal. The term 
includes, but is not limited to, in situ gasification, in situ leaching, 
slurry mining, solution mining, bore hole mining, and fluid recovery 
mining. At this time, part 870 considers only in situ gasification.
    Indian Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund or Indian Fund means a 
separate fund established by an Indian tribe for the purpose of 
accounting for moneys granted by the Director under an approved Indian 
Reclamation Program and other moneys authorized by these regulations to 
be deposited in the Indian Fund.
    Indian reclamation program means a program established by an Indian 
tribe in accordance with this chapter for reclamation of lands and water 
adversely affected by past mining, including the reclamation plan and 
annual applications for grants under the plan.
    Inherent moisture means moisture that exists as an integral part of 
the coal seam in its natural state, including water in pores, but 
excluding that present in macroscopically visible fractures, as 
determined according to Sec. 870.19(a) or Sec. 870.20(a).
    Left or abandoned in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed 
condition means lands and water:
    (a) Which were mined or which were affected by such mining, 
wastebanks, processing or other mining processes prior to August 3, 
1977, or between August 3, 1977 and November 5, 1990, as authorized 
pursuant to Section 402(g)(4) of the Act, and on which all mining has 
ceased;
    (b) Which continue, in their present condition, to degrade 
substantially the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the 
beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health and 
safety of the public; and
    (c) For which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility 
under State or Federal Laws, except as provided in Sections 402(g)(4) 
and 403(b)(2) of the Act.
    Lignite coal means consolidated lignite coal having less than 8,300 
British thermal units per pound, moist and mineral-matter-free. Moist, 
mineral-matter free British thermal units per pound are determined by 
Parr's formula, equation 3, on page 222 of ``Standard Specification for 
Classification of Coals by Rank,'' in American Society for Testing and 
Materials ASTM D 388-77 (Philadelphia, 1977). Parr's formula follows:

Moist, Mn-Free Btu=
(Bu-50S)/[100-(1.08A+0.55S)]x100

where:

Mn = Mineral matter
Btu = British thermal units per pound (calorific value)
A = percentage of ash, and

Sec. 870.12  Reclamation fee.

    (a) The operator shall pay a reclamation fee on each ton of coal 
produced for sale, transfer, or use, including the products of in situ 
mining.
    (b) The fee shall be determined by the weight and value at the time 
of initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use by the 
operator.
    (1) The initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use shall 
be determined by the first transaction or use of the coal by the 
operator immediately after it is severed, or removed from a reclaimed 
coal refuse deposit.
    (2) The value of the coal shall be determined F.O.B. mine.
    (3) The weight of each ton shall be determined by the actual gross 
weight of the coal.
    (i) Impurities that have not been removed prior to the time of 
initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use by the operator, 
excluding excess moisture for which a reduction has been taken pursuant 
to Sec. 870.18, shall not be deducted from the gross weight.
    (ii) Operators selling coal on a clean coal basis shall retain 
records that show run-of-mine tonnage, and the basis for the clean coal 
transaction.
    (iii) Insufficient records shall subject the operator to fees based 
on raw tonnage data.
    (c) If the operator combines surface mined coal, including reclaimed 
coal, with underground mined coal before the coal is weighed for fee 
purposes, the higher reclamation fee shall apply, unless the operator 
can substantiate the amount of coal produced by surface

[[Page 408]]

mining by acceptable engineering calculations or other reports which the 
Director may require.
    (d) The reclamation fee shall be paid after the end of each calendar 
quarter beginning with the calendar quarter starting October 1, 1977.

<R05>
Sec. 870.13  Fee rates.

    (a) Fees for coal produced for sale, transfer, or use through 
September 30, 2004. (1) Surface mining fees. The fee for anthracite, 
bituminous, and subbituminous coal, including reclaimed coal, is 35 
cents per ton unless the value of such coal is less than $3.50 per ton, 
in which case the fee is 10 percent of the value.
    (2) Underground mining fees. The fee for anthracite, bituminous, and 
subbituminous coal is 15 cents per ton unless the value of such coal is 
less than $1.50 per ton, in which case the fee is 10 percent of the 
value.
    (3) Surface and underground mining fees for lignite coal. The fee 
for lignite coal is 10 cents per ton unless the value of such coal is 
less than $5.00 per ton, in which case the fee charged is 2 percent of 
the value.
    (4) In situ coal mining fees. The fee for in situ mined coal, except 
lignite coal, is 15 cents per ton based on Btu's per ton in place 
equated to the gas produced at the site as certified through analysis by 
an independent laboratory. The fee for in situ mined lignite is 10 cents 
per ton based on the Btu's per ton of coal in place equated to the gas 
produced at the site as certified through analysis by an independent 
laboratory.
    (b) Fees for coal produced for sale, transfer, or use after 
September 30, 2004. In this paragraph (b), ``we'' refers to OSM, 
``Combined Fund'' refers to the United Mine Workers of America Combined 
Benefit Fund established under section 9702 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9702), and ``unassigned beneficiaries premium 
account'' refers to the account established under section 9704(e) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9704(e)).
    (1) Fees to be set annually. We will establish the fee for each ton 
of coal produced for sale, transfer, or use after September 30, 2004, on 
an annual basis. The fee per ton is based on the total fees required to 
be paid each fiscal year, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, allocated among the estimated coal production categories, as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. We will publish the fees 
for each fiscal year after Fiscal Year 2005 in the Federal Register at 
least 30 days before the start of that fiscal year. Once we publish the 
fees, they will not change for that fiscal year and they will apply to 
all coal produced during that fiscal year.
    (2) Calculation of the total fee collections needed. The total 
amount of fee collections needed for any fiscal year is the amount that 
must be transferred from the Fund to the Combined Fund under section 
402(h) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1232(h)) for that fiscal year, with any 
necessary adjustments for the amount of any fee overcollections or 
undercollections in prior fiscal years. We will calculate the amount of 
total fee collections needed as follows:
    (i) Step one. We will determine the smallest of the following 
numbers:
    (A) The estimated net interest earnings of the Fund during the 
fiscal year;
    (B) $70 million; or
    (C) The most recent estimate provided by the trustees of the 
Combined Fund of the amount that will be debited against the unassigned 
beneficiary premium account for that fiscal year (``the Combined Fund's 
needs'').
    (ii) Step two. We will increase or decrease, as appropriate, the 
amount determined under step one by the amount of any adjustments to 
previous transfers to the Combined Fund resulting from a difference 
between estimated and actual interest earnings or the estimated and 
actual Combined Fund's needs. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) applies only to 
adjustments to transfers for prior fiscal years beginning on or after 
October 1, 2004, and only to those adjustments that have not previously 
been taken into account in establishing fees for prior years.
    (iii) Step three. We will adjust the amount determined under steps 
one and two of this section by an amount equal to the difference between 
the fees actually collected (based on estimated

[[Page 409]]

production) and the amount that should have been collected (based on 
actual production) for any prior fiscal year beginning on or after 
October 1, 2004, if the difference has not previously been taken into 
account in establishing fees for prior years.
    (3) Establishment of fees. We will use the following procedure to 
establish the per-ton fees for each fiscal year:
    (i) Step one. We will estimate the total tonnage of coal that will 
be produced during that fiscal year and for which a fee payment 
obligation exists, categorized by the types of coal and mining methods 
described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Step two. We will allocate the total fee collection needs 
determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section among the various 
categories of estimated coal production under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section to establish a per-ton fee based upon the following 
parameters:
    (A) The per-ton fee for anthracite, bituminous or subbituminous coal 
produced by underground methods will be 43 percent of the rate for the 
same type of coal produced by surface methods.
    (B) Regardless of the method of mining, the per-ton fee for lignite 
coal will be 29 percent of the rate for other types of coal mined by 
surface methods.
    (C) The per-ton fee for in situ mined coal will be the same as the 
fees set under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, 
depending on the type of coal mined. The fee will be based upon the 
quantity and quality of gas produced at the site, converted to Btu's per 
ton of coal upon which in situ mining was conducted, as determined by an 
analysis performed and certified by an independent laboratory.

<R05>
Sec. 870.14  Determination of percentage-based fees.

    (a) If the operator submits a fee based on a percentage of the value 
of coal, the operator shall include, with his fee and production report, 
documentation supporting the alleged coal value. Based on this 
information and any additional documentation; including examination of 
the operator's books and records, that the Director may require, the 
Director may accept the valuation submitted by the operator, or may 
otherwise determine the value of the coal.
    (b) If the Director determines that a higher fee shall be paid, the 
operator shall submit the additional fee together with interest computed 
under Sec. 870.15(c).


<R05>
Sec. 870.15  Reclamation fee payment.

    (a) Each operator shall pay the reclamation fee based on calendar 
quarter tonnage no later than thirty days after the end of each calendar 
quarter.
    (b) Each operator must use mine report Form OSM-1 (or any approved 
successor form) to report the tonnage of coal sold, used, or 
transferred. The report must also include the name and address of any 
person or entity who, in a given quarter, is the owner of 10 percent or 
more of the mineral estate for a given permit, and any entity or 
individual who, in a given quarter, purchases ten percent or more of the 
production from a given permit during the applicable quarter. The 
operator can file a report under this section either in paper format or 
in electronic format as specified in Sec. 870.17. If no single mineral 
owner or purchaser meets the 10 percent rule, then the largest single 
mineral owner and purchaser shall be reported. If several persons have 
successively transferred the mineral rights, information shall be 
provided on the last owner(s) in the chain prior to the permittee, i.e. 
the person or persons who have granted the permittee the right to 
extract the coal. At the time of reporting, a submitter may designate 
such information as confidential.
    (c) As of April 1, 1983, delinquent reclamation fee payments are 
subject to interest at the rate established quarterly by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury for use in applying late charges on late 
payments to the Federal Government, pursuant to Treasury Fiscal 
Requirements Manual 6-8020.20. The Treasury current value of funds rate 
is published by the Fiscal Service in the Notices section of the Federal 
Register. Interest on unpaid reclamation fees shall begin to accure on 
the

[[Page 410]]

31st day following the end of the calendar quarter for which the fee 
payment is owed and will run until the date of payment. OSM will bill 
delinquent operators on a monthly basis and initiate whatever action is 
necessary to secure full payment of all fees and interest. All operators 
who receive a Coal Sales and Reclamation Fee Report (Form OSM-1), 
including those with zero sales, uses, or transfers, must submit a 
completed Form OSM-1, as well as any fee payment due. Fee payments 
postmarked later than thirty days after the calendar quarter for which 
the fee was owed will be subject to interest.
    (d)(1) An operator who owes total quarterly reclamation fees of 
$25,000 or more for one or more mines shall:
    (i) Use an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury;
    (ii) Forward its payments by electronic transfer;
    (iii) Include the applicable Master Entity No.(s) (Part 1--Block 4 
on the OSM-1 form), and OSM Document No.(s) (Part 1--upper right corner 
of the OSM-1 form) on the wire message; and
    (iv) Use OSM's approved form or approved electronic form to report 
coal tonnage sold, used, or for which ownership was transferred, to the 
address indicated in the Instructions for Completing the OSM-1 Form.
    (2) An operator who owes less than $25,000 in quarterly reclamation 
fees for one or more mines may:
    (i) Forward payments by electronic transfer in accordance with the 
procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
    (ii) Submit a check or money order payable to the Office of Surface 
Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, in the same envelope with OSM's 
approved form to: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, 
P.O. Box 360095M, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15251.
    (3) An operator who submits a payment of more than $25,000 by a 
method other than an electronic fund transfer mechanism approved by the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury shall be in violation of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, as amended.
    (e) Failure to pay overdue reclamation fees, including interest on 
late payments or underpayments, failure to maintain adequate records, or 
failure to provide access to records of a surface coal mining operation 
may result in one or more of the following actions: (1) Initiation of 
litigation; (2) reporting to the Internal Revenue Service; (3) reporting 
to State agencies responsible for taxation; (4) reporting to credit 
bureaus; or (5) referral to collection agencies. Such remedies are not 
exclusive.
    (f) When a reclamation fee debt is greater than 91 days overdue, a 6 
percent per annum penalty shall begin to accure on the amount owed for 
fees and will run until the date of payment. This penalty is in addition 
to the interest described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (g)(1) For all delinquent fees, interest and any penalties, the 
debtor will be required to pay a processing and handling charge which 
shall be based upon the following components:
    (i) For debts referred to a collection agency, the amount charged to 
OSM by the collection agency;
    (ii) For debts processed and handled by OSM, a standard amount set 
annually by OSM based upon similar charges by collection agencies for 
debt collection;
    (iii) For debts referred to the Solicitor, Department of the 
Interior, but paid prior to litigation, the estimated average cost to 
prepare the case for litigation as of the time of payment;
    (iv) For debts referred to the Solicitor, Department of the 
Interior, and litigated, the estimated cost to prepare and litigate a 
debt case as of the time of payment; and
    (v) If not otherwise provided for, all other administrative expenses 
associated with collection, including, but not limited to, billing, 
recording payments, and follow-up actions.

Sec. 870.18  General rules for calculating excess moisture.

    If you are an operator who mined coal after June 1988, you may 
deduct the weight of excess moisture in the coal to determine 
reclamation fees you owe under 30 CFR 870.12(b)(3)(i). Excess

[[Page 412]]

moisture is the difference between total moisture and inherent moisture. 
To calculate excess moisture in HIGH-rank coal, follow Sec. 870.19. To 
calculate excess moisture in LOW-rank coal, follow Sec. 870.20. Report 
your calculations on the OSM-1 form, Coal Reclamation Fee Report, for 
every calendar quarter in which you claim a deduction. Some cautions:
    (a) You or your customer may do any test required by Sec. Sec. 
870.19 and 870.20. But whoever does a test, you are to keep test results 
and all related records for at least six years after the test date.
    (b) If OSM disallows any or all of an allowance for excess moisture, 
you must submit an additional fee plus interest computed according to 
Sec. 870.15(c) and penalties computed according to Sec. 870.15(f).
    (c) The following definitions are applicable to Sec. Sec. 870.19 
and 870.20. ASTM standards D4596-93, Standard Practice for Collection of 
Channel Samples of Coal in a Mine; D5192-91, Standard Practice for

Sec. 872.11  Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.

    (a) Revenue to the Fund shall include--
    (1) Reclamation fees collected under section 402 of the Act and part 
870 of this chapter;
    (2) Amounts collected by OSM from charges for use of land acquired 
or reclaimed with moneys from the Fund under part 879 of this chapter;
    (3) Moneys recovered by OSM through satisfaction of liens filed 
against privately owned lands reclaimed with moneys from the Fund under 
part 882 of this chapter;
    (4) Moneys recovered by OSM from the sale of lands acquired with 
moneys from the Fund or by donation; and
    (5) Moneys donated to OSM for the purpose of abandoned mine land 
reclamation.
    (6) Interest and any other income earned from investment of the 
Fund. Such interest and other income shall be credited only to the 
Federal share. In addition, an amount equal to the interest earned after 
September 30, 1992, shall be available pursuant to Section 402(h) of the 
Act for possible future transfer to the United Mine Workers of America 
Combined Benefit Fund.
    (b) Moneys deposited in Fund and appropriated by the Congress shall 
be used for the following purposes:
    (1) An amount equal to 50 percent of the reclamation fees collected 
from within a State shall be allocated at the end of the fiscal year to 
the State in which they were collected. Reclamation fees collected from 
Indian lands shall not be included in the calculation of amounts to be 
allocated to a State. If a State advises OSM in writing that it does not 
intend to submit a State reclamation plan, no monies shall be allocated 
to the State. Amounts granted to a State that have not been expended 
within three years from the date of grant award shall be available to 
the Director for other purposes under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. 
Such funds may be withdrawn from the State if the Director finds in 
writing that the amounts involved are not necessary to carry out the 
approved reclamation activities.
    (2) An amount equal to 50 percent of the reclamation fees collected 
from Indian lands shall be allocated to the Indian tribe or tribes 
having an interest in those lands. This shall occur at the end of the 
fiscal year in which the fees were collected. If an Indian tribe advises 
OSM in writing that it does not intend to submit an Indian reclamation 
plan, no monies shall be allocated to that Indian tribe. Amounts granted 
to an Indian tribe that have not been expended within three years from 
the date of grant award shall be available to the Director for other 
purposes under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Such funds may be 
withdrawn from the Indian tribe if the Director finds in writing that 
the amounts involved are not necessary to carry out the approved 
reclamation activities.
    (3) An amount equal to the 10 percent of the monies collected and 
deposited in the Fund annually, as well as 20 percent of the interest 
and other miscellaneous receipts to the Fund, if such

[[Page 418]]

amount is not necessary pursuant to Section 402(h) of the Act for 
transfer to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund, 
shall be allocated by the Secretary for transfer to the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture's Rural Abandoned Mine Program.
    (4) An amount equal to 40 percent of the monies deposited in the 
Fund annually, including interest, if not required to satisfy the 
provisions of Section 402(h) of the Act, shall be allocated for use by 
the Secretary to supplement annual grants to States and Indian tribes 
after making the allocations referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
this section. States and Indian tribes eligible for supplemental grants 
under this provision are those that have not certified the completion of 
all coal-related reclamation under Section 411(a) of the Act and that 
have not achieved the priorities stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of 
Section 403(a) of the Act. The allocation of these monies by the 
Secretary to eligible States and Indian tribes shall be through a 
formula based upon the amount of coal historically produced prior to 
August 3, 1977, in the State or from the Indian lands concerned. Funds 
to be granted to specific States or Indian tribes under this paragraph 
may be reduced or curtailed under the following two conditions:
    (i) If State or Indian tribal share funds to be granted in a year 
are sufficient to address all remaining eligible priority 1 or 2 coal 
sites in the State or on Indian lands, no additional funds under this 
paragraph will be provided during that year; or
    (ii) If the cost to reclaim all remaining priority 1 or 2 coal sites 
in a specific State or on a specific Indian tribe's land exceeds the 
amount of State or Indian tribal share funds to be granted in a year to 
that State or Indian tribe pursuant to Section 402(g)(1) of the Act, but 
is less than the total amount of funds to be granted to the State or 
Indian tribe in that year utilizing State or Indian tribe and Federal 
funds under paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the 
Federal funds granted under this paragraph will be reduced to that 
amount needed to fully fund all remaining priority 1 or 2 coal sites 
after utilizing all available State or Indian tribe share funds.
    (5) Amounts available in the Fund that are not allocated pursuant to 
paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section are authorized to 
be expended by the Secretary for any of the following:
    (i) The Small Operator Assistance Program under Section 507(c) of 
the Act (not more than $10,000,000 annually).
    (ii) Emergency projects under State, Indian tribal, and Federal 
programs under Section 410 of the Act.
    (iii) Nonemergency projects in States and on Indian tribal lands 
that do not have an approved abandoned mine reclamation program pursuant 
to Section 405 of the Act.
    (iv) Administration of the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program 
by the Secretary.
    (v) Projects authorized under Section 402(g)(4) in States and on 
Indian lands that do not have an approved abandoned mine reclamation 
program pursuant to Section 405 of the Act.
    (6) If necessary to achieve the priorities stated in paragraphs 
403(a) (1) and (2) of the Act, the Secretary, subject to the provision 
below, shall grant annually not less than $2,000,000 for expenditure in 
each State and Indian tribe having an approved abandoned mine land 
program, provided however, that annual State or Indian tribe share funds 
are utilized first, and that supplemental funds granted under this 
paragraph and paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall not exceed the 
costs of reclaiming all remaining priority 1 or 2 coal sites in a State 
or on Indian tribal land.
    (7) Funds allocated or expended annually by the Secretary under 
Sections 402(g) (2), (3), or (4) of the Act for any State or Indian 
tribe shall not be deducted from funds allocated or granted annually to 
a State or Indian tribe under the authority of Sections 402(g) (1), (5), 
or (8) of the Act.
    (8) The Secretary shall expend funds pursuant to the authority in 
Section 402(g)(3)(C) of the Act only in States or on Indian lands where 
the State or Indian tribe does not have an abandoned mine reclamation 
program approved under Section 405 of the Act.
    (c) Money deposited in State or Indian Abandoned Mine Reclamation

Funds shall be used to carry out the reclamation plan approved under 
part 884 of this chapter and projects approved under part 888 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 874.12  Eligible coal lands and water.

    Coal lands and water are eligible for reclamation activities if--
    (a) They were mined for coal or affected by coal mining processes;
    (b) They were mined prior to August 3, 1977, and left or abandoned 
in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition; and
    (c) There is no continuing responsibility for reclamation by the 
operator, permittee, or agent of the permittee under statutes of the 
State or Federal government, or as a result of bond forfeiture. Bond 
forfeiture will render lands or water ineligible only if the amount 
forfeited is sufficient to pay the total cost of the necessary 
reclamation. In cases where the forfeited bond is insufficient to pay 
the total cost of reclamation, additional moneys from the Fund may be 
sought under parts 886 or 888 of this chapter.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, 
coal lands and waters in a State or on Indian lands damaged and 
abandoned after August 3, 1977, by coal mining processes are also 
eligible for funding if the Secretary finds in writing that:
    (1) They were mined for coal or affected by coal mining processes; 
and
    (2) The mining occurred and the site was left in either an 
unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition between August 4, 1977, 
and:
    (i) The date on which the Secretary approved a State regulatory 
program pursuant to Section 503 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1253) for a State 
or September 28, 1994, for an Indian tribe, and that any funds for 
reclamation or abatement that are available pursuant to a bond or other 
form of financial guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient 
to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; or
    (ii) November 5, 1990, that the surety of the mining operator became 
insolvent during such period and that, as of November 5, 1990, funds 
immediately available from proceedings relating to

[[Page 421]]

such insolvency or from any financial guarantee or other source are not 
sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; 
and
    (3) The site qualifies as a priority 1 or 2 site pursuant to Section 
403(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. Priority will be given to those sites that 
are in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or that have an 
adverse economic impact upon a community.
    (e) Any State or Indian tribe may expend funds may available under 
paragraphs 402(g)(1) and (5) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1232(g)(1) and (5)) 
for reclamation and abatement of any site eligible under paragraph (d) 
of this section, if the State or Indian tribe, with the concurrence of 
the Secretary, makes the findings required in paragraph (d) of this 
section and the State or Indian tribe determines that the reclamation 
priority of the site is the same or more urgent than the reclamation 
priority for the lands and water eligible pursuant to paragraphs (a), 
(b) or (c) of this section that qualify as a priority 1 or 2 site under 
Section 403(a) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1233(a)).
    (f) With respect to lands eligible pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) 
of this section, monies available from sources outside the Abandoned 
Mine Reclamation Fund or that are ultimately recovered from responsible 
parties shall either be used to offset the cost of the reclamation or 
transferred to the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund if not required for 
further reclamation activities at the permitted site.
    (g) If reclamation of a site covered by an interim or permanent 
program permit is carried out under the Abandoned Mine Land Program, the 
permittee of the site shall reimburse the Abandoned Mine Land Fund for 
the cost of reclamation that is in excess of any bond forfeited to 
ensure reclamation. Neither the Secretary nor a State or Indian tribe 
performing reclamation under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section shall 
be held liable for any violations of any performance standards or 
reclamation requirements specified in Title V of the Act nor shall a 
reclamation activity undertaken on such lands or waters be held to any 
standards set forth in Title V of the Act.
    (h) Surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining 
pursuant to Section 404 of the Act shall not affect the eligibility of 
such lands for reclamation activities after the release of the bonds or 
deposits posted by any such operation as provided by Sec. 800.40 of 
this chapter. If the bond or deposit for a surface coal mining operation 
on lands eligible for remining is forfeited, funds available under this 
title may be used if the amount of such bond or deposit is not 
sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement, except that 
if conditions warrant the Secretary shall immediately exercise his/her 
authority under Section 410 of the Act.

    (b) Reclamation projects shall reflect the priorities of Section 
403(a) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1233). Generally, projects lower than a 
priority 2 should not be undertaken until all known higher priority coal 
projects either have been accomplished, are in the process of being 
reclaimed, or have been approved for funding by the Secretary, except in 
those instances where such lower priority projects may be undertaken in 
conjunction with a priority 1 or 2 site in accordance with OSM's ``Final 
Guidelines for Reclamation Programs and Projects.''

Sec. 874.14  Utilities and other facilities.

    (a) Any state or Indian tribe that has not certified the completion 
of all coal-related reclamation under Section 411(a) of the Act, 30 
U.S.C. 1241(a), may expend up to 30 percent of the funds granted 
annually to such State or Indian tribe pursuant to the authority in 
Sections 402(g) (1) and (5) of the Act for the purpose of protecting, 
repairing, replacing, constructing, or enhancing facilities relating to 
water supplies, including water distribution facilities

[[Page 422]]

and treatment plants, to replace water supplies adversely affected by 
coal mining practices.
    (b) If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this 
section occurred both prior to and after August 3, 1977, the project 
shall remain eligible, notwithstanding the criteria specified in 30 CFR 
874.12(b), if the State or Indian tribe finds in writing, as part of its 
eligibility opinion, that such adverse affects are due predominately to 
effects of mining processes undertaken and abandoned prior to August 3, 
1977.
    (c) If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this 
section occurred both prior to and after the dates (and under the 
criteria) set forth under Section 402(g)(4)(B) of the Act, the project

Sec. 874.17  AML agency procedures for reclamation projects receiving 
less than 50 percent government funding.

    This section tells you, the AML agency, what to do when considering 
an abandoned mine land reclamation project as government-financed 
construction under part 707 of this chapter. This section only applies 
if the level of funding for the construction will be less than 50 
percent of the total cost because of planned coal extraction.
    (a) Consultation with the Title V regulatory authority. In 
consultation with the Title V regulatory authority, you must make the 
following determinations:
    (1) You must determine the likelihood of the coal being mined under 
a Title V permit. This determination must take into account available 
information such as:
    (i) Coal reserves from existing mine maps or other sources;
    (ii) Existing environmental conditions;
    (iii) All prior mining activity on or adjacent to the site;
    (iv) Current and historic coal production in the area; and
    (v) Any known or anticipated interest in mining the site.
    (2) You must determine the likelihood that nearby or adjacent mining 
activities might create new environmental problems or adversely affect 
existing environmental problems at the site.
    (3) You must determine the likelihood that reclamation activities at 
the site might adversely affect nearby or adjacent mining activities.
    (b) Concurrence with the Title V regulatory authority. If, after 
consulting with the Title V regulatory authority, you decide to proceed 
with the reclamation project, then you and the Title V regulatory 
authority must concur in the following determinations:

[[Page 423]]

    (1) You must concur in a determination of the limits on any coal 
refuse, coal waste, or other coal deposits which can be extracted under 
the part 707 exemption or counterpart State/Indian Tribe laws and 
regulations.
    (2) You must concur in the delineation of the boundaries of the AML 
project.
    (c) Documentation. You must include in the AML case file:
    (1) The determinations made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section;
    (2) The information taken into account in making the determinations; 
and
    (3) The names of the parties making the determinations.
    (d) Special requirements. For each project, you must:
    (1) Characterize the site in terms of mine drainage, active slides 
and slide-prone areas, erosion and sedimentation, vegetation, toxic 
materials, and hydrologic balance;
    (2) Ensure that the reclamation project is conducted in accordance 
with the provisions of 30 CFR subchapter R;
    (3) Develop specific-site reclamation requirements, including 
performance bonds when appropriate in accordance with State procedures; 
and
    (4) Require the contractor conducting the reclamation to provide 
prior to the time reclamation begins applicable documents that clearly 
authorize the extraction of coal and payment of royalties.
    (e) Limitation. If the reclamation contractor extracts coal beyond 
the limits of the incidental coal specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the contractor must obtain a permit under Title V of SMCRA for 
such coal.

completion of all known coal projects and the Director's concurrence in 
such certification, eligible noncoal lands, waters, and facilities shall 
be those--
    (1) Which were mined or processed for minerals or which were 
affected by such mining or processing, and abandoned or left in an 
inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977. In determining 
the eligibility under this subsection of Federal lands, waters, and 
facilities under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service or Bureau of 
Land Management, in lieu of the August 3, 1977, date, the applicable 
date shall be August 28, 1974, and November 26, 1980, respectively; and

[[Page 425]]

    (2) For which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility 
under State or other Federal laws.
    (b) If eligible coal problems are found or occur after certification 
under Sec. 875.13, a State or Indian tribe must address the coal 
problem utilizing State or Indian tribe share funds no later than the 
next grant cycle, subject to the availability of funds distributed to 
the State or Indian tribe in that cycle. The coal project would be 
subject to the coal provisions specified in Sections 401 through 410 of 
SMCRA.

Sec. 877.13  Entry and consent to reclaim.

    (a) OSM, the State, or Indian tribe or its agents, employees, or 
contractors may enter upon land to perform reclamation activities or 
conduct studies or exploratory work to determine the existence of the 
adverse effects of past coal mining if consent from the owner is 
obtained.
    (b) If consent is not obtained, then, prior to entry under this 
section, the OSM, State, or Indian tribe shall find in writing, with 
supporting reasons that--
    (1) Land or water resources have been or may be adversely affected 
by past coal mining practices;
    (2) The adverse effects are at a state where, in the interest of the 
public health, safety, or the general welfare, action to restore, 
reclaim, abate, control, or prevent should be taken; and
    (3) The owner of the land or water resources where entry must be 
made to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects 
of past coal mining practices is not known or readily available, or the 
owner will not give permission for OSM, State, or Indian tribe or its 
agents, employees, or contractors to enter upon such property to 
restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the effects of past coal 
mining practices.
    (c) If consent is not obtained, OSM, State, or Indian tribe shall 
give notice of its intent to enter for purposes of conducting 
reclamation at least 30 days before entry upon the property. The notice 
shall be in writing and shall be mailed, return receipt requested, to 
the owner, if known, with a copy of the findings required by this 
section. If the owner is not known, or if the current mailing address of 
the owner is not known, notice shall be posted in one or more places on 
the property to be entered where it is readily visible to the public and 
advertised once in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality in 
which the land is located. The notice posted on the property and 
advertised in the newspaper shall include a statement of where the 
findings required by this section may be inspected or obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 877.14  Entry for emergency reclamation.

    (a) OSM, its agents, employees, or contractors shall have the right 
to enter upon any land where an emergency exists and on any other land 
to have access to the land where the emergency exists to restore, 
reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of coal mining 
practices and to do all things necessary to protect the public health, 
safety, or general welfare.
    (b) Prior to entry under this section, OSM shall make a written 
finding with supporting reasons that the situation qualifies as an 
emergency in accordance with the requirements set out in section 410 of 
the Act.
    (c) Notice to the owner shall not be required prior to entry for 
emergency reclamation. OSM shall make reasonable efforts to notify the 
owner and obtain consent prior to entry, consistent with the emergency 
conditions that exist. Written notice shall be given to the owner as 
soon after entry as practical in accordance with the requirements set

Sec. 879.1  Scope.

    This part establishes procedures for acquisition of eligible land 
and water resources for emergency abatement activities and reclamation 
purposes by OSM or a State or Indian tribe under an approved reclamation 
program. It also provides for the management and disposition of lands 
acquired by the OSM, State, or Indian tribe and establishes requirements 
for the redeposit of proceeds from the use or sale of land.


<R05>
Sec. 879.10  Information collection.

    The information collection re quirements contained in Sec. Sec. 
879.11(b)(1), (b)(2), and (e)(3), 879.12(a), 879.13(b), and 879.15(a) 
and (b) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1029-0056. This information is 
being collected to meet the mandate of section 407 of the Act, which 
requires that a State/Indian tribe include in its reclamation plan 
assurances that the acquisition, management, and disposition of eligible 
lands and water for reclamation and other designated purposes will be 
accomplished in a manner prescribed by the Act. This information will be 
used by the regulatory authority to ensure that the State/Indian tribe 
has sufficient programmatic capability to acquire, manage, and dispose 
of land in the prescribed manner. The obligation to respond is 
mandatory.


<R05>
Sec. 879.11  Land eligible for acquisition.

    (a) Land adversely affected by past coal mining practices may be 
acquired by the OSM with moneys from the Fund, or by a State or Indian 
tribe if approved in advance by OSM. OSM shall find in writing that 
acquisition is necessary for successful reclamation and that--
    (1) The acquired land will serve recreation, historic, conservation, 
and reclamation purposes or provide open space benefits after 
restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the 
adverse effects of past coal mining practices; and
    (2) Permanent facilities will be constructed on the land for the 
restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the 
adverse effects of past coal mining practices.
    (b)(1) Coal refuse disposal sites and all coal refuse thereon may be 
acquired with moneys from the Fund by OSM or by a State or Indian tribe 
if approved in advance by OSM. Prior to the approval of the acquisition 
of such sites, the OSM, State, or Indian tribe shall find in writing 
that the acquisition of such land is necessary for successful

[[Page 430]]

reclamation and will serve the purposes of the Abandoned Mine Land 
Reclamation Program.
    (2) Where an emergency situation exists and a written finding as set 
out in Sec. 877.14 of this chapter has been made, OSM may use Fund 
moneys to acquire lands where public ownership is necessary to meet an 
emergency situation and prevent recurrence of the adverse effects of 
past coal mining practices.
    (c) Land adversely affected by past coal mining practices may be 
acquired by OSM if the acquisition with moneys from the Fund is an 
integral and necessary element of an economically feasible plan or 
project to construct or rehabilitate housing which meets the specific 
requirements set out in section 407(h) of the Act.
    (d) Land or interests in land needed to fill voids, seal abandoned 
tunnels, shafts, and entryways or reclaim surface impacts of underground 
or surface mines may be acquired by the OSM, State, or Indian tribe if 
OSM finds that acquisition is necessary under part 875 of this chapter.
    (e) The OSM, State, or Indian tribe which acquires land under this 
part shall acquire only such interests in the land as are necessary for 
the reclamation work planned or the postreclamation use of the land. 
Interests in improvements on the land, mineral rights, or associated 
water rights may be acquired if--
    (1) The customary practices and laws of the State in which the land 
is located will not allow severance of such interests from the surface 
estate; or
    (2) Such interests are necessary for the reclamation work planned or 
for the postreclamation use of the land; and
    (3) Adequate written assurances cannot be obtained from the owner of 
the severed interest that future use will not be in conflict with the 
reclamation to be accomplished.


<R05>
Sec. 879.12  Procedures for acquisition.

    (a) An appraisal of all land or interest in land to be acquired 
shall be obtained by the OSM, State, or Indian tribe. The appraisal 
shall state the fair market value of the land as adversely affected by 
past mining.
    (b) When practical, acquisition shall be by purchase from a willing 
seller. The amount paid for land or interests in land acquired shall 
reflect the fair market value of the land or interests in land as 
adversely affected by past mining.
    (c) When necessary, land or interests in land may be acquired by 
condemnation. Condemnation procedures shall not be started until all 
reasonable efforts have been made to purchase the land or interests in 
lands from a willing seller.
    (d) The OSM, State, or Indian tribe which acquires land under this 
part shall comply, at a minimum, with the Uniform Relocation Assistance 
and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. 4601, et 
seq., and 41 CFR part 114-50.


<R05>
Sec. 879.13  Acceptance of gifts of land.

land proposed for donation meets the requirements set out in Sec. 
879.11.
    (b) Offers to make a gift of land or interest in land to the U.S. 
Government shall be in writing and comply with U.S. Department of the 
Interior regulations for land donations. The States and Indian tribes 
may use procedures provided by applicable State or Indian tribal law.


<R05>
Sec. 879.14  Management of acquired land.

    Land acquired under this part may be used for any lawful purpose 
that is consistent with the necessary reclamation activities. Procedures 
for collection of user charges or the waiver of such charges by the OSM, 
State, or Indian tribe shall provide that all user fees collected shall 
be deposited in the appropriate Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 879.15  Disposition of reclaimed land.

    (a) Prior to the disposition of any land acquired under this part, 
OSM, State, or Indian tribe shall publish a notice of proposed land 
disposition, hold public hearings, if required, and make written 
findings in accordance with the authority contained in section 407(g)(2) 
of the Act.

[[Page 431]]

    (b) OSM may transfer administrative responsibility for land acquired 
by OSM to any Federal Department or Agency, with or without cost to that 
Department or Agency. OSM may transfer title for land acquired by OSM to 
any State or Indian tribe or to any agency or political subdivision of a 
State or Indian tribe, with or without cost to that entity, for the 
purposes set out in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section. The agreement 
under which a transfer is made shall specify--
    (1) The purposes for which the land may be used, which shall be 
consistent with the authorization under which the land was acquired; and
    (2) That the title of administrative responsibility for the land 
shall revert to OSM, State, or Indian tribe if, at any time in the 
future, OSM finds that the land is not used for the purposes specified.
    (c) OSM may accept title for abandoned and unreclaimed land to be 
reclaimed and administered by OSM. If a State or Indian tribe transfers 
land to OSM under this section, that State or Indian tribe shall have a 
preference right to purchase such land from OSM after reclamation is 
completed. The price to be paid by the State or Indian tribe shall be 
the fair market value of the land in its reclaimed condition less any 
portion of the land acquisition price paid by the State or Indian tribe.
    (d) OSM may sell land acquired and reclaimed under this part, except 
that acquired for housing under Sec. 879.11(c), to the State or local 
government at less than fair market value but in no case less than 
purchase price plus reclamation cost provided such land is used for a 
valid public purpose.
    (e) OSM may transfer or sell land acquired for housing under Sec. 
879.11(c), with or without monetary consideration, to any State or

    (2) A department, agency, or instrumentality of a State; or
    (3) Any public body or nonprofit organization designated by a State.
    (g)(1) OSM may sell or authorize the States or Indian tribes to sell 
land acquired under this part by public sale if--
    (i) Such land is suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, 
or recreational development;
    (ii) Such development is consistent with local, State, of Federal 
land use plans for the area in which the land is located; and
    (iii) Retention by OSM, State, or Indian tribe, or disposal under 
other paragraphs of this section is not in the public interest.
    (2) Disposal procedures will be in accordance with Section 407(g) of 
the Act and applicable State or Indian tribal requirements.
    (3) States may transfer title or administrative responsibility for 
land to cities, municipalities, or quasi-governmental bodies, provided 
that the State provide for the reverter of the title or administrative 
responsibility if the land is no longer used for the purposes originally 
proposed.
    (h) All moneys received from disposal of land under this part shall 
be deposited in the appropriate Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund in 
accordance with 30 CFR part 872 of this chapter.

than 20 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 881.6  Project contract.

    (a) Upon approval of the project by the Secretary, execution of the 
cooperative agreement, and receipt of an acceptable bid, the State shall 
carry out and execute the project through a project contract, or, if the 
work is to be done in phases, a series of project contracts, entered 
into by the State and its contractors or suppliers for the construction, 
installation, services or work to be performed.
    (b) Project contracts shall be entered into only with the lowest 
responsible bidder pursuant to suitable procedures for advertising and 
competitive bidding. The Government's obligation to contribute to the 
cost of a project, or a phase of a project, is limited to the estimated 
costs established in the cooperative agreement. If the bids on work to 
be done under a proposed project contract exceed the estimated cost of 
the work established in the cooperative agreement, the State should not 
enter into the project contract unless the cooperative agreement has 
been amended to provide for an increase in contributions sufficient to 
meet the increase in costs, or unless the State wishes to assume the 
excess cost of the project.
    (c) OSM shall be advised of the time and place of the opening of 
bids on a proposed project contract and may have a representative 
present.
    (d) If the State amends a project contract, or issues a change order 
thereunder, and the amendment or change order results in an expenditure 
under the project contract in excess of the estimated cost of the work 
established in the cooperative agreement, the Government shall be under 
no obligation to contribute to such excess costs unless the cooperative 
agreement has been amended to provide for an increase in contributions 
by the parties sufficient to meet such excess costs.
    (e) The State shall furnish the Director, in duplicate, a certified 
true executed copy of each project contract with related plans, 
specifications, and drawings annexed thereto, promptly upon its 
execution.
    (f) The State shall include in each project contract provisions to 
the effect that--
    (1) Regardless of any agreement between the State and the Government 
respecting contributions by the Government to the cost of the contract 
under the provisions of section 205(a)(1) of the Appalachian Regional 
Development Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 89-4, 79 Stat. 5), the Government shall 
not be considered to be a party to the contract or in any manner liable 
thereunder. Neither the Government nor any of its officers, agents, or 
employees shall be responsible for any loss, expense, damages to 
property, or injuries to persons, which

[[Page 437]]

may arise from or be incident to the use and occupation of any property 
affected by the operations contemplated under the project, or for 
damages to the property of the contractor, or for injuries to the person 
of the contractor, or for damages to the property, or injuries to the 
contractor's officers, agents, servants, or employees, or others who may 
be on said premises at their invitation or the invitation of any of 
them, and the State and the project contractor shall hold the Government 
and any of its officers, agents, or employees, harmless from all such 
claims.
    (2) The Secretary of the Interior or the Director of OSM or their 
authorized representative may enter upon and inspect the project at any 
reasonable time and may confer with the contractor and the State 
regarding the conduct of project operations.
    (3) All laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or 
subcontractors on the project shall be paid wages at rates not less than 
those prevailing on similar construction in the locality as determined 
by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act, as 
amended (40 U.S.C. 276a-276a-5). The Secretary of Labor shall have with 
respect to such labor standards, the authority and functions set forth 
in Reorganization Plan Number 14 of 1950 (15 FR 3176, 64 Stat. 1267, 5 
U.S.C. 133-133z-15), and section 2 of the Act of June 13, 1934, as 
amended (48 Stat. 948, as amended; 40 U.S.C. 276(c)).
    (4) To assure the use of local labor to the maximum extent 
practicable in the implementation of a project:
    (i) Every contractor or subcontractor undertaking to do work on the 
project which is or reasonably may be done as onsite work, in carrying 
out such contract work shall give preference to qualified persons who 
regularly reside in the labor area as designated by the U.S. Department 
of Labor wherein such project is situated, or the subregion, or the 
Appalachian counties of the State wherein such project is situated, 
except:
    (A) To the extent that qualified persons regularly residing in the 
area are not available;
    (B) For the reasonable needs of any such contractor or 
subcontractor, to employ supervisory or specially experienced 
individuals necessary to assure an efficient execution of the contract;
    (C) For the obligation of any such contractor or subcontractor to 
offer employment to present or former employees as the result of a 
lawful collective bargaining contract, provided that in no event shall 
the number of nonresident persons employed under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(C) 
exceed 20 percent of the total number of employees employed by such 
contractor and his subcontractors on such project.
    (ii) Every such contractor and subcontractor shall furnish the 
appropriate U.S. Employment Service offices with a list of all positions 
for which laborers, mechanics, and other employees may be required.
    (iii) Every such contractor and subcontractor shall furnish periodic 
reports to the contracting agency on the extent to which local labor has 
been used in carrying out the contract work.


<R05>
Sec. 881.7  Administration of contributions.

    (a) The Government's contribution to a State will be made only 
pursuant to a cooperative agreement and only upon the basis of payments 
made, or that are then due and payable, by the State under a project 
contract between the State and its contractor for the construction, 
installation, services or work performed on individual projects and 
shall not exceed 75 percent of such amounts.
    (b) The State shall submit to the Director, not more often than once 
a month and for each cooperative agreement, a separate voucher which 
describes each payment made or that is due and payable by the State 
under a project contract. The amounts claimed under each voucher shall 
be certified by the State as proper charges under the project contract, 
and the State shall also certify that the amounts have either been paid 
or are due and payable thereunder. Insofar as the Government's 
contribution payments related to amounts due and payable rather than 
amounts already paid, the State shall disburse such funds together with 
the funds contributed by the State, promptly upon receipt from the 
Government.

[[Page 438]]

    (c) The State shall maintain suitable records and accounts of its 
transactions with and payments to project contractors, and the 
Government may inspect and audit such accounts and records during normal 
business hours and as it may deem necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 881.8  Withholding of payments.

    Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for 
hearing, finds that there is a failure by the State to expend funds in 
accordance with the terms and conditions governing the Government's 
contribution for an approved project, he shall notify the State that 
further payments will not be made to the State from available 
appropriations until he is satisfied that there will no longer be any 
such failure. Until the Secretary is so satisfied, payment of any 
financial contribution to the State shall be withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 881.9  Reports.

    At such times and in such detail as the Secretary shall require, the 
State shall furnish to the Secretary a statement with respect to each 
project showing the work done, the status of the project, expenditures, 
and amounts obligated, and such other information as may be required.


<R05>
Sec. 881.10  Obligations of States or local authorities.

    (a) The State shall have full responsibility for installing, 
operating, and maintaining projects constructed pursuant to the 
regulations in this part.
    (b) The State shall give evidence, satisfactory to the Secretary, 
that it will enforce effective safeguards with respect to installation, 
operation, and maintenance.
    (c) The State shall agree that neither the Government nor any of its 
officers, agents, or employees shall be responsible for any loss, 
expense, damages to property, or injuries to persons, which may arise 
from or be incident to work upon, or to the use and occupation of any 
property affected by operations under, the project, and the State shall 
agree to hold the Government and its officers, agents, or employees 
harmless from all such claims.
    (d) In order to assure effective safeguards with respect to 
installation, operation, and maintenance, the State or local authority 
will be required to own (or control), the land, subsurface, or coal 
seams in instances such as the following:
    (1) If the objective of the project is to prevent or alleviate 
subsidence, the State or local authority shall have or acquire such 
subsurface and underground rights or interests in such coal seams or 
coal measures as may be required to assure the stability and continued 
existence of the project and to such an extent as will give reasonable 
assurance that the work will not be disturbed in the future.
    (2) If the objective of the project is to rehabilitate or reclaim 
strip-mined areas, the land shall be owned by the Federal, State, or 
local body of government. Such ownership shall comprise such mineral, 
subsurface and underground rights and interests as will assure that no 
further mining operations will be conducted upon or under the land in 
the future.
    (3) If the objective of the project is to seal abandoned open 
shafts, slopes, air holes and other mine openings to underground 
workings where public safety hazards exist, or to control or prevent 
erosion, water pollution, or discharge of harmful mine waters, the State 
shall have or acquire such right, title or interest in the lands as will 
assure the stability and continued existence of the project work.
    (4) The extent of ownership or control necessary shall be determined 
with respect to each individual project.
    (e) The State or local authorities, shall agree not to mine or 
permit the mining of coal or other minerals in the land or property 
owned or controlled by the State or local authorities, if required by 
OSM to assure the success or protection of the project work for such 
period of time as may be required by OSM.
    (f) Upon request of OSM, the State or local authority shall furnish 
and disclose the nature and extent of its right, title, or interest in 
lands within, or which may be affected by, the project and submit an 
analysis, in writing, of the title situation, the effectiveness, extent 
and strength of the title which

[[Page 439]]

has been acquired, and an opinion as to the protection which the 
documents conveying the various rights, titles, and interests in the 
land afford the project work and as to any defects in the title.
    (g) If necessary, State and local authorities shall procure the 
enactment of State or local laws or ordinances providing authority to 
participate in the work and projects conducted pursuant to the 
regulations in this part on lands owned by the State, the local 
authorities, or private persons, and the requisite authority to permit 
the State or local authorities to meet the obligations imposed by the 
regulations in this part or a cooperative agreement and to enter into 
project contracts of the kind and nature contemplated for the work to be 
performed.


<R05>
Sec. 881.11  Nondiscrimination.

<R05>
Sec. 882.1  Scope.

    This part authorizes reclamation on private land and establishes 
procedures for recovery of the cost of reclamation activities conducted 
on privately owned land by the OSM, State, or Indian tribe.


<R05>
Sec. 882.10  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements contained in Sec. Sec. 
882.12(c) and 882.13(b) were approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1029-0057. 
This information is being collected to meet the mandate of Secion 408 of 
the Act, which allows the State/Indian tribe to file liens on private 
property that has been reclaimed under certain conditions. This 
information will be used by the regulatory authority to ensure that the 
State/Indian tribe has sufficient programmatic capability to file liens. 
The obligation to respond is mandatory.


<R05>
Sec. 882.12  Appraisals.

    (a) A notarized appraisal of private land to be reclaimed which may 
be subject to a lien under Sec. 882.13 shall be obtained from an 
independent appraiser. The appraisal shall state--
    (1) The estimated market value of the property in its unreclaimed 
condition; and
    (2) The estimated market value of the property as reclaimed.
    (b) This appraisal shall be made prior to start of reclamation 
activities. The agency shall furnish to the appraiser information of 
sufficient detail in the from of plans, factual data, specifications, 
etc., to make such appraisals. When reclamation requires more than 6 
months to complete, an updated appraisal under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section shall be made to determine if the increase in value as 
originally appraised has actually occurred. Such updated appraisal shall 
not include any

[[Page 440]]

increase in value of the land as unreclaimed. If the updated appraised 
value results in lower increase in value, such increase shall be used as 
a basis for the lien. However, an increase in value resulting from the 
updated appraisal shall not be considered in determining a lien. OSM 
shall provide appraisal standards for Federal projects, and the State or 
Indian tribes shall provide appraisal standards for State or Indian 
tribal projects consistent with generally acceptable appraisal practice.


<R05>
Sec. 882.13  Liens.

    (a) OSM, State, or Indian tribe has the discretionary authority to 
place or waive a lien against land reclaimed if the reclamation results 
in a significant increase in the fair market value; except that--
    (1) A lien shall not be placed against the property of a surface 
owner who acquired title prior to May 2, 1977, and who did not consent 
to, participate in, or exercise control over the mining operation which 
necessitated the reclamation work.
    (2) The basis for making a determination of what constitutes a 
significant increase in market value or what factual situation 
constitutes a waiver of lien will be made by OSM, State, or Indian tribe 
pursuant to the Congressional intent expressed in Section 408 of the Act 
and consistent with State or Indian tribal laws governing liens.
    (3) A lien may be waived if findings made prior to construction 
indicate that the reclamation work to be performed on private land shall 
primarily benefit the health, safety, or environmental values of the 
greater community or area in which the land is located; or if the 
reclamation is necessitated by an unforeseen occurrence, and the work 
performed to restore that land will not result in a significant increase 
in the market value of the land as it existed immediately before the 
unforeseen occurrence; and
    (4) OSM, State, or Indian tribe may waive the lien if the cost of 
filing it, including indirect costs to OSM, State, or Indian tribe, 
exceeds the increase in fair market value as a result of reclamation 
activities.
    (b) If a lien is to be filed, the OSM, State, or Indian tribe shall, 
within 6 months after the completion of the reclamation work, file a 
statement in the office having responsibility under applicable law for 
recording judgments and placing liens against land. Such statement shall 
consist of notarized copies of the appraisals obtained under Sec. 
882.12 and may include an account of moneys expended for the reclamation 
work. The amount reported to be the increase in value of the property 
shall constitute the lien to be recorded in compliance with existing 
Federal, State or Indian tribal laws: Provided, however, That prior to 
the time of the actual filing of the proposed lien, the landowner shall 
be notified of the amount of the proposed lien and shall be allowed a 
reasonable time to prepay that amount instead of allowing the lien to be 
filed against the property involved.
    (c) Within 60 days after the lien is filed the landowner may 
petition under local law to determine the increase in market value of 
the land as a result of reclamation work. Any aggrieved party may appeal 
in the manner provided by local law.


<R05>
Sec. 882.14  Satisfaction of liens.

    (a) A lien placed on private property shall be satisfied, to the 
extent of the value of the consideration received, at the time of 
transfer of ownership. Any unsatisfied portion shall remain as a lien on 
the property.
    (b) The OSM, State, or Indian tribe which files a lien on private 
property shall maintain or renew it from time to time as may be required 
under State or local law.
    (c) Moneys derived from the satisfaction of liens established under 
this part shall be deposited in the appropriate abandoned mine 
reclamation fund account.

part. This paragraph does not apply to Indian tribes who receive 
reclamation funds without having an approved regulatory program.
    (4) If an agency is not in compliance with the following 
nondiscrimination provisions, OSM shall terminate the grant:
    (i) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88-352, 78 
Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-1). ``Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted 
Programs'', which provides that no person in the United States shall on 
the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from

required by Sec. 884.15, OSM may reduce, suspend, or terminate all 
existing AML grants in whole or in part or may refuse to process all 
future grant applications.
    (b) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, OSM may take one or more 
the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the

OSM official delegated grant signature authority shall give the agency 
at least 30 days written notice of intent to reduce, suspend, or 
terminate a grant. OSM must send this notice by certified mail, return 
receipt requested. OSM shall include in the notice the reasons for the 
proposed action and the proposed effective date of the action.

notify the agency of the termination, suspension, or reduction of the 
grant in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (4) Upon termination, the agency shall refund or credit to the Fund 
that remaining portion of the grant money not encumbered. However, the 
agency shall retain any portion of the grant that is required to meet 
contractual commitments made before the effective date of termination.
    (5) Upon receiving notification of OSM's intent to terminate the 
grant, the agency shall not make any new commitments without OSM's 
approval.
    (6) OSM may allow termination costs as determined by applicable 
Federal

[[Page 447]]

cost principles listed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87.
    (7) Either OSM or the agency may terminate or reduce a grant if both 
parties agree that continuing the program would not produce beneficial 
results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. Such a 
termination for convenience shall be handled as an amendment and shall 
be signed by the OSM official delegated grant signature authority.
    (d) Appeals. (1) Within 30 days of OSM's decision to reduce, 
suspend, or terminate a grant, the agency may appeal the decision to the 
Director.
    (i) The agency shall include in the appeal a statement of the 
decision being appealed and the facts that the agency believes justify a 
reversal or modification of the decision.

Sec. 887.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Establishment--means either the development of a subsidence 
insurance program or the administration or operation of a subsidence 
insurance program.
    Private property--means any or all of the following: dwellings and 
improvements, commercial and industrial structures, utilities, 
underground structures such as sewers, pipes, wells and septic systems, 
sidewalks and driveways, and land.
    Self-sustaining--means maintaining an insurance rate structure which 
is designed to be actuarially sound. Self-sustaining requires that State 
subsidence insurance programs provide for recovery of payments made in 
settlement for damages from any party responsible for the damages under 
the law of the State. Actuarial soundness implies that funds are 
sufficient to cover expected losses and expenses including a reasonable 
allowance for underwriting services and contingencies. Self-sustaining 
shall not preclude the use of funds from other non-Federal sources.
    State Administered--means administered either directly by a State 
agency

operations or coal exploration activities on non-Federal, non-Indian 
lands must have either an approved State program or a promulgated 
Federal program as required by Title V of the Act and 30 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. Approval of a State program and promulgation of a 
Federal program are described in the paragraphs below.
    (b) Under section 503 of the Act and 30 CFR parts 730, 731 and 732 a 
State in which there are coal exploration activities or surface mining 
and reclamation operations must submit a State program to the Secretary 
for approval if it wishes to assume exclusive regulatory jurisdiction on 
non-Federal and non-Indian lands within its borders. The State programs 
must meet the requirements of the Act and 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter 
C.
    (c) Pursuant to section 504 of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.11, OSM must 
promulgate and implement a Federal program in each State in which the 
Director reasonably expects coal exploration or surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations to exist on non-Federal and non-Indian lands at 
any time before June, 1985, and either: (1) The State does not submit a 
State program, (2) the Secretary of the Interior finally disapproves the 
program submitted by the State, or (3) the Secretary of the Interior 
withdraws approval of the State program.
    (d) Under section 405 of SMCRA and 30 CFR part 884, each State 
having within its borders coal mined lands eligible for reclamation 
under Title IV of SMCRA, may submit to the Secretary a State Reclamation 
Plan, demonstrating its capability for administering an abandoned mine 
reclamation program. Title IV provides that the Secretary may approve 
the plan once the State has an approved regulatory program under Title V 
of SMCRA. If the Secretary determines that a State has developed and 
submitted a program for reclamation and has the necessary State 
legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV, the Secretary shall 
grant the State exclusive responsibility and authority to implement the 
provisions of the approved plan. Section 405 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1235) 
contains the requirements for State reclamation plans.
    (e) States with approved programs may enter into cooperative 
agreements with OSM in order to become the regulatory authority for coal 
mining on Federal lands, in accordance with 30 CFR chapter VII, 
subchapter D.

[62 FR 9934, Mar. 5, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 901.30  State-Federal cooperative agreement.

    The Governor of the State of Alabama and the Secretary of the 
Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative 
Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

        Article I: Introduction, Purpose and Responsible Agencies

    A. Authority: This agreement is authorized by sectoin 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the Act), 30 U.S.C. 
1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program 
approved by the Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into 
an Agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State 
regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Alabama 
subject to the Federal lands program (30 CFR parts 740-746), consistent 
with State and Federal Acts governing such activities, and the Alabama 
State Program (Program).
    B. Purpose: The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster 
Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and 
duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the 
Program on all lands in Alabama in accordance with the Act, the Program, 
and this Agreement.
    C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Alabama Surface Mining 
Commission (ASMC) shall be responsible for administering this Agreement 
on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining (OSM) shall 
administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After it has been signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this 
Agreement shall be effective 30 days after publication in the Federal 
Register as a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until 
terminated as provided in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
the Act, 30 CFR 700, 701, and 740, the approved State Program and the 
State Act, and in the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to 
those Acts, shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. 
Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal 
definitions, the definitions used in the approved State Program will 
apply, except

[[Page 455]]

in the case of a term which defines the Secretary's continuing 
responsibilities under the Act and other laws.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    In accordance with the Federal lands program in 30 CFR part 745, the 
laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to 
lands in Alabama subject to the Federal lands program except as 
otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Act, 30 CFR 745.13, or other 
applicable laws or regulations.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
the provisions of this Agreement.
    A. Authority of State Agency: ASMC has and shall continue to have 
the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    B. Funds: Upon application by ASMC and subject to appropriations, 
OSM shall provide the State with the funds to defray the costs 
associated with carrying out responsibilities under this Agreement as 
provided in section 705(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds 
shall cover the full cost of carrying out these responsibilities 
provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal 
government would have expended in regulating surface coal mining 
operations on Federal lands in Alabama in the absence of an agreement. 
If the State requests funds and sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSM, OSM and the ASMC shall promptly meet to decide on 
appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations are 
regulated in accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be 
reached, then either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance 
with 30 CFR 745.15. Funds provided to the State under this Agreement 
shall be adjusted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-102, Attachment E.
    C. Reports and Records: ASMC shall make annual reports to OSM 
containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this 
Agreement, pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, ASMC and OSM 
shall exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where 
prohibited by Federal law.
    OSM shall provide ASMC with a copy of any final evaluation report 
prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement.
    D. Personnel: ASMC shall have the necessary personnel to fully 
implement this agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
and the approved State Program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: ASMC will assure itself access to 
equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, 
investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are 
necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
    F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the 
fee accompanying an application for a permit shall be determined in 
accordance with Section 15 of the Alabama Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1981, Section 880-X-8B-.07 of the State regulations, 
and the applicable provisions of the State Program and Federal law. All 
permit fees and civil penalties collected from operations on Federal 
lands will be retained by the State and shall be deposited with the 
State Treasurer in the Alabama Surface Mining Fund. The financial status 
report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include the amount of 
fees collected during the prior State fiscal year.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

    A. Submission of Permit Application Package: ASMC and the Secretary 
shall require an operator proposing to conduct surface coal mining 
operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a permit 
application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to ASMC. 
ASMC shall furnish OSM with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. 
The PAP shall be in the form required by ASMC and include any 
supplemental information required by OSM or the Federal land management 
agency. At a minimum, the PAP shall include the information necessary 
for ASMC to make a determination of compliance with the State Program 
and for the appropriate Federal agency to make a determination of 
compliance with applicable requirements of Federal laws and regulations 
for which it is responsible.
    B. Review Procedures Where Leased Federally-Owned Coal Is Not 
Involved:
    1. ASMC shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review 
and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the 
PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations under the Federal lands program in Alabama not requiring a 
mining plan under 30 CFR 746.11. ASMC shall be the primary point of 
contact for operators regarding decisions on the PAP and will be 
responsible for informing the applicant of determinations.
    2. Upon receipt of a PAP that involves surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands not containing leased Federal 
coal, ASMC shall (1) transmit a copy of the complete PAP to the Federal 
land management agency with a request for review pursuant to 30 CFR 
740.13(c)(4), and (2) provide OSM with a complete copy of the PAP and 
any additional information necessary to allow OSM to determine whether 
the operations are prohibited or limited by the requirements of section 
522(e) (1) or (2) of the

[[Page 456]]

Federal Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR part 761 with respect to 
areas designated therein by Congress as unsuitable for mining. Except as 
specified by paragraph 5 of this article, ASMC shall be responsible for 
obtaining, in a timely manner, the views and determinations of any other 
Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands 
affected by a PAP in Alabama.
    3. OSM will provide technical assistance to ASMC when requested if 
available resources allow and will process requests for determinations 
of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761 
relating to areas designated by Congress under section 522(e)(1) or (2) 
as unsuitable for mining. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any 
information OSM receives from an applicant is promptly sent to ASMC. OSM 
shall have access to ASMC files concerning mines on Federal lands. The 
Secretary reserves the right to act independently of ASMC to carry out 
his responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act. A copy of 
all resulting correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing 
on decisions regarding the PAP shall be sent to the State.
    4. ASMC shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program.
    5. Prior to making a decision on a PAP for proposed surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations for which there is no other concurrent 
Secretarial action that would trigger compliance with Section 7 of the 
Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1536, ASMC shall obtain the written 
concurrence of OSM regarding the effect the proposed operations would 
have on threatened and endangered species and critical habitat in the 
area affected by the proposed operations, and shall include in any 
permit that is issued for such operations any terms or conditions which 
OSM may require to avoid the likelihood of actions which would 
jeopardize the continued existence of any such species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat.
    6. The permit issued by ASMC shall incorporate any terms or 
conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including 
conditions relating to post-mining land use, and shall condition the 
initiation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency. 
After issuing the decision on the PAP, ASMC shall send a notice to the 
applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSM with a copy of 
the permit and written findings.
    C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federally-Owned Coal is Involved:
    1. ASMC shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review 
and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the 
PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands 
in Alabama where a mining plan is required by 30 CFR 746.11. OSM, as 
requested, shall assist the State in this analysis and review. The 
Department of the Interior (Department) shall concurrently carry out its 
responsibilities under the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other applicable Federal laws that 
cannot be delegated to the State. The Department shall carry out these 
responsibilities in accordance with the Federal lands program and this 
Agreement in a timely manner so as to avoid, to the extent possible, 
duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this 
Agreement and the Program. Responsibilities and decisions which can be 
delegated to the State under other applicable Federal laws may be 
specified in working agreements between OSM and the State without 
amendment to this Agreement. The Secretary will consider the information 
in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required by the 
Federal Act, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
    2. ASMC will be the primary point of contact for operators regarding 
the review of the PAP, except on matters concerned exclusively with 43 
CFR parts 3480-3487, administered by the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM). ASMC will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint 
State-Federal determinations. The Secretary may act independently of the 
State to carry out responsibilities under laws other than the Federal 
Act or provisions of the Act not covered by the Program, and in 
instances of disagreement over the Act and the Federal lands program. 
ASMC shall send to OSM, copies of any correspondence with the applicant 
and any information received from the applicant regarding the mining 
plan including the operation and reclamation plan portion of the permit 
application. OSM shall send to ASMC copies of all independent 
correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. 
As a matter of practice, OSM will not independently initiate contacts 
with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with 
respect to matters covered by the Program.
    3. ASMC shall assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) 
(1), (2), (4), (5), and (6). OSM shall retain the responsibilities 
listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(3) and the exceptions specified in (c)(7) (i) 
through (vii). OSM shall assist the State in carrying out its 
responsibilities by:
    (a) Distributing copies of the PAP to, and coordinating the review 
of the PAP among, all Federal agencies which have responsibilities 
relating to decisions on the PAP. This shall be done in a manner which 
ensures timely identification, communication and resolution of issues 
relating to those Federal agencies' statutory requirements. OSM shall 
request that such other Federal agencies furnish their findings and any 
requests for

[[Page 457]]

additonal data to OSM within 45 calendar days of their receipt of the 
PAP.
    (b) Providing ASMC with the analyses and conclusions of other 
Federal agencies.
    (c) Addressing conflicts and difficulties of the other Federal 
agencies in a timely manner.
    (d) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings as necessary between 
State and Federal agencies.
    (e) Where OSM is assisting ASMC in reviewing the permit application, 
furnish the State with the work product within 45 calendar days of 
receipt of the State's request for such assistance, or earlier if 
mutually agreed upon by OSM and the State.
    (f) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner as set forth 
in a mutually agreed upon schedule, governed to the extent possible by 
the deadlines established in the Program.
    (g) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any 
Federal lessee protection bond requirement.
    4. Review of the PAP:
    (a) OSM and ASMC shall coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. ASMC shall keep OSM informed of findings during the 
review process which bear on the responsibilities of other Federal 
agencies. OSM shall ensure that any information OSM receives which has a 
bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to ASMC.
    (b) The State shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program.
    (c) OSM shall review the PAP for compliance with the Act and the 
requirements of other Federal laws and regulations. OSM and ASMC shall 
develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each shall identify 
a person as the project leader. The OSM project leader shall serve as 
the primary point of contact between OSM and ASMC throughout the review 
process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of the PAP, OSM shall 
furnish ASMC with its preliminary findings on the PAP and specify any 
requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, the State 
shall provide OSM all available information that may aid OSM in 
preparing any findings.
    (d) ASMC shall provide to OSM written findings indicating whether 
the PAP is in compliance with the Program, and a technical analysis of 
the PAP.
    (e) ASMC may proceed to issue a permit in accordance with the 
Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, 
provided that ASMC advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial 
approval of a mining plan must be obtained before the operator may 
conduct surface coal mining operations on Federal lands. ASMC shall 
reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the approved 
permit to conform with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary 
in his approval of the mining plan.
    5. Prior to acting on a permit revision or renewal, ASMC shall 
consult with OSM on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a 
mining plan modification under 30 CFR 746.18. OSM shall inform the State 
within 30 days of receiving notice of a proposed revision or renewal, 
whether any permit revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan 
modification. Permit revisions which do not constitute mining plan 
modifications shall be approved solely by the State.
    OSM may establish criteria consistent with 30 CFR 746.18 to 
determine which permit revisions and renewals clearly do not constitute 
mining plan modifications. If such criteria are promulgated, revisions 
or renewals which do not constitute mining plan modifications in 
accordance with the criteria may be approved by ASMC before it submits 
copies of the revision or renewal to OSM.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. ASMC shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare and 
file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
    B. ASMC shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on a 
timely basis, file with OSM a legible copy of the completed State 
inspection report.
    C. ASMC shall be the point of contact and primary inspection 
authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and 
compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as 
described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent 
inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other 
than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any 
inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its 
obligations under laws other than the Act.
    D. OSM shall ordinarily give the ASMC reasonable notice of its 
intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide 
State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM 
is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public 
health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to 
land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it 
will contact ASMC no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, 
if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All 
citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or 
significant imminent environmental harm shall be referred to ASMC for 
action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without 
prior notice to ASMC to carry out his responsibilities under the Federal 
Act.

[[Page 458]]

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. ASMC shall have primary enforcement authority under the Act 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
Program. Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other laws 
and orders, including but not limited to those listed in Appendix A, is 
reserved to the Secretary.
    B. During any joint inspection by OSM and ASMC, ASMC shall have 
primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of 
orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. 
The ASMC shall inform OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend 
or revoke a permit.
    C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection 
where the ASMC and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any 
particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement 
actions shall be based on the standards in the approved Program, the 
Act, or both, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system 
contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
    D. The ASMC and the Department shall promptly notify each other of 
all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved 
mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with 
respect to such violations.
    E. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department 
shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions 
taken by either party.
    F. This Agreement does not limit the Department's authority to 
enforce violations of Federal law which establish standards and 
requirements which are authorized by laws other than the Act.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. ASMC and the Secretary shall require each operator covered by the 
Federal lands program to submit a single performance bond payable to 
Alabama and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities 
under the Federal Act and the Program. Such performance bond shall be 
conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Federal Act, 
the Program and any other requirements imposed by the Department or the 
Federal land management agency. Such bond shall provide that if this 
Agreement is terminated, the bond shall be payable only to the United 
States to the extent that lands covered by the Federal lands program are 
involved.
    B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such 
bond, the ASMC shall obtain the concurrence of OSM. The ASMC shall also 
advise OSM of annual adjustment to the performance bond, pursuant to the 
Program. Departmental concurrence shall include coordination with other 
Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.
    Such bond shall be subject to forfeiture with the consent of OSM, in 
accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.
    C. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the 
requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 30 CFR Subpart 3474 or 
lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in 
certain circumstances, by Section 715 of the Act.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
                     Surface Coal Mining Operations

    A. When either ASMC or OSM receives a petition to designate lands 
areas unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining 
operations that could impact adjacent Federal and non-Federal lands, the 
agency receiving the petition shall (1) notify the other of receipt and 
the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision; and (2) request and 
fully consider data, information and views of the other.
    B. Authority to designate State and private lands as unsuitable for 
mining is reserved to the State. Authority to designate Federal lands as

Sec. 903.700  Arizona Federal program.

    (a) This part establishes a Federal program under the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) and applies to all coal 
exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in 
Arizona conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. To the extent 
required by 30 CFR Part 740, this part also applies to surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Arizona.
    (b) Some rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program rules in this chapter. The full text of a cross-
referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the 
relevant section of the Arizona Federal program.
    (c) The following provisions of Arizona law generally provide for 
more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of 
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the 
regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of 
the Act, OSM will not generally construe such laws to be inconsistent 
with the Act, unless in a particular instance OSM determines that the 
rules in this chapter establish

[[Page 464]]

more stringent environmental or land use controls:
    (1) The Arizona Department of Agriculture has authority to abate 
public nuisances, including noxious weeds and noxious weed seeds, under 
A.R.S. Section 3-231 to 3-242. Violation of this statute is a 
misdemeanor.
    (2) It is unlawful to injure any bird or harass any bird upon its 
nest or remove the nests or eggs of any bird without prior authorization 
of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. A.R.S. Section 17-236.
    (3) A bridge, dam, dike or causeway may not be constructed over or 
in a navigable river or other navigable water without the authorization 
of the Governor. A.R.S. Section 18-301.
    (4) The Department of Mineral Resources has jurisdiction over the 
mining of minerals, and oil and gas under Title 27 of the Arizona 
Revised Statutes. One of the functions of that Department is the 
prevention and elimination of hazardous dust conditions. A.R.S. Section 
27-128. Violation of orders of State mine inspectors respecting dust 
prevention and control is a misdemeanor.
    (5) Roads leading into waste dump areas and tailing areas from 
inhabited or public areas are required to be blocked off and warning 
signs posted on the perimeter of such areas. A.R.S. Section 27-317.
    (6) The primary responsibility for the control and abatement of air 
pollution rests with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and 
its Hearing Board. The Department is responsible for the establishment 
and enforcement of air pollution emission standards and ambient air 
quality standards as a part of a comprehensive air quality plan for 
Arizona. A.R.S. Title 49.
    (7) The Arizona Department of Water Resources has jurisdiction over 
State water, including ``surface waters.'' ``Surface waters'' means 
``the waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or 
other natural channels, or in definite underground channels, whether 
perennial or intermittent, flood, waste or surplus water, and of lakes, 
ponds and springs on the surface. For the purposes of administering this 
title, surface water is deemed to include Central Arizona Project 
Water.'' A.R.S. Section 45-101. It is a misdemeanor to knowingly use the 
water of another, or divert water from a stream, waste water or obstruct 
water flowing into a water work. A.R.S. Section 45-112. Possession of 
water lawfully denied to the possessor is prima facie evidence of one's 
guilt. A.R.S. Section 45-112. If water is to be used for mining purposes 
the water rights may be severed from the land rights and transferred 
separately. The separation and transference of water rights is subject 
to numerous limitations, under A.R.S. Section 45-172.
    (8) Dams are defined as ``any artificial barrier, including 
appurtenant works for the impounding or diversion of water except those 
barriers for the purpose of controlling liquid borne material, twenty-
five feet or more in height or the storage capacity of which will be 
more than fifty acre feet, but does not include any such barrier which 
is or will be less than six feet in height, regardless of storage 
capacity, or which has or will have a storage capacity not in excess of 
fifteen acre feet, regardless of height.'' A.R.S. Section 45-701. The 
construction, operation, repair or alteration of any dam without the 
prior approval of the Director of Water Resources is a misdemeanor. 
A.R.S. Section 45-702 to Section 45-716.
    (d) Any Arizona law or regulation which may be found to interfere 
with the purposes and achievements of the Act, shall be preempted and 
superseded to the extent that the State law or regulation is 
inconsistent with, or precludes implementation of, requirements of the 
Act or this chapter under the Federal program for Arizona. The Director 
shall publish a notice to that effect in the Federal Register following 
the procedures set forth in Sec. 730.11(a) of this chapter.
    (e) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3501 in its approval of the information collection requirements 
contained in the permanent regulatory program.

Sec. 905.700  California Federal Program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in California which have been adopted under the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.

[[Page 474]]

    (b) Certain of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent 
parts of the permanent program regulations in this Chapter. The full 
text of a cross-referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited 
under the relevant section of the California Federal program.
    (c) This part applies to all coal exploration and surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations in California conducted on non-Federal 
and non-Indian lands. To the extent required by 30 CFR part 740, this 
part also applies to operations on Federal lands in California.
    (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
44 U.S.C. 3507 in its approval of the information collection 
requirements contained in the permanent regulatory program.
    (e) The following provisions of California law generally provide for 
more stringent land use and environmental control and regulation of some 
aspects of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the regulations 
in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA, these 
provisions shall not generally be considered to be inconsistent with 
SMCRA unless, in a particular instance, the Federal program regulations 
establish more stringent environmental or land use controls:
    (1) The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code 
section 21000 et seq. (West 1986).
    (2) The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, Cal. Water Code 
section 13000 et seq. (West 1971).
    (3) California Hazardous Waste Control Law, Cal. Health & Safety 
Code section 25100 et seq. (West 1984).
    (4) The State Underground Storage of Hazardous Substances Law, Cal. 
Health & Safety Code section 25280 et seq. (West 1984).
    (5) California Coastal Act of 1976, Cal. Pub. Res. Code Section 
30000 et seq. (West 1986).
    (6) The Z'berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973, Cal. Pub. Res. 
Code section 4511 et seq. (West 1984).
    (7) Cal. Pub. Res. Code section 4656 (West 1984), requiring a permit 
for mining in State forests.
    (f) The following are the California laws that generally interfere 
with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of SMCRA and are, 
in accordance with section 504(g) of SMCRA, preempted and superseded. 
Other California laws may in an individual situation interfere with the 
purposes and achievements of SMCRA and may be preempted and superseded 
with respect to the performance standards of Sec. Sec. 905.815 through 
905.828 as they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining 
operation by publication of a notice to that effect in the Federal 
Register.
    (1) The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975, Cal. 
Pub. Res. Code section 2710 et seq. (West 1984), as it relates to coal 
mining, except to the extent that it regulates other activities that are 
not regulated by SMCRA.
    (2) Cal. Labor Code section 7990 et seq. (West Supp. 1988) 
(licensing of blasters), except as it applies to other activities that 
are not regulated by SMCRA.
    (3) California Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery Act of 
1972, Cal. Gov. Code section 66770 et seq. (West 1983), except to the 
extent that it regulates other activities that are not regulated by 
SMCRA.

<R05>
Sec. 906.30  State-Federal cooperative agreement.

    The Governor of the State of Colorado, acting through the Mined Land 
Reclamation Division (MLRD), and the Secretary of the Department of the 
Interior, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Energy and 
Minerals, and the Office of Surface Mining (OSM), enter into a 
Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows.

                   Article I: Introduction and Purpose

    1. This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which 
allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the 
Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for 
the regulation and control of surface coal mining operations on Federal 
lands.
    This Agreement provides for State regulation, consistent with the 
Act, the Federal lands program (30 CFR part 745) and the Colorado State 
Program (Program) for surface coal mining and reclamation operations, on 
Federal lands.
    2. The purpose of this Agreement is to (a) foster Federal-State 
cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining; (b) eliminate 
intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and 
effective application of the Program on all non-Indian lands in 
Colorado, in accordance with the Act and the Program.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    3. After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, the 
Agreement shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register as 
a final rule.
    This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided 
in Article XI.

                           Article III: Scope

    4. Under this Agreement, the laws, regulations, terms, and 
conditions of the Program conditionally approved effective December 15, 
1980, 30 CFR part 906, or as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30 
CFR 732.17, for the administration of the Act, are applicable to Federal 
lands within the State except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the 
Act, 30 CFR 745.13, or other applicable laws.
    Orders and decisions issued by MLRD in accordance with the State 
Program that are

[[Page 484]]

appealable, shall be appealed to the State reviewing authority. Orders 
and decisions issued by the Department that are appealable, shall be 
appealed to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and 
Appeals.

                 Article IV: Requirements for Agreement

    5. The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with 
all of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all 
the conditions and requirements specified in this Article.

collected during the prior State fiscal year.

                         Article V: Definitions

    6. Terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in the 
Act, 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740 and as defined in the Program shall 
be given the meaning set forth in said definitions. Where there is a 
conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the 
definitions used in the approved State Program will apply, except in the 
case of a term which defines the Secretary's continuing responsibilities 
under the Act and other laws.

 Article VI: Policies and Procedures: Review of a Permit Application To 
Conduct Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations or an Application 
                 for a Permit Revision or Permit Renewal

    7. The MLRD and the Director shall require an operator on Federal 
lands to submit a permit application package or an application for a 
permit revision or renewal in an appropriate number of copies to the 
MLRD and OSM. Any documentation or information prepared by the operator 
for the sole purpose of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 
7(c) of the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) will be submitted directly to the 
Minerals Management Service (MMS). If such documentation is submitted as 
part of a permit application, a copy of the entire package will be 
forwarded to the MMS by OSM.
    The permit application package or application for a permit revision 
or renewal shall be in the format required by the MLRD and include any 
supplemental information required by the Department. The permit 
application package or application for a permit revision or renewal 
shall satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 741.12(b) and 30 CFR 741.13, 
and include the information required by, or necessary for, the MLRD and 
the Department to make a determination of compliance with:
    (a) Section 34-33-101, et seq., CRS 1973, as amended;
    (b) Regulations of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board for 
Coal Mining;
    (c) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease;

[[Page 485]]

    (d) Applicable requirements of the MMS's 30 CFR part 211 regulations 
pertaining to the Mineral Leasing Act requirements unless previously 
submitted to the MMS; and
    (e) Applicable requirements of the approved Program and other 
Federal laws including, but not limited to, those identified in 30 CFR 
Chapter VII, Subchapter D, and Appendix A of this Agreement.
    8. The MLRD shall assume primary responsibility pursuant to sections 
510(a) and 523(c) of the Act for the analysis, review, and approval of 
the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal 
according to the standards of the approved Program. The Director shall 
assist the MLRD in the analysis of the permit application or application 
for a permit revision or renewal and coordinate with the other 
appropriate Federal agencies as specified by the Secretary according to 
the procedures set forth in Appendix B. The Department shall 
concurrently carry out its responsibilities which cannot be delegated to 
the State under the MLA, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and 
other public laws (including, but not limited to, those in Appendix A) 
according to the procedures set forth in Appendix B so as, to the 
maximum extent possible, not to duplicate the responsibilities of the 
State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary 
shall consider the information submitted in the permit application 
package and, when appropriate, make the decisions required by the Act, 
MLA, NEPA and other public laws as described above.
    9. As a matter of practice the Department will not independently 
initiate contacts with the applicant regarding permit application 
packages or applications for permit revisions or renewals. However, the 
Department reserves the right to act independently of the MLRD to carry 
out its statutory responsibilities under the Act, MLA, NEPA and other 
public laws provided, however, that the Department shall send copies of 
all relevant correspondence to the MLRD.
    10. The MLRD shall maintain a file of all original correspondence 
with the applicant and any information received from the applicant which 
may have a bearing on decisions regarding the permit application or 
application for a permit revision or renewal.
    11. OSM shall have access to MLRD files for mines on Federal lands. 
MLRD will provide OSM copies of information OSM deems necessary.
    12. To the fullest extent allowed by State and Federal law, the 
Director and MLRD shall cooperate so that duplication will be eliminated 
in conducting the review and analysis of the permit application package 
or application for a permit revision or renewal.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    13. The MLRD shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare 
and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
    14. The MLRD shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on 
a timely basis, file with the Director a copy of each inspection report. 
Such report shall adequately describe (1) the general conditions of the 
lands under the permit; (2) the manner in which the operations are being 
conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable 
performance and reclamation requirements.
    15. The MLRD will be the point of contact and primary inspection 
authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and 
compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as 
described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Federal 
inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other 
than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any 
inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 743, as part 
743 relates to obligations under laws other than the Act.
    16. OSM shall ordinarily give the MLRD reasonable notice of its 
intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide 
State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM 
is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public 
health and safety or significant, imminent environmental harm to land, 
air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1(ii)(C), it will 
contact MLRD no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if 
practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen 
complaints which do not involve an imminent danger shall be referred to 
MLRD for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections 
without prior notice to MLRD to carry out his responsibilities under the 
Federal Act.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    17. MLRD shall be the primary enforcement authority under the Act 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
Program. Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other laws 
and orders including, but not limited to, those listed in Appendix A is 
reserved to the Secretary.
    18. During any joint inspection by OSM and MLRD, MLRD shall have 
primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of 
orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. 
The MLRD shall consult OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend 
or revoke a permit.
    19. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection 
where the

[[Page 486]]

MLRD and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular 
enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to 
comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be 
based on the performance standards included in the regulations of the 
approved Program, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty 
system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
    20. The MLRD and the Department shall promptly notify each other of 
all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved 
mining permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with 
respect to such violations.
    21. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department 
shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions 
taken by either party.
    22. This Agreement does not limit the Department's authority to 
enforce violations of Federal law which establish standards and 
requirements which are authorized by laws other than the Act.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    23. For all surface coal mining operations on Federal lands, the 
MLRD and the Secretary shall require each operator to submit a single 
performance bond payable to the State and to the United States, if 
required by Federal regulations, to cover the operator's 
responsibilities under the Act and the Program. Such performance bond 
shall be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, 
the Program and any other requirements imposed by the Department under 
the MLA, as amended. If the Agreement is terminated, all bonds will 
revert to being payable only to the United States to the extent that 
Federal lands are involved. Submission of a performance bond does not 
satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 30 CFR 
Subpart 3473 or a lessee protection bond required in addition to a 
performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.
    24. Prior to releasing the operator from an obligation under a 
performance bond required by the Program, the MLRD shall obtain the 
concurrence of OSM. the MLRD shall also advise OSM of annual adjustments 
to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program. Departmental 
concurrence shall include coordination with other Federal agencies 
having authority over the lands involved.
    25. The operator's performance bond shall be subject to forfeiture 
with the consent of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and 
requirements of the Program.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
                     Surface Coal Mining Operations

    26. The MLRD and the Director shall cooperate with each other in the 
review and processing of petitions to designate lands as unsuitable for 
surface coal mining operations. When either agency receives a petition 
that could impact adjacent Federal and non-Federal lands, respectively, 
the agency receiving the petition shall (1) notify the other of receipt 
and of the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision; and (2) request 
and fully consider data, information and views of the other.
    The authority to designate State and private lands as unsuitable for 
mining is reserved to the State. The authority to designate Federal 
lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary or his 
designated respresentative.

            Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    27. This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the 
Secretary under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

           Article XII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    28. If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part it may 
be reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

            Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    29. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the 
Governor and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    30. The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new 
or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and 
administration procedures. Each party shall, if it determines it to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the State 
Program and under the procedures of section 501 of the Act for changes 
to the Federal lands program.
    31. The MLRD and the Department shall provide each other with copies 
of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations and 
standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this 
Agreement.

[[Page 487]]

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    32. Each party to this Agreement shall notify the other, when 
necessary, of any changes in personnel, organization and funding or 
other changes that will affect the implementation of this Agreement to 
ensure coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.

                   Article XVI: Reservation of Rights

    33. In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be 
construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have 
not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not 
limited to those listed in Appendix A.

    Dated: September 27, 1982.

Sec. 912.700  Idaho Federal program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in Idaho which have been adopted under the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule 
is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the 
Idaho Federal program.
    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining 
operations in Idaho conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The 
rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal 
lands in Idaho.
    (d) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this part are 
the same as those of the permanent program regulations which have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
    (e) The following provisions of Idaho laws provide, where 
applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of 
surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the 
regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to Section 505(b) of 
the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act.
    (1) Idaho Code Section 47-1503(20) pertaining to the definition of 
``operator.''
    (2) Idaho Code Section 47-1509(c) regarding reclamation of disturbed 
land of less than 2 acres.
    (3) Idaho Code Section 47-1513(c) providing for assessment of 
anticipated costs of reclamation against an operator.
    (4) Idaho Code Sections 47-1513 (f) and (g) providing for assessment 
of civil penalties in addition to bond forfeiture.

[[Page 497]]

    (5) Idaho Code Sections 47-1301 et seq. and Rules 1 through 20 
promulgated thereunder pertaining to regulation of dredge mining.
    (6) Idaho Code Sections 18-4301 and 18-7019 providing for punishment 
for interference with water sources used in mining operations.
    (7) Idaho Code Section 42-1713 requiring a fee to be paid by each 
owner of a dam, reservoir or mine tailing impoundment structure.
    (8) Idaho Code Section 42-1718 (Supp.) providing for assessment 
against an operator for costs incurred in correction deficiencies in 
dams and impoundment structures.
    (f) The following Idaho statute and regulations interfere with the 
achievement of the purposes and goals of the Act. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, they are preempted and 
superseded with respect to surface coal mining and reclamation, except 
as they apply to surface coal mining operations affecting two acres or 
less, or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act:

    The Idaho Surface Mining Act, Idaho Code Sections 47-1501--47-1524, 
as amended, and all regulations issued thereunder (with the exception of 
Sections 47-1503(20), 47-1509(c), 47-1513(c), and 47-1513 (f) and (g),

rights'' in 62 IAC 1701.Appendix A, also known as 62 IAC 1701.5, as

requisite property rights after August 3, 1977.

Sec. 913.30  State-Federal cooperative agreement.

    The Governor of the State of Illinois (Governor) and the Secretary 
of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative 
Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

       Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies

    A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), 
which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the 
Secretary under section 503 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter 
into an agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations (including surface operations and surface impacts 
incident to underground mining operations) on Federal lands. This 
Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations 
not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, Subpart 3480 through 3487, and surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations in Illinois on Federal lands (30 
CFR Chapter VII Subchapter D), consistent with SMCRA and State and 
Federal laws governing such activities and the Illinois State Program 
(Program).
    B. Purposes: The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster 
Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 
CFR part 3480, subparts 3480 through 3487; (b) minimize 
intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and 
effective application of the Program on all lands in Illinois in 
accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.
    C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Land Reclamation 
Division (LRD) of the Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals will be 
responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. 
The Office of Surface and Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) 
will administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement 
will take effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register as a 
final rule. This Agreeement will remain in effect until terminated as 
provided in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
SMCRA, 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, and this Agreement 
including the State Act [Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch 96\1/2\, Section 7901 et 
seq. (1985)], and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to 
those Acts, will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. 
Where there is a conflict between the above reference State and Federal 
definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, 
terms and conditions of the Program and this Agreement are applicable to 
Federal lands in Illinois except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, 
SMCRA, 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable laws, 
Executive Orders, or regulations.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
the provisions of this Agreement.
    A. Authority of State Agency: IRD has and will continue to have the 
authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    B. Funds: 1. Upon application by LRD and subject to appropriations, 
OSMRE will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs 
associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement 
as provided in section 705(c) of SMCRA, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 
735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by LRD in

[[Page 505]]

carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not 
exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on 
such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement.
    2. OSMRE's Springfield Field Office and OSMRE's Eastern Field 
Operations office will work with LRD to estimate the amount the Federal 
government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands in 
Illinois in the absence of this Agreement.
    3. OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal lands cost 
estimate. After resolution of any issues, LRD will include the Federal 
lands cost estimate in the State's annual regulatory grant application 
submitted to OSMRE's Springfield Field Office.
    The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for 
inflation and workload considerations in estimating regulatory costs for 
the following grant year. OSMRE will notify LRD as soon as possible if 
such projections are unrealistic.
    4. If LRD applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and LRD will promptly meet to decide on 
appropriate measures that will insure that surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands in Illinois are regulated in 
accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be reached, either 
party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI of this 
Agreement.
    5. Funds provided to the LRD under this Agreement will be adjusted 
in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, 
Attachment E.
    C. Reports and Records: LRD will make annual reports to OSMRE 
containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this 
Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, LRD and OSMRE will 
exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where 
prohibited by Federal or State law.
    OSMRE will provide LRD with a copy of any final evaluation report 
prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. LRD comments on the report will be appended before 
transmission to the Congress, unless necessary to respond to a request 
by a date certain, or to other interested parties.
    D. Personnel: Subject to adequate appropriations and grant awards, 
the LRD will maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this 
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA, the Federal lands 
program, and the Program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: Subject to adequate appropriations 
and grant awards, the LRD will assure itself access to equipment, 
laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, 
studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to 
carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
    F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the 
fee accompanying an application for a permit for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands in Illinois will be determined 
in accordance with section 2.05 of the Illinois State Act, 62 Ill. Adm. 
Code 1771.25, and the applicable provisions of the Program and Federal 
law. All permit fees, civil penalties and fines collected from 
operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and will be 
deposited with the State Treasurer. Permit fees will be considered 
program income. Civil penalties and fines will not be considered program 
income. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 
will include a report of the amount of fees, penalties, and fines 
collected during the State's prior fiscal year.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

               A. Submission of Permit Application Package

    1. LRD and the Secretary require an applicant proposing to conduct 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered 
by this Agreement to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an 
appropriate number of copies to LRD. LRD will furnish OSMRE and other 
Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The 
PAP will be in the form required by LRD and will include any 
supplemental information required by OSMRE, the Federal land management 
agency, and other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over 
Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP.
    At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 
740.13(b) and include the information necessary for LRD to make a 
determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the 
appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with 
applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other 
Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are 
responsible.
    2. For any outstanding or pending permit applications on Federal 
lands being processed by OSMRE prior to the effective date of this 
Agreement, OSMRE will maintain sole permit decision responsibility. 
After the final decision, all additional responsibilities shall pass to 
LRD pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

   B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved

    1. LRD will assume the responsibilities for review of permit 
applications where there is no leased Federal coal to the extent 
authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to 
consultation with the Federal

[[Page 506]]

Land Management Agency pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), LRD will be 
responsible for obtaining, except for non-significant revisions, the 
comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction 
or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed 
in the PAP. LRD will request such Federal agencies to furnish their 
findings or any requests for additional information to LRD within 45 
calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist LRD 
in obtaining this information, upon request.
    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to LRD under 
other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements 
between OSMRE and the State, with the concurrence of any Federal agency 
involved, and without amendment to this agreement.
    2. LRD will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review 
and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the 
PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations in Illinois on Federal lands not requiring a mining plan 
pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). LRD will review the PAP for 
compliance with the Program and State Act and regulations. LRD will be 
the primary point of contact for applicants regarding decisions on the 
PAP and will be responsible for informing the applicant of 
determinations.
    3. The Secretary will make his determinations under SMCRA that 
cannot be delegated to the State. Some of which have been delegated to 
OSMRE.
    4. OSMRE and LRD will coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to LRD when 
requested, if available resources allow. LRD will keep OSMRE informed of 
findings made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE may provide 
assistance to LRD in resolving conflicts with Federal land management 
agencies. OSMRE will be responsible for ensuring that any information 
OSMRE receives from an applicant is promptly sent to LRD. OSMRE will 
have access to LRD files concerning operations on Federal lands. OSMRE 
will send to LRD copies of all resulting correspondence between OSMRE 
and the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the 
PAP. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of LRD to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA.
    5. LRD will make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit 
on Federal lands.
    (a) Any permit issued by LRD will incorporate any lawful terms or 
conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including 
conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conducted on 
compliance with the requirements of Federal land management agency.
    (b) The permit will include lawful terms and conditions required by 
other applicable Federal laws and regulations.
    (c) After making its decision on the PAP, LRD will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the 
operations proposed in the PAP.
    A copy of the permit and written findings will be submitted to OSMRE 
upon request.

       C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal is Involved

    1. LRD will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) 
(1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7), to the extent authorized.
    In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), LRD will assume primary 
responsibility for the analysis, review and approval, disapproval or 
conditional approval of the permit application component of the PAP for 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Illinois where a 
mining plan is required, including applications for revisions, renewals 
and transfer sale and assignment of such permits. OSMRE will, at the 
request of the State, assist to the extent possible in this analysis and 
review.
    LRD will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding 
the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and 
regulations. LRD will be responsible for informing the applicant of all 
joint State-Federal determinations.
    LRD will to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land 
management agency and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) pursuant to 30 
CFR 740.4(c)(2) and (3), respectively. On matters concerned exclusively 
with regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3487, BLM 
will be primary contact with the applicant. BLM will inform LRD of its 
actions and provide LRD with a copy of documentation on all decisions.
    LRD will send the OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the 
applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the 
PAP. OSMRE will send to LRD copies of all OSMRE correspondence with the 
applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, 
OSMRE will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding 
completeness or deficiences of the PAP with respect to matters covered 
by the Program.
    LRD will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and 
determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or 
responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in 
the PAP. LRD will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings 
or any requests for additional information to LRD within 45 days of the 
date of

[[Page 507]]

receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist LRD in obtaining this information, 
upon request of LRD.
    LRD will be responsible for approval and release of performance 
bonds under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(4) in accordance with Article IX of this 
agreement, and for review and approval of exploration operations not 
subject to 43 CFR part 3480, subparts 3480-3487, under 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(6).
    LRD will prepare documentation to comply with the requirements of 
NEPA under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7); however, OSMRE will retain the 
responsibility for the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii).
    2. The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities 
under 30 CFR 740.4(a) that cannot be delegated to LRD under the Federal 
lands program, MLA, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this 
Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry 
out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid, to the 
extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set 
forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the 
information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required 
by SMCRA, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State 
under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working 
agreements between OSMRE and LRD, with concurrence of any Federal agency 
involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
    Where necessary to make the determination to recommend that the 
Secretary approve the mining plan, OSMRE will consult with and obtain 
the concurrences of the BLM, the Federal land management agency and 
other Federal agencies as required.
    The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of LRD to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA or provisions 
of SMCRA not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement 
over SMCRA and the Federal lands program.
    3. OSMRE will assist LRD in carrying out LRD's responsibilities by:
    (a) Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between 
LRD and other Federal agencies in a timely manner.
    (b) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between 
State and Federal agencies.
    (c) Where OSMRE is assisting LRD in reviewing the PAP, furnishing to 
LRD the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the State's 
request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed upon by 
OSMRE and LRD.
    (d) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to 
the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.
    4. Review of the PAP: (a) OSMRE and LRD will coordinate with each 
other during the review process as needed. LRD will keep OSMRE informed 
of findings made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE will ensure 
that any information OSMRE receives which has a bearing on decisions 
regarding the PAP is promptly sent to LRD.
    (b) LRD will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and 
State law and regulations.
    (c) OSMRE will review the operation and reclamation plan portion of 
the permit application, and any other appropriate portions of the PAP 
for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of SMCRA and for 
compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations.
    (d) OSMRE and LRD will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP 
review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The 
project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between 
OSMRE and LRD throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days 
after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSMRE 
will furnish LRD with its review comments on the PAP and specify any 
requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, LRD will 
provide OSMRE all available information that may aid OSMRE in preparing 
any findings.
    (e) LRD will prepare a State decision package, including written 
findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in 
compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State 
decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for 
processing PAPs agreed upon by LRD and OSMRE.
    (f) LRD may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit 
on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary 
Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that LRD advises the 
operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must 
be obtained before the operator may conduct coal development or mining 
operations on the Federal lease. LRD will reserve the right to amend or 
rescind any requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or 
conditions imposed by the Secretary in his approval of the mining plan.
    (g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions 
required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other 
applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by 
the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and 
those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance 
with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with 
jurisdiction.

[[Page 508]]

    (h) After making its decision on the PAP, LRD will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal land affected by 
operations proposed in the PAP. A copy of the written findings and the 
permit will also be submitted to OSMRE.
    5. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to LRD when requested, if 
available resources allow. OSMRE will have access to LRD files 
concerning operations on Federal lands.

   D. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions; Renewals; and Transfer 
                   Assignment or Sale of Permit Rights

    1. Any permit revision or renewal for an operation on Federal lands 
will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by LRD after consultation 
with OSMRE on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan 
modification pursuant to 30 CFR 746.18. OSMRE will inform LRD within 30 
days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision or renewal, whether the 
permit revision, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. 
Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSMRE and LRD 
will follow the procedures outlined in paragraphs C.1. through C.5. of 
this Article.
    2. OSMRE may establish criteria consistent with 30 CFR 746.18 to 
determine which permit revisions and renewals clearly do not constitute 
mining plan modifications.
    3. Permit revisions or renewals on Federal lands which are 
determined by OSMRE not to constitute mining plan modifications under 
paragraph D.1. of this Article or that meet the criteria for not being 
mining plan modifications as established under paragraph D.2. of this 
Article will be reviewed and approved following the procedures set forth 
in 62 Ill. Adm. Code 1774 and paragraphs B.1. through B.5. of this 
Article.
    4. Transfer, assignment or sale of permit rights on Federal lands 
shall be processed in accordance with 62 Ill. Adm. Code 1774 and 30 CFR 
740.13(e).

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. LRD will conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 
30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance 
with the Program.
    B. LRD will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 
CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSMRE a legible copy 
of the completed State inspection report.
    C. LRD will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority 
in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with 
the requirements covered by the agreement, except as described 
hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by 
authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those 
covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations 
under laws other than SMCRA.
    D. OSMRE will ordinarily give LRD reasonable notice of its intent to 
conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State 
inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection.
    When OSMRE is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent 
danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent 
environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 
842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact LRD no less than 24 hours prior to 
the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/
State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an 
imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm will be 
referred to LRD for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct 
inspections without prior notice to LRD to carry out his 
responsibilities under SMCRA.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. LRD will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority 
given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders 
including, but not limited to, those listed in Appendix A (attached) is 
reserved to the Secretary.
    B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and LRD, LRD will have 
primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of 
orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. 
LRD will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or 
revoke a permit on Federal lands.
    C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint 
inspection where LRD and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of 
any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement 
action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, or both, 
and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 
30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
    D. LRD and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations 
of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits 
subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such 
violations.
    E. Personnel of LRD and the Department of the Interior, including 
OSMRE, will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement 
actions taken by either party.

[[Page 509]]

    F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority 
to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. LRD and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts 
operations on Federal lands to submit a performance bond payable to the 
State of Illinois and the United States to cover the operator's 
responsibilities under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will 
be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the 
Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed 
by the Secretary or the Federal land management agency. Such bond will 
provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond 
covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. 
LRD will advise OSMRE of annual adjustments to the performance bond 
pursuant to the program.
    B. Performance bonds will be subject to release and forfeiture in 
accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program. Where 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations are subject to an 
approved mining plan, a performance bond shall be released by the State 
after the release is concurred in by OSMRE.
    C. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the 
requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR Subpart 3474 or 
lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in 
certain circumstances, by section 715 of SMCRA.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid 
            Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

                       A. Unsuitability Petitions

    1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining 
pursuant to a petition, including the authority to make substantial 
legal and financial commitment determinations pursuant to section 
522(a)(6) of SMCRA, is reserved to the Secretary.
    2. When either LRD or OSMRE receives a petition to designate land 
areas unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining 
operations that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands 
pursuant to section 522(c) of SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition 
will notify the other of its receipt and the anticipated schedule for 
reaching a decision, and request and fully consider data, information 
and recommendations of the other. OSMRE will coordinate with the Federal 
land management agency with jurisdiction over the petition area, and 
will solicit comments from the agency.

        B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

    The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations 
of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA or for determinations of 
compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA, and received prior 
to or at the time of submission of a PAP that involves surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations and activities:
    1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified 
under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, OSMRE will determine whether VER 
exists for such areas.
    For private inholdings within section 522(e)(1) areas, LRD, with the 
consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether surface 
coal mining operations on such lands will or will not affect the Federal 
interest (Federal lands as defined in section 701(4) of SMCRA). OSMRE 
will process VER determination requests on private inholdings within the 
boundaries of section 522(e)(1) areas where surface coal mining 
operations affects the Federal interest.
    2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest 
where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) 
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSMRE will make the VER determinations.
    OSMRE will process requests for determinations of compatibility 
under section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA.
    3. For Federal lands, LRD will determine whether any proposed 
operation will adversely affect any publicly owned park and, in 
consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, places listed 
in the National Register of Historic Places, with respect to the 
prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. LRD will make 
the VER determination for such lands using the State Program. LRD will 
coordinate with any affected agency or agency with jurisdiction over the 
proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
    In the case that VER is determined not to exist under section 
522(e)(3) of SMCRA or 30 CFR 761.11(c), no surface coal mining 
operations will be permitted unless jointly approved by LRD and the 
Federal, State or local agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned 
park or historic place.
    4. LRD will process and make determinations of VER on Federal lands, 
using the State Program, for all areas limited or prohibited by section 
522(e)(4) and (5) of SMCRA as unsuitable for mining. For operations on 
Federal lands, LRD will coordinate with any affected agency or agency 
with jurisdiction over the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation.

Sec. 914.30  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

                   State-Federal Cooperative Agreement

    The Governor of the State of Indiana (Governor) and the Secretary of 
the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative 
Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

       Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies

                              A. Authority

    This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a 
State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary 
under section 503 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an 
Agreement for the State regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations (including surface operations and surface impacts 
incident to underground mining operations) on Federal lands. This 
Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations 
not

[[Page 515]]

subject to 43 CFR Part 3400 and surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations in Indiana on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter 
D), consistent with SMCRA and State and Federal laws governing such 
activities and the Indiana State Program (Program).

                               B. Purposes

    The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State 
cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR Part 
3400; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) 
provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in 
Indiana in accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.

                 C. Responsible Administrative Agencies

    The Natural Resource Commission (NRC) and the Division of 
Reclamation (DOR) of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources will be 
responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor 
under the approved Indiana Regulatory Program. The Office of Surface and 
Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) will administer this Agreement 
on behalf of the Secretary.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement 
will take effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register as a 
final rule. This Agreement will remain in effect until terminated as 
provided in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
SMCRA, 30 CFR Parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, including the OSM 
approved State Act (I.C. 14-34), and the rules and regulations 
promulgated pursuant to those Acts, will be given the meanings set forth 
in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above 
referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the 
Program will apply.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, 
terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in 
Indiana except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA, 30 CFR 
740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable laws, Executive 
Orders, or regulations.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
the provisions of this Agreement.
    A. Authority of State Agency: DOR and NRC have and will continue to 
have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    B. Funds: 1. Upon application by DOR and subject to appropriations, 
OSM will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated 
with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided 
in section 705(c) of SMCRA, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such 
funds will cover the full cost incurred by DOR and NRC in carrying out 
these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the 
estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on such 
responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement.
    2. OSM's Indianapolis Field Office and OSM's Mid-Continent Region 
Coordinating Center office will work with DOR to estimate the amount the 
Federal government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands 
in Indiana in the absence of this Agreement.
    3. OSM and the State will discuss the OSM Federal lands cost 
estimate. After resolution of any issues, DOR will include the Federal 
lands cost estimate in the State's annual regulatory grant application 
submitted to OSM's Indianapolis Field Office.
    The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for 
inflation and workload considerations in estimated regulatory costs for 
the following grant year. OSM will notify DOR as soon as possible if 
such projections are not acceptable.
    4. If DOR applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSM, OSM and DOR will promptly meet to decide on 
appropriate measures that will insure that surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands in Indiana are regulated in 
accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be reached, either 
party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI of this 
Agreement.
    5. Funds provided to the DOR under this Agreement will be adjusted 
in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Common Rule for 
Uniform Administration Requirements for Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements to State and Local Governments.
    C. Reports and Records: DOR will make annual reports to OSM 
containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this 
Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, DOR and OSM will 
exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where 
prohibited by Federal or State law.
    OSM will provide DOR with a copy of any final evaluation report 
prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. DOR comments on the report will be appended before 
transmission to the Congress, unless necessary to respond to

[[Page 516]]

a request by a date certain, or to other interested parties.
    D. Personnel: Subject to adequate appropriations and grant awards, 
the DOR will maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this 
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA, the Federal lands 
program, and the Program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: Subject to adequate appropriations 
and grant awards, the DOR will assure itself access to equipment, 
laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, 
studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to 
carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
    F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the 
fee accompanying an application for a permit for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands in Indiana will be determined in 
accordance with the approved Indiana Program. All permit fees, civil 
penalties and fines collected from operations on Federal lands will be 
retained by the State and will be deposited within the Natural Resources 
Reclamation Division Fund. Permit fees will be considered program 
income. Civil penalties and fines will not be considered program income. 
The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 will 
include a report of the amount of fees, penalties, and fines collected 
on such permits during the State's prior fiscal year.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

              A. Submission of Permit Application Package:

    1. DOR and the Secretary require an applicant proposing to conduct 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered 
by this Agreement to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an 
appropriate number of copies to DOR. DOR will furnish OSM and other 
Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The 
PAP will be in the form required by DOR and will include any 
supplemental information required by OSM, the Federal land management 
agency, and other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over 
Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP.
    At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 
740.13(b) and include the information necessary for DOR to make a 
determination of compliance with the Program and for OSM and the 
appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with 
applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other 
Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are 
responsible.
    2. For any outstanding or pending permit applications on Federal 
lands being processed by OSM prior to the effective date of this 
Agreement, OSM will maintain sole permit decision responsibility. After 
the final decision, all additional responsibilities shall pass to DOR 
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement along with any attendant fees, 
fines, or civil penalties therefrom.

  B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved:

    1. DOR will assume the responsibilities for review of PAPs where 
there is no leased Federal coal to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to consultation with the 
Federal land management agency pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), DOR will 
be responsible for obtaining, except for non-significant revisions, the 
comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction 
or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed 
in the PAP. DOR will request such Federal agencies to furnish their 
findings or any requests for additional information to DOR within 45 
calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSM will assist DOR in 
obtaining this information, upon request. Responsibilities and decisions 
which can be delegated to DOR under other applicable Federal laws may be 
specified in working agreements between OSM and the State, with the 
concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to 
this Agreement.
    2. DOR will assume responsibility for the analysis, review and 
approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit application 
component of the PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining 
and reclamation operations in Indiana on Federal lands not requiring a 
mining plan pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). DOR will review 
the PAP for compliance with the Program and the OSM approved State Act 
and regulations. DOR will be the primary point of contact for applicants 
regarding decisions on the PAP and will be responsible for informing the 
applicant of determinations.
    3. The Secretary will make his determinations under SMCRA that 
cannot be delegated to the State. Some of which have been delegated to 
OSM.
    4. OSM and DOR will coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. OSM will provide technical assistance to DOR when 
requested, if available resources allow. DOR will keep OSM informed of 
findings made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSM or other Federal agencies. OSM may provide 
assistance to DOR in resolving conflicts with Federal land management 
agencies. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSM 
receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DOR. OSM will have access 
to DOR files concerning operations on Federal lands. OSM will send to 
DOR copies of all resulting correspondence between OSM

[[Page 517]]

and the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the 
PAP. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOR to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA.
    5. DOR will make a decision on approval, disapproval or conditional 
approval of the permit on Federal lands.
    (a) Any permit issued by DOR will incorporate any lawful terms or 
conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including 
conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conducted in 
compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency.
    (b) The permit will include lawful terms and conditions required by 
other applicable Federal laws and regulations.
    (c) After making its decision on the PAP, DOR will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSM, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the 
operations proposed in the PAP. A copy of the permit and written 
findings will be submitted to OSM upon request.

       C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal Is involved:

    1. DOR will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7), to the extent authorized.
    In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), DOR will assume 
responsibility for the analysis, review and approval, disapproval, or 
conditional approval of the permit application component of the PAP for 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Indiana where a mining 
plan is required, including applications for revisions, renewals and 
transfer sale and assignment of such permits. OSM will, at the request 
of the State, assist to the extent possible in this analysis and review.
    DOR will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding 
the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and 
regulations.
    DOR will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint 
State-Federal determinations.
    DOR will to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land 
management agency and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) pursuant to 30 
CFR 740.4(c)(2) and (3), respectively. On matters concerned exclusively 
with regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3487, BLM 
will be the primary contact with the applicant. BLM will inform DOR of 
its actions and provide DOR with a copy of documentation on all 
decisions.
    DOR will send the OSM copies of any correspondence with the 
applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the 
PAP. OSM will send to DOR copies of all correspondence with the 
applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, 
OSM will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding 
completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered 
by the Program.
    DOR will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and 
determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or 
responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in 
the PAP. DOR will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings 
or any requests for additional information to DOR within 45 days of the 
date of receipt of the PAP. OSM will assist DOR in obtaining this 
information, upon request of DOR.
    DOR will be responsible for approval and release of performance 
bonds under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(4) in accordance with Article IX of this 
Agreement, and for review and approval under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(6) of 
exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR Part 3480, Subparts 3480-
3487.
    DOR will prepare documentation to comply with the requirements of 
NEPA under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7); however, OSM will retain the 
responsibility for the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii).
    2. The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities 
under 30 CFR 740.4(a) that cannot be delegated to DOR under the Federal 
lands program, MLA, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this 
Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry 
out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid to the 
extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set 
forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the 
information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required 
by SMCRA, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State 
under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working 
agreements between OSM and DOR, with concurrence of any Federal agency 
involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
    Where necessary to make the determination to recommend that the 
Secretary approve the mining plan, OSM will consult with and obtain the 
concurrences of the BLM, the Federal land management agency and other 
Federal agencies as required.
    The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOR to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA or provisions 
of SMCRA not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement 
over SMCRA and the Federal lands program.
    3. OSM will assist DOR in carrying out DOR's responsibilities by:
    (a) Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between 
DOR and other Federal agencies in a timely manner.

[[Page 518]]

    (b) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between 
State and Federal agencies.
    (c) Where OSM is assisting DOR in reviewing the PAP, furnishing to 
DOR the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the State's 
request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed upon by 
OSM and DOR.
    (d) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to 
the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.
    4. Review of the PAP:
    (a) OSM and DOR will coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. DOR will keep OSM informed of findings and technical 
analyses made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSM or other Federal agencies. OSM will ensure that 
any information it receives which has a bearing on decisions regarding 
the PAP is promptly sent to DOR.
    (b) DOR will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and 
State law and regulations.
    (c) OSM will review the operation and reclamation plan portion of 
the permit application, and any other appropriate portions of the PAP 
for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of SMCRA and for 
compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations.
    (d) OSM and DOR will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review 
and each will identify a person as the project leader. The project 
leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between OSM and DOR 
throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of 
the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSM will furnish DOR 
with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for 
additional data. To the extent practicable, DOR will provide OSM all 
available information that may aid OSM in preparing any findings.
    (e) DOR will prepare a State decision package, including written 
findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in 
compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State 
decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for 
processing PAPs agreed upon by DOR and OSM.
    (f) DOR may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit 
on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary 
Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that DOR advises the 
operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must 
be obtained before the operator may conduct coal development or mining 
operations on the Federal lease. DOR will reserve the right to amend or 
rescind any requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or 
conditions imposed by the Secretary in his approval of the mining plan.
    (g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions 
required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other 
applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by 
the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and 
those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance 
with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with 
jurisdiction.
    (h) After making its decision on the PAP, DOR will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSM, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal land affected by 
operations proposed in the PAP. A copy of the written findings and the 
permit will also be submitted to OSM.
    5. OSM will provide technical assistance to DOR when requested, if 
available resources allow. OSM will have access to DOR files concerning 
operations on Federal lands.

   D. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions; Renewals; and Transfer 
                  Assignment or Sate of Permit Rights:

    1. Any permit revision or renewal for an operation on Federal lands 
will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by DOR after consultation 
with OSM on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan 
modification pursuant to 30 CFR 746.18. OSM will inform DOR within 30 
days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision or renewal, whether the 
permit revision, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. 
Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSM and DOR 
will follow the procedures outlined in paragraphs C.1. through C.5. of 
this Article.
    2. OSM may establish criteria consistent with 30 CFR 746.18 to 
determine which permit revisions and renewals clearly do not constitute 
mining plan modifications.
    3. Permit revisions or renewals on Federal lands which are 
determined by OSM not to constitute mining plan modifications under 
paragraph D.1. of this Article or that meet the criteria for not being 
mining plan modifications as established under paragraph D.2. of this 
Article will be reviewed and approved following the procedures set forth 
under Indiana law and the State Program and paragraphs B.1. through B.5. 
of this Article.
    4. Transfer, assignment or sale of permit rights on Federal lands 
shall be processed in accordance with Indiana law and the State Program 
and 30 CFR 740.13(e).

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. DOR will conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 
30 CFR

[[Page 519]]

740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with 
the Program.
    B. DOR will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 
CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSM a legible copy of 
the completed State inspection report.
    C. DOR will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority 
in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with 
the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described 
hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by 
authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those 
covered by this Agreement. The Department of the Interior may conduct 
any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and 
its obligations under laws other than SMCRA.
    D. OSM will give DOR reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an 
inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with 
an opportunity to join in the inspection.
    When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger 
to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent 
environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 
842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact DOR no less than 24 hours prior to 
the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/
State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an 
imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm will be 
referred to DOR for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct 
inspections without prior notice to DOR to carry out his 
responsibilities under SMCRA.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. DOR will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA 
concerning compliance with the requirements of the Agreement and the 
Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority 
given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders 
including, but not limited to, those listed in Appendix A (attached) is 
reserved to the Secretary.
    B. During any joint inspection by OSM and DOR, DOR will have primary 
responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders 
of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. DOR 
will inform OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a 
permit on Federal lands.
    C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection 
where DOR and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any 
particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846. Such 
enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, 
or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system 
contained in 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846.
    D. DOR and OSM will promptly notify each other of all violations of 
applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject 
to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such 
violations
    E. Personnel of DOR and the Department of the Interior, including 
OSM, will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement 
actions taken by either party.
    F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority 
to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. DOR and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts 
operations on Federal lands to submit a performance bond payable to the 
State of Indiana and the United States to cover the operator's 
responsibilities under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will 
be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the 
Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed 
by the Secretary or the Federal land management agency. Such bond will 
provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond 
covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. 
DOR will advise OSM of annual adjustments to the performance bond 
pursuant to the Program.
    B. Performance bonds will be subject to release and forfeiture in 
accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program. Where 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations are subject to an 
approved mining plan, a performance bond shall be released by the State 
after the release is concurred in by OSM.
    C. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the 
requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR Subpart 3474 or 
lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in 
certain circumstances, by section 715 of SMCRA.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for all or Certain Types of 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid 
         Existing Rights (VER) and Compatibility Determinations

                       A. Unsuitability Petitions

    1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining 
pursuant to a petition, including the authority to make substantial 
legal and financial commitment determinations pursuant to section 
522(a)(6) of SMCRA, is reserved to the Secretary.
    2. When either DOR or OSM receives a petition to designate land 
areas unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining

[[Page 520]]

operations that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands 
pursuant to section 522(c) of SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition 
will notify the other of its receipt and the anticipated schedule for 
reaching a decision, and request and fully consider data, information 
and recommendations of the other. OSM will coordinate with the Federal 
land management agency with jurisdiction over the petition area, and 
will solicit comments from the agency.

        B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

    The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations 
of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA or for determinations of 
compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA, and received prior 
to or at the time of submission of a PAP that involves surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations and activities:
    1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified 
under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, OSM will determine whether VER exists 
for such areas.
    For private in holdings within section 522(e)(1) areas, DOR, with 
the consultation and concurrence of OSM, will determine whether surface 
coal mining operations on such lands will or will not affect the Federal 
interest (Federal lands as defined in section 701(4) of SMCRA). OSM will 
process VER determination requests on private in holdings within the 
boundaries of section 522(e)(1) areas where surface coal mining 
operations affects the Federal interest.
    2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest 
where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) 
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSM will make the VER determinations. OSM 
will process requests for determinations of compatibility under section 
522(e)(2) of SMCRA.
    3. For Federal lands, DOR will determine whether any proposed 
operation will adversely affect any publicly owned park and, in 
consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, places listed 
in the National Register of Historic Sites, with respect to the 
prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. DOR will make 
the VER determination for such lands using the State Program. DOR will 
coordinate with any affected agency or agency with jurisdiction over the 
proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
    In the case that VER is determined not to exist under section 
522(e)(3) of SMCRA or 30 CFR 761.11(c), no surface coal mining 
operations will be permitted unless jointly approved by DOR and the 
Federal, State or local agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned 
park or historic place.
    4. DOR will process and make determinations of VER on Federal lands, 
using the State Program, for all areas limited or prohibited by section 
522(e)(4) and (5) of SMCRA as unsuitable for mining. For operations on 
Federal lands, DOR will coordinate with any affected agency or agency 
with jurisdiction over the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation 
operation.

            Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

            Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. The Secretary or the Governor may from time to time promulgate 
new or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement 
and administration procedures. Each party will, if it determines it to 
be necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations or request necessary legislative action. Such changes will 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the 
Program and under the procedures of section 501 of SMCRA for changes to 
the Federal lands program.
    B. DOR and the Secretary will provide each other with copies of any 
changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations or standards 
pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    Each party to this Agreement will notify the other, when necessary, 
of any changes in personnel, organization and funding, or other changes 
that may affect the implementation of this Agreement to ensure 
coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.

                   Article XVI: Reservation of Rights

    This Agreement will not be construed as waiving or preventing the 
assertion of any rights that have not been expressly addressed in this 
Agreement that the State or the Secretary may have under laws other than

Sec. 917.30  State-Federal cooperative agreement.

                          Cooperative Agreement

    The Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the Governor) and the 
Secretary of the Department of the Interior (the Secretary) enter into a 
Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

       Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Agencies

                              A. Authority

    This Agreement is authorized by Section 523(c) of the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a 
State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary 
under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for the 
regulation and control of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 
CFR Group 3400 and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation consistent 
with the Act, the Federal lands program (30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter 
D) and the approved Kentucky State Program (Program) for surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands.

                               B. Purposes

    The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State 
cooperation on the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR Group 
3400, (b) minimize intergovernmental duplication of effort, and (c) 
provide for uniform and effective application of the Program on all 
lands in Kentucky in accordance with the Act and the Program.

                 C. Responsible Administrative Agencies

    The Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet 
(NREPC), acting through the Department for Surface Mining Reclamation 
and Enforcement (DSMRE), shall be responsible for administering this 
Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining 
Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) shall administer this Agreement on 
behalf of the Secretary.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement 
shall be effective on October 1, 1998. This Agreement shall remain in 
effect until terminated as provided for in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement, which are defined in 
the Act, 30 CFR Parts 700, 701 and 740 and defined in the KRS 350 and 
the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, shall have 
the same meanings as set forth in said definitions. Where there is a 
conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the 
definitions used in the approved State Program will apply except in the 
case of a term which defines the Secretary's continuing responsibilities 
under the Act or other laws.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, 
terms and provisions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in 
Kentucky except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, The Act, 30 CFR 
740.4 and 745.13 or other applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders or 
regulations.
    Orders and decisions issued by the NREPC in accordance with the 
Program that are appealable shall be appealed to the reviewing authority 
in accordance with the Program. Orders and decisions issued by the 
Secretary or his authorized agents that are appealable shall be appealed 
to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
provisions of this Agreement.

                      A. Authority of State Agency

    NREPC has and shall continue to have the authority under State law 
to carry out this agreement.

                               B. Funding

    Upon application by NREPC, and subject to appropriations, OSM will 
provide the State with funds to defray the costs associated with 
carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in 
Section 705(c) of the Act and 30 CFR Part 735. Such funds will cover the 
full cost incurred by NREPC in carrying out those responsibilities. The 
amount of the grant will be determined using the procedures specified in 
the Federal Assistance Manual Chapter 3-10 and Appendix III.
    For purposes of this agreement, actual costs of NREPC's 
administration of its approved program on Federal lands in accordance 
with this agreement shall be that percentage of NRECP's total program 
expenditures during any specific grant period that equals the percentage 
of Federal lands within all lands under permit in the State of Kentucky 
for that specific grant period.

[[Page 532]]

    If NREPC applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSM, OSM and NREPC will meet to decide upon appropriate 
measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal lands 
located in Kentucky are regulated in accordance with the approved 
Program. The NREPC also reserves the right to terminate this agreement 
should OSM be unable to adequately fund this program.

                         C. Reports and Records

    NREPC will make annual reports to OSM containing information with 
respect to compliance with terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 
745.12(d).
    Upon request, NREPC and OSM will exchange information generated 
under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal or State law.
    OSM will provide NREPC with a copy of any final evaluation reports 
prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. NREPC comments on the report will be attached before being 
sent to the Congress or other interested parties.

                              D. Personnel

    NREPC shall have the personnel necessary to fully implement this 
Agreement in accordance with the provision of the Act, applicable 
regulations, the Federal lands program and the approved Program.

                       E. Equipment and Facilities

    NREPC will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories and 
facilities to perform all inspections, investigations, studies, tests 
and analyses that are necessary to carry out the requirements of this 
Agreement.

             F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties

    The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for 
operations on Federal lands in Kentucky shall be determined in 
accordance with KRS 350.060 and Federal law. All permit fees and civil 
penalties collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by 
the State. Permit fees shall be considered Program income. Civil 
penalties shall not be considered Program income. The financial status 
report submitted to OSM pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include the 
amount of fees and civil penalties collected and attributable to Federal 
lands during the prior State fiscal year.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

                           A. Responsibilities

    NREPC will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, 
and approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit 
application component of the permit application package (PAP) required 
by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations in 
Kentucky on Federal lands. NREPC will assume the responsibilities for 
review of permit applications to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), and (7).
    For proposals to conduct surface coal mining operations involving 
leased Federal coal, OSM is responsible for preparing a mining plan 
decision document in accordance with 30 CFR 746.13 and obtaining the 
Secretary's approval.
    The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for matters 
concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR Group 3400.
    The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of NREPC to 
carry out responsibilities under laws other than the Act or provisions 
of the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement 
over the Act and the Federal lands program. The Secretary will make 
determinations under the Act that cannot be delegated to the State, some 
of which have been delegated to OSM.
    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to NREPC under 
other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements 
between OSM and the State with the concurrence of any Federal agency 
involved and without amendment to this agreement.

                      B. Permit Application Package

    NREPC shall require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands to submit a PAP with 
an appropriate number of copies to NREPC. NREPC will furnish OSM, the 
Federal land management agency, and any other agency with jurisdiction 
or responsibility over Federal lands affected by operations proposed in 
the PAP with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be 
in the form required by NREPC and will include any supplemental 
information required by OSM, the Federal land management agency, and any 
other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands 
affected by operations proposed in the PAP.
    At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 
740.13(b) and include the information necessary for NREPC to make a 
determination of compliance with the Program, and for OSM, the 
appropriate Federal land management agencies, and any other agencies 
with jurisdiction or responsibilities over Federal lands affected by 
operations proposed in the PAP to make determinations of compliance with 
applicable requirements of the Act, the Federal lands program, other 
Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are 
responsible.

[[Page 533]]

                          C. Review Procedures

    NREPC will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding 
the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State laws and 
regulations. OSM will review the applicable portions of the PAP for 
compliance with the non-delegated responsibilities of the Act and for 
compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws, Executive 
Orders, and regulations.
    OSM and NREPC will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP reviews 
that comply with the time limitations established by the approved State 
program, and each agency will designate a person as the Federal lands 
liaison. The Federal lands liaisons will serve as the primary points of 
contact between OSM and NREPC throughout the review process. Not later 
than 45 calendar days after receipt of an administratively complete PAP, 
unless a different schedule is agreed upon, OSM will furnish NREPC with 
its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for 
additional data.
    OSM and NREPC will coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. NREPC will send to OSM copies of any correspondence 
with the applicant and any information received from the applicant 
regarding the PAP.
    OSM will send to NREPC copies of all OSM correspondence which may 
have a bearing on the PAP.
    OSM will provide technical assistance to NREPC when requested, and 
will have access to NREPC files concerning operations on Federal lands. 
NREPC will keep OSM informed of findings made during the review process 
which bear on the responsibilities of OSM or other Federal agencies.

     D. Coordination Between NREPC, OSM, and Other Federal Agencies

    NREPC will, to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land 
management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2) and (3), 
respectively. NREPC will also be responsible for obtaining the comments 
and determinations of other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility 
over the Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. 
NREPC will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any 
request for additional information to NREPC within 45 calendar days of 
the date of receipt of the PAP. OSM will, upon request, assist NREPC in 
obtaining such information.
    In accordance with 30 CFR 745.12(g)(2), where lands containing 
leased Federal coal are involved, NREPC will provide OSM, in the form 
specified by OSM in consultation with NREPC, with written findings 
indicating that each permit application is in compliance with the terms 
of the regulatory program and a technical analysis of each permit 
application to assist OSM in meeting its responsibilities under other 
applicable Federal laws and regulations.
    Where leased Federal coal is involved, OSM will consult with and 
obtain the concurrences of BLM, the Federal land management agency, and 
any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over the Federal 
lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP as required to make 
its recommendation for the Secretary's decision on the mining plan.
    Where BLM contacts the applicant in carrying out its 
responsibilities under 43 CFR Group 3400, BLM will immediately inform 
NREPC of its actions and provide NREPC with a copy of documentation of 
all decisions within 5 calendar days.

           E. Permit Application Decision and Permit Issuance

    NREPC will prepare a State decision package, including written 
findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in 
compliance with the Program. NREPC will make the decision on approval, 
disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit on Federal lands.
    Any permit issued by NREPC will incorporate any lawful terms or 
conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including 
conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conditioned 
upon compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management 
agency.
    NREPC may make a decision on approval, disapproval, or conditional 
approval of the permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program 
prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan when 
leased Federal coal is involved, provided that NREPC advises the 
operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must 
be obtained before the operator may conduct surface coal mining 
operations on the Federal lease. NREPC will reserve the right to amend 
or rescind any requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or 
conditions imposed by the Secretary in the approval of the mining plan.
    After making its decision on the PAP, NREPC will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSM, the Federal land management agencies, and any other 
agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected 
by the operations proposed in the PAP. A copy of the permit and written 
findings will be provided to OSM upon request.

   F. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions; Renewals; and Transfer, 
                  Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights

    Any permit revision or renewal for a surface coal mining and 
reclamation operation

[[Page 534]]

on Federal lands will be reviewed and approved, or disapproved, by NREPC 
after consultation with OSM on whether such revision or renewal 
constitutes a mining plan modification pursuant to 30 CFR 746.18. OSM 
will inform NREPC within 10 calendar days of receiving a copy of a 
proposed permit revision or renewal, whether the permit revision or 
renewal constitutes a mining plan modification.
    Transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights on Federal lands 
shall be processed in accordance with the Program and 30 CFR 740.13(e).

                        Article VII: Inspections

    NREPC will conduct inspections of all surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands, in accordance with 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(5) and the Program and prepare and file inspection reports in 
accordance with the Program. NREPC, subsequent to conducting any 
inspection pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5), and in a timely fashion which 
will not exceed 45 calendar days, will file with OSM's Lexington Field 
Office a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.
    NREPC will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority 
in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with 
the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described 
hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by 
authorized Federal or State land management agencies for purposes other 
than those covered by this Agreement. The Department of the Interior 
acting through OSM, the Federal land management agency or any other 
agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands to be 
affected under the proposed PAP, may conduct any inspections necessary 
to comply with obligations under 30 CFR Parts 842 and 843 and any laws 
other than the Act.
    OSM will give NREPC reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an 
inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide NREPC inspectors with 
an opportunity to accompany OSM inspectors. When OSM is responding to a 
citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, 
or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water 
resources pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(c), it will contact NREPC 
and provide the opportunity for a joint Federal/State inspection. 
Inability of NREPC to make an immediate joint inspection will not be 
cause for OSM to delay a Federal inspection where a citizen has alleged, 
and OSM has reason to believe, that an imminent danger to the public 
health and safety, or significant, imminent environmental harm to land, 
air or water resources exists. All citizen complaints which do not 
involve an imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm 
will be referred to NREPC for action in accordance with OSM regulations, 
policies, and procedures.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    NREPC will have primary enforcement authority under the Act 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority 
given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive Orders 
including, but not limited to, those listed in Appendix A (attached) is 
reserved to the Secretary.
    During any joint inspections by OSM and NREPC, NREPC will have 
primary responsibility for enforcement procedures including issuance of 
orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. 
NREPC will inform OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or 
revoke a permit on Federal lands.
    During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection 
where NREPC and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any 
particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR Parts 843, 845, and 846. Such 
enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, the 
Act, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system 
contained in 30 CFR Parts 843, 845, and 846.
    NREPC and OSM will within 5 calendar days notify each other of all 
violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining 
permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect 
to such violations.
    Personnel of NREPC and OSM will be mutually available to serve as 
witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.
    This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to 
enforce violations of Federal laws other than the Act.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    NREPC and the Secretary will require each permittee who conducts 
operations on Federal lands to submit a performance bond payable to the 
State of Kentucky for an amount adequate to cover the operator's 
responsibilities under the Act and Program. Such performance bond will 
be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, the 
Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed 
by the Department of the Interior. Such bond will state on its face that 
in the event the Federal Lands Cooperative Agreement between Kentucky 
and the U.S. Department of the Interior is terminated, the portion of 
the bond covering the Federal lands increment(s) shall be assigned to 
the United States. The bond shall also state that if subsequent to the 
forfeiture of the bond, the Cooperative

[[Page 535]]

Agreement is terminated, any unspent or uncommitted proceeds of the 
portion of the bond covering the Federal lands increment(s) shall be 
assigned to and forwarded to the United States. NREPC will advise OSM 
within 30 calendar days of any adjustments to the performance bond made 
pursuant to the Program.
    Prior to releasing the permittee from any obligation under such bond 
for surface coal mining operations involving leased Federal coal, NREPC 
will obtain the concurrence of OSM. OSM concurrence will include 
coordination with the Federal land management agency and any other 
agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected 
by the surface coal mining and reclamation operation.
    Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements 
for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR Subpart 3474 or lessee 
protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain 
circumstances, by Section 715 of the Act. Where Federal lease bonds or 
protections are required, OSM or the appropriate Federal agency is 
responsible for the collection and maintenance of such bonds.

  Article X: Designating Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
  Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities, Valid 
         Existing Rights (VER), and Compatibility Determinations

                       A. Unsuitability Petitions

    1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining 
pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.
    2. When either NREPC or OSM receives a petition to designate land 
areas unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining 
operations that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands 
pursuant to Section 522(c) of the Act, the agency receiving the petition 
will notify the other agency of receipt within 5 calendar days and of 
the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision, and request and fully 
consider data, information and recommendations of the other agency. OSM 
will coordinate with the Federal land management agency and any other 
agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands within or 
adjacent to the petition area and will solicit comments from these 
agencies.

                 B. VER and Compatibility Determinations

    The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations 
of VER pursuant to Section 522(e)(1) or (2) of the Act or for 
determinations of compatibility pursuant to Section 522(e)(2) of the Act 
are received:
    1. For Federal lands where proposed operations are prohibited or 
limited by Section 522(e)(1) or (2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.11(a) or 
(b), OSM will make the VER determination.
    2. OSM will process requests for determinations of compatibility 
under Section 522(e)(2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.11(b) and 761.12(c).

            Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

           Article XII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part, it may be 
reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16. The Secretary reserves 
the powers and authority specified in 30 CFR 745.13.

            Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    The Secretary or NREPC may, from time to time, promulgate new or 
revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and 
administrative procedures. Each party will, if it determines it to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations or request necessary legislative action.
    Such changes will be made under the procedures of 30 CFR Part 732 
for changes to the Program and under the procedures of Section 501 of 
the Act for changes to the Federal lands program.
    NREPC and OSM will provide each other with copies of any changes to 
their respective laws, rules, regulations, policy statements, guidelines 
or standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this 
Agreement.

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    Each party to this Agreement will notify the other, when necessary, 
of any changes in personnel, organization and funding, or other changes 
that may affect the implementation of this Agreement to ensure 
coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.

                   Article XVI: Reservation of Rights

    This Agreement will not be construed as waiving or preventing the 
assertion of any rights in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under laws other than the Act or their regulations, 
including but not limited to those listed in Appendix A.

Sec. 921.700  Massachusetts Federal program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in Massachusetts which have been adopted under the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule 
is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the 
Massachusetts Federal program.
    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining 
operations in Massachusetts conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian 
lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on 
Federal lands in Massachusetts.
    (d) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this part are 
the same as those of the permanent program regulations which have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
    (e) There are no Massachusetts laws which provide more stringent 
environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining operations 
than do the provisions of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act and the 
regulations in 30 CFR chapter VII.
    (f) The following are Massachusetts laws that interfere with the 
achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in 
accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded 
insofar as they apply to surface coal mining operations regulated under 
the Act:
    (1) The Coal Mining Regulatory and Reclamation Act of 1977, as 
amended, Mass. Ann. Laws. Ch. 21B, Sections 1-15.
    (2) Statutes governing licenses for minerals exploration, Mass. Ann. 
Laws Ch. 21, section 54-56.
    (g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance 
standards of Sec. Sec. 921.815 through 921.828 of this part if the 
applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface mining permit 
submitted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 921.772 through 921.785 demonstrates in 
the application that:
    (1) Such a variance is necessary because of the nature of 
Massachusetts' terrain, climate, biological, chemical or other relevant 
physical conditions; and
    (2) The proposed variance is not less effective than the 
environmental protection requirements of the regulations in this program 
and is consistent with the Act.

Sec. 922.700  Michigan Federal program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in Michigan which have been adopted under the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule 
is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the 
Michigan Federal program.
    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining 
operations in Michigan conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. 
The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal 
lands in Michigan.
    (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
    (e) The following provisions of Michigan laws provide, where 
applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of 
surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the 
regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of 
the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act:
    (1) The Michigan Reclamation of Mining Lands, Act 92 (1970), MCL 
section 425.181 et seq. as amended, to the extent that it regulates 
surface coal mining operations which affect two acres or less; or where 
less than 250 tons of coal are removed or intended to be removed for 
commercial use or sale in one location or; or where the extraction of 
coal is incidental to the extraction of other minerals and where coal 
does not exceed 16\2/3\ per centum of the tonnage of minerals removed 
for purposes of commercial use or sale; or coal explorations subject to 
section 512 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1262) or; where the extraction of coal 
is an incidental part of Federal, State, or local government-financed 
highway or other construction.
    (2) Michigan Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act, MCL section 
554.701, pertaining to land use restrictions including mineral 
extraction.
    (3) Michigan Solid Waste Regulations pertaining to solid waste 
management, MCL section 299.401, R-325.3231.
    (4) Michigan noxious weed statute and regulations containing the 
noxious weed list, MCL section 243.61.
    (f) The following are Michigan laws that interfere with the 
achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in 
accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded:
    The Michigan Reclamation of Mining Lands Act, MCL section 425.181 et 
seq. as amended, but not to the extent that it regulates surface coal 
mining operations which affect two acres or less; or where less than 250 
tons of coal are removed or intended to be removed for commercial use in 
one location; or where the extraction of coal is incidental to the 
extraction of other minerals and where coal does not exceed 16\2/3\ per 
centum of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposes of commercial use 
or sale; or coal explorations

<R05>
Sec. 925.17  Direct Federal enforcement of the Missouri program.

    Starting on August 22, 2003, OSM will directly implement, administer 
and enforce the Missouri program requirements to the extent outlined 
below in accordance with the enforcement provisions of SMCRA and the 
Federal regulations. The authority of the Missouri Department of Natural 
Resources, Air and Land Protection Division, Land Reclamation Program 
(MLRP) to implement the Missouri regulatory program is suspended with 
regard to those provisions listed below, with the following exceptions. 
With respect to State enforcement actions initiated before August 22, 
2003, the MLRP will have authority to take administrative actions to 
process outstanding violations to a final disposition (including issuing 
proposed assessments, assessing penalties, holding informal conferences 
and hearings, and collecting penalties). For enforcement actions that 
are terminated or vacated, OSM will inspect the sites and if a violation 
exists, we will take appropriate Federal enforcement action. With 
respect to bond forfeiture actions initiated before August 22, 2003, the 
MLRP will have authority to perform bond forfeiture reclamation 
activities. Bond forfeiture reclamation activities include, but are not 
limited to, issuing show-cause orders, revoking permits, initiating 
proceedings to declare bonds forfeited, and administering reclamation in 
lieu of bond forfeiture. The MLRP will have authority to perform bond 
forfeiture reclamation activities initiated after August 22, 2003, if 
show-cause orders to revoke permits were initiated before August 22, 
2003, and those show-cause orders subsequently result in forfeiture of 
the bond.
    (a) OSM will conduct inspections of all coal exploration and surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations, including bond release sites, in 
accordance with sections 517, 518, 521, 525, and 526 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 
1267, 1268, 1271, 1275, and 1276), 30 CFR parts 842 through 845, and 43 
CFR part 4. With respect to enforcement actions initiated by the MLRP 
before August 22, 2003, OSM will conduct follow-up inspections at all 
sites with outstanding violations on or after the abatement dates 
specified in the State-issued notices of violation. As required by 30 
CFR 733.12(f)(2)(iii), OSM will conduct inspections to determine 
compliance with the substantive requirements of the approved Missouri 
program.
    (b) OSM will issue, modify, enforce, and terminate notices of 
violation, cessation orders, and show cause orders for violations of the 
approved Missouri program, in accordance with sections 517, 518, 521, 
525, and 526 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1257, 1268, 1271, 1275, and 1276), 30 
CFR parts 842 through 845, and 43 CFR part 4. With respect to 
enforcement actions initiated by the MLRP before August 22, 2003, we 
will reinspect the site and if the operator has not abated the violation 
by the abatement date set in the State-issued notice of violation, we 
will take appropriate enforcement action. We will issue a notice of 
violation for any violation observed by us that has not been previously 
cited by the MLRP. We will issue a cessation order

[[Page 556]]

for any condition or practice that creates an imminent danger to the 
health or safety of the public, or is causing, or can reasonably be 
expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, 
or water resources.
    (c) OSM will impose civil and criminal sanctions, as appropriate, 
for violations of the Missouri program in accordance with sections 517, 
518, 521, 525, and 526 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1267, 1268, 1271, 1275, and 
1276), 30 CFR parts 843 through 847, and 43 CFR part 4 for those 
violations issued by OSM.
    (d) OSM will promptly inform the MLRP of the results of all follow-
up inspections conducted and of enforcement actions taken that pertain 
to enforcement actions initiated by the MLRP before August 22, 2003.
    (e) OSM will review all new applications and issue all new permits, 
permit revisions, permit renewals, transfer and assignment or sale of 
permit rights for all surface coal mining and reclamation operations in 
accordance with the approved Missouri program at sections 444.815 
through 444.825, 444.835 through 444.845, and 444.850 of the Missouri 
Surface Coal Mining Law (MSCML) and 10 CSR 40-6.010 through 40-6.120. 
This includes pending permit actions for which the MLRP has not made a 
final decision. Administrative and judicial review will be in accordance 
with sections 525 and 526 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1275 and 1276), 30 CFR 
part 775, and 43 CFR part 4.
    (f) Permit fees are required in accordance with section 444.820.1 of 
MSCML and 10 CSR 40-6.010(6). The fees for all new permitting actions 
must be submitted to and made payable to OSM.
    (g) OSM will determine the amount of the performance bonds for new 
permitting actions in accordance with section 509 of SMCRA and 30 CFR 
part 800.
    (h) OSM will maintain the amount of the performance bonds for 
existing permits in accordance with the Missouri program at section 
444.830 of MSCML and 10 CSR 40-7.011.
    (i) OSM will review and make decisions on performance bond release 
requests for new and existing permits in accordance with the Missouri 
program at section 444.875 of MSCML and 10 CSR 40-7.021. For existing 
bonds, OSM will make the required determinations for the amount of the 
bond to be released and will submit the determinations to the MLRP. The 
MLRP will present OSM's bond release determinations for the amount of 
the bond to be released to the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission, who 
will make a final decision on the release.
    (j) Performance bonds must be made payable to the ``United States of 
America and State of Missouri,'' and they must be submitted to OSM.
    (k) Administrative and judicial review of OSM's enforcement actions, 
performance bond release determinations, and final decisions on all 
other actions, including permitting, certification of blasters, and 
small operator assistance, will be in accordance with 43 CFR part 4. 
Administrative and judicial review of final bond release decisions made 
by the Commission for existing performance bonds will be subject to the 
procedures specified in the Missouri program at section 444.875 of MSCML 
and 10 CSR 40-7.021(4).
    (l) OSM will review and issue decisions on applications for blaster 
certification in accordance with the approved Missouri program at 
sections 444.855.2(15)(d) and 444.905.4 of MSCML and 10 CSR 40-3.160. 
The applicants must submit OSM Form 74 to OSM when applying for blaster 
certification. Administrative and judicial review of our decisions will 
be in accordance with 43 CFR part 4.
    (m) OSM will review and issue decisions on petitions to have areas 
designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations in 
accordance with the approved Missouri program at section 444.890 of 
MSCML and 10 CSR 40-5.020. Judicial review of our decisions will be in 
accordance with sections 526(a)(2) and (b) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 
1276(a)(2) and (b)) and 30 CFR 775.13.
    (n) OSM will review and issue decisions on applications for small 
operator assistance in accordance with section 507(c) of SMCRA (30 
U.S.C. 1257(c)) and the approved Missouri program at 10 CSR 40-8.050. 
Administrative and judicial review of our decisions will be in 
accordance with 43 CFR part 4.

Sec. 926.30  State-Federal cooperative agreement.

                          Cooperative Agreement

    The Governor of the State of Montana (Governor) and the Secretary of 
the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a State-Federal 
Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

        Article I: Authority, Purposes, and Responsible Agencies

                              A. Authority

    This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a 
State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary, 
under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an agreement for State 
control and regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal 
exploration operations \1\ not subject to 43 CFR Group 3400, and surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Montana on 
Federal lands consistent with SMCRA, the Federal lands program (30 CFR) 
Chapter VII, Subchapter D), and the Montana State Program (State 
Program), including among other things, the Montana Strip and 
Underground Mine Reclamation Act, Part 2, Chapter 4, Title 82, Montana 
Code Annotated (State Act or MCA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The term ``Exploration Operations'' is referred to as 
``Prospecting'' in the Montana State Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               B. Purposes

    The purposes of the Agreement are to (1) foster State-Federal 
cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Federal lands and coal exploration operations not subject 
to 43 CFR Group 3400; (2) minimize intergovernmental overlap and 
duplication; and (3) provide effective and uniform application of the 
State Program on all non-Indian lands in Montana.

process which bear on the responsibilities of OSM or other Federal 
agencies. DEQ shall send to OSM copies of any correspondence with the 
applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the 
PAP or transfer application. OSM shall send to DEQ copies of all OSM 
correspondence with the applicant and any other information received 
from the applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP or transfer 
application. Any conflicts or differences of opinions that may develop 
during the review process should be resolved at the lowest possible 
staff level.
    e. OSM shall have access to DEQ files concerning operations on 
Federal lands.
    f. Where a mining plan action is required pursuant to 30 CFR Part

will serve as the primary points of contact between OSM and DEQ 
throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of 
the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSM shall furnish DEQ 
with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for 
additional data. DEQ shall provide OSM all available information that 
may assist OSM in preparing any findings for the mining plan action.
    g. On matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR 
Group 3400, BLM will be the primary contact with the applicant and shall 
inform DEQ of its actions and provide DEQ with a copy of documentation 
on all decisions.
    h. Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to DEQ 
under applicable Federal laws other than SMCRA may be specified in 
working agreements between OSM and DEQ, with the concurrence of any 
Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
    i. In the case that valid existing rights (VER) are determined to 
exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where the 
proposed operation will adversely affect either a publicly-owned park, 
or a historic

[[Page 565]]

place listed in the National Register of Historic Sites, DEQ shall work, 
respectively, with the agency with jurisdiction over the publicly-owned 
park or the agency with jurisdiction over the historic place, to develop 
mutually acceptable terms and conditions for incorporation into the 
permit to mitigate adverse impacts.

             C. Approval of the PAP or Transfer Application

    1. DEQ shall make a decision on approval, conditional approval, or 
disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP or the 
transfer application on Federal lands.
    2. DEQ must consider the comments of Federal agencies in the context 
of permit issuance and will document these comments in the record of 
permit decisions. To the extent allowed by Montana law, permits issued 
by DEQ will include terms and conditions imposed by the Federal land 
management agency pursuant to applicable Federal laws and regulations 
other than SMCRA, in accordance with 30 CFR 740.13(c)(1). When Federal 
agencies recommend permit conditions and these conditions are not 
adopted by DEQ. DEQ will provide OSM with documentation as to why they 
were not incorporated as permit conditions.
    3. When a mining plan action is required pursuant to 30 CFR Part 
746, DEQ may make a decision on approval, conditional approval, or 
disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP on Federal 
lands in accordance with the State Program prior to the necessary 
Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that DEQ advises the 
applicant that Secretarial approval of the mining plan action must be 
obtained before the applicant may conduct surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on the Federal lands. To the extent allowed by 
the State law, DEQ shall reserve the right to amend or rescind any 
requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or conditions 
imposed by the Secretary in the approval of the mining plan.
    4. After making its decision on the permit application component of 
the PAP or transfer application, DEQ shall send a copy of the signed 
permit form and State decision document to the applicant, OSM, the 
Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction over a 
publicly-owned park, or historic property included in the NRHS which 
would be adversely affected by the surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. DEQ shall conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 
30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance 
with the approved State Program.
    B. DEQ shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection on Federal 
lands, file with OSM's appropriate Field Office an inspection report 
describing: (1) the general conditions of the lands under the lease, 
permit, or license; (2) the manner in which the operations are being 
conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable 
performance standards and reclamation requirements.
    C. DEQ will be the point of contact and inspection authority in 
dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with 
requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described in this 
Agreement and in the Secretary's regulations. Nothing in this Agreement 
shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for 
purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.
    D. Authorized representatives of the Secretary may conduct any 
inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR Parts 842 and 843, and with 
the Secretary's obligations under laws other than SMCRA.
    E. OSM shall give DEQ reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an 
inspection in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to 
join in the inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint 
supplying adequate proof of an imminent danger to the public health and 
safety, or a significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or 
water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it shall 
contact DEQ no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if 
practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen 
complaints which do not involve an imminent danger to the public health 
and safety, or a significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, 
or water resources, must be referred initially to DEQ for action. The 
Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice 
to DEQ, if necessary, to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. DEQ shall have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
State Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and 740.17(a)(2). 
Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under SMCRA, and its 
implementing regulations, or other Federal laws and Executive Orders, 
including, but not limited to, those listed in Appendix A, is reserved 
to the Secretary.
    B. During any joint inspection by OSM and DEQ, DEQ will have primary 
responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of 
cessation orders and notices of violation. DEQ shall consult with OSM 
prior to issuance of any decision to suspend, rescind or revoke a permit 
on Federal lands.

[[Page 566]]

DEQ shall notify BLM of any suspension, rescission or revocation of a 
permit containing leased Federal coal pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(f)(2).
    C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection 
where DEQ an OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular 
enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to 
comply with 30 CFR Parts 842, 843, 845 and 846.
    D. DEQ and OSM shall promptly notify each other of all violations 
and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
    E. Personnel of DEQ and OSM shall be mutually available to serve as 
witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.
    F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority 
to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. DEQ and the Secretary shall require all operators on Federal 
lands to submit a single performance bond jointly payable to both the 
United States and DEQ. The board shall be of sufficient amount to cover 
the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the State Program. The 
bond shall be conditioned upon continued compliance with all 
requirements of SMCRA, 30 CFR Chapter VII, the State Program, and the 
permit. Such bond shall provide that if this Agreement is terminated 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15, the portion of the bond covering 
the Federal lands shall be payable only to the United States.
    B. DEQ will have primary responsibility for the approval and release 
of performance bonds required for surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Federal lands. However, release of a performance bond on 
lands subject to an approved mining plan requires the concurrence of OSM 
as provided in 30 CFR 740.15(d)(3). Prior to such concurrence, OSM shall 
coordinate with other Federal agencies having the authority over the 
lands involved. DEQ shall annually advice OSM of adjustments to the 
performance bond.
    C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with he

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities, and Valid 
            Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

                       A. Unsuitability Petitions

    1. Authority to designate or terminate the designation of areas of 
Federal lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary. 
Unsuitability petitions shall be filed with OSM and would be processed 
in accordance with 30 CFR 769.
    2. When either DEQ or OSM receives a petition that could impact 
adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of 
SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of 
receipt of the petition and the anticipated schedule for reaching a 
decision. OSM shall coordinate with and solicit comments from the 
applicable Federal land management agency. OSM and DEQ shall fully 
consider data, information, and recommendations of all agencies.

     B. Valid Existing Rights (VER) and Compatibility Determinations

    The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations 
of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, or for determinations of 
compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA are received:
    1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified 
under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, the Secretary will make the VER 
determination. If surface coal mining and reclamation operations would 
be conducted on both Federal and non-Federal lands within such areas, 
the Secretary will make the VER determination for the Federal lands and 
DEQ will make the VER determination for State and private lands.
    2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest 
where proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations are 
prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 
761.11(b), the Secretary will make VER determinations. OSM will process 
requests for determinations of compatibility under section 522(e)(2) of 
SMCRA and part 30 CFR 761.12(c).
    3. Where a VER determination is requested for Federal lands 
protected under section 522(e)(3), DEQ will make the VER determination. 
DEQ will determine, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation 
Officer, whether any proposed operation will adversely affect any 
publicly-owned park or historic place listed on the National Register of 
Historic Sites (NRHS).
    Surface coal mining and reclamation operations of Federal lands 
protected under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA may be permitted if approved 
jointly by DEQ, and the Federal, State, or local agency with 
jurisdiction over

[[Page 567]]

the park or historic place. DEQ will coordinate with any agency with 
jurisdiction over the publicly-owned park or historic place to develop 
mutually acceptable terms and conditions for incorporation into the 
permit in order to mitigate environmental impacts.
    4. DEQ will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all 
areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e)(4) and (5) of SMCRA as 
unsuitable for mining.
    5. For operations on Federal lands, whenever DEQ is responsible for 
making the VER determinations, DEQ will consult with OSM and any 
affected agency.

                Article XI: Termination of the Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

               Article XII: Reinstatement of the Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or part, it may be 
reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

                Article XIII: Amendments of the Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. The Secretary or the State may, from time to time, revise and 
promulgate new or revised performance or reclamation requirements or 
enforcement and administrative procedures. Each party shall, if it is 
determined to be necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or 
revise its respective laws or regulations or request necessary 
legislative action. Such changes will be made under the procedures of 30 
CFR Part 732 for changes to the State Program and under the procedures 
of section 501 of SMCRA for changes to the Federal lands program.
    B. DEQ and OSM shall provide each other with copies of any changes 
to their respective laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining 
to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    A. DEQ and OSM shall, consistent with 30 CFR Part 745, advise each 
other of changes in the organization, structure, functions, duties and 
funds of the offices, departments, divisions, and persons within their 
organizations which could affect administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. Each shall promptly advise the other in writing of changes in 
key personnel, including the head of a department or division, or 
changes in the functions or duties of the principal offices of the 
program. DEQ and OSM shall advise each other in writing of changes in 
the location of their respective offices, addresses, telephone numbers, 
as well as changes in the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of 
their respective personnel.
    B. Should the State Act be amended to transfer administration of the 
State Act to another agency, all references to DEQ in this Agreement 
shall be deemed to apply to the successor regulatory agency as of the 
date of the transfer. The provisions in this Agreement shall thereafter 
apply to that agency.

                   Article XVI: Reservation of Rights

    In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be 
construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have 
not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under laws other than the Act and the State Program, 
including, but not limited to those listed in Appendix A.

the lands; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; 
and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance 
and reclamation requirements.
    19. Mining and Minerals will be the point of contact and primary 
inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations 
and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except 
as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent 
inspections by authorized Federal agencies for purposes other than those 
covered by this Agreement.
    20. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply 
with 30 CFR parts 842 and 743.
    21. Except as provided below, the Secretary shall give Mining and 
Minerals reasonable notice of his intent to conduct an inspection in 
order to provide State inspectors an opportunity to join in the 
inspection. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections 
without prior notice to Mining and Minerals to carry out his 
responsibilities under the Federal Act.

                         Article IX: Enforcement

    22. Mining and Minerals shall be the primary enforcement authority 
under the Federal Act concerning compliance with the requirements of 
this Agreement and the Program. Enforcement authority of the Secretary 
under other laws and orders including, but not limited to, those listed 
in Appendix A is reserved to the Secretary.
    23. During any joint inspection by OSM and Mining and Minerals, 
Mining and Minerals shall have primary responsibility for enforcement 
procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of 
violation and assessment of penalties. OSM and Mining and Minerals shall 
consult prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.
    24. Mining and Minerals and OSM shall promptly notify each other of 
all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, approved mining 
plans and permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken 
with respect to such violations.
    25. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection 
where Mining and Minerals and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety 
of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement 
action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
    Such enforcement action shall be based on the performance standards 
included in the regulations of the Program, and the procedures and 
penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. This Agreement 
does not limit the Department's authority to enforce violations of 
standards and requirements of Federal laws other than the Federal Act.
    26. Personnel of the State and the Department shall be mutually 
available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either 
party.

                            Article X: Bonds

    27. For all surface coal mines on Federal lands, Mining and Minerals 
and the Secretary shall require all operators to submit a single 
performance bond to cover the operator's responsibilities under the 
Federal Act and the Program, payable to the State, and if required by 
Federal regulations in Subchapter D, the United States. The performance 
bond shall be of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of 
both State and Federal law and release of the bond shall be conditioned 
upon compliance with all applicable State and Federal requirements. If 
the cooperative agreement is terminated, the bonds will revert to being 
payable only to the United States to the extent that Federal lands are 
involved. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the 
requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR 3474 or a 
lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in 
certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Federal Act.
    28. Prior to releasing the operator from an obligation under the 
performance bond required by the Program for any Federal lands, Mining 
and Minerals shall obtain the consent of OSM. Mining and Minerals shall 
also

    33. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the State 
and the Department. An amendment proposed by one party shall be 
submitted to the other with a statement of the reasons for such proposed 
amendment. The amendment shall be adopted after Federal rulemaking in 
accordance with 30 CFR 745.11. The party to whom the proposed amendment 
is submitted shall signify its acceptance or rejection of the proposed 
amendment, and if rejected shall state the reasons for rejection.

            Article XV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    34. The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new 
or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and 
administration procedures. Each party shall, it it determines it to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the State 
Program, and under the procedures of section 501 of the Federal Act for 
changes to the Federal Lands Program.
    35. The State and the Department shall provide each other with 
copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations and 
standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this 
Agreement.

           Article XVI: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    36. The State and the Department shall, consistent with 30 CFR 
745.12, advise each other of changes in the organization, structure, 
functions, duties and funds of the offices, departments, divisions and 
persons within their organizations. Each shall promptly advise the other 
in writing of changes in key personnel, including the head of a 
department or division, or changes in the functions or duties of persons 
occupying the principal offices within the structure of the Program. The 
State and the Department shall advise each other in writing of changes 
in the location of offices, addresses, telephone numbers and changes in 
the names, locations and telephone numbers of their respective mine 
inspectors and the area within the State for which such inspectors are

<R05>
Sec. 933.700  North Carolina Federal program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in North Carolina which have been adopted under the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule 
is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the 
North Carolina Federal program.

[[Page 579]]

    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining 
operations in North Carolina conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian 
lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on 
Federal lands in North Carolina.
    (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
    (e) The following provisions of North Carolina laws and regulations 
provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and 
regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining operations than do the 
provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, 
pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be 
inconsistent with the Act unless in a particular instance the rules in 
this chapter are found by OSM to establish more stringent environmental 
controls.
    (1) North Carolina General Statute (NCGS) 74-51, concerning 
conditions under which a mining permit may be granted, authorized the 
North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development 
to deny a permit for a mining operation which will have a significantly 
adverse effect on the purposes of a publicly owned park, forest, or 
recreation area and may condition permit approval on a requirement of 
visual screening, vegetative or otherwise, so as to screen the view of 
the operation from public highways, public parks, or residential areas 
where the Department finds such screening to be feasible and desirable, 
or determines that such screening measures are either not feasible or 
not desirable.
    (2) North Carolina mining laws and regulations apply to mining 
operations affecting an area greater than one acre. To the extent that 
North Carolina mining law and regulations cited in paragraph (f) of this 
section apply to coal mining operations not regulated by the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act, they are not preempted by this 
Federal program for North Carolina.
    (3) North Carolina Dam Safety Law of 1967, North Carolina General 
Statutes (NCGS) 143-215.23 through 143-215.37.
    (4) Geophysical Exploration regulations, Title 15, North Carolina 
Administrative Code, Subchapter 5C, applies to any coal exploration 
involving the use of explosives.
    (f) The following are North Carolina laws and regulations that 
generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and 
requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of 
the Act, preempted and superseded to the extent that they regulate coal 
exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations regulated 
by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Other North Carolina 
laws may interfere with the achievement of the proposes of goals of the 
Act in an individual situation, and may be preempted and superseded as 
they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by 
publication of the notice to that effect in the Federal Register.
    (1) North Carolina Mining Act of 1971, as amended, NCGS 74-46 
through 74-68, except to the extent that the Mining Act is preserved as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Title 15, North Carolina Administrative Code, Subchapters 5A, 
5B, and 5F Mining and Mineral Resources, except to the extent that those 
regulations are preserved as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance 
standards of Sec. Sec. 933.815 through 933.828 of this part if the 
applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface mining permit 
submitted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 933.772 through 933.785 demonstrates in 
the application that: (1) Such variance is necessary because of the 
unique nature of North Carolina's terrain, climate, biological, 
chemical, or other relevant physical conditions; and (2) the proposed 
alternative will achieve equal or greater environmental protection than 
does the performance requirement from which the variance is requested.

Sec. 934.30  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

                          Cooperative Agreement

    This is a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) between North Dakota 
(State) acting by and through the North Dakota Public Service Commission 
(Commission) and the Governor, and the United States Department of the 
Interior (Interior), acting by and through the Secretary of the Interior 
(Secretary) and the Office of Surface Mining (OSM).

                   Article I: Introduction and Purpose

    A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Federal Act), Pub. L. 95-87, 
30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory 
program approved under 30 U.S.C. 1253 to elect to enter into an 
Agreement for the regulation and control of surface coal mining on 
Federal lands, and by Chapter 38-14.1 of the North Dakota Century Code, 
Reclamation of Surface Mined Lands (State Act). This Agreement provides 
for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
on Federal lands within North Dakota consistent with the State and 
Federal Acts and the Federal lands program (section 523(a) of the 
Federal Act and 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D).
    B. Purpose: The purpose of the Agreement is to: (1) Foster State-
Federal cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations; (2) eliminate unnecessary intergovernmental 
overlap and duplication; and (3) provide uniform and effective 
application of the State Program on all non-Indian lands in North 
Dakota.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    Following signing by the Secretary, the Governor, and the 
Commission, the Agreement shall take effect upon publication in the 
Federal Register as a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect 
until terminated as provided in Article X.

                           Article III: Scope

    In accordance with the Federal lands program in 30 CFR parts 740-
746, the laws, rules, terms, and conditions of North Dakota's Permanent 
State Program (Program) (conditionally approved effective December 15, 
1980, 30 CFR 934.11 or as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30 CFR 
732.17) are applicable to Federal lands within North Dakota except as 
otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Federal Act, 30 CFR 745.13, or
other applicable laws or rules and regulations. Orders and decisions 
issued by the Commission in accordance with the State Program that are 
reviewable shall be reviewed pursuant to section 38-14.1-30 of the North 
Dakota Century Code. Orders and decisions issued by the Department that 
are appealable shall be appealed to the Department of the Interior's 
Office of Hearings and Appeals.

           Article IV: Requirements for Cooperative Agreement

    The Commission and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with 
all of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all 
the conditions and requirements specified in this Article.

   Article V: Policies and Procedures: Review of a Permit Application 
       Package or an Application for a Permit Renewal or Revision

    A. Contents of Permit Application Package: The Commission and the 
Secretary will require that an operator proposing to mine on Federal 
land shall submit an identical permit application package in an 
appropriate number of copies to the Commission and OSM. Any 
documentation or information submitted by the operator for the sole 
purpose of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 7(c) of the 
Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) will be submitted directly 
to the Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior. The permit 
application package shall be in the form required by the Commission and 
include any supplemental information required by the Secretary. The 
permit application package shall satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 
Chapter VII, Subchapter D and shall include the information required by, 
or necessary for, the Commission and the Secretary, acting within their 
statutory authority, to make a determination of compliance with:
    (1) Chapter 38-14.1 and Chapter 38-18 of the North Dakota Century 
Code;
    (2) Article 69-05.2 of the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC);
    (3) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease;
    (4) Applicable requirements of the Bureau of Land Management's 30 
CFR part 211 \1\ regulations pertaining to the Mineral Leasing Act; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Editorial Note: 30 CFR part 211 was redesignated as 43 CFR part 
3480 at 48 FR 41589, Sept. 16, 1983.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Applicable requirements of other Federal laws and the Program, 
including but not limited to those in Appendix A of this Agreement.
    B. Review Procedures: 1. The Commission shall assume primary 
responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval of permit 
applications required by 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D for surface 
coal mining on Federal lands in North Dakota. OSM shall, as requested, 
assist the Commission in this analysis and review.
    2. The Commission shall be the primary point of contact for 
operators regarding the approval of the permit application package, 
except on matters concerned exclusively with the 30 CFR part 211 \1\ 
regulations administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The 
Commission will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint 
State-Federal or Federal determinations, except matters concerned 
exclusively with the 30 CFR part 211 \1\ regulations. The Commission 
shall send to the Bureau of Land Management all correspondence with the 
applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding Mineral 
Leasing Act requirements. Except in exigent circumstances, OSM shall 
generally not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding 
completeness or deficiencies of permit application packages with respect 
to matters which are properly within the jurisdiction of the Commission. 
The Commission may arrange for an operator to send written 
communications and documents regarding a permit application package 
directly to OSM. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently 
of the Commission to carry out his responsibilities under laws other 
than the Federal Act. A copy of any independent correspondence with the 
applicant required to carry out these responsibilities which may have a 
bearing on decisions regarding the permit application package shall be 
sent to the State.
    3. OSM is responsible for ensuring that any information OSM receives 
from an applicant regarding the permit application package is sent to 
the Commission and the Commission will send any information received 
from the applicant to OSM. OSM shall have access to Commission files for 
mines on Federal lands. OSM and the Commission shall regularly 
coordinate with each other during the permit application package review 
process.
    4. OSM shall be responsible for obtaining, in a timely manner, the 
views of all Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility

[[Page 590]]

over a permit application package on Federal lands in North Dakota and 
for making these views known to the Commission within 90 days of the 
receipt of the application by OSM. The Commission shall keep OSM 
informed of findings during the review which bear on the 
responsibilities of other Federal agencies. OSM shall take appropriate 
steps to facilitate discussions between the Commission and the concerned 
agencies wherever desirable to resolve issues or problems identified in 
the review.
    5. Upon receipt of a permit application package, both OSM and the 
Commission shall each designate its application manager. The application 
managers shall serve as the primary point of contact between OSM and the 
Commission throughout the review process and shall be responsible for 
identifying areas of avoidable duplication of review and analysis, which 
shall be eliminated where possible. Not later than 15 days after an 
application has been received, OSM and the Commission shall discuss the 
application and agree upon a work plan and schedule for the review of 
the application. OSM shall thereafter inform the Commission of any 
specific or general areas of concern, including the scope of required 
environmental analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act, 
which require special handling or analysis. The Commission shall 
likewise inform OSM where OSM assistance will be needed to perform any 
specific or general analysis or prepare any studies or similar work.
    6. The Commission shall prepare a technical-environmental analysis 
on the permit application package. Copies of drafts of this document 
shall be sent to OSM for review and comment. OSM shall independently 
evaluate the documents and inform the Commission within 30 days of any 
changes that should be made. The Commission shall consider the comments 
of OSM and send a final technical-environmental analysis to OSM which 
will form the basis for and be included in the decision document which 
OSM will prepare for the Secretary's consideration. The Commission shall 
approve or disapprove the permit application by written decision in 
accordance with the Program. The Secretary's decision on the mining plan 
and those other Federal responsibilities which cannot be delegated 
(including but not limited to those listed in Appendix A) shall be made 
concurrently with or as soon as possible after the final decision of the 
Commission on the permit. The permit issued by the Commission shall 
condition the initiation of surface coal mining operations on Federal 
lands within the permit area on obtaining mining plan approval from the 
Secretary. The Commission shall, in the approved permit, reserve the 
right to amend or rescind its action to conform with action taken, or 
with terms or conditions imposed, by the Secretary when approving the 
mining plan. After the Commission makes its decision on the permit, it 
shall send a notice to the applicant and OSM with a statement of 
findings and conclusions in support of the action.
    7. The Commission may approve and issue permits, permit renewals, 
and permit revisions for surface disturbances associated with surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations, and disturbance of the surface 
may commence without need for an approved mining plan on lands where:
    (a) The surface estate is non-Federal and non-Indian;
    (b) The mineral estate is Federal and is unleased;
    (c) The Commission consults with the Bureau of Land Management 
through OSM in order to insure that actions are not taken which would 
substantially and adversely affect the Federal mineral estate; and
    (d) The proposed surface disturbances are planned to support surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations on adjacent non-Federal lands and 
this is specified in the permit, permit renewal, or permit revision.
    8. Any permit renewal requested pursuant to applicable State laws 
and rules for a surface coal mining and reclamation operation on Federal 
lands, and for which a mining plan has been approved by the Secretary, 
shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Commission in 
consultation with OSM for Federal responsibility under other laws. The 
Commission shall inform OSM and BLM of the approval or disapproval of 
the renewal and provide OSM and BLM with copies of the application 
documents.
    9. The Commission shall inform OSM of each permit revision request 
with respect to surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
Federal lands containing leased Federal coal. For other Federal lands, 
the Commission shall inform the Federal land management agency of each 
permit revision request. Surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
shall not occur pursuant to the revision unless the permit revision 
request has been approved by the Commission and:
    (a) With respect to Federal lands containing leased Federal coal--
    (i) The Secretary has determined that the permit revision does not 
constitute a mining plan modification, or
    (ii) If the revision does constitute a mining plan modification, the 
modification has been approved by the Secretary.
    (b) With respect to other Federal lands, the Commission has 
consulted with the Federal land management agency to ensure that the 
permit revision is consistent with Federal laws and regulations other 
than the Act.
    10. When the Commission and OSM cannot resolve differences that 
develop during permit application package review or cannot

[[Page 591]]

agree on the final actions to be taken by the Commission and the 
Department, the matter shall be referred to the Governor and the 
Secretary for resolution.

                         Article VI: Inspections

    The Commission shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and 
prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the approved 
Program.
    A. Inspection Reports: The Commission shall, within 15 days of 
conducting any inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection 
report describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the 
permit; (2) whether the operator is complying with applicable 
performance and reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which 
specific operations are being conducted.
    B. Commission Authority: The Commission shall be the point of 
contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator 
concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by 
this Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and the 
Secretary's regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent 
inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other 
than those covered by this Agreement.
    C. OSM Authority: For the purpose of evaluating the manner in which 
this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that performance and 
reclamation standards are being met, OSM may conduct inspections of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands without 
prior notice to the Commission. In order to facilitate a joint Federal-
State inspection, when OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an 
imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or of a 
significant, imminent environmental harm pursuant to 30 CFR 
842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact the Commission if circumstances and 
time permit, prior to the Federal inspection. The Department may conduct 
any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842 and 30 CFR 
740.17 (as 30 CFR 740.17 relates to obligations under laws other than 
the Federal Act). If an inspection is made without Commission 
inspectors, OSM shall provide the Commission with a copy of the 
inspection report within 15 days after the inspections.
    D. Witness Availability: Personnel of the State and the Department 
shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions 
taken by either party.

                        Article VII: Enforcement

    A. Commission Enforcement: The Commission shall have primary 
enforcement authority on Federal lands in accordance with the Program 
and this Agreement. During any joint inspection by OSM and the 
Commission, the Commission shall take appropriate enforcement action, 
including issuance of orders of cessation and notices of violation. OSM 
and the Commission shall consult prior to issuance of any decision to 
suspend or revoke a permit.
    B. Notification: The Commission and OSM shall promptly notify each 
other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, 
approved mining and reclamation plans and permits subject to this 
Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
    C. Secretary's Authority: (1) This Agreement does not affect or 
limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of laws other than 
the Federal Act. (2) During any inspection made solely by OSM or any 
joint inspection where the Commission and OSM fail to agree regarding 
the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any 
enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. 
Such enforcement action shall be based on the substantive standards 
included in the approved Program and shall be taken using the procedures 
and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.

                           Article VIII: Bonds

    A. Bond Coverage and Terms: The Commission and OSM shall require all 
operators on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond to cover 
the operator's responsibilities under the Federal Act and the Program, 
payable to both the United States and North Dakota. The performance bond 
shall be of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of both 
State and Federal law and release of the performance bond shall be 
conditioned upon compliance with all applicable requirements. If this 
Agreement is terminated, the bond will continue in effect and to the 
extent that Federal lands are involved will be payable to the United 
States.
    Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements 
for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR Subpart 3474 or a lessee 
protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain 
circumstances, by section 715 of the Federal Act.
    B. Bond Release: The Commission shall obtain OSM's concurrence prior 
to releasing the operator from any performance bonding obligation 
required under the Program for any Federal lands containing leased 
Federal coal. For surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
other Federal lands, the Commission shall obtain the concurrence of the 
Federal land management agency prior to releasing the performance bond. 
The Commission shall advise OSM of any release of and adjustments made 
to the performance bond.
    C. Forfeiture: The operator's performance bond shall be subject to 
forfeiture with the

[[Page 592]]

consent of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of 
the Program.

             Article IX: Designation of Lands as Unsuitable

    The Commission and OSM shall cooperate in the review and processing 
of petitions to designate lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining 
operations. When either agency receives a petition which could have an 
impact on lands the designation of which as unsuitable for mining would 
be the responsibility of the other agency, the agency shall: (1) Notify 
the other of its receipt of the petition and of the anticipated schedule 
for reaching a decision; and (2) request and fully consider data, 
information and views of the other. The authority to designate Federal 
lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary or his 
designated representative.

             Article X: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated as follows:
    A. Termination by the State: The Agreement may be terminated by the 
Commission upon written notice to the Secretary, specifying the date

not be less than 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal 
Register. Prior to the time fixed for public hearing, representatives of 
the Commission may be permitted to appear and confer in person with 
representatives of the Secretary and present oral or written statements, 
and any other documents relative to the proposed termination.
    3. The proposed termination hearing shall be conducted by OSM and a 
record shall be made of the hearing. The Commission shall be entitled to 
have legal, and technical and other representatives present at the 
hearing, and may present, either orally or in writing, evidence, 
information, testimony, documents, records or materials as may be 
relevant to the issues involved.
    4. The Secretary's decision shall be made after the hearing and 
close of the comment period.
    5. A decision to terminate the Agreement may be made if the 
Secretary finds in writing that:
    (a) The Commission has substantially failed to comply with the 
requirements of the Federal Act, 30 CFR parts 740-746, the Program, or 
provisions of this Agreement; or
    (b) The Commission has failed to comply with any undertaking by the 
Commission in this Agreement upon which the approval of the Program, 
this Agreement, or grants by OSM for administration or enforcement of 
the Program or this Agreement were based.
    6. The Secretary shall send written notice of the decision and 
findings to the Commission and publish notice of it in the Federal 
Register.
    7. This Agreement shall terminate not less than 60 days after

Register. The Commission may remedy any failure during the 60-day 
period. If the Secretary determines that the State has taken effective 
remedial action, the Agreement will not terminate.
    C. Termination by Operation of Law: This Agreement shall terminate 
by operation of law under either of the following circumstances:
    1. When no longer authorized by Federal law or North Dakota laws and 
regulations; or
    2. Upon termination or withdrawal of the Secretary's approval of the 
Program pursuant to 30 CFR part 733.
    D. Mutual Termination: This Agreement may be terminated at any time 
upon mutual agreement by the Secretary and the Commission.

           Article XI: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated as provided in Article X, it 
may be reinstated upon application by the Commission and upon its giving 
evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that the Commission can and will 
comply with all the provisions of the Agreement and that the Commission 
has remedied all defects in administration for which this Agreement was 
terminated.

            Article XII: Amendments To Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Commission 
and the Secretary. An amendment proposed by one party shall be submitted 
to the other with a statement of the reasons for such proposed 
amendment. The amendment shall be adopted or rejected in accordance with 
the requirements of 30 CFR 745.11. The party to

[[Page 593]]

whom the proposed amendment is submitted shall signify its acceptance or 
rejection of the proposed amendment and if rejected shall state the 
reason for rejection.

           Article XIII: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. Time for Change: The Secretary or the State may from time to time 
promulgate new Federal or State regulations, including new or revised 
performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement or administration 
procedures. OSM and the Commission shall immediately inform each other 
of any final changes in their respective laws or regulations as provided 
in 30 CFR part 732. Each party shall, if it is determined to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the 
Program and section 501 of the Federal Act for changes to the Federal 
lands program.
    B. Copies of Changes: The State and OSM shall provide each other 
with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations, 
and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this 
Agreement.

or division, or changes in the functions or duties of persons occupying 
the principal offices within the structure of the program. The 
Commission and OSM shall advise each other in writing of changes in the 
location of offices, addresses, telephone numbers, and changes in the 
names, location and telephone numbers of their respective mine 
inspectors and the area within the State for which such inspectors are 
responsible.

                    Article XV: Reservation of Rights

    In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be

<R05>
Sec. 935.30  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

    The Governor of the State of Ohio, acting through the Department of 
Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Division), and the Secretary 
of the Department of the Interior, acting through the Office of Surface 
Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), enter into a Cooperative 
Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

 Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Administrative Agency

    A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), 
which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the 
Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement with 
the Secretary of the Department of the Interior for State regulation of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. This 
Agreement provides for State regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and of coal exploration operations not subject to 
43 CFR part 3480, subparts 3480 through 3487, on Federal lands in Ohio 
which are under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, Forest Service, except those lands containing leased 
Federal coal, consistent with State and Federal laws governing such 
activities in Ohio, the Federal lands program (30 CFR parts 740-745) and 
the Ohio State program (approved State program).
    B. Purpose: The purpose of this Agreement is to (a) foster Federal-
State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations; (b) eliminate intergovernmental overlap and 
duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the 
approved State program on all lands in Ohio, except those containing 
leased Federal coal, in accordance with the Act, the approved State 
program, and this Agreement.
    C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Division shall be 
responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. 
The Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals Management, acting through 
OSM, shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary in 
accordance with the regulations in 30 CFR Chapter VII. The Federal lands 
in Ohio covered by this Agreement are only those under the jurisdiction 
of the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (Forest 
Service) and include all or parts of the Wayne National Forest. It is 
understood by both parties that the Forest Service will continue to be 
involved in mining operations on its respective lands pursuant to its 
laws, regulations, agreements and

[[Page 598]]

restrictions. These requirements are in addition to the requirements 
discussed in this Agreement.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After it has been signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this 
Agreement shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register as 
a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as 
provided in Article V.B. or X.

                        Article III: Definitions

    Any terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
the Act, 30 CFR parts 700, 701, and 740, or the approved State program 
shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there 
is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal 
definitions, the definitions used in the approved State program will 
apply, except in the case of a term or phrase which defines the 
Secretary's non-delegable responsibilities under the Act and other laws.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    In accordance with the Federal lands program in 30 CFR parts 740-
745, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the approved State 
program (conditionally approved on August 10, 1982, 30 CFR part 935, or 
as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17) are applicable 
to surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in 
Ohio except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Act, 30 CFR 
745.13, or other applicable laws or regulations.
    This Agreement does not apply to surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on lands containing leased Federal coal. This Agreement 
applies only to lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the 
conditions and requirements specified in this Article.
    A. Authority of State Agency: The Division has and shall continue to 
have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    B. Funds: Upon application by the Division and subject to the 
availability of appropriations, the Department shall provide the State 
with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out 
responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of 
the Act and 30 CFR part 735. If the State requests funds and sufficient 
funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and the Division shall meet 
promptly to decide on appropriate measures that will ensure that surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations are regulated in accordance with 
the approved State program. If agreement cannot be reached, then either 
party may terminate the Agreement. Funds provided to the State under 
this Agreement shall be reduced; in proportion to the amount of fees 
collected by the State that are attributable to the Federal lands 
covered by this Agreement.
    C. Reports and Records: The Division shall make annual reports to 
OSMRE on the results of the Division's implementation and administration 
of this Agreement, pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, the 
Division and OSMRE shall exchange information developed under this 
Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal law. OSMRE shall provide 
the Division with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared 
concerning the Division's administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement.
    D. Personnel: The Division shall have the necessary personnel to 
implement this Agreement fully in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act and the approved State program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: The Division will assure itself 
access to facilities which are necessary to carry out the requirements 
of the Agreement.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

    The Division shall assume the primary responsibility for the review 
of permit application packages for surface coal mining and reclamation 
and coal exploration operations on Forest Service lands covered by this 
Agreement. The Division shall coordinate the review of permit 
application packages with the Forest Service and other Federal agencies 
which may be affected by the proposed surface coal mining and 
reclamation operation to ensure compliance with Federal laws other than 
the Act and regulations other than the approved State program. When 
requested by the State, OSMRE shall assist the State in identifying 
Federal agencies other than the Forest Service which may be affected by 
the mining proposal.
    A. Submission of Permit Application Package: The Division shall 
require an operator proposing to mine on Forest Service lands to submit 
a permit application package in an appropriate number of copies to the 
Division. The permit application package shall be in the format required 
by the Divison and include any supplemental information (as specified by 
OSMRE or the Forest Service) needed to satisfy the requirements of non-
delegable requirements of the Act, Federal laws other than the Act, and 
regulations other than the approved State program.
    B. Coordination With Affected Agencies: Upon receipt, the Division 
shall transmit a copy of the complete permit application package to the 
Forest Service and to other Federal agencies affected by the proposed

[[Page 599]]

surface coal mining and reclamation operation with a request for review 
pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(c)(4). OSM shall determine whether or not a 
proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation is prohibited or 
limited by the requirements of section 522(e) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 
1272(e)) and 30 CFR parts 760-762 with respect to Federal areas 
designated by Congress as unsuitable for mining and shall make any 
necessary determinations under section 522(b) of the Act. The Division 
shall obtain, in a timely manner, the comments of the Forest Service and 
other Federal agencies affected by the mining proposal.
    C. Contact With the Applicant: As a matter of practice, OSMRE will 
not independently initiate contacts with the applicant regarding permit 
application packages. However, OSMRE reserves the right to act 
independently of the Division to carry out any non-delegable 
responsibilities under the Act, or under other Federal laws and 
regulations, provided, however, that OSMRE shall inform the Division of 
the necessity of such action taken and send copies of all relevant 
correspondence to the Division.
    D. File and Records: The Division shall maintain a title of all 
original correspondence with the applicant and any information received 
which may have a bearing on decisions regarding surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Forest Service lands. Upon request, the 
Division shall provide, for OSMRE or Forest Service review, copies of 
any titles and records for surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Forest Service lands.
    E. Permit Application Decision and Permit Issuance: After 
consultation with the Forest Service and after making a finding of 
compliance with the approved State program and other applicable 
requirements, the Division may approve a permit application or 
application for permit revision or renewal and issue a permit. The 
permit issued by the Division shall condition the initiation of surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations on compliance with the 
requirements of the approved State program and, as applicable, 
requirements of OSM or the Forest Service pursuant to Federal laws other 
than the Act and regulations other than the approved State program. 
After the Division issues its decision on the permit application, it 
shall promptly send a notice of the action to OSM and to the Forest 
Service.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    The Division shall conduct inspections on Forest Service lands 
covered by this Agreement and prepare and file inspection reports in 
accordance with the approved State program.
    A. Inspection Reports: The Division shall, within 15 days of 
conducting any inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection 
report describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the 
permit; (2) whether the operator is complying with the applicable 
performance and reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which 
specific operations are being conducted.
    B. Division Authority: The Division shall be the point of contact 
and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning 
operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this 
Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's 
regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by 
authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those 
covered by this Agreement.
    C. OSM Authority: For the purpose of evaluating the manner in which 
this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that performance and 
reclamation standards are being met, OSM may conduct inspections of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands, without 
prior notice to the Division. In order to facilitate a joint Federal-
State inspection, when OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an 
imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or of a 
significant, imminent environmental harm pursuant to 30 CFR 
842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact the Division, if circumstances and time 
permit, prior to the Federal inspection. OSM may conduct any inspections 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842. If an inspection is made 
without Division inspectors, OSM shall provide the Division with a copy 
of the inspection report within 10 days after inspection.
    D. Witness Availability: Personnel of the State and OSM shall be 
mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by 
either party.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. Division Enforcement: The Division shall have primary enforcement 
authority on Federal lands covered by this Agreement in accordance with 
the approved State program and this Agreement. During any joint 
inspection by OSM and the Division, the Division shall take appropriate 
enforcement action, including issuance of orders of cessation and 
notices of violation.
    B. Notification: The Division shall promptly notify the Forest 
Service of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, and 
approved permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
lands administered by the Forest Service.
    C. Secretary's Authority: (1) This Agreement does not affect or 
limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of laws other than 
the Act. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSM or any joint 
inspection where

[[Page 600]]

the Division and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any 
particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement 
action shall be based on the Act or the applicable substantive 
provisions included in the regulations of the approved State program and 
shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 
CFR parts 843 and 845.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. Performance Bond: The Division shall require all operators on 
Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a performance bond to 
cover the operator's responsibilities under the Federal Act and the 
approved State program, payable to both the United States and Ohio. The 
performance bond shall be of sufficient amount to comply with the 
requirements of the approved State program and any other conditions of 
the permit. Release of the performance bond shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with all applicable requirements. The Division shall obtain 
the concurrence of the Forest Service prior to releasing the operator 
from any obligation under the performance bond. If this Agreement is 
terminated, (1) the bond will revert to being payable only to the United 
States to the extent that Federal lands are involved, and (2) the bond 
will be delivered by the Division to OSM if only Federal lands are 
covered by the bond.
    B. Forfeiture: In the event of forfeiture by an operator of the 
performance bond for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
Federal lands covered by this Agreement, the State shall use funds 
received from bond forfeiture and, where necessary, funds from the Ohio 
Reclamation Forfeiture Special Account (pursuant to section 1513.18 of 
the Ohio Revised Code) to ensure that reclamation is accomplished in 
accordance with the approved State program and the approved permit.

             Article X: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

           Article XI: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part it may be 
reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

             Article XII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIII: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. Effect of Changes: The Secretary or the State may promulgate new 
Federal or State regulations, including new or revised performance or 
reclamation requirements or enforcement or administration procedures. 
OSM and the Division shall immediately inform each other of any final 
changes and of any effect such changes may have on the cooperative 
agreement. If it is determined to be necessary to keep this Agreement in 
force, the Division shall request necessary State legislative action and 
each party shall revise its regulations or promulgate new regulations, 
as applicable. Such changes shall be made under the procedures of 30 CFR 
part 732 for changes to the approved State program and sections 501 and 
523 of the Federal Act for changes to the Federal lands program.
    B. Copies of Changes: The State and OSM shall provide each other 
with copies of any changes to their repsective laws, rules, regulations, 
and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this 
Agreement.

           Article XIV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    The Division and the Secretary shall, consistent with 30 CFR part 
745, advise each other of substantial changes in statutes, regulations, 
funding, staff, or other changes which could affect the administration 
and enforcement of this Agreement.

                    Article XV: Reservation of Rights

    In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be 
construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have 
not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not 
limited to those listed in Appendix A.

    Approved:

[[Page 604]]

regulation consistent with the Act, the Federal lands program (30 CFR, 
chapter VII, subchapter D) and the Oklahoma State program (Program) for 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands.
    B. The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State 
cooperation on the regulation of surface coal mining (b) minimize 
intergovernmental overlap and duplication and (c) provide uniform and 
effective application of the Program on all non-Indian lands in Oklahoma 
in accordance with the Act and the Program.
    C. The Oklahoma Department of Mines (ODM), under the direction of 
the Oklahoma Mining Commission, shall be responsible for administering 
this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining 
Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) shall administer this Agreement on 
behalf of the Secretary.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement 
shall be effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register as 
a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as 
provided in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
the Act, 30 CFR parts 700, 701, and 740, the Program, the Oklahoma Coal 
Reclamation Act of 1979, and in the rules and regulations promulgated 
pursuant to those Acts, shall be given the meanings set forth in said 
definitions. Where there is conflict between the above-referenced State 
and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the approved State 
program will apply except in the case of a term which defines the 
Secretary's continuing responsibilities under the Act and other laws.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    A. In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, 
regulations, terms and conditions of the Oklahoma Program are applicable

Agreement, the Act, 30 CFR 740.4 and 745.13, or other applicable Federal 
laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.
    B. The following permits will not be transferred to the State by 
this Agreement and will remain under the jurisdiction of OSMRE: 1. CFI-
Bokoshe (Federal Permit OK-0002), 2. Stigler No. 9 (Federal Permit OK-
0009), 3. Bokoshe No. 10 (Federal Permit OK-0001), and 4. McCurtain No. 
2 (Federal Permit OK-0002).
    C. Orders and decisions issued by ODM in accordance with the Program 
that are appealable shall be appealed to the reviewing authority in 
accordance with the Program. Orders and decisions issued by the 
Department that are appealable shall be appealed to the Department of 
the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
the provisions of this Agreement.

                      A. Authority of State Agency

    ODM has and shall continue to have the authority under State law to 
carry out this Agreement.

                                B. Funds

    Upon Application by ODM and subject to appropriations, OSMRE will 
provide the State with the funds to defray the cost associated with 
carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in 
section 705(c) of the Federal Act, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 
735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by ODM in carrying 
out those responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the 
estimated cost the Federal government would have expended to carry out 
such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement; and provided 
that such State incurred cost per permitted acre of Federal land does 
not exceed the per permitted acre cost for similar administration and 
enforcement activities of the Program on non-Federal and non-Indian 
lands during the same time period.
    The ratio or cost split of Federal to non-Federal dollars allocated 
under this Agreement will be determined by OSMRE and ODM based on the 
projected cost for regulation of mines within Federal lands that are 
under the jurisdiction of the State, in consideration of the relative 
amounts of Federal and non-Federal lands involved. The designation of 
mines based on Federal land will be prepared by ODM and submitted to 
OSMRE's Tulsa Field Office. OSMRE will work with ODM to estimate the 
amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of 
surface coal mining operations on Federal lands in Oklahoma in the 
absence of this Agreement.
    OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal land cost 
estimate, the ODM prepared list of acres by mine, and the State's 
overall cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, ODM will submit 
its grant application to OSMRE's Tulsa Field Office. The Federal lands/
non-Federal lands ratio will be applied to the final eligible total 
State expenditures to arrive at the total Federal reimbursement due the 
State. This ratio or cost split will be agreed upon by July of the year 
preceding the applicable fiscal year in order to enable the State to 
budget funds for the Program.

[[Page 605]]

    The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for 
inflation and workload considerations, in estimating the regulatory cost 
for the following grant year. OSMRE will notify ODM as soon as possible 
if such projections are unrealistic.
    If ODM applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and ODM will promptly meet to decide on 
appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal 
lands in Oklahoma are regulated in accordance with the Program.
    Funds provided to ODM under this Agreement will be adjusted in 
accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102 
Attachment E.

                         C. Reports and Records

    ODM will make annual reports to OSMRE containing information with 
respect to compliance with terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 
745.12(d). ODM and OSMRE will exchange, upon request, except where 
prohibited by Federal or State law, information developed under this 
Agreement.
    OSMRE will provide ODM with a copy of any final evaluation report 
prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. ODM comments on the report will be appended before 
transmission to the Congress or other interested parties.

                              D. Personnel

    ODM shall have the necessary personnel to fully implement this 
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Act, Federal lands 
program and the Program.

                      E. Equipment and Laboratories

    ODM will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and 
facilities to perform all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, 
and analyses that are necessary to carry out the requirements of the 
Agreement.

             F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties

    The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for 
operations on Federal lands in Oklahoma shall be determined in 
accordance with section 745.1 of the Oklahoma Coal Reclamation Act of 
1979, section 771.25 of the State regulations and the applicable 
provisions of the Program and Federal law. All permit fees and civil 
penalties collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by 
the State and shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in the 
Oklahoma Department of Mines Revolving Fund. Permit fees will be 
considered Program income. The financial status report submitted 
pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include the amount of fees collected and 
attributable to Federal lands during the prior State fiscal year.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

               A. Submission of Permit Application Package

    ODM and the Secretary will require an applicant proposing to conduct 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities on Federal 
lands to submit a permit application package (PAP) with an appropriate 
number of copies to ODM. ODM will furnish OSMRE and other Federal 
agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will 
be in the form required by ODM and will include any supplemental 
information required by OSMRE and the Federal land management agency. 
Where section 522(e)(3) of the Act applies, ODM will work with the 
agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park, including units 
of the National Park System, or place included in the National Register 
of Historic Places (NRHP) to determine what supplemental information 
will be required.
    At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR part 
740 and include the information necessary for ODM to make a 
determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the 
appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with 
applicable requirements of the Act, the Federal lands program, and other 
Federal laws, Executive Orders, and the regulations for which they are 
responsible.

       B. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal is Involved

    1. ODM will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) 
(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), and (7) to the extent authorized.
    In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), ODM will assume primary 
responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of 
the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and activities in Oklahoma where a mining plan is 
required. OSMRE will, at the request of the State, assist to the extent 
possible in this analysis and review.
    The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities that 
cannot be delegated to ODM under the Federal lands program, the Mineral 
Leasing Act (MLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this 
Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry 
out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid, to the 
extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set 
forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the 
information in the PAP and where appropriate, make decisions required by 
the Act, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.

[[Page 606]]

    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State 
under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working 
Agreements between OSMRE and ODM with concurrence of any Federal agency 
involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
    2. ODM will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding 
the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State laws and 
regulations. On matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 
CFR part 3480, subparts 3480 through 3487, the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) will be the primary point of contact with the applicant. ODM will 
send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any 
information received from the applicant regarding the PAP. OSMRE will 
send to ODM copies of all OSMRE correspondence which may have a bearing 
on the PAP. OSMRE will request additional information from the applicant 
through ODM. Copies of OSMRE's request will be sent directly to the 
operator by OSMRE to help expedite the permit review process. The 
requested information will be submitted to OSMRE through ODM.
    BLM will inform ODM of its actions and provide ODM with a copy of 
documentation on all decisions. ODM will be responsible for informing 
the applicant of all joint State-Federal determinations. Where necessary 
to make the determination to recommend that the Secretary approve the 
mining plan, OSMRE will consult with and obtain the concurrences of BLM, 
the Federal land management agency, and other Federal agencies as 
required.
    The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of ODM to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than the Act or 
provisions of the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of 
disagreement over the Act and the Federal lands program.
    3. ODM will, to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land 
management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c) (2) and (3), 
respectively. ODM will also be responsible for obtaining the comments 
and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or 
responsibility over the Federal lands affected by the operations 
proposed in the PAP. ODM will request all Federal agencies to furnish 
their findings on any request for additional information to ODM within 
45 days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist ODM in 
obtaining this information upon request of ODM.
    ODM will be responsible for approval and release of performance 
bonds and liability insurance under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(4).
    ODM will prepare documentation to comply with the requirements of 
NEPA under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7); however, OSMRE will retain the 
responsibility for the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii).
    4. OSMRE will assist ODM in carrying out ODM's responsibilities by:
    (a) Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between 
ODM and other Federal agencies in a timely manner;
    (b) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between 
State and Federal agencies;
    (c) Where OSMRE is assisting ODM in reviewing the PAP, furnishing to 
ODM the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the State's 
request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed upon by 
OSMRE and ODM;
    (d) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to 
the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program; and
    (e) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any 
Federal lessee protection bond requirement.
    5. Review of the PAP:
    (a) OSMRE and ODM will coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. ODM will keep OSMRE informed of findings made during 
the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSMRE or other 
Federal agencies. OSMRE will ensure that any information OSMRE receives 
which has a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to 
ODM.
    (b) ODM will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and 
State law and regulations.
    (c) OSMRE will review the applicable portions of the PAP for 
compliance with the non-delegated responsibilities of the Act and for 
compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws, Executive 
orders, and regulations.
    (d) OSMRE and ODM will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP 
review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The 
project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between 
OSMRE and ODM throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days 
after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSMRE 
will furnish ODM with its review comments on the PAP and specify any 
requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, ODM will 
provide OSMRE all available information that may aid OSMRE in preparing 
any findings.
    (e) ODM will prepare a State decision package, including written 
findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in 
compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State 
decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for 
processing PAP's agreed upon by ODM and OSMRE.
    (f) ODM may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit 
on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary 
Secretarial decision on the mining

[[Page 607]]

plan, provided that ODM advises the operator in the permit that 
Secretarial approval of the mining plan must be obtained before the 
operator may conduct coal development or mining operations on the 
Federal lease. ODM will reserve the right to amend or rescind any 
requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or conditions 
imposed by the Secretary in the approval of the mining plan.
    (g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions 
required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other 
applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by 
the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and 
those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance 
with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with 
jurisdiction.
    (h) In the case that valid existing rights (VER) are determined to 
exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of the Act where the 
proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the National Park 
Service (NPS), ODM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed 
upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit to mitigate 
environmental impacts as set forth under Article X of this Agreement.
    (i) After making its decision on the PAP, ODM will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or historic place 
included in the NRHP affected by a decision under section 522(e)(3) of 
the Act. A copy of the written findings and the permit will also be 
submitted to OSMRE.
    (j) OSMRE will provide technical assistance to ODM when requested, 
if available resources allow. OSMRE will have access to ODM files 
concerning operations on Federal lands.

          C. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions or Renewals

    1. Any permit revision or renewal for an operation on Federal lands 
will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by ODM after consultation 
with OSMRE on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan 
modification. OSMRE will inform ODM within 30 days of receiving a copy 
of a proposed revision or renewal, whether the permit revision or 
renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. Where approval of a 
mining plan modification is required, OSMRE and ODM will follow the 
review procedures where leased Federal coal is involved as outlined in 
this Agreement.
    2. OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which permit revisions 
and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan modifications.
    3. Permit revisions or renewals on Federal lands which are 
determined by OSMRE not to constitute mining plan modifications or that 
meet the criteria for not being mining plan modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by ODM.
    4. Transfer, sale, or assignment of permit rights on Federal lands 
shall be processed in accordance with the Oklahoma Program and 30 CFR 
740.13(e).

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. ODM will conduct inspections of all surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands, except for those operations 
listed in Article IV, in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and the 
Program and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the 
Program.
    B. ODM will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 
CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSMRE's Tulsa Field 
Office a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.
    C. ODM will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority 
in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with 
the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described 
hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by 
authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those 
covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations 
under laws other than the Act.
    D. OSMRE will ordinarily give ODM reasonable notice of its intent to 
conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State 
inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSMRE is 
responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public 
health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to 
land, air or water resources pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it 
will contact ODM no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, 
if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All 
citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or 
significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to ODM for 
action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without 
prior notice to ODM to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. ODM will have primary enforcement authority under the Act 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority 
given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders 
including, but not limited

[[Page 608]]

to, those listed in Appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.
    B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and ODM, ODM will have 
primary responsibility for enforcement procedures including issuance of 
orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. 
ODM will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or 
revoke a permit on Federal lands.
    C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint 
inspection where ODM and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of 
any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846. Such 
enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, the 
Act, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system 
contained in 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846.
    D. ODM and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations 
of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits 
subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such 
violations.
    E. Personnel of ODM and OSMRE will be mutually available to serve as 
witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.
    F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority 
to enforce violations of Federal laws other than the Act.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. ODM and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts 
operations on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond payable 
to Oklahoma and the United States to cover the operator's 
responsibilities under the Act and the Program. Such performance bond 
will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, 
the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements 
imposed by the Department. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement 
is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will 
be payable only to the United States. ODM will advise OSMRE of any 
adjustments to the performance bond made pursuant to the Program.
    B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such 
bond, ODM will obtain the concurrence of OSMRE. OSMRE concurrence will 
include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over 
the lands involved.
    C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the 
concurrence of OSMRE, in accordance with the procedures and requirements 
of the Program.
    D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the 
requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart 3474 or 
lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in 
certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid 
            Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

                       A. Unsuitability Petitions.

    1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining 
pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.
    2. When either ODM or OSMRE receives a petition that could impact 
adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of the 
Act, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of receipt 
and the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision, and request and 
fully consider data, information and recommendations of the other. OSMRE 
will coordinate with the Federal land management agency with 
jurisdiction over the petition area, and will solicit comments from the 
agency.

        B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

    The following actions will be taken when requests for determination 
of valid existing rights (VER) pursuant to section 522(e) of the Act or 
for determinations of compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of the 
Act are received prior to or at the time of submission of a PAP that 
involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities:
    1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified 
under section 522(e)(1) of the Act, OSMRE will determine whether VER 
exist for such areas.
    For non-Federal lands within section 522(e)(1) areas ODM, with the 
consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations 
on such lands will or will not affect Federal lands. For such non-
Federal lands affecting Federal lands, OSMRE will make the VER 
determination.
    Under section 522(e)(1), for non-Federal lands within the boundaries 
of the National Park System, ODM, with the consultation and concurrence 
of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will 
not affect the Federal interest. For such non-Federal lands within the 
boundaries of the National Park System which affect the Federal 
interest, OSMRE will make the VER determinations.
    2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest 
where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) 
of the Act and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSMRE will make the VER determination.
    OSMRE will process requests for determinations of compatibility 
under section 522(e)(2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.12(c).

[[Page 609]]

    3. For Federal lands, ODM, with the consultation and concurrence of 
OSMRE, will determine whether any proposed operations will adversely 
affect units of the National Park System with respect to the 
prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of the Act. For such 
operations adversely affecting units of the National Park System, ODM, 
with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will make the VER 
determination.
    For Federal lands, ODM will determine whether any proposed operation 
will adversely affect any publicly owned parks other than those covered 
in the preceding paragraph and, in consultation with the State Historic 
Preservation Officer, places listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places (NRHP), with respect to the prohibitions or limitations of 
section 522(e)(3) of the Act.
    For Federal lands other than those on which the proposed operation 
will adversely affect units of the National Park System, ODM will make 
the VER determination for operations which are prohibited or limited by 
section 522(e)(3) of the Act. In the case that VER is determined to 
exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of the Act where a 
proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the National Park 
System, ODM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms 
and conditions for incorporation into the permit in order to mitigate 
environmental impacts.
    In the case that VER is determined not to exist under section 
522(e)(3) of the Act or 30 CFR 761.11(c), no surface coal mining 
operations and activities will be permitted unless jointly approved by 
ODM and the Federal, State or local agency with jurisdiction over the 
publicly owned park or place included in the NRHP.
    4. ODM will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all 
areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e)(4) and (5) of the Act as 
unsuitable for mining. For operations on Federal lands, ODM will 
coordinate with any affected agency or agency with jurisdiction over the 
proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation.

            Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

           Article XII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part it may be 
reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

            Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new 
or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and 
administration procedures. Each party will, if it determines it to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations or request necessary legislative action. Such changes will 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the 
Program and under the procedures of section 501 of the Act for changes 
to the Federal lands program.
    B. ODM and the Department will provide each other with copies of any 
changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations or standards 
pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    Each party to this Agreement will notify the other, when necessary, 
of any changes in personnel, organization, and funding, or other changes 
that may affect the implementation of this Agreement to ensure 
coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.

                   Article XVI: Reservation of Rights

    This Agreement will not be construed as waiving or preventing the 
assertion of any rights in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under laws other than the Act or their regulations, 
including but not limited to those listed in Appendix A.

    Approved:
                                                          Henry Bellmon,

Sec. 937.700  Oregon Federal program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in Oregon which have been adopted under the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule 
is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the 
Oregon Federal program.
    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining 
operations in Oregon conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The 
rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal 
lands in Oregon.
    (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
    (e) The following provisions of Oregon laws provide, where 
applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of 
surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the 
regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to Section 505(b) of 
the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act:
    (1) Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 468.700-468.997, pertaining to the 
control of water pollution.
    (2) ORS 498.002 and ORS 498.705, protecting fish and wildlife and 
their habitats.
    (3) ORS 509.125, prohibiting deleterious substances from being 
introduced into State waters.
    (4) ORS 509.140, requiring the approval of the Fish and Wildlife 
Commission before explosives may be used to construct a dam or similar 
structure.
    (5) ORS 509.600, prohibiting the injury or destruction of fish 
within 600 feet of any fishway. Prior approval of the Director, the 
Department of Fish and Wildlife, is required before contructing a dam or 
obstruction in State waters.
    (6) ORS 509.615, requiring that artificial watercourses must be 
screened.
    (f) The following are Oregon laws that interfere with the 
achievement of

[[Page 611]]

the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with 
section 504(g) of the Act, pre-empted and superseded with respect to 
coal mining, except to the extent they provide for regulation of surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations which are exempt from the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977:
    (1) Oregon Surface Mining and Mine Land Reclamation Act, as amended, 
ORS 517.750-ORS 517.990.
    (2) Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR), Department of Geology and 
Mineral Industries, Division 30, Rules and Regulations, Oregon Mined 
Land Reclamation Act, OAR 632-30-005 through OAR 632-30-060.
    (3) ORS 273.551 and ORS 273.775 to ORS 273.790. The contractual and 
leasing responsibility of the Division of Lands over State lands and 
minerals is not affected by this Federal program.
    (4) ORS 275.340. Pre-empted to the extent that the State of Oregon 
construes this statute as delegating to cities and counties the 
authority to issue surface coal mining permits and related exploration 
permits.

    (1) Sections 25 Pa. Code 86.124(f) and 25 Pa. Code 86.125(j) are not 
approved to the extent that these sections would allow Pennsylvania more 
time to complete a final written decision on a lands unsuitable for 
surface mining activities petition than is allowed by the provisions of 
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 764.19(b).
    (c) We are not approving the following portions of provisions of the 
proposed program amendment that Pennsylvania submitted on December 18, 
1998:
    (1) 4.2(f)(4) of PASMCRA. We are not approving Subsection (4) to the 
extent that it would allow Phase 3 bond release.

[[Page 617]]

    (2) 4.12(b) of PASMCRA. We are not approving Subsection (b) to the 
extent that it creates an alternative bonding system.
    (3) 25 Pa. Code 86.281(e). The last sentence which states, ``If the 
actual cost of reclamation by the Department exceeds the amount 
reserved, additional funds from the Remining Financial Assurance Fund 
will be used to complete reclamation'' is not approved.
    (4) 25 Pa. Code 87.1 and 88.1, Definition of ``de minimis cost 
increase.'' The definition is not approved as it applies to coal mining 
activities.
    (5) 25 Pa. Code 87.119 and 88.107. With regard to coal mining 
activities, we are not approving Subsection (a) to the extent that it 
would allow the replaced water supply to be of a lesser quantity and 
quality than the premining water supply or does not provide for 
temporary replacement of water supplies. We are not approving Subsection 
(a)(1)(v) to the extent it would pass on operating and maintenance costs 
of a replacement water supply in excess of the operating and maintenance 
costs of the premining water supply to the landowner or water supply 
user. We are not approving Section (a)(2) to the extent that an operator 
is not required to provide for all increased operating and maintenance 
costs of a restored or replaced water supply. Finally, we are not 
approving Subsection (a)(3) to the extent it would allow a waiver from 
the requirements for replacing a water supply outside the requirements 
of 30 CFR 701.5 regarding the definition of the term, ``replacement of 
water supply.''
    (6) 25 Pa. Code 87.119(g) and 88.107(g). These sections are not 
approved.
    (7) 25 Pa. Code 87.119(i) and 88.107(i). We are not approving 
Subsection (i) to the extent that it would allow Phase 3 bond release.

Sec. 938.13  State statutory and regulatory provisions set aside.

    (a) The following provisions of Pennsylvania's Bituminous Mine 
Subsidence and Land Conservation Act (BMSLCA) are inconsistent with the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) and are 
superseded to the extent noted effective December 9, 2004.
    (1) Section 5.1(b) (52 P.S. 1406.5a(b)) of BMSLCA is superseded to 
the extent that it would limit an operator's liability to restore or 
replace a water supply covered under section 720 of SMCRA.
    (2) Section 5.2(g) (52 P.S. 1406.5b(g)) of BMSLCA is superseded to 
the extent that it would limit an operator's liability to restore or 
replace a water supply covered under section 720 of SMCRA.
    (3) Section 5.2(h) (52 P.S. 1406.5b(h)) of BMSLCA is superseded to 
the extent it would preclude Pennsylvania from requiring the restoration 
or replacement of a water supply covered under section 720 of SMCRA.
    (4) The portion of section 5.4(a)(3) (52 P.S. 1406.5d(a)(3)) of 
BMSLCA that states, ``in place on the effective date of this section or 
on the date of first publication of the application for a Mine Activity 
Permit or a five-year renewal thereof for the operations in question and 
within the boundary of the entire mine as depicted in said 
application,'' is superseded to the extent it would limit an operator's 
liability for restoration of, or compensation for, subsidence damages to 
structures protected under section 720 of SMCRA that were in existence 
at the time of mining.
    (5) Section 5.4(c) (52 P.S. 1406.5d(c)) of BMSLCA is superseded to 
the extent it limits an operator's liability for repair of, or 
compensation for, subsidence damage to a structure covered under section 
720 of SMCRA.
    (6) The portion of Section 5.5(b) (52 P.S. 1406.5e(b)) of BMSLCA 
that states, ``All claims under this subsection shall be filed within 
two years of the date damage to the building occurred'' is superseded to 
the extent that it would limit an operator's liability for restoration 
of, or compensation for, subsidence damages to a structure covered under 
section 720 of SMCRA.
    (b) [Reserved]

mining and reclamation operations in Rhode Island which have been 
adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the 
permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule 
is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the 
Rhode Island Federal program.
    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations in Rhode Island conducted on non-Federal and non-
Indian lands. The rules in subchapter D of this chapter apply to 
operations on Federal lands in Rhode Island.
    (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
    (e) The following provisions of Rhode Island laws provide, where 
applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of 
the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to 
Section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be 
inconsistent with the Act:
    (1) R.I. General Laws Sections 23-19.1-1 to 23-19.1-22, regulating 
treatment, disposal, and transportation of hazardous wastes within the 
State of Rhode Island.

pollution of any of the State's waterways.
    (f) There are no Rhode Island laws that generally interfere with the 
achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and which must 
be superseded and preempted pursuant to Section 504(g). Some Rhode 
Island laws may in an individual situation interfere with the 
achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and may be 
preempted and superseded with respect to the performance standards of 
Sec. Sec. 939.815 through 939.828 as they affect a particular coal 
exploration or surface mining operation by publication of a notice to 
that effect in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 944.30  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

    The Governor of the State of Utah (Governor) and the Secretary of 
the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative 
Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

       Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies

    A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), 
which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into 
an agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State 
regulation of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 
3480 through 3487, and surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
and activities in Utah on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter 
D), consistent with SMCRA and the Utah Code Annotated (State Act) 
governing such activities and the Utah State Program (Program).
    B. Purposes: The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster 
Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and activities and coal exploration operations 
not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3487; (b) 
minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide 
uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Utah in 
accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.
    C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Utah Division of Oil, 
Gas, and Mining (DOGM) will be responsible for administering this 
Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining 
Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) will administer this Agreement on 
behalf of the Secretary.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement 
will take effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Regiser as a 
final rule. This agreement will remain in effect until terminated as 
provided in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
SMCRA 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, including the State 
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, 
will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions.
    Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and 
Federal definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, 
terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in 
Utah except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA 30 CFR 740.4, 
740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable Federal laws, Executive 
Orders, or regulations.

                     Article V: General Requirements

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
the provisions of this Agreement.
    A. Authority of State Agency: DOGM has and will continue to have the 
authority under State law to carry out this Agreement
    B. Funds: 1. Upon application by DOGM and subject to appropriations, 
OSMRE will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs 
associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement 
as provided in section 705(c) of the Federal Act, the grant agreement, 
and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by DOGM 
in carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not 
exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on 
such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement; and provided 
that such State-incurred cost per permitted acre of Federal lands does 
not exceed the per permitted area costs for similar administration and 
enforcement activities of the Program on non-Federal and non-Indian 
lands during the same time period.
    2. The ratio or cost split of Federal to non-Federal dollars 
allocated under the cooperative agreement will be determined by OSMRE 
and DOGM based on the projected costs for regulation of mines within 
Federal lands, in consideration of the relative amounts of Federal and 
non-Federal land involved. The designation of mines, based on Federal 
and non-federal land, will be prepared by DOGM and submitted to OSMRE's 
Albuquerque Field Office. OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office and OSMRE's 
Western Field Operations office will work with DOGM to estimate the 
amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of 
Federal lands in Utah in the absence of this Agreement.
    3. OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal lands cost 
estimate, the DOGM-prepared list of acres by mine, and the State's 
overall cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, DOGM will submit 
its grant application to OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office. The Federal 
lands/non-Federal lands ratio will be applied to the final eligible 
total State expenditures to arrive at the total Federal reimbursement 
due the State. Assuming timely submission, this ratio or

[[Page 652]]

cost split will be agreed upon by July of the year preceding the 
applicable fiscal year in order to enable the State to budget funds for 
the Program.
    The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for 
inflation and workload considerations in estimating the regulatory costs 
for the following grant year. OSMRE will notify DOGM as soon as possible 
if such projections are unrealistic.
    4. If DOGM applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and DOGM will promptly meet to decide on 
appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal 
lands in Utah are regulated in accordance with the Program.
    5. Funds provided to the DOGM under this Agreement will be adjusted 
in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, 
Attachment E.
    C. Reports and Records: DOGM will make annual reports to OSMRE 
containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this 
Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). DOGM and OSMRE will exchange, 
upon request, except where prohibited by Federal or State law, 
information developed under this Agreement.
    OSMRE will provide DOGM with a copy of any final evaluation report 
prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. DOGM comments on the report will be appended before 
transmission to the Congress or other interested parties.
    D. Personnel: DOGM will maintain the necessary personnel to fully 
implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA the 
Federal lands program, and the Program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: DOGM will assure itself access to 
equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, 
investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are 
necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
    F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the 
fee accompanying an application for a permit for operations on Federal 
lands in Utah will be determined in accordance with 40-10-6(5), Utah 
Code Annotated 1953 as amended and UMC/SMC 771.25 of the State 
regulations, and the applicable provisions of the Program and Federal 
law. All permit fees and civil penalty fines collected from operations 
on Federal lands will be retained by the State and will be deposited 
with the State Treasurer. Permit fees will be considered program income. 
Civil penalty fines will not be considered program income and will be 
deposited in an account for use in reclaiming abandoned mine sites. The 
financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 will include 
a report of the amount of fees collected during the State's prior fiscal 
year.

            Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

    A. Submission of Permit Application Package: DOGM and the Secretary 
require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and activities on Federal lands to submit a 
permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to 
DOGM. DOGM will furnish OSMRE and other Federal agencies with an 
appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form 
required by DOGM and will include any supplemental information required 
by OSMRE and the Federal land management agency. Where section 522(e)(3) 
of SMCRA applies, DOGM will work with the agency with jurisdiction over 
the publicly owned park, including units of the National Park System, or 
historic property included in the National Register of Historic Places 
(NRHP) to determine what supplemental information will be required.
    At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR part 
740 and include the information necessary for DOGM to make a 
determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the 
appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with 
applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other 
Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are 
responsible.
    B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved: 
1. DOGM will assume the responsibilities for review of permit 
applications where there is no leased Federal coal to the extent 
authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to 
consultation with the Federal land management agency pursuant to 30 CFR 
740.4 (c)(2), DOGM will be responsible for obtaining, except for non-
significant revisions or amendments, the comments and determinations of 
other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal 
lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOGM will request 
such Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for 
additional information to DOGM within 45 calendar days of the date of 
receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist DOGM in obtaining this 
information, upon request.
    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to DOGM under 
other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements 
between OSMRE and the State, with the concurrence of any Federal agency 
involved, and without amendment to this agreement.
    2. DOGM will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review 
and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the 
PAP required by 30 CFR

[[Page 653]]

740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities 
in Utah on Federal lands not requiring a mining plan pursuant to the 
Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). DOGM will review the PAP for compliance with 
the Program and State Act and regulations. DOGM will be the primary 
point of contact for applicants regarding decisions on the PAP and will 
be responsible for informing the applicant of determinations.
    3. The Secretary will make his non-delegable determinations under 
SMCRA, some of which have been delegated to OSMRE.
    4. OSMRE and DOGM will coordinate with each other during the review 
process as needed. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to DOGM when 
requested, if available resources allow. DOGM will keep OSMRE informed 
of findings made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE may provide 
assistance to DOGM in resolving conflicts with Federal land management 
agencies. OSMRE will be responsible for ensuring that any information 
OSMRE receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DOGM. OSMRE will 
have access to DOGM files concerning operations on Federal lands. OSMRE 
will send to DOGM copies of all resulting correspondence between OSMRE 
and the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the 
PAP. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOGM to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA.
    5. DOGM will make a decision on approval or disapproval of the 
permit on Federal lands.
    (a) Any permit issued by DOGM will incorporate any terms or 
conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including 
conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conditioned on 
compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency. 
In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands under 
section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where the proposed operation will adversely 
affect a unit of the National Park System (NPS), DOGM will work with the 
NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for 
incorporation into the permit to mitigate environmental impact as set 
forth under Article X of this agreement.
    (b) The permit will include terms and conditions required by other 
applicable Federal laws and regulations.
    (c) After making its decision on the PAP, DOGM will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction over a publicly owned park or historic property 
included in the NRHP which would be affected by a design under section 
522(e)(3) of SMCRA. A copy of the permit and written findings will be 
submitted to OSMRE if requested.
    C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal is Involved: 1. DOGM 
will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), 
(3), (4), (6) and (7), to the extent authorized.
    In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), DOGM will assume primary 
responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of 
the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and activities in Utah where a mining plan is 
required. OSMRE will, at the request of the State, assist to the extent 
possible in this analysis and review.
    The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities that 
cannot be delegated to DOGM under the Federal lands program, MLA, the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this Agreement, and other 
applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry out these 
responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid, to the extent 
possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth 
in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the 
information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required 
by SMCRA, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
    Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State 
under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working 
agreements between OSMRE, and DOGM, with concurrence of any Federal 
agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
    2. DOGM will be the primary point of contact for applicants 
regarding the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and 
State law and regulations. On matters concerned exclusively with 
regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3847, the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be the primary contact with the 
applicant. DOGM will send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the 
applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the 
PAP. OSMRE will send to DOGM copies of all OSMRE correspondence with the 
applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, 
OSMRE will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding 
completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered 
by the Program.
    BLM will inform DOGM of its actions and provide DOGM with a copy of 
documentation on all decisions. DOGM will be responsible for informing 
the applicant of all joint

[[Page 654]]

State-Federal determinations. Where necessary to make the determination 
to recommend that the Secretary approve the mining plan, OSMRE will 
consult with and obtain the concurrences of the BLM, the Federal land 
management agency and other Federal agencies as required.
    The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOGM to 
carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA or provisions 
of SMCRA not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement 
over SMCRA and the Federal lands program.
    DOGM will to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land 
management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c) (2) and (3), 
respectively. DOGM will also be responsible for obtaining the comments 
and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or 
responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in 
the PAP. DOGM will request all Federal agencies to furnish their 
findings or any requests for additional information to DOGM within 45 
days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist DOGM in 
obtaining this information, upon request of DOGM.
    3. DOGM will be responsible for approval and release of performance 
bonds under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(4), and for review and approval of 
exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, under 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(6).
    DOGM will prepare documentation to comply with the requirements of 
NEPA under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7); however, OSMRE will retain the 
responsibility for the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii).
    OSMRE will assist DOGM in carrying out DOGM's responsibilities by:
    (a) Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between 
DOGM and other Federal agencies in a timely manner.
    (b) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between 
State and Federal agencies.
    (c) Where OSMRE is assisting DOGM in reviewing the PAP, furnishing 
to DOGM the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the 
State's request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed 
upon by OSMRE and DOGM.
    (d) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to 
the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.
    (e) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any 
Federal lessee protection board requirement.
    4. Review of the PAP: (a) OSMRE and DOGM will coordinate with each 
other during the review process as needed. DOGM will keep OSMRE informed 
of findings made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE will ensure 
that any information OSMRE receives which has a bearing on decisions 
regarding the PAP is promptly sent to DOGM.
    (b) DOGM will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and 
State law and regulations.
    (c) OSMRE will review the operation and reclamation plan portion of 
the permit application, and any other appropriate portions of the PAP, 
for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of SMCRA and for 
compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations.
    (d) OSMRE and DOGM will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP 
review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The 
project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between 
OSMRE and DOGM throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days 
after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSMRE 
will furnish DOGM with its review comments on the PAP and specify any 
requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, DOGM will 
provide OSMRE all available information that may aid OSMRE in preparing 
any findings.
    (e) DOGM will prepare a State decision package, including written 
findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in 
compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State 
decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for 
processing PAPs agreed upon by DOGM and OSMRE.
    (f) DOGM may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the 
permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the 
necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that DOGM 
advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the 
mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct coal 
development or mining operations on the Federal lease. DOGM will reserve 
the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the permit to conform 
with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in the approval of 
the mining plan.
    (g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions 
required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other 
applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by 
the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and 
those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance 
with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with 
jurisdiction.
    (h) In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands 
under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where the proposed operation will 
adversely affect a unit of the NPS, DOGM will work with the NPS to 
develop mutually

[[Page 655]]

agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit to 
mitigate environmental impacts as set forth under Article X of this 
agreement.
    (i) After making its decision on the PAP, DOGM will send a notice to 
the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency 
with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or historic property 
included in the NRHP affected by a decision under section 522(e)(3) of 
SMCRA. A copy of the written findings and the permit will also be 
submitted to OSMRE.
    5. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to DOGM when requested, 
if available resources allow. OSMRE will have access to DOGM files 
concerning operations on Federal lands.
    D. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions, Amendments, or Renewals: 
1. Any permit revision, amendment, or renewal for an operation on 
Federal lands will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by DOGM after 
consultation with OSMRE on whether such revision, amendment, or renewal 
constitutes a mining plan modification. OSMRE will inform DOGM within 30 
days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision, amendment, or renewal, 
whether the permit revision, amendment, or renewal constitutes a mining 
plan modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is 
required, OSMRE and DOGM will follow the procedures outlined in 
paragraphs C.1. through C.5. of this Article.
    2. OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which permit revisions, 
amendments, and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan 
modifications.
    3. Permit revisions, amendments, or renewals on Federal lands which 
are determined by OSMRE not to constitute mining plan modifications 
under paragraph D.1. of this Article or that meet the criteria for not 
being mining plan modifications as established under paragraph D.2. of 
this Article will be reviewed and approved following the procedures 
outlined in paragraphs B.1. through B.5. of this Article.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. DOGM will conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 
30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance 
with the Program.
    B. DOGM will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 
CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSMRE a legible copy 
of the completed State inspection report.
    C. DOGM will be the point of contact and primary inspection 
authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and 
compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as 
described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent 
inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other 
than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any 
inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its 
obligations under laws other than SMCRA.
    D. OSMRE will ordinarily give DOGM reasonable notice of its intent 
to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State 
inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSMRE is 
responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public 
health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to 
land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it 
will contact DOGM no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, 
if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All 
citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger of 
significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to DOGM for 
action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without 
prior notice to DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. DOGM will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA 
concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the 
Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority 
given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders 
including, but not limited to, those listed in Appendix A (attached) is 
reserved to the Secretary.
    B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and DOGM, DOGM will have 
primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of 
orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. 
DOGM will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or 
revoke a permit on Federal lands.
    C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint 
inspection where DOGM and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of 
any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement 
action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, or both, 
and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 
30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
    D. DOGM and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations 
of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits 
subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such 
violations.
    E. Personnel of DOGM and OSMRE will be mutually available to serve 
as witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.
    F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority 
to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

[[Page 656]]

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. DOGM and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts 
operations on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond payable 
to Utah and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities 
under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned 
upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the Program, State 
rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the 
Department. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement is terminated, 
the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will be payable only 
to the United States. DOGM will advise OSMRE or annual adjustments to 
the performance bond, pursuant to the Program.
    B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such 
bond, DOGM will obtain the concurrence of OSMRE. OSMRE concurrence will 
include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over 
the lands involved.
    C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the 
concurrence of OSMRE, in accordance with the procedures and requirements 
of the Program.
    D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the 
requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR Subpart 3474 or 
lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in 
certain circumstances, by section 715 of SMCRA.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid 
            Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

                       A. Unsuitability Petitions.

    1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining 
pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.
    2. When either DOGM or OSMRE receives a petition that could impact 
adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of 
SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of 
receipt and the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision, and 
request and fully consider data, information and recommendations of the 
other. OSMRE will coordinate with the Federal land management agency 
with jurisdiction over the petition area, and will solicit comments from 
the agency.

        B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

    The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations 
of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, or for determinations of 
compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA are received prior 
to or at the time of submission of a PAP that involves surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations and activities:
    1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified 
under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, OSMRE will determine whether VER 
exists for such areas.
    For non-Federal lands within section 522(e)(1) areas DOGM, with the 
consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations 
on such lands will or will not affect Federal lands. For such non-
Federal lands affecting Federal lands, OSMRE will make the VER 
determination.
    Under section 522(e)(1), for non-Federal lands within the boundaries 
of the National Park System, DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence 
of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will 
not affect the Federal interest. For such non-Federal lands within the 
boundaries of the National Park System which affect the Federal 
interest, OSMRE will make the VER determination.
    2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest 
where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) 
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSMRE will make the VER determination.
    OSMRE will process requests for determinations of compatibility 
under section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA.
    3. For Federal lands, DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of 
OSMRE, will determine whether any proposed operation will adversely 
affect units of the National Park System with respect to the 
prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. For such 
operations adversely affecting units of the National Park System, DOGM, 
with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will make the VER 
determination.
    For Federal lands, DOGM will determine whether any proposed 
operation will adversely affect all publicly owned parks other than 
those covered in the preceding paragraph and, in consultation with the 
State Historic Preservation Officer, places listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places, with respect to the prohibitions or 
limitations of section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA.
    For Federal lands other than those on which the proposed operation 
will adversely affect units of the National Park System, DOGM will make 
the VER determination for operations which are prohibited or limited by 
section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. In the case that VER is determined to exist 
on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where a proposed 
operation will adversely affect a unit of the NPS, DOGM will work with 
the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for 
incorporation into the permit in order to mitigate environmental 
impacts.
    In the case that VER is determined not to exist under section 
522(e)(3) of SMCRA or 30

[[Page 657]]

CFR 761.11(c), no surface coal mining operations and activities will be 
permitted unless jointly approved by DOGM and the Federal, State or 
local agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or historic 
place.
    4. DOGM will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all 
areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e) (4) and (5) of SMCRA as 
unsuitable for mining. For operations on Federal lands, DOGM will 
coordinate with any affected agency or agency with jurisdiction over the 
proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation.

            Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new 
or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and 
administration procedures. Each party will, if it determines it to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations or request necessary legislative action. Such changes will 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the 
Program and under the procedures of section 501 of SMCRA for changes to 
the Federal lands program.
    B. DOGM and the Department will provide each other with copies of 
any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations or standards 
pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

Sec. 946.30  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

    This is a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) between the Commonwealth 
of Virginia (State) acting by and through the Governor, and the United 
States Department of the Interior (Department), acting by and through 
the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).

 Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Administrative Agency

    A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 
1273(c), which provides that any State with a permanent regulatory 
program approved under 30 U.S.C. 1253 may enter into an agreement with 
the Secretary to assume the responsibilities of regulating surface coal 
mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands within that State. 
This Agreement provides for such regulation within the Commonwealth of 
Virginia (State) consistent with SMCRA, the Virginia State Program, and 
the Federal Lands Program (30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D).
    B. Purpose: The purpose of this Agreement is to (1) foster State-
Federal cooperation in the regulation of coal mining including coal 
exploration on Federal lands containing non-Federal coal; (2) minimize 
intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (3) provide uniform and 
effective application of the Virginia State Program (State Program) on 
all Federal lands except those containing leased Federal coal. This 
agreement does not apply on Indian lands.
    C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Division of Mined Land 
Reclamation (DMLR) of the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy is 
responsible for administering the Agreement on behalf of the Governor. 
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) is 
responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary. 
The Federal lands in Virginia covered by this Agreement are 
predominantly administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest 
Service, and include in part the Jefferson National Forest and the 
George Washington National Forest. It is understood by all parties that 
the Forest Service or the applicable Federal agency will continue to 
regulate mining operations on lands under its jurisdiction pursuant to 
the laws, regulations, agreements, and restrictions governing those 
lands. These requirements are in addition to the requirements discussed 
in this Agreement.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    The Agreement shall take effect May 7, 1987. This Agreement shall 
remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

                        Article III: Definitions

    The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 
the Act, 30 CFR Chapter VII, and the approved State Program shall be 
given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a 
conflict among the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the 
definitions used in the approved State Program will apply unless 
prohibited by Federal law.

[[Page 662]]

    The term ``Federal lands covered by the agreement'' means all 
Federal lands in Virginia except those lands containing leased Federal 
coal or those consisting of Federal surface over unleased Federal coal.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    The laws, rules, terms, and conditions of the State Program are 
applicable to all Federal lands in Virginia. The State is authorized to 
conduct regulatory activities on all Federal lands with cooperative 
agreement.

            Article V: Requirements for Cooperative Agreement

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the 
conditions and requirements specified in the Agreement.
    A. Authority of State Agency: DMLR has and shall continue to have 
authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    B. Funds: Upon application by the DMLR and subject to the 
availability of appropriations, the Department shall provide the State 
with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out 
responsibilities under this Agreement as provided by section 705(c) of 
the SMORA and 30 CFR part 735. If sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and DMLR shall meet promptly to decide on 
measures that will insure that mining operations are regulated in 
accordance with the State Program. If agreement cannot be reached, then 
either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI.
    Funds provided to the State shall be adjusted in accordance with the 
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E.
    C. Reports and Records: DMLR shall make annual reports to OSMRE 
pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d) on the results of the State's 
implementation and administration of this cooperative agreement. DMLR 
and OSMRE shall exchange, upon request, information developed under this 
Agreement except where prohibited by Federal law. OSMRE shall provide 
DMLR with a copy of any final evaluation report concerning State 
administration and enforcement of this Agreement.
    D. Personnel: DMLR shall provide the necessary personnel to fully 
implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the 
Federal and State Acts and the State Program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: DMLR shall have access to equipment, 
laboratories, and facilities necessary to carry out inspections, 
investigations, studies, tests, and analyses necessary to implement this 
Agreement.
    F. Permit Application Fees: The amount of the fee accompanying an 
application for a permit shall be determined in accordance with the 
Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1979 and 19 
CV 45.1-235.(E). All permit fees, including fees for permits, permit 
revisions, renewals, transfers, sales or assignments, application fees, 
and civil penalties collected from operations on Federal lands covered 
by this agreement shall be retained by the State and deposited with the 
State Treasurer. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 
CFR 735.26 shall include a report of the amount of the permit 
application and other fees collected and attributable to Federal lands 
during the prior Federal fiscal year. This amount shall be disposed of 
in accordance with Federal regulations and OMB Circular No. A-102 
Attachment E.

           Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package(s)

    A. Permit Application Package: DMLR shall require an operator 
proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit the appropriate permit 
application package (PAP) for a permit, permit revision, or permit 
renewal in an appropriate number of copies to DMLR. DMLR will furnish 
OSMRE a copy if OSMRE so requests. The permit application package shall 
be in the form required by DMLR and include any supplemental information 
required by the Federal land management agency. The PAP shall include 
the information required by, or necessary for, DMLR to make a 
determination of compliance with the State program and, under 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(2), with any conditions or special requirements imposed by the 
Federal land management agency.
    As requested, OSMRE will assist DMLR in identifying Federal agencies 
which may be affected by the proposed mining operation.
    B. Review Procedures: 1. DMLR shall assume primary responsibility 
for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of PAPs for a 
permit, permit revision, or permit renewal for operations on Federal 
lands covered by this agreement. DMLR shall also assume primary 
responsibility for the review and analysis of applications for transfer, 
assignment or sale of permit rights required by 30 CFR 740.13 for 
surface coal mining operations on Federal lands covered by this 
agreement. DMLR shall be the primary point of contact for operators 
regarding PAPs and applications for the transfer, sale, or assignment of 
permit rights and will be responsibile for informing the applicant of 
all joint State-Federal or Federal determinations.
    2. Upon receipt of PAP that involves surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on lands covered by this Agreement, DMLR shall 
(a) transmit a copy of the complete PAP to the Federal land management 
agency with a request for review pursuant to 30

[[Page 663]]

CFR 740.13(c)(4); (b) provide OSMRE with information necessary to allow 
OSMRE to determine whether or not a proposed surface coal mining and 
reclamation operation is prohibited or limited by the requirements of 
Section 522(e) of SMORA (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR part 761 and part 
762; (c) determine whether leased Federal coal or Federal surface over 
unleased Federal coal is involved and immediately inform OSMRE in these 
situations; and (d) obtain, in a timely manner, the views and 
determinations of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or 
responsibility over Federal lands affected by a PAP in Virginia. These 
consultation comments shall be forwarded to OSMRE to be considered in 
any compatibility or valid existing rights determination;
    3. OSMRE will provide technical assistance when requested, if 
available resources allow, and will process requests for determinations 
of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761 and 
part 762. OSMRE will be responsible for ensuring that any information 
OSMRE receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DMLR. OSMRE shall 
have access to DMLR files concerning mines on Federal lands. The 
Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DMLR to carry out 
his responsibilities under laws other than SMORA. A copy of all 
correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions 
regarding the PAP shall be sent to the State.
    4. DMLR shall prepare the required technical analysis and written 
findings on the PAP. If requested by the Federal land management agency, 
a draft of these documents shall be sent to it for review and comment.
    5. Any permit including permit revisions, renewals, transfers, 
sales, or assignments approved or issued by DMLR shall incorporate any 
terms or conditions imposed by OSMRE or the Federal land management 
agency, including conditions relating to post mining land use. After 
DMLR reaches a decision on a PAP, it shall send a notice to the 
applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSMRE with a 
statement of all findings and conclusions on which the decision is 
based.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    A. DMLR Authority: DMLR shall be the point of contact and primary 
inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations 
on lands covered by this Agreement, except as described in this 
Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. DMLR must conduct inspections 
on Federal lands covered by this agreement and shall, within 30 days of 
conducting an inspection on Federal lands, prepare and file with OSMRE a 
legible copy of the State's completed inspection report. Nothing in this 
Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State 
agencies.
    B. DOI Authority: The Secretary reserves the right to conduct 
inspections without prior notice of DMLR to carry out his 
responsibilities under SMORA. For the purposes of evaluating the manner 
in which this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that 
performance and reclamation standards are being met, OSMRE may 
periodically conduct inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Federal lands. OSMRE will attempt to give DMLR notice of 
its intent to conduct inspections and encourage joint inspections. 
However, pursuant to 30 CFR part 842 or 30 CFR part 877, OSMRE may 
conduct an inspection without the State when responding to information 
that there exists any condition, practice, or violation which creates an 
imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or is causing or 
could reasonably be expected to cause a significant, imminent 
environmental harm to land, air, or water resources. If an inspection is 
make without DMLR inspectors, OSMRE shall provide DMLR with a copy of 
the inspection report within 15 days after inspection.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. DMLR Enforcement: DMLR shall have primary enforcement authority 
on Federal lands covered by this Agreement in accordance with the State 
Program and this Agreement, and DMLR shall take appropriate enforcement 
action whenever necessary, including issuance of orders of cessation and 
notices of violation.
    DMLR shall promptly notify the Federal land management agency of all 
violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, and approved permits 
subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such 
violations.
    B. Secretary's Authority: (1) This Agreement does not affect or 
limit the Secretary's authority to enforce provisions of laws other than 
the SMORA. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint 
inspection where DMLR and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of 
any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845 or with SMORA. Such 
enforcement action shall be based on the substantive standards included 
in the approved State Program and shall be taken using the procedures 
and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. (3) Nothing in 
this agreement shall preclude the Secretary from performing his 
responsibilities in Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel, No. 81-2238 
(D.D.C.).
    C. Witness Availability: Personnel of the State and Interior shall 
be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken 
by either party.

[[Page 664]]

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. DMLR shall require all operators on Federal lands covered by this 
Agreement to submit a performance bond, payable to both the United 
States and Virginia. The performance bond shall be of sufficient amount 
to comply with the bonding requirements of both SMORA and the State 
Program. Such bond shall provide that if this Cooperative Agreement is 
terminated, (1) the bond will revert to being payable only to the United 
States to the extent that Federal lands are involved, and (2) the bond 
will be delivered by DMLR to OSMRE if only Federal lands are covered by 
the bond. The DMLR shall also advise OSMRE of adjustment to the 
performance bond, pursuant to the Program.
    B. Release of the performance bond shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with all applicable requirements. Prior to releasing the 
operator from any obligation under such bond, the DMLR shall obtain the 
concurrence of the Federal land management agency. Such bond shall be 
subject to forfeiture, with the concurrence of OSMRE, in accordance with 
the procedures and requirements of the State Program

                      Article X: Filing of Appeals

    Orders and decisions issued by DMLR in accordance with the State 
Program that are appealable shall be appealed to the Commonwealth of 
Virginia in accordance with the State Program. Orders and decisions 
issued by the Department that are appealable shall be appealed to the 
Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

            Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

           Article XII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or part, it may be 
reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

            Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. Notification of Changes: The Secretary or the State may from time 
to time promulgate new Federal or State regulations, including new or 
revised permitting or performance standards, or administrative and 
enforcement procedures. OSMRE and DMLR shall immediately inform each 
other of any final changes in their respective laws or regulations as 
provided in 30 CFR part 732. Each party shall, if it is determined to be 
necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its 
regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall 
be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the State 
Program and section 501 of the SMORA for changes to the Federal lands 
program.
    B. Copies of Changes: The State and OSMRE shall provide each other 
with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations, 
and standards pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement.

            Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    DMLR and the Secretary shall, consistent with 30 CFR part 745, 
advise each other of changes in the organization, structure, functions, 
duties, and funds of the offices, departments, divisions, and persons 
within their organizations which could affect administration and 
enforcement of this Agreement. Each shall promptly advise the other in 
writing of changes in key personnel, including the head of department or 
division, or changes in the functions or duties of persons occupying the 
principal offices within the structure of the program. DMLR and OSMRE 
shall advise each other in writing of changes in the location of 
offices, addresses, telephone numbers, and changes in the names, 
location, and telephone numbers of their respective mine inspectors and 
the area within the State for which such inspectors are responsible. 
This provision does not apply to Department of the Interior personnel 
performing activities under Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel 
referenced in Article VIII of this Agreement.

                   Article XVI: Reservation of Rights

    In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be 
construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have 
not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not 
limited to those listed in Appendix A.

<R05>
Sec. 947.700  Washington Federal program.

    (a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal 
mining operations in Washington which have been adopted under the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
    (b) Most of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts 
of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a 
rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section 
of the Washington Federal program.
    (c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining 
operations in Washington conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. 
The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal 
lands in Washington.
    (d) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
    (e) The following provisions of Washington laws generally provide 
for more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects 
of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the regulations in this chapter. 
Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not 
generally be construed to be inconsistent with the Act, unless in a 
particular instance the rules in this Chapter are found by OSM to 
establish more stringent environmental controls:
    (1) Washington Clean Air Act, RCW 70.94.
    (2) Washington Food Fish and Shell Fish Laws pertaining to the 
Department of Fisheries on operation in streams, RCW 75.
    (3) Washington Hydraulic Projects Approval Law, RCW 75.20.100.
    (4) Washington Forest Practices Act, RCW 76.09.
    (5) Washington Water Code, RCW 90.03.
    (6) Washington Water Pollution Control Act, RCW 90.48.
    (7) Washington Minimum Water Flows and Levels Act, RCW 90.22.
    (8) Washington Shoreline Management Act, RCW 90.58.
    (9) Washington Pesticide Control Act, RCW 15.58.
    (f) The following are the Washington law and regulations that 
generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and 
requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of 
the Act, preempted and superseded. Other Washington laws may in an 
individual situation interfere with the purposes and achievements of the 
Act and may be preempted and superseded with respect to the performance 
standards of Sec. Sec. 947.815 through 947.828 as they affect a 
particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication 
of a notice to that effect in the Federal Register.
    (1) The Washington Surface Mining Act of 1971, Revised Code of 
Washington (RCW) 78.44, as related to surface coal mining, except to the 
extent that it regulates surface coal mining operations which affect two 
acres or less or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act.
    (2) Surface Mined Land Reclamation regulations, Washington 
Administrative Code (WAC) 332-18, as they apply to surface coal mining, 
except to the extent that such regulations apply to surface coal mining 
operations which affect two acres or less or which otherwise are not 
regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
    (g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance 
standards of Sec. Sec. 947.815 through 947.828 of this part if the 
applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface coal mining 
reclamation permit submitted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 947.772 through 
947.785 of this part demonstrates in the application:
    (1) That such a variance is necessary because of the nature of the 
terrain, climate, biological, chemical, or other relevant physical 
conditions in the area of the mine; and
    (2) If applicable, that the proposed variance is no less effective 
than the environmental protection requirements of the regulations in 
this program and is consistent with the Act.

Sec. 948.1  Scope.

    This part contains all rules applicable only within West Virginia 
that have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation 
Act of 1977.

[46 FR 5954, Jan. 21, 1981]

Sec. 948.10  State regulatory program approval.

    The West Virginia program, as submitted on March 3, 1980, as 
clarified on July 16, 1980, and as resubmitted on December 19, 1980, is 
conditionally approved, effective January 21, 1981. Beginning on that 
date and continuing until July 11, 1985, the Department of Natural 
Resources was deemed the regulatory authority in West Virginia for all 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations and all exploration 
operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. Beginning on July 11, 
1985, the Department of Energy was deemed the regulatory authority 
pursuant to the program transfer provisions of Enrolled Committee 
Substitute for House Bill 1850, as signed by the Governor of West 
Virginia on May 3, 1985. Beginning on October 16, 1991, the Division of 
Environmental Protection was deemed the regulatory authority pursuant to 
Enrolled Committee Substitute for House Bill 217 that was signed by the 
Governor on October 25, 1991. On December 3, 1991, OSM found that it was 
not necessary to amend the State program to effect the redesignation of 
the regulatory authority from the Division of Energy to the Division of 
Environmental Protection (58 FR 42904, August 12, 1993). Beginning on 
April 14, 2001, the Department of Environmental Protection was deemed 
the regulatory authority pursuant to Enrolled Committee Substitute for 
House Bill 2218. The bill, which was signed by the Governor on April 30, 
2001, transferred programs and redesignated the Division of 
Environmental Protection as the Department of Environmental Protection 
within the executive branch. Copies of the conditionally approved 
program, as amended, are available at:
    (a) Office of Surface Mining, Charleston Field Office, 1027 Virginia 
Street East, Charleston, West Virginia 25301-2816. Telephone: (304) 347-

Sec. 948.30  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

                          Cooperative Agreement

    This is a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) between the State of 
West Virginia (State) acting by and through the Governor, and the United 
States Department of the Interior (Department), acting by and through 
the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).

 Article I: Introduction, Purpose and Responsible Administrative Agency

    A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (the Federal Act), 30 U.S.C. 
1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program 
approved under 30 U.S.C. 1253 to elect to enter into an Agreement for 
the regulation and control of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations on Federal lands within that State. This Agreement provides 
for such regulation within West Virginia except on lands containing 
leased Federal coal consistent with the State and Federal Acts, the West 
Virginia State Program (State program), and the Federal Lands Program 
(section 523(a) of the Federal Act and 30 CFR parts 740-745).
    B. Purpose: The purpose of the Agreement is to: (1) Foster State-
Federal cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands; (2) eliminate unnecessary 
intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (3) provide uniform and 
effective application of the State program on all lands except those 
containing leased Federal coal in West Virginia.
    C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Department of Natural 
Resources, Reclamation Division (DNR) is responsible for administering 
this Agreement on behalf of the Governor on Federal lands throughout the 
State. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is 
responsible for administering this Agreement on

[[Page 679]]

behalf of the Secretary, in accordance with the regulations in 30 CFR 
Chapter VII. The Federal lands in West Virginia covered by this 
Agreement are predominantly those under the jurisdiction of the United 
States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. It is understood by 
all parties that the Forest Service or the Federal land management 
agency, if other than the Forest Service, will continue to govern mining 
operations on Federal lands covered by this agreement pursuant to laws, 
regulations, agreements, and restrictions for which the respective 
agency is responsible. These requirements are in addition to the 
requirements discussed in this Agreement.

                       Article II: Effective Date

    After it has been signed by the Governor and the Secretary, the 
Agreement shall take effect upon publication in the Federal Register as 
a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as 
provided in Article X.

                        Article III: Definitions

    Terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 30 CFR 
parts 700, 701 and 740, and the State program shall be given the 
meanings set forth in said definitions.

                        Article IV: Applicability

    A. Applicability to Federal Lands: In accordance with the Federal 
Lands Program in 30 CFR part 740, the laws, rules, terms, and conditions 
of the State program (as conditionally approved effective January 21, 
1981, 30 CFR part 948, or as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30 
CFR 732.17) are applicable to Federal lands within West Virginia. This 
Agreement does not apply to operations on Federal lands containing 
leased Federal coal.
    B. Filing of Appeals: Orders and decisions issued by DNR in 
accordance with the State program that are appealable shall be appealed 
to the State of West Virginia's Reclamation Board of Review. Orders and 
decisions issued by the Department that are appealable shall be appealed 
to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

            Article V: Requirements for Cooperative Agreement

    The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all 
of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the 
conditions and requirements specified in this Article.
    A. Authority of State Agency: DNR has and shall continue to have 
authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    B. Funds: Upon application by the DNR and subject to the 
availability of appropriations, the Department shall provide the State 
with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out 
responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of 
the Act and 30 CFR 735.16. If sufficient funds have not been 
appropriated to OSM, OSM and DNR shall promptly meet to decide on 
measures that will insure that mining operations are regulated in 
accordance with the State program. If agreement cannot be reached, then 
either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article X.
Funds provided to the State shall be adjusted in accordance with Office 
of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E, and shall be 
reduced by the amount of fees collected by the State that are 
attributable to the Federal lands covered by this Agreement.
    C. Reports and Records: DNR shall make annual reports to OSM 
pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d), containing information respecting its 
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon request, DNR and OSM 
shall exchange information developed under this Agreement except where 
prohibited by Federal law. OSM shall provide DNR with a copy of any 
final evaluation report concerning State administration and enforcement 
of this Agreement.
    D. Personnel: DNR shall provide the necessary personnel to fully 
implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the 
Federal and State Acts and the State program.
    E. Equipment and Laboratories: DNR shall assure itself access to 
equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, 
investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed and which 
are necessary to carry out the requirements of this Agreement.
    F. Permit Application Fees: The amount of the fee accompanying an 
application for a permit shall be determined in accordance with Section 
20-6-9(f) of the Code of West Virginia (1931), as amended. All permit 
and civil penalty fees collected from operations on Federal lands shall 
be retained by the State and deposited with the State Treasurer. The 
financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall 
include a report of the amount of permit application fees collected and 
attributable to Federal lands during the prior Federal fiscal year. This 
amount shall be disposed of in accordance with Federal regulations, and 
OMB Circular No. A-102, Attachment E.

           Article VI: Review of a Permit Application Package

    A. Contents of Permit Application Package: DNR and the Secretary 
shall require an operator proposing to conduct surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to 
submit a permit application package in an appropriate number of copies 
to DNR. DNR will furnish OSM a copy if OSM so requests. The

[[Page 680]]

permit application package shall be in the form required by DNR and 
include any supplemental information required by OSM or the Federal land 
management agency. The permit application package shall include the 
information required by, or necessary for, DNR to make a determination 
of compliance under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2) with any conditions or special 
requirements imposed by the Federal land management agency and with the 
requirements of the State program, including:
    1. W. Va. Code, Section 20-6-1 et seq., as amended;
    2. Applicable regulations of the West Virginia Surface Mining 
Reclamation Regulations, 20-6-Series VIII (1981);
    3. Requirements of the West Virginia DNR Reclamation Division 
``Technical Handbook of Standards and Specifications for Mining 
Operations (1981).''
    B. Review Procedures: 1. DNR shall assume primary responsibility for 
the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of permit application 
packages required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on Federal lands in West Virginia except those 
containing leased Federal coal. DNR shall be the primary point of 
contact for operators regarding decisions on the permit application 
package and will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint 
State-Federal or Federal determinations.
    2. Upon receipt of a permit application package that involves 
surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered 
by this agreement, DNR shall (1) transmit a copy of the complete permit 
application package to the Federal land management agency with a request 
for review pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(b)(4), and (2) provide OSM with 
relevant information to allow OSM to determine whether or not the 
proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation is prohibited or 
limited by the requirements of section 522(e) of the Federal Act (30 
U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR parts 760-762 with respect to Federal areas 
designated by Congress as unsuitable for mining. DNR shall be 
responsible for obtaining, in a timely manner, the views and 
determinations of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or 
responsibility over Federal lands affected by a permit application 
package in West Virginia.
    3. OSM will provide technical assistance to DNR when requested if 
available resources allow and will process requests for determinations 
of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761 
relating to Federal areas designated by Congress as unsuitable for 
mining. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSM 
receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DNR. OSM shall have 
access to DNR files concerning mines on Federal lands. The Secretary 
reserves the right to act independently of DNR to carry out his 
responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act. A copy of all 
resulting correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on 
decisions regarding the permit application package shall be sent to the 
State.
    4. DNR shall prepare the required technical analysis and written 
findings on the permit application package. If requested by the Federal 
land management agency, a draft of these documents shall be sent to it 
for review and comment.
    5. The permit issued by DNR shall incorporate any terms or 
conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including 
conditions relating to post-mining land use, and shall condition the 
initiation of surface coal mining operations on compliance with the 
requirements of the Federal land management agency. After DNR issues the 
decision on the permit application package, it shall send a notice to 
the applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSM with a 
statement of findings and conclusions in support of the action.

                        Article VII: Inspections

    DNR shall conduct inspections on Federal lands covered by this 
agreement and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the 
approved Program
    A. Inspection Reports: DNR shall, within 15 days of conducting any 
inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection report 
describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) 
whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and 
reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which specific 
operations are being conducted.
    B. DNR Authority: DNR shall be the point of contact and primary 
inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations 
and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except 
as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. Nothing 
in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or 
State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.
    C. OSM Authority: OSM may conduct inspections of surface coal mining 
and reclamation operations on Federal lands for the purpose of 
evaluating the manner in which this Agreement is being carried out and 
to insure that performance and reclamation standards are being met. In 
order to facilitate a joint Federal-State inspection, OSM will 
ordinarily give DNR notice of its intent to conduct an inspection. When 
OSM is responsing to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the 
health or safety of the public or a significant, imminent environmental 
harm pursuant to 30 CFR

[[Page 681]]

842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact DNR if circumstances and time allow, 
prior to the Federal inspection. OSM may conduct any inspections 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842. If an inspection is made 
without DNR inspectors, OSM shall provide DNR with a copy of the 
inspection report within 15 days after inspection. The Secretary 
reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to DNR to 
carry out his responsibilities under the Act.
    D. Witness Availability: Personnel of the State and of the 
Department of the Interior shall be mutually available to serve as 
witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

                        Article VIII: Enforcement

    A. DNR Inforcement: DNR shall have primary enforcement authority on 
Federal lands covered by this agreement in accordance with the State 
program and this Agreement. During any joint inspection by OSM and DNR, 
DNR shall take appropriate enforcement action, including issuance of 
orders of cessation and notices of violation.
    B. Notification: DNR shall promptly notify the Federal land 
management agency of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, 
orders, and approved permits subject to this Agreement and of all 
actions taken with respect to such violations.
    C. Secretary's Authority: (1) This Agreement does not affect or 
limit the Secretary's authority to enforce provisions of laws other than 
the Act. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSM or any joint 
inspection where DNR and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of 
any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action 
necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement 
action shall be based on the Act or the substantive requirements of the 
State program and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system 
contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.

                            Article IX: Bonds

    A. Performance Bond: DNR shall require all operators on Federal 
lands to submit a performance bond to cover the operator's 
responsibilities under the Federal Act and the State program, payable to 
both the United States and West Virginia. The performance bond shall be 
of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of both State and 
Federal law, and release of the performance bond shall be conditioned 
upon compliance with all applicable requirements. DNR may release the 
operator from any obligation under the performance bond with the 
concurrence of the Federal land management agency. If this Agreement is 
terminated: (1) The bond will revert to being payable only to the United 
States to the extent that Federal lands are involved, and (2) the bond 
will be delivered by DNR to OSM if only Federal lands are covered by the 
bond.
    B. Forfeiture: In the event of forfeiture by an operator of the 
performance bond for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on 
Federal lands covered by this agreement, the State shall use funds 
received from bond forfeiture and, where necessary, funds from the West 
Virginia Special Reclamation Fund (pursuant to Section 20-6-12(h) of the 
West Virginia Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act) to ensure that 
reclamation is accomplished in accordance with the State program and the 
approved permit.

             Article X: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary 
under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

           Article XI: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement

    If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part, it may be 
reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

             Article XII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement

    This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor 
and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

           Article XIII: Changes in State or Federal Standards

    A. Time for Changes: The Secretary or the State may from time to 
time promulgate new Federal or State regulations, including new or 
revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement or 
administration procedures. OSM and DNR shall immediately inform each 
other of any final changes and of any effect such changes may have on 
the cooperative agreement. If it is determined to be necessary to keep 
this Agreement in force, DNR shall request necessary State legislative 
action and each party shall change or revise its regulations or 
promulgate new regulations, as applicable. Such changes shall be made 
under the procedures of 30 CFR Part 732 for changes to the approved 
State program and sections 501 and 523 of the Federal Act for changes to 
the Federal lands program.
    B. Copies of Changes: The State and OSM shall provide each other 
with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations, 
and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this 
Agreement.

           Article XIV: Changes in Personnel and Organization

    DNR and the Secretary shall, consistent with 30 CFR Part 745, advise 
each other of

[[Page 682]]

changes in the organization, structure, functions, duties, and funds of 
the offices, departments, divisions, and persons within their 
organizations which could affect administration and enforcement of this 
Agreement. Each shall promptly advise the other in writing of changes in 
key personnel, including the head of a department or division, or 
changes in the functions or duties of persons occupying the principal 
offices within the structure of the program. DNR and OSM shall advise 
each other in writing of changes in the location of offices, addresses, 
telephone numbers, and changes in the names, location and telephone 
numbers of their respective mine inspectors and the area within the 
State for which such inspectors are responsible.

                    Article XV: Reservation of Rights

    In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be 
construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have 
not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the 
Secretary may have under other laws or regulations.

Sec. 950.20  State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

    The Governor of the State of Wyoming (State) acting by and through 
the Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality Division 
(Division), and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior 
(Department) acting by and through the Office of Surface Mining 
Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), enter into a Cooperative Agreement 
(Agreement) to read as follows:

                   Article I: Introduction and Purpose

    1. This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), 
which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved under 
30 U.S.C. 1253 to elect to enter an Agreement with the Secretary for the 
regulation and control of surface coal mining and reclamation operations 
on Federal lands.
    This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration 
operations not subject to 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487 and surface 
coal mining and reclamation operations in Wyoming subject to the Federal 
lands program (30 CFR parts 740 through 746) consistent with the Act, 
the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (W.S. 35-11-401-437), and the 
Wyoming State Program (Program).
    2. The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State 
cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR parts 
3480 through 3487; (b) eliminate intergovernmental overlap and 
duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the

                       Article II: Effective Date

    3. This Agreement shall take effect following signing by the 
Secretary and the Governor, and thirty days after publication as a final 
rule in the Federal Register. This Agreement shall remain in effect 
until terminated as provided in Article X.

                           Article III: Scope

    4. In accordance with the Federal lands regulations in 30 CFR parts 
740 through 746, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the 
Wyoming State Program, as approved or as amended in accordance with 30 
CFR part 732, are applicable to lands in Wyoming subject to the Federal 
lands program except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Act, 30 
CFR part 745, or other applicable laws or regulations. Orders and 
decisions issued by the State in accordance with the Program that are 
appealable shall be appealed as provided for by State law. Orders and 
decisions issued by the Department that are administratively appealable 
shall be appealed to the Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

               Article IV: Requirements for the Agreement.

    5. The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with 
all of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all 
the conditions and requirements specified in this Article.
    (a) Responsible Administrative Agency. The Division shall be 
responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. 
OSMRE shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary, in 
accordance with the regulations in 30 CFR Chapter VII.

authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
    (c) Funds. The State will devote adequate funds to the 
administration and enforcement on Federal lands in the State of the 
requirements contained in the Program. If the State complies with the 
terms of this Agreement, and if necessary funds have been appropriated, 
the Department shall reimburse the State as provided in section 705(c) 
of the Act, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16 for costs associated 
with carrying out responsibilities under this Agreement. Reimbursements 
shall be in the form of annual grants and grant amendments, and 
applications for said grants shall be processed and awarded in a timely 
and prompt manner. If sufficient funds have not been appropriated to 
OSMRE or the State, the parties shall promptly meet to decide on 
appropriate measures that will ensure that surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations and exploration operations on Federal lands are 
regulated in accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be 
reached, then either party may terminate the Agreement.
    (d) Reports and Records. The State shall make annual reports to

[[Page 687]]

the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, 
the State and OSMRE shall exchange (except where prohibited by Federal 
law) information developed under this Agreement. OSMRE shall provide the 
State with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning 
State administration and enforcement of this Agreement.
    (e) Personnel. The State shall have the necessary personnel to fully 
implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
and the Program.
    (f) Equipment and Laboratories. The State shall have access to 
equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, 
investigations, studies, tests and analyses can be performed and which 
are necessary to carry out the requirements of this Agreement.
    (g) Permit Application Fees. The amount of the fee accompanying an 
application for a permit shall be determined in accordance with W.S. 35-
11-406(a)(xii). All permit fees shall be retained by the State and 
deposited with the State Treasurer in the General Fund. The Financial 
Status Report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include a report 
of the amount of permit application fees collected and attributable to 
Federal lands during the prior Federal fiscal year. This amount shall be 
disposed of in accordance with Federal regulations and OMB Circular No. 
A-102, Attachment E.

  Article V: Policies and Procedures: Permit Application Package Review

    6. The State and OSMRE agree and hereby require that an applicant 
proposing to conduct surface coal mining operations on lands subject to 
the Federal lands program shall submit a permit application package 
(PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to the State and OSMRE. If any 
material is submitted to the State by an applicant for the sole purpose 
of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 7(c) of the Mineral 
Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq., the State will forward such 
material through OSMRE to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). If the 
material is submitted as part of the PAP, a copy of the entire package 
will be sent through OSMRE to BLM. The PAP shall be in the form required 
by the State, and shall include any supplemental information required by 
OSMRE. The PAP shall include the information required by, or necessary 
for, the State and the Secretary to make a determination of compliance 
with:
    (a) W.S. 35-11-406(a) and (b) (1980);
    (b) Chapter II, Land Quality Division Rules and Regulations, 
Department of Environmental Quality, or other chapters where these may 
supersede Chapter II;
    (c) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease; and
    (d) Applicable requirements of the Program, and other Federal laws 
and regulations, including, but not limited to those listed in Appendix 
A.
    7. a. State Responsibility. The State shall assume primary 
responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of 
the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations on lands subject to the Federal lands program.
    b. OSMRE Responsibility. (1) OSMRE will, at the request of the 
State, assist the State in its analysis and review of the PAP. (2) The 
Department shall concurrently carry out its responsibilities which 
cannot be delegated to the State under the Act, the Mineral Leasing Act 
(MLA), as amended, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and 
other applicable Federal laws (including but not limited to these in 
Appendix A). The Department shall carry out those responsibilities in 
accordance with the Federal lands program and this Agreement in a timely 
manner so as to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, duplication 
of the responsibilities of the State set forth in this Agreement and the 
Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and, 
where appropriate, make decisions required by the Act, MLA, NEPA, and 
other Federal laws.
    c. Responsibility for Handling Other Federal Laws. The State must 
consider the comments of Federal agencies in the context of permit 
issuance and will document these comments in the record of permit 
decisions. Permits issued by the State shall include, to the extent 
allowed by Wyoming law, terms and conditions required by the lease 
issued pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act and by other applicable 
Federal laws and regulations in accordance with 30 CFR 740.13(c)(1). 
When Federal agencies recommend permit conditions and these conditions 
are not adopted, the State will provide OSMRE with documentation as to 
why they were not incorporated as permit conditions.
    Upon notification from the State that certain permit conditions are 
not incorporated, OSMRE will determine whether such conditions are 
necessary and may be attached to other Federal authorizations. If not 
other Federal authorizations are required, then OSMRE may issue a 
supplemental SMCRA permit attaching only those conditions which are 
necessary to assure compliance with other Federal laws. The State shall 
not be required to enforce the conditions of the Federal permit.
    d. Working Agreements. Responsibilities and decisions which can and 
cannot be delegated to the State under the Act and other applicable 
Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSMRE and 
the State with the concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and 
without amendment to this Agreement.
    8. The State will be the primary point of contact for applicants 
regarding the review

[[Page 688]]

of the PAP, except on matters concerned exclusively with the regulations 
in 43 CFR parts 3480-3487 administered by the BLM and on matters 
unrelated to the review of the PAP. The State will be responsible for 
informing the applicant of any joint State-Federal determinations. The 
State shall send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the 
applicant and any information received from the applicant which may have 
a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP. OSMRE would not independently 
initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies 
of the PAP with respect to matters covered by the Program; however, the 
Department reserves the right to act independently of the State to carry 
out its responsibilities under laws other than the Act or provisions of 
the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement 
over the Act and the Federal lands program. OSMRE shall send to the 
State copies of all independent correspondence with the applicant which 
may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP.
    9. The State shall assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 
740.4(c)(1), (4), (5), (6), and (7). OSMRE will retain the 
responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), (3) and the exceptions in 
30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii). In addition to the procedures outlined in 
paragraphs 9, 10, and 11, OSMRE shall assist the State in carrying out 
its responsibilities by:
    (a) Distributing copies of the PAP to, and coordinating the review 
of the PAP among all Federal agencies which have responsibilities 
relating to decisions on the package. This shall be done in a manner 
which ensures timely identification, communication and resolution of 
issues relating to those Federal agencies' statutory requirements. OSMRE 
shall request that such other Federal agencies furnish their findings or 
any requests for additional data to OSMRE within 45 calendar days of the 
date OSMRE transmits to them a copy of the PAP.
    (b) Providing the State with the analyses and conclusions of other 
Federal agencies regarding those portions of the PAP which affect their 
statutory responsibilities.
    (c) Resolving conflicts and difficulties between or among other 
Federal agencies in a timely manner.
    (d) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings as necessary between 
State and Federal agencies.
    (e) Where OSMRE is assisting the State in reviewing the permit 
application, furnishing the State with the work product within 45 
calendar days of receipt of the State's request for such assistance, or 
earlier if mutually agreed upon by OSMRE and the State.
    (f) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner as set forth 
in a mutually agreed upon schedule, governed to the extent possible by 
the deadlines established in the Program.
    (g) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any 
Federal lessee protection bond requirement.
    10. This paragraph describes the procedures that OSMRE and the State 
will follow in the review of a PAP for surface coal mining and 
reclamation operations where a mining plan is required under the Mineral 
Leasing Act:
    (a) OSMRE and the State shall coordinate with each other during the 
review process as needed. The State shall keep OSMRE informed of 
findings made during the review process which bear on the 
responsibilities of OSMRE and other Federal agencies. OSMRE shall ensure 
that any information OSMRE receives which has a bearing on decisions 
regarding the PAP is promptly sent to the State.
    (b) The State shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program 
and State laws and regulations.
    (c) OSMRE shall review the appropriate portions of the PAP for 
compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of the Act and the 
requirements of other Federal laws and regulations consistent with 
paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Agreement.
    (d) OSMRE and the State shall develop a work plan and schedule for 
PAP review and each shall identify a person as project leader. The State 
and OSMRE project leaders shall serve as the primary point of contact 
between OSMRE and the State throughout the review process. Not later 
than 50 days after receipt, OSMRE shall furnish the State with its 
preliminary findings and specify any requirements for additional data. 
OSMRE shall advise the State on the need for it to perform any work as 
part of the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement as soon as 
possible in the review process.
    (e) The State shall prepare a State decision package on the PAP. To

operations to mine Federal coal. The State shall reserve the right to 
amend or rescind any requirements of the approved permit to conform with 
any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in his approval of the 
mining plan.
    11. This paragraph describes the procedures that the State and OSMRE 
will follow in processing a PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation 
operations which does not require Secretarial approval of a mining plan 
under the Mineral Leasing Act:
    (a) Upon receipt of a PAP for such operations, OSMRE shall consult 
with and obtain the determinations or conditions of any other Federal 
agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected 
by the operations proposed in the PAP. To the extent possible, these 
determinations and conditions and any determinations required by OSMRE 
pursuant to section 522 of the Act, shall be forwarded to the State 
within the time frame allowed by State law for processing permit 
applications.
    (b) The State shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program 
and State laws and regulations.
    (c) The State may proceed to issue the permit.
    (d) After issuing the permit, the State shall send OSMRE and the 
Federal land management agency a copy of the signed permit form and 
State decision package.
    12. The following procedures will be used in processing permit 
revisions or renewals:
    (a) Any permit revision or renewal for operations on lands subject 
to the Federal lands program shall be reviewed and approved or 
disapproved by the State after consultation with OSMRE on whether the 
revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification under 30 CFR 
746.18. OSMRE shall inform the State within 30 days of receiving a copy 
of a proposed revision or renewal, whether it constitutes a mining plan 
modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, 
OSMRE and the State will follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 10 
of this Article.
    (b) Permit revisions or renewals for operations not constituting a 
mining plan modification and not meeting the criteria that may be 
established under (c) of this paragraph shall be reviewed and approved 
or disapproved following the procedures outlined in paragraph 11 of this 
Article.
    (c) OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which types of permit 
revisions and renewals do not constitute mining plan modifications and 
will not affect the non-delegable responsiblities of OSMRE and other 
Federal agencies. Revisions or renewals meeting such criteria may be 
approved by the State prior to informing OSMRE of the approval and 
submission of copies of the revision or renewal to OSMRE.

                         Article VI: Inspections

    13. The State shall conduct inspections on lands subject to the

describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit and 
license; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; and 
(3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and 
reclamation requirements.
    15. The State will be the point of contact and the inspection 
authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and 
compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as 
described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent 
inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other 
than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any 
inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842 and 30 CFR 
843.12(a)(2) and its obligations under laws other than the Act.
    16. OSMRE shall give the State reasonable notice of its intent to 
conduct an inspection in order to provide State inspectors with an 
opportunity to join in the inspection. When the Department is responding 
to a citizen complaint of an imminent environmental danger or a threat 
to human health pursuant to 30 CFR part 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will 
contact the State no less than 24 hours if practicable, prior to the 
Federal inspection to facilitiate a joint Federal/State inspection. The 
Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice 
to the State as necessary to carry out his responsibilities under the 
Act.

finds good cause, OSM may reject the pending application of any 
applicant who fails to take the examination after OSM has granted his or 
her request for admission.


<R05>
Sec. 955.15  Certification.

    (a) Processing of application. (1) Upon receiving an application for 
an OSM blaster certificate OSM shall:
    (i) Notify the applicant of the receipt of, and of any deficiency 
in, the application.
    (ii) Where applicable, notify the applicant that his or her request 
for admission to a scheduled examination either is granted or denied.

[[Page 695]]

    (2) When OSM determines that an applicant has failed to qualify for 
an OSM blaster certificate, OSM shall reject his or her application and 
notify him or her accordingly.
    (b) Grant of certificate. OSM shall:
    (1) Issue or reissue an OSM blaster certificate to any qualified 
applicant who completes the applicable training, passes the examination, 
and is found by OSM to be competent and to have the necessary knowledge 
and experience to accept responsibility for blasting operations;
    (2) Renew one time the issued or reissued OSM blaster certificate of 
any qualified applicant;
    (3) Replace the OSM blaster certificate of any qualified applicant 
who presents satisfactory evidence that his or her certificate was lost 
or destroyed;
    (4) Grant an OSM blaster certificate through reciprocity as provided 
in Sec. 955.16; or
    (5) Reinstate a suspended, or reissue a revoked OSM blaster 
certificate as provided in Sec. 955.17(e).
    (c) Term of certificate. OSM shall grant an OSM blaster certificate 
for a term to expire as follows:
    (1) Issuance--3 years after issue date;
    (2) Renewal--3 years after expiration date of applicant's current or 
expired certificate;
    (3) Reissuance--3 years after expiration date of applicant's current 
or expired certificate;
    (4) Replacement--same expiration date as replaced certificate; or
    (5) Reciprocity--60 days after expiration date of corresponding 
State certificate.
    (d) Limits on renewal. (1) OSM shall not renew an OSM blaster 
certificate more than 1 time. A blaster who seeks to extend a renewed 
certificate may apply to OSM for certificate reissuance.
    (2) OSM shall not renew an OSM blaster certificate that expired more 
than 1 year prior to the date of an application for renewal. An 
applicant who desires to extend a certificate that expired more than 1 
year prior to the date of his or her application may apply to OSM for 
certificate reissuance.
    (e) Temporary certificate. Upon request of an applicant who 
demonstrates that his or her current OSM blaster certificate is about to 
expire, or expired within 30 days prior to the date of his or her 
application, for reasons beyond his or her control, OSM may issue a non-
renewable temporary OSM blaster certificate for a maximum term of 90 
days.
    (f) Conditions of certification. Any person who holds an OSM blaster 
certificate shall comply with the conditions specified in Sec. Sec. 
850.15 (d) and (e) of this chapter.
    (g) Change of address. Any person who holds an OSM blaster 
certificate shall notify OSM in writing within 30 days of any change in 
his or her address.


<R05>
Sec. 955.16  Reciprocity.

    (a) Grant of certificate. OSM shall grant an OSM blaster certificate 
through reciprocity to any qualified applicant who demonstrates that he 
or she, and whom OSM finds, holds a current State blaster certificate 
granted by a State regulatory authority under an OSM-approved State 
blaster certification program. An applicant for a certificate through 
reciprocity need not otherwise demonstrate that he or she meets the age, 
experience, knowledge, competence, training or examination requirements 
of this part.
    (b) Subsequent certificate. (1) Any person who holds an OSM blaster 
certificate granted through reciprocity may qualify for a subsequent 
certificate either through reciprocity or by meeting directly the 
applicable requirements of this part for certificate issuance, renewal 
or reissuance.
    (2) OSM shall not recognize a certificate granted through 
reciprocity as qualifying an applicant for certificate issuance, renewal 
or reissuance.


<R05>
Sec. 955.17  Suspension and revocation.

    (a) Cause, nature and duration. (1) OSM may, and upon a finding of 
willful conduct of the blaster OSM shall, suspend for a definite or 
indefinite period, revoke or take other necessary action on the 
certificate of an OSM-certified blaster for any of the reasons specified 
in Sec. 850.15(b) of this chapter.
    (2) Where OSM has reliable information which demonstrates that the 
storage, transportation or use of explosives by an OSM-certified blaster 
is likely to

[[Page 696]]

threaten public safety or the environment, OSM shall suspend his or her 
certificate as soon as is practicable.
    (3) OSM shall make the nature and duration of a suspension, 
revocation or other action under this section commensurate with the 
cause of the action and what the person whose certificate is subjected 
to the action does to correct it.
    (b) Notice and hearing. When practicable, OSM shall give a 
certificate holder written notice and an opportunity for an informal 
hearing prior to suspending, revoking or taking other action on his or 
her OSM blaster certificate. OSM shall limit any action taken without 
such notice and opportunity to a temporary suspension for a maximum term 
of 90 days pending a decision on a final suspension, revocation or other 
action after such notice and opportunity have been provided.
    (c) Decision and appeal. By certified mail within 30 days after 
giving written notice and an opportunity for an informal hearing, OSM 
shall notify the certificate holder in writing of its final decision on 
his or her OSM blaster certificate, including the reasons for any 
suspension, revocation or other action. If the certificate was granted 
through reciprocity, OSM shall notify the State regulatory authority of 
its action. In any decision suspending, revoking or taking other action 
on an OSM blaster certificate, OSM shall grant to the certificate holder 
the right of appeal to the Department of the Interior Board of Land 
Appeals under 43 CFR 4.1280 to 4.1286.
    (d) Surrender of certificate. Upon receiving written notice that his 
or her OSM blaster certificate was suspended, revoked or subjected to 
other action, a certificate holder immediately shall surrender the 
certificate to OSM in the manner specified in the notice.
    (e) Reinstatement and reissuance. (1) OSM shall reinstate a 
suspended OSM blaster certificate by returning the certificate to the 
former certificate holder with notice of reinstatement when:
    (i) The term of a definite suspension expires; or
    (ii) The former certificate holder demonstrates, and OSM finds, that 
the cause of an indefinite suspension has been corrected.
    (2) OSM shall reissue an OSM blaster certificate to an applicant 
whose certificate was revoked if his or her application demonstrates, 
and OSM finds, that:
    (i) The cause of the revocation has been corrected; and
    (ii) The applicant meets all other applicable requirements of this 
part.
    (f) Conformance with State action. OSM shall suspend, revoke or take 
other commensurate action on an OSM blaster certificate granted through 
reciprocity if the State regulatory authority suspends, revokes or takes 
other action on the corresponding State certificate.
