                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 790.1  Scope, purpose, and authority.

    (a) This part establishes procedures for gathering information, 
conducting negotiations, and developing and implementing test rules or 
consent agreements on chemical substances and mixtures under section 4 
of TSCA.
    (b) Section 4 of the Act authorizes EPA to require manufacturers and 
processors of chemical substances and mixtures to test these chemicals 
to determine whether they have adverse health or environmental effects. 
Section 4 (a) empowers the Agency to promulgate rules which require such 
testing. In addition, EPA has implied authority to enter into 
enforceable consent agreements requiring testing where they provide 
procedural safeguards equivalent to those that apply where testing is 
conducted by rule.
    (c) EPA intends to use enforceable consent agreements to accomplish 
testing where a consensus exists among EPA, affected manufacturers and/
or processors, and interested members of the public concerning the need 
for and scope of testing. If such a consensus does not exist and the 
Agency believes that it can make the findings specified in section 4(a), 
EPA will initiate proceedings to promulgate test rules which will be 
codified in part 799 of this chapter.

[[Page 6]]

    (d) Appendix A to this part presents timetables for various steps in 
the evaluation of chemicals under consideration for testing, the 
initiation and completion of negotiations to develop consent agreements, 
and the proposal and promulgation of test rules. All deadlines which are 
imposed by the Act are binding on EPA and will be observed by the 
Agency. The remaining deadlines represent target dates that EPA intends 
to meet.

Sec. 790.7  Confidentiality.

    (a) Any person subject to the requirements of a consent agreement or 
a test rule under section 4 of the Act may assert a claim of 
confidentiality for certain information submitted to EPA in response to 
the consent agreement or the test rule. Any information claimed as 
confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in part 2 
of this title and section 14 of the Act. Failure to assert a claim of 
confidentiality at the time the information is submitted will result in 
the information being made available to the public without further 
notice to the submitter.
    (b) A claim of confidentiality must be asserted by circling or 
otherwise marking the specific information claimed as confidential and 
designating it with the words ``confidential business information,'' 
``trade secret,'' or another appropriate phrase indicating its 
confidential character.
    (c) If a person asserts a claim of confidentiality for study plan 
information described in Secs. 790.50(c)(1)(iii)(D), (iv), (v), and (vi) 
and 790.62(b)(6), (7), (8), (9), and (10), the person must provide a 
detailed written substantiation of the claim by answering the questions 
in this paragraph. Failure to provide written substantiation at the time 
the study plan information is submitted will be considered a waiver of 
the claim of confidentiality, and the study plan information will be 
disclosed to the public without further notice.
    (1) Would disclosure of the study plan information disclose 
processes used in the manufacture or processing of a chemical substance 
or mixture? Describe how this would occur.
    (2) Would disclosure of the study plan information disclose the 
portion of a mixture comprised by any of the substances in the mixture? 
Describe how this would occur.
    (3) What harmful effects to your competitive position, if any, do 
you think would result from disclosure of this information? How would a 
competitor use such information? How substantial would the harmful 
effects be? What is the causal relationship between disclosure and the 
harmful effects?
    (4) For what period of time should confidential treatment be given? 
Until a specific date, the occurrence of a specific event, or 
permanently? Why?
    (5) What measures have you taken to guard against disclosure of this 
information to others?
    (6) To what extent has this information been disclosed to others? 
What precautions have been taken in connection with such disclosures?
    (7) Has this information been disclosed to the public in any forms? 
Describe the circumstances.
    (8) Has the information been disclosed in a patent?
    (9) Has EPA, another Federal agency, or any Federal court made any 
pertinent confidentiality determination regarding this information? If 
so, copies of such determinations must be included in the 
substantiation.

Sec. 790.20  Recommendation and designation of testing candidates by the ITC.

    (a) Recommendations with intent to designate. The ITC has advised 
EPA that it will discharge its responsibilities under section 4(e) of 
the Act in the following manner:

[[Page 8]]

    (1) When the ITC identifies a chemical substance or mixture that it 
believes should receive expedited consideration by EPA for testing, the 
ITC may add the substance or mixture to its list of chemicals 
recommended for testing and include a statement that the ITC intends to 
designate the substance or mixture for action by EPA in accordance with 
section 4(e)(1)(B) of the Act.
    (2) Chemical substances or mixtures selected for expedited review 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may, at a later time, be 
designated for EPA action within 12 months of such designation. The 
ITC's subsequent decision would be based on the ITC's review of TSCA 
sections 8(a) and 8(d) data and other relevant information.
    (3) Where the ITC concludes that a substance or mixture warrants 
testing consideration but that expedited EPA review of testing needs is 
not justified, the ITC will add the substance or mixture to its list of 
testing recommendations without expressing an intent to designate the 
substance or mixture for EPA action in accordance with section 
4(e)(1)(B) of the Act.
    (4) The ITC reserves its right to designate any chemical that it 
determines the Agency should, within 12 months of the date first 
designated, initiate a proceeding under section 4(a) of the Act.
    (b) EPA consideration of ITC recommendations. (1) Where a substance 
or mixture is designated for EPA action under section 4(e)(1)(B) of the 
Act, the Agency will take either one of the following actions within 12 
months after receiving the ITC designation:
    (i) Initiate rulemaking proceedings under section 4(a) of the Act.
    (ii) Publish a Federal Register notice explaining the Agency's 
reasons for not initiating such rulemaking proceedings. EPA may conclude 
that rulemaking proceedings under section 4(a) of the Act are 
unnecessary if it determines that the findings specified in section 4(a) 
of the Act cannot be made or if the Agency has entered into a consent 
agreement requiring testing in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (2) Where a substance or mixture has been recommended for testing by 
the ITC without an intent to designate, EPA will use its best efforts to 
act on the ITC's recommendations as rapidly as possible consistent with 
its other priorities and responsiblities. EPA may respond to the ITC's 
recommendations either by:
    (i) Initiating rulemaking proceedings under section 4(a) of the Act.
    (ii) Publishing a Federal Register notice explaining the Agency's 
reasons for concluding that testing is unnecessary.
    (iii) Entering into a consent agreement in accordance with this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 790.22  Procedures for gathering information and negotiating consent agreements on chemicals which the ITC has recommended for testing with an intent to 
          designate.

    (a) Preliminary EPA evaluation. Following receipt of an ITC report 
containing a recommendation with an intent to designate, EPA will use 
the following procedure for completing a preliminary evaluation of 
testing needs. Appendix A\1\ to this part presents the schedule that EPA 
intends to follow for this purpose.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\Editorial Note: Appendix A appears at the end of subpart E.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) EPA will publish the ITC report in the Federal Register and 
announce that interested persons have 30 days to submit comments on the 
ITC's testing recommendations.
    (2) EPA will publish a Federal Register notice adding all ITC-
recommended chemicals to the automatic reporting provisions of its rules 
under sections 8(a) and 8(d) of the Act (40 CFR parts 712 and 716).
    (3) EPA will hold a public ``focus meeting'' to discuss the ITC's 
testing recommendations and obtain comments and information from 
interested parties.
    (4) EPA will evaluate submissions received under the sections 8(a) 
and 8(d) reporting requirements, comments filed on the ITC's 
recommendations, and other information and data compiled by the Agency.
    (5) EPA will make a preliminary staff determination of the need for 
testing and, where testing appears warranted, will tentatively select 
the studies to be performed.

[[Page 9]]

    (6) EPA will hold a public meeting to announce its preliminary 
testing determinations.
    (b) Negotiation procedures for consent agreements. Where EPA 
believes that testing is necessary, the Agency will explore whether a 
consent agreement can be negotiated that satisfies the testing needs 
identified by the Agency. EPA will use the following procedures for 
negotiating, formulating and accepting consent agreements. Appendix A\1\ 
to this part presents the schedule that EPA intends to follow for this 
purpose.
    (1) In the Federal Register notice described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, EPA will explain its procedures and timetable for 
negotiating consent agreements and invite persons interested in 
participating in or monitoring negotiations to contact the Agency in 
writing.
    (2) Persons who respond to EPA's notice by the announced date of the 
Agency's course-setting meeting will be deemed ``interested parties'' 
for purposes of any negotiations that EPA conducts.
    (3) Following the course-setting meeting announcing EPA's 
preliminary testing determinations, the Agency will meet with 
manufacturers, processors and other interested parties for the purpose 
of attempting to negotiate a consent agreement. To facilitate attendance 
at these meetings, EPA will contact all interested parties who have 
expressed a desire to participate in or monitor negotiations under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section and advise them of meeting dates.
    (4) All negotiating meetings will be open to members of the public. 
The minutes of each meeting will be prepared by EPA. Meeting minutes, 
testing proposals, background documents and other materials exchanged at 
or prepared for negotiating meetings will be included in the public file 
established by EPA on each ITC-recommended chemical. Materials in this 
file will be made available for inspection in the OPPTS Reading Room 
during EPA working hours.
    (5) While negotiations are underway, EPA will promptly circulate 
meeting minutes, testing proposals, correspondence and other relevant 
materials to interested parties who expressed a desire to participate in 
or monitor negotiations pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (6) As negotiations progress, EPA will make a tentative decision 
either to proceed with formulation of a consent agreement or to initiate 
rulemaking. EPA will terminate negotiations after 10 weeks and proceed 
with rulemaking unless negotiations are likely to result in a draft 
consent agreement within 4 additional weeks. By the end of this 4-week 
period, EPA either will have prepared a draft consent agreement 
reflecting the apparent consensus of the parties or will terminate 
negotiations and proceed with rulemaking. If EPA decides to proceed with 
rulemaking, no further opportunity for negotiations will be provided. 
EPA will promptly send written notice to all interested parties of the 
termination of negotiations.
    (7) Where EPA prepares a draft consent agreement, it will be 
circulated for comment to all interested parties who expressed a desire 
to participate in or monitor negotiations under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. A period of 4 weeks will be provided for submitting comments or 
written objections under Sec. 790.24(a).
    (8) If necessary, EPA will hold a public meeting to discuss comments 
on the draft consent agreement and to determine whether revisions in the 
agreement are appropriate.
    (9) Where a consensus exists concerning the contents of a draft 
consent agreement, it will be circulated to EPA management and 
interested parties for final approval and signature.
    (10) Upon final approval of a consent agreement, EPA will publish a 
Federal Register notice that summarizes the agreement, describes the ITC 
recommendations for the test substance, outlines the chemical's use and 
exposure characteristics, and explains the background, objectives and 
rationale of the testing to be conducted, and codifies in subpart C of 
part 799 the name of the substance(s) to be tested and the citation to 
the Federal Register notice of the agreement.

[[Page 10]]


<R05>
Sec. 790.24  Criteria for determining whether a consensus exists concerning the provisions of a draft consent agreement.

    (a) EPA will enter into consent agreements only where there is a 
consensus among the Agency, one or more manufacturers and/or processors 
who agree to conduct or sponsor the testing, and all other interested 
parties who identify themselves in accordance with Sec. 790.22(b)(2). 
EPA will not enter into a consent agreement in either of the following 
circumstances:
    (1) EPA and affected manufacturers and/or processors cannot reach a 
consensus on the testing requirements or other provisions to be included 
in the consent agreement.
    (2) A draft consent agreement is considered inadequate by other 
interested parties who, pursuant to Sec. 790.22(b)(2), have asked to 
participate in or monitor negotiations; and these parties have submitted 
timely written objections to the draft consent agreement which provide a 
specific explanation of the grounds on which the draft agreement is 
objectionable.
    (b) EPA may reject objections described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section only where the Agency concludes the objections are either:
    (1) Not made in good faith.
    (2) Untimely.
    (3) Do not involve the adequacy of the proposed testing program or 
other features of the agreement that may affect EPA's ability to fulfill 
the goals and purposes of the Act.
    (4) Not accompanied by a specific explanation of the grounds on 
which the draft agreement is considered objectionable.
    (c) The unwillingness of some manufacturers and/or processors of a 
prospective test chemical to sign the draft consent agreement does not, 
in itself, establish a lack of consensus if EPA concludes that those 
manufacturers and/or processors who are prepared to sign the agreement 
are capable of accomplishing the testing to be required and that the 
draft agreement will achieve the purposes of the Act in all other 
respects.


<R05>
Sec. 790.26  Initiation and completion of rulemaking proceedings on ITC-designated chemicals.

    (a) Where EPA concludes that a consensus does not exist concerning 
the provisions of a draft consent agreement and that the findings 
specified by section 4(a) can be made, the Agency will proceed with 
rulemaking under section 4(a) of TSCA.
    (b) When EPA decides to proceed with rulemaking under paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Agency intends to publish a rulemaking proposal and 
a final rule or a notice terminating the rulemaking proceeding in 
accordance with the schedule specified in Appendix A\1\ to this part.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\Editorial Note: Appendix A appears at the end of subpart E.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Where the testing recommendations of the ITC raise unusually 
complex and novel issues that require additional Agency review and 
opportunity for public comment, the Agency may publish an Advance Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR). The schedule that EPA intends to follow 
for rulemaking proceedings initiated by publication of an ANPR is 
presented in appendix A\1\ to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 790.28  Procedures for developing consent agreements and/or test rules for chemicals that have not been designated or recommended with intent to designate 
          by the ITC.

    (a) Where EPA believes that testing is needed, it may also develop 
consent agreements and/or test rules on chemical substances or mixtures 
that either:
    (1) Have been recommended but not ``recommended with intent to 
designate'' by the ITC.
    (2) Have been selected for testing consideration by EPA on its own 
initiative.
    (b) When EPA wishes to initiate negotiations concerning chemicals 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, it will publish a Federal 
Register notice describing its tentative evaluation of testing needs, 
announcing a date for a public course-setting meeting, and inviting 
persons interested in participating in or monitoring negotiations to

[[Page 11]]

contact the Agency in writing. Any negotiations that EPA conducts will 
conform to the procedures specified in Sec. 790.22(b) and, to the extent 
feasible, will follow the schedules presented in appendix A\1\ to this 
part.
    (c) EPA will enter into consent agreements on chemicals described in 
paragraph (a) of this section only if there is a consensus among EPA, 
affected manufacturers and/or processors, and any other persons who have 
asked to participate in or monitor negotiations. In determining whether 
such a consensus exists, EPA will employ the criteria specified in 
Sec. 790.24. In the absence of consensus, EPA will initiate rulemaking 
if it concludes that the findings specified in section 4(a) of the Act 
can be made. The schedule for initiating and completing such rulemaking 
proceedings will, to the extent feasible, follow the schedule specified 
in appendix A\1\ to this part.

<R05>
Sec. 790.42  Persons subject to a test rule.

    (a) Each test rule described in Sec. 790.40 will specify whether 
manufacturers, processors, or both are subject to the requirement for 
testing of the subject chemical under section 4(b)(3)(B) of the

[[Page 12]]

Act and will indicate who will be required to submit letters of intent 
to conduct testing.
    (1) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks:
    (i) Primarily associated with manufacture of the chemical, or
    (ii) Associated with both manufacturer and processing of the 
chemical, or
    (iii) Associated with distribution in commerce, use, and/or disposal 
activities concerning the chemical, each manufacturer of the chemical 
will be subject and must comply with the requirements of the test rule.
    (2) While legally subject to the test rule in circumstances 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, 
processors of the chemical must comply with the requirements of the test 
rule only if processors are directed to do so in a subsequent notice as 
set forth in Sec. 790.48(b).
    (3) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks

described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, persons who manufacture 
less than 500 kg (1,100 lb) of the chemical annually during the period 
from the effective date of the test rule to the end of the reimbursement 
period, must comply with the requirements of the test rule only if such 
manufacturers are directed to do so in a subsequent notice as set forth 
in Sec. 790.48, or if directed to do so in a particular test rule.
    (5) While legally subject to the test rule in circumstances 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, persons who manufacture 
small quantities of the chemical solely for research and development 
(meaning quantities that are not greater than those necessary for 
purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research 
on, or analysis of, such chemical or another chemical, including such 
research or analysis for development of a product) from the effective 
date of the test rule to the end of the reimbursement period, must 
comply with the requirements of the test rule only if such manufacturers 
are directed to do so in subsequent notice set forth in Sec. 790.48, or 
if directed to do so in a particular test rule.
    (6) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks

Sec. 790.42(a) must, for each test required, either notify EPA by letter 
of his or her intent to conduct testing or submit to EPA an application 
for an exemption from testing requirements for the test.
    (b) EPA will consider letters of intent to test as commitments to 
sponsor the tests for which they are submitted unless EPA agrees to the 
substitution of an exemption application in instances where more than 
one person indicates an intent to sponsor equivalent tests.
    (c) Each letter of intent to conduct testing must include:
    (1) Identification of test rule.
    (2) Name, address, and telephone number of the firm(s) which will be 
sponsoring the tests.
    (3) Name, address, and telephone number of the appropriate

any person not processing the subject chemical as of the effective date 
of the test rule described in Sec. 790.40 or by 30 days after 
publication of the Federal Register notice described in 
Sec. 790.48(b)(2) who, before the end of the reimbursement period, 
processes the test chemical and who is required to comply with the 
requirements of the rule must submit the letter of intent to test or an 
exemption application required by Sec. 790.48(b)(3) of the date 
processing begins.
    (e) Manufacturers subject to a test rule described in Sec. 790.40 
who do not submit to EPA either a letter of their intent to conduct 
tests or a request for an exemption from testing for each test for which 
testing is required in the test rule will be considered in violation of 
that rule beginning on the 31st day after the effective date of the test 
rule described in Sec. 790.40 or on the date manufacture begins as 
described in paragraph (d) of this section.

Sec. 790.48  Procedure if no one submits a letter of intent to conduct testing.

    (a) If only manufacturers are subject to the rule. (1) This 
paragraph applies if testing is being required solely to allow 
evaluation of risks associated with manufacturing and the test rule 
described in Sec. 790.40 states that manufacturers only are responsible 
for testing.
    (2) If no manufacturer subject to the test rule has notified EPA of 
its intent to conduct one or more of the required tests within 30 days 
after the effective date of the test rule described in Sec. 790.40, EPA 
will notify all manufacturers, including those described in 
Sec. 790.42(a)(4) and (a)(5), by certified mail or by publishing a 
notice of this fact in the Federal Register specifying the tests for 
which no letter of intent has been submitted and will give such 
manufacturers an opportunity to take corrective action.
    (3) If no manufacturer submits a letter of intent to conduct one or 
more of the required tests within 30 days after receipt of the certified 
letter or publication of the Federal Register notice described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all manufacturers subject to the rule 
will be in violation of the test rule from the 31st day after receipt of 
the certified letter or publication of the Federal Register notice 
described in this paragraph.
    (b) If manufacturers and processors are subject to the rule. (1) 
This paragraph applies if testing is being required to allow evaluation 
of risks associated with manufacturing and processing or with 
distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical and the test 
rule described in Sec. 790.40 states that manufacturers and processors 
are responsible for testing.
    (2) If no manufacturer subject to the rule has notified EPA of its 
intent to conduct testing for one or more of the required tests within 
30 days after the effective date of the test rule described in 
Sec. 790.40, EPA will publish a notice in the Federal Register of this 
fact

[[Page 14]]

specifying the tests for which no letter of intent has been submitted.
    (3) No later than 30 days after the date of publication of the 
Federal Register notice described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
each person described in Sec. 790.40(a)(4) and (5) and each person 
processing the subject chemical as of the effective date of the test 
rule described in Sec. 790.40 or by 30 days after the date of 
publication of the Federal Register notice described in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section must, for each test specified in the Federal Register 
notice, either notify EPA by letter of his or her intent to conduct 
testing or submit to EPA an application for an exemption from testing 
requirements for the test.
    (4) If no manufacturer or processor of the test chemical has 
submitted a letter of intent to conduct one or more of the required 
tests within 30 days after the date of publication of the Federal 
Register notice described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, EPA will 
notify all manufacturers and processors by certified letter or publish a 
Federal Register notice of this fact specifying the tests for which no 
letter of intent has been submitted. This letter or Federal Register 
notice will give the manufacturers and processors an opportunity to take 
corrective action.
    (5) If no manufacturer or processor submits a letter of intent to 
conduct one or more of the required tests within 30 days after receipt 
of the certified letter or publication of the Federal Register notice 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, all manufacturers and 
processors subject to the rule will be in violation of the test rule 
from the 31st day after receipt of the certified letter or publication 
of the Federal Register notice described in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (c) Only processors are subject to the rule. (1) This paragraph 
applies if testing is being required solely to allow evaluation of risks 
associated with processing and the test rule described in Sec. 790.40 
states that only processors are responsible for testing.
    (2) If no processor subject to the rule has notified EPA of its 
intent to conduct one or more of the required tests within 30 days after 
the effective date of the test rule described in Sec. 790.40, EPA will 
notify all the processors by certified mail or publish a notice in the 
Federal Register of this fact, specifying the tests for which no letter 
of intent has been submitted and give the processors an opportunity to 
take corrective action.
    (3) If no processor submits a letter of intent to conduct one or 
more of the required tests within 30 days after receipt of the certified 
letter or publication of the Federal Register notice described in

    (a) Who must submit study plans. (1) Persons who notify EPA of their 
intent to conduct tests in compliance with the requirements of a single 
phase test rule as described in Sec. 790.40(b)(1) must submit study 
plans for those tests prior to the initiation of each of these tests, 
unless directed by a particular test rule or consent agreement to submit 
study plans at a specific time.
    (2) Persons who notify EPA of their intent to conduct tests in 
compliance with the requirements of a Phase I test rule as described in 
Sec. 790.40(b)(2) must submit the proposed study plans for those tests 
on or before 90 days after the effective date of the Phase I rule; or, 
for processors complying with the notice described in Sec. 790.48(b)(2), 
90 days after the publication date of that notice; or 60 days after the 
date manufacture or processing begins as described in Sec. 790.45(d), as 
appropriate, to the address in Sec. 790.5(b).
    (3) Study plans must be prepared according to the requirements of 
this subpart B and part 792 of this chapter. Only one set of study plans 
should be prepared and submitted by persons who are jointly sponsoring 
testing.
    (4) Any person subject to a test rule may submit a study plan for 
any test

[[Page 15]]

required by the rule at any time, regardless of whether the person 
previously submitted an application for exemption from testing for that

    (5) Unless EPA has granted an extension of time for submission of 
proposed study plans, manufacturers who notify EPA that they intend to 
conduct testing in compliance with the requirements of a Phase I test 
rule as described in Sec. 790.40(b)(2) and who do not submit proposed 
study plans for those tests on or before 90 days after the effective 
date of the Phase I test rule or 60 days after the date manufacture 
begins as described in Sec. 790.45(d) will be considered in violation of 
the test rule as if no letter of intent to test had been submitted.
    (6) Unless EPA has granted an extension of time for submission of 
proposed study plans, processors who notify EPA that they intend to 
conduct testing in compliance with the requirements of a Phase I test 
rule as described in Sec. 790.40(b)(2) and who do not submit proposed 
study plans for those tests on or before 90 days after the effective 
date of the Phase I test rule or 90 days after the publication date of 
the notice described in Sec. 790.48(b)(2), or 60 days after the date 
processing begins as described in Sec. 790.45(d), as appropriate, will 
be considered in violation of the test rule as if no letter of intent to 
test had been submitted.
    (b) Extensions of time for submission of study plans. (1) EPA may 
grant requests for additional time for the development of study plans on 
a case-by-case basis. Requests for additional time for study plan 
development must be made in writing to EPA at the address in 
Sec. 790.5(b). Each extension request must state why EPA should grant 
the extension.
    (2) Under two-phase rulemaking, extension requests must be submitted 
to EPA within 60 days after the effective date of the Phase I test rule 
as described in Sec. 790.40(b)(2); or for processors complying with the 
notice described in Sec. 790.48(b)(2), 60 days after the publication 
date of that notice; or 30 days after the date manufacture or processing 
begins as described in Sec. 790.45(d), as appropriate.
    (3) EPA will notify the submitter by certified mail of EPA's 
decision to grant or deny an extension request.
    (4) Persons who have been granted an extension of time for 
submission of study plans as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and who do not submit proposed study plans in compliance with 
the requirements of a Phase I test rule in accordance with the new 
deadline granted by EPA will be considered in violation of the test rule 
as if no letter of intent to test had been submitted as described in 
Sec. 790.45(e) and (f).
    (c) Content of study plans. (1) All study plans are required to 
contain the following information:
    (i) Identity of the test rule.

Sec. 790.52  Phase II test rule.

    (a) If EPA determines that the proposed study plan described in 
Sec. 790.50(a)(2) complies with Sec. 790.50(c), EPA will publish a 
proposed Phase II test rule in the Federal Register requesting comments 
on the ability of the proposed study plan to ensure that data from the 
test will be reliable and adequate.
    (b) EPA will provide a 45-day comment period and will provide an 
opportunity for an oral presentation upon the request of any person. EPA 
may extend the comment period if it appears from the nature of the 
issues raised by EPA's review or from public comments that further 
comment is warranted.
    (c) After receiving and considering public comments on the study 
plan, EPA will adopt, as proposed or as modified in response to EPA 
review and public comments, the study protocol section of the study 
plan, as defined by Sec. 790.50(c)(1)(v) of this chapter, as the test 
standard for the required testing, and the schedule section of the study 
plan, as defined by Sec. 790.50(c)(1)(vi) of this chapter, as the 
schedule for the required testing in a final Phase II test rule.

<R05>
Sec. 790.55  Modification of test standards or schedules during conduct of test.

    (a) Application. Any test sponsor who wishes to modify the test 
schedule for the mandatory testing conditions or requirements (i.e., 
``shall statements'') in the test standard for any test required by a 
test rule must submit an application in accordance with this paragraph. 
Application for modification must be made in writing to EPA at the 
address in Sec. 790.5(b), or by phone with written confirmation to 
follow within 10 working days. Applications must include an appropriate 
explanation and rationale for the modification. Where a test sponsor 
requests EPA to provide guidance or to clarify a non-mandatory testing 
requirement (i.e., ``should statements'') in a test standard, the test 
sponsor should submit these requests to EPA at the address in 
Sec. 790.5(b).

[[Page 17]]

    (b) Adoption. (1) Where EPA concludes that the requested 
modification of a test standard or schedule for a test required under a 
test rule is appropriate, EPA will proceed in accordance with this 
paragraph (b).
    (2) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of the test 
standard or schedule would not alter the scope of the test or 
significantly change the schedule for completing the test, EPA will not 
ask for public comment before approving the modification. EPA will 
notify the test sponsor by letter of EPA's approval. EPA will place 
copies of each application and EPA approval letter in the rulemaking 
record for the test rule in question. EPA will publish a notice annually 
in the Federal Register indicating the test standards or schedules for 
tests required in test rules which have been modified under this 
paragraph (b)(2) and describing the nature of the modifications. Until 
the Federal Register notice is published, any modification approved by 
EPA under this paragraph (b)(2) shall apply only to the test sponsor who 
applied for the modification under this paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of a test 
standard or schedule would significantly alter the scope of the test or 
significantly change the schedule for completing the test, EPA will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting comment on the 
proposed modification. However, EPA will approve a requested 
modification of a test standard under paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
without first seeking public comment if EPA believes that an immediate 
modification to the test standard is necessary to preserve the accuracy 
or validity of an ongoing test. EPA may also modify a testing 
requirement or test condition in a test standard if EPA determines that 
the completion or achievement of this requirement or condition is not 
technically feasible. EPA may approve a test schedule extension under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section without first seeking public comment if 
EPA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a delay of over 12 months 
is not the fault of the test sponsor and is the result of unforeseen 
circumstances such as a lack of laboratory availability, lack of 
availability of suitable test substance (e.g., 14-C labelled test 
substance), lack of availability of healthy test organisms, or the 
unexpected failure of a long-term test. EPA will publish an annual 
notice in the Federal Register announcing the approval of any test 
standard modifications and test schedule extensions under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section and provide a brief rationale of why the 
modification was granted.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b), a requested modification of 
a test standard or schedule for a test required under a test rule would 
alter the scope of the test or significantly change the schedule for 
completing the test if the modification would:
    (i) Change the test species.
    (ii) Change the route of administration of the test chemical.
    (iii) Change the period of time during which the test species is 
exposed to the test chemical.
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, extend 
the final reporting deadline more than 12 months from the date specified 
in the final rule.
    (c) Disapproval. Where EPA concludes that the requested modification 
of a test standard or schedule for a test required under a test rule is 
not appropriate, EPA will so notify the test sponsor in writing.
    (d) Timing. (1) Test sponsors should submit all applications for 
test schedule modifications at least 60 days before the reporting 
deadline for the test in question.
    (2) EPA will not normally approve any test schedule extensions 
submitted less than 30 days before the reporting deadline for the test 
in question.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, EPA may 
grant extensions for up to 1 year but will normally limit extensions to 
a period of time equal to the in-life portion of the test plus 60 days.
    (4) EPA will normally approve only one deadline extension for each 
test.
    (5) Test sponsors should submit requests for test standard 
modifications as soon as they determine that the test

[[Page 18]]

cannot be successfully completed according to the test standard 
specified in the rule.

Sec. 790.59  Failure to comply with a test rule.

    (a) Persons who notified EPA of their intent to conduct a test 
required in a test rule in part 799 of this chapter and who fail to 
conduct the test in accordance with the test standards and schedules 
adopted in the test rule, or as modified in accordance with Sec. 790.55, 
will be in violation of the rule.
    (b) Any person who fails or refuses to comply with any aspect of 
this part or a test rule under part 799 of this chapter is in violation 
of section 15 of the Act. EPA will treat violations of the Good 
Laboratory Practice standards as indicated in Sec. 792.17 of this 
chapter.

progress and/or final reports to EPA.
    (9) A requirement that the principal sponsor will submit a study 
plan to EPA in accordance with Sec. 790.62.
    (10) A statement that the results of testing conducted pursuant to 
the consent agreement will be announced to the public in accordance with 
the procedures specified in section 4(d) of the Act and that the 
disclosure of data generated by such testing will be governed by section 
14(b) of the Act.
    (11) A requirement that the manufacturers and/or processors signing 
the consent agreement will comply with the notification requirements of 
section 12(b)(1) of the Act and part 707 of this chapter if they export 
or intend to export the substance or mixture for which the submission of 
data is required under the agreement and a statement that any other 
person who exports or intends to export such substance or mixture is 
subject to the above cited export notification requirements.
    (12) A requirement that, in the event EPA promulgates a significant 
new use rule applicable to the test chemical under section 5(a)(2), the 
consent agreement will have the status of a test rule for purposes of 
section 5(b)(1)(A) and manufacturers and/or processors signing the 
agreement will comply with the data submission requirements imposed by 
that provision.
    (13) A statement that each manufacturer and/or processor signing the 
agreement agrees that violation of its requirements will constitute a 
``prohibited act'' under section 15(1) of the Act and will trigger all 
provisions of TSCA applicable to a violation of section 15.
    (14) A statement that, in the event one or more provisions of the 
agreement are determined to be unenforceable by a court, the remainder 
of the agreement would not be presumed to be valid and EPA will then 
either initiate a rulemaking proceeding or publish in the Federal 
Register the Administrator's reason for not initiating such a 
proceeding.
    (15) A statement that the Agency may conduct laboratory inspections

[[Page 19]]

and/or study audits of the testing being conducted pursuant to the 
consent agreement in accordance with the authority and procedures 
contained in section 11 of the Act.
    (16) A statement that EPA acceptance of a consent agreement 
constitutes ``final agency action'' for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.
    (17) Any other requirements that the parties agree are necessary to 
achieve the purposes of the Act.
    (b) Contents of standards for the development of data. The standards 
for the development of the data included in consent agreements will be 
based on the TSCA test guidelines in 40 CFR parts 796, 797, and 798, the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test 
guidelines, the EPA pesticide assessment guidelines published by The 
National Technical Information Service (NTIS), or other suitable test 
methodologies. During the negotiation of consent agreements, EPA will 
initially propose suitable test guidelines as the required test 
standards; manufacturers and processors or other interested parties may 
then suggest alternative methodologies or modifications to the Agency's 
proposed guidelines. These alternative methodologies or modifications 
will be adopted only where, in the judgment of EPA, they will develop at 
least equally reliable and adequate data on the chemical substance or 
mixture subject to the agreement.
    (c) Statement of rationale for consent agreement. EPA will prepare a 
written explanation of the basis for each consent agreement. This 
document will summarize the agreement, describe any ITC testing 
recommendations for the chemical involved, outline the chemical's use 
and exposure characteristics, and explain the objectives of the testing 
to be conducted and the rationale for the specific studies selected. 
This document will be published in the Federal Register and, for ITC-
designated chemicals, will constitute the statement of EPA's reasons for 
not initiating rulemaking required by section 4(e)(1)(B) of the Act.

[[Page 20]]

    (10) A schedule, with reasonable timeables and deadlines, for 
initiation and completion of each short-term test and of each major 
phases of long-term tests, and submission of interim progress and/or 
final reports to EPA.
    (c) Review and modification. (1) Upon receipt of a study plan, EPA 
will review it to determine whether it complies with paragraph (b) of 
this section. If EPA determines that the study plan does not comply with 
paragraph (b) of this section, EPA will notify the submitter that the 
plan is incomplete and will identify the deficiencies and the steps 
necessary to complete the plan. It is the responsibility of the test 
sponsor to review the study protocols to determine if they comply with 
all the mandatory testing conditions and requirements in the test 
standards (i.e., ``shall statements'').
    (2) The submitter will have 15 days after the day it receives a 
notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to submit appropriate

<R05>
Sec. 790.65  Failure to comply with a consent agreement.

    (a) Manufacturers and/or processors who have signed a consent 
agreement and who fail to comply with the test requirements, test 
standards, GLP regulations, schedules, or other provisions contained in 
the consent agreement, or in modifications to the agreement adopted 
pursuant to Sec. 790.68, will be in violation of the consent agreement.
    (b) The Agency considers failure to comply with any aspect of a 
consent agreement to be a ``prohibited act'' under section 15 of TSCA, 
subject to all of the provisions of the Act applicable to violations of 
section 15. Section 15(1) of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to 
fail or refuse to comply with any rule or order issued under section 4. 
Consent agreements adopted pursuant to this part are ``orders issued 
under section 4'' for purposes of section 15(1) of TSCA.
    (c) Manufacturers and/or processors who violate consent agreements 
are subject to criminal and/or civil liability. Under the penalty 
provisions of section 16 of TSCA, such firms could be subject to a civil 
penalty of up to $25,000 per violation with each day in violation 
constituting a separate violation of section 15. Intentional violations 
could lead to the imposition of criminal penalties of up to $25,000 for 
each day of violation and imprisonment for up to one year. In addition, 
EPA could invoke the remedies available under section 17 of TSCA, 
including seeking an injunction to compel adherence to the requirements 
of the consent agreement.
    (d) Noncompliance with a consent agreement will constitute conduct 
``in violation of this Act'' under section 20(a)(1) of TSCA. Thus, 
failure to comply with the requirements of a consent agreement could 
result in a citizens' civil action under section 20(a)(1) of TSCA.


<R05>
Sec. 790.68  Modification of consent agreements.

    (a) Changes in the scope of testing. (1) Manufacturers or processors 
subject to a consent agreement, other persons or EPA may seek 
modifications in the scope of testing performed under the consent 
agreement. If, upon receiving a request for modification, EPA determines 
that new issues have been raised that warrant reconsideration of the 
scope of testing, or if EPA determines

[[Page 21]]

on its own that such reconsideration is appropriate, EPA will publish a 
Federal Register notice describing the proposed modification and 
soliciting public comment. If, based on the comments received, EPA 
concludes that differences of opinion may exist about the proposed 
modification, EPA will establish a schedule for conducting negotiations 
and invite parties who wish to participate in or monitor these 
negotiations to contact the Agency in writing. Any negotiations that EPA 
conducts will conform to the procedures specified in Sec. 790.22(b).
    (2) The scope of testing required by a consent agreement will be 
modified only where there is a consensus concerning the modified testing 
requirements among EPA, affected manufacturers and/or processors, and 
other persons who have asked to participate in or monitor negotiations 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In determining whether a 
consensus exists, EPA will employ the criteria specified in Sec. 790.24. 
In the absence of consensus, EPA may initiate rulemaking under section 
4(a) of the Act if it concludes that any testing beyond that required by 
the consent agreement is necessary and that the other statutory findings 
required by section 4(a) can be made. While such rulemaking proceedings 
are underway, the consent agreement will remain in effect unless EPA 
finds that the testing required by the agreement is or may be 
unnecessary in view of the testing requirements included in EPA's 
proposed rule.
    (b) Changes in test standards or schedules. (1) Any test sponsor who 
wishes to modify the test schedule for any test required under a consent 
order must submit an application in accordance with this paragraph. 
Application for modification must be made in writing to EPA at the 
address in Sec. 790.5(b), or by phone with written confirmation to 
follow within 10 working days. Applications must include an appropriate 
explanation and rationale for the modification. EPA will consider only 
those applications that request modifications to mandatory testing 
conditions or requirements (``shall statements'' in the consent order). 
Where a test sponsor requests EPA to provide guidance or to clarify a 
non-mandatory testing requirement (i.e., ``should statements''), the 
test sponsor should submit these requests to EPA at the address in 
section 790.5(b).
    (2)(i) Where EPA concludes that the requested modification of a test 
standard or schedule for a test required under a consent agreement is 
appropriate, EPA will proceed in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2).
    (ii) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of a test 
standard or schedule would not alter the scope of the test or 
significantly change the schedule for completing the test, EPA will not 
ask for public comment before approving the modification. EPA will 
notify the test sponsor, and any other persons who have signed the 
consent agreement, by letter of EPA's approval. EPA will place copies of 
each application and EPA approval letter in the administrative record 
maintained for the consent agreement in question. EPA will publish a 
notice annually in the Federal Register indicating the test standards or 
schedules for test required in consent agreements which have been 
modified under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and describing the nature of 
the modifications.
    (iii) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of a test 
standard or schedule would significantly alter the scope of the test or 
significantly change the schedule for completing the test, EPA will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting comment on the 
proposed modification. However, EPA will approve a requested 
modification of a test standard under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this 
section without first seeking public comment if EPA believes that an 
immediate modification to the test standard is necessary to preserve the 
accuracy or validity of an ongoing test. EPA also may modify a testing 
requirement or test condition in a test standard if EPA determines that 
the completion or achievement of this requirement or condition is not 
technically feasible. EPA may approve a requested modification of a test 
schedule under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section without first 
seeking public comment if EPA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that 
a delay of over 12 months is not the fault of the test sponsor and is 
due

[[Page 22]]

to unforeseen circumstances such as a lack of laboratory availability, 
lack of availability of suitable test substance (e.g., 14-C labelled 
test substance), lack of availability of healthy test organisms, or the 
unexpected failure of a long-term test. EPA will publish an annual 
notice in the Federal Register announcing the approval of any test 
standard modifications and test scheduled extensions under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section, and provide a brief rationale of why the 
modification was granted.
    (iv) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a requested modification 
of a test standard of schedule for a test required under a consent 
agreement would alter the scope of the test or significantly change the 
schedule for completing the test if the modification would:
    (A) Change the test species.
    (B) Change the route of administration of the test chemical.
    (C) Change the period of time during which the test species is 
exposed to the test chemical.
    (D) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, 
extend the final reporting deadline more than 12 months from the date 
specified in the consent order.
    (3) Where EPA concludes that the requested modification of a test 
standard or schedule for a test requirement under a consent agreement is 
not appropriate, EPA will so notify the test sponsor in writing.
    (c) Timing. (1) Test sponsors should submit all applications for 
test schedule modifications at least 60 days before the reporting 
deadline for the test in question.
    (2) EPA will not normally approve any test schedule extensions 
submitted less than 30 days before the reporting deadline for the test 
in question.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, EPA 
may grant extensions as shown necessary for up to 1 year but will 
normally limit extensions to a period of time equal to the in-life 
portion of the test plus 60 days.
    (4) EPA will normally approve only one deadline extension for each 
test.
    (5) Test sponsors should submit requests for test standard 
modifications as soon as they determine that the test cannot be 
successfully completed according to the test standard specified in the 
consent order.

    Source: 50 FR 20660, May 17, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 790.80  Submission of exemption applications.

    (a) Who should file applications. (1) Any manufacturer or processor 
subject to a test rule in part 799 of this chapter may submit an 
application to EPA for an exemption from performing any or all of the 
tests required under the test rule.
    (2) Processors will not be required to apply for an exemption or 
conduct testing unless EPA so specifies in a test rule or in a special 
Federal Register notice as described in Sec. 790.48(b)(2) under the 
following circumstances:
    (i) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks 
associated with manufacturing and processing or with distribution in 
commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical and manufacturers do not 
submit notice(s) of intent to conduct the required testing; or
    (ii) If testing is being required solely to allow evaluation of 
risks associated with processing of the chemical.
    (b) When applications must be filed. (1) Exemption applications must 
be filed within 30 days after the effective date of the test rule 
described in Sec. 790.40 or, if being submitted in compliance with the 
Federal Register notice described in Sec. 790.48(b)(2), within 30 days 
after the publication of that notice.
    (2) Exemption applications must be filed by the date manufacture or 
processing begins by any person not manufacturing or processing the 
subject chemical as of the effective date of the test rule described in 
Sec. 790.40 or by 30 days after the effective date of the test rule 
described in Sec. 790.40, who, before the end of the reimbursement 
period, manufactures or processes the test substance and who is subject 
to the requirement to submit either a letter of

[[Page 23]]

intent to test or an exemption application.
    (3) When both manufacturers and processors are subject to the rule, 
exemption applications must be filed by the date processing begins by 
any person not processing as of the effective date of the test rule 
described in Sec. 790.40 or by 30 days after publication of the Federal 
Register notice described in Sec. 790.48(b)(2) who, before the end of 
the reimbursement period, processes the test substance and who is 
subject to the requirement to submit either a letter of intent to test 
or an exemption application.
    (c) Scope of application. A person may apply for an exemption from 
all, or one or more, specific testing requirements in a test rule in 
part 799 of this chapter.

[50 FR 20660, May 17, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 34205, June 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 790.82  Content of exemption application.

    The exemption application must contain:
    (a) The identity of the test rule, the chemical identity, and the 
CAS No. of the test substance on which the application is based.
    (b) The specific testing requirement(s) from which an exemption is 
sought and the basis for the exemption request.
    (c) Name, address, and telephone number of applicant.
    (d) Name, address, and telephone number of appropriate individual to 
contact for further information.
    (e)(1) If required in the test rule to establish equivalence:
    (i) The chemical identity of the test substance on which the 
application is based.
    (ii) Equivalence data specified in Sec. 790.85.
    (2) If a test rule requires testing of a single representative 
substance, EPA will consider all forms of the chemical subject to that 
rule to be equivalent and will not require the submission of equivalence 
data as described in Sec. 790.85.

[50 FR 20660, May 17, 1985, as amended at 54 FR 36315, Sept. 1, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 790.85  Submission of equivalence data.

    If EPA requires in a test rule promulgated under section 4 of the 
Act the testing of two or more test substances which are forms of the 
same chemical, each exemption applicant must submit the following data:
    (a) The chemical identity of each technical-grade chemical substance 
or mixture manufactured and/or processed by the applicant for which the 
exemption is sought. The exact type of identifying data required will be 
specified in the test rule, but may include all characteristics and 
properties of the applicant's substance or mixture, such as boiling 
point, melting point, chemical analysis (including identification and 
amount of impurities), additives, spectral data, and other physical or 
chemical information that may be relevant in determining whether the 
applicant's substance or mixture is equivalent to the specific test 
substance.
    (b) The basis for the applicant's belief that the substance or 
mixture is equivalent to the test substance or mixture.
    (c) Any other data which exemption applicants are directed to submit 
in the test rule which may bear on a determination of equivalence. This 
may include a description of the process by which each technical-grade 
chemical substance or mixture for which an exemption is sought is 
manufactured or processed prior to use or distribution in commerce by 
the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 790.87  Approval of exemption applications.

    (a) EPA will conditionally approve exemption applications if:
    (1)(i) For single-phase test rules, EPA has received a letter of 
intent to conduct the testing from which exemption is sought;
    (ii) For two-phase test rules, EPA has received a complete proposed 
study plan for the testing from which exemption is sought and has 
adopted the study plan, as proposed or modified, as test standards and 
schedules in a final Phase II test rule; and
    (2) The chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the 
application was submitted is equivalent to a test substance or mixture 
for which the

[[Page 24]]

required data have been or are being submitted in accordance with a test 
rule; and
    (3) Submission of the required test data concerning that chemical 
substance or mixture would be duplicative of data which have been or are 
being submitted to EPA in accordance with a test rule.
    (b)(1) If a single representative substance is to be tested under a 
test rule, EPA will consider all forms of the chemical subject to that 
rule to be equivalent and will contact the exemption applicant only if 
information is missing or unclear.
    (2) If two or more representative substances are to be tested under 
a test rule, EPA will evaluate equivalence claims made in each exemption 
application according to the criteria discussed in the test rule.
    (i) If EPA finds an equivalence claim to be in error or inadequately 
supported, the applicant will be notified by certified mail. The 
applicant will be given 15 days to provide clarifying information.
    (ii) Exemption applicants will be notified that equivalence has been 
accepted or rejected.
    (c) The final Phase II test rule which adopts the study plans in 
two-phase rulemaking, a separate Federal Register notice in single-phase 
rulemaking, or a letter by certified mail will give exemption applicants 
final notice that they have received a conditional exemption. All 
conditional exemptions thus granted are contingent upon the test 
sponsors' successful completion of testing according to the 
specifications in the test rule.


<R05>
Sec. 790.88  Denial of exemption application.

    (a) EPA may deny any exemption application if:

the applicant's chemical is equivalent to the test substance; or
    (2) The exemption applicant fails to submit any of the information 
specified in Sec. 790.82; or
    (3) The exemption applicant fails to submit any of the information 
specified in Sec. 790.85 if required in the test rule; or
    (4)(i) For single-phase test rules, EPA has not received a letter of 
intent to conduct the test for which exemption is sought; or
    (ii) For two-phase test rules, EPA has not received an adequate 
study plan for the test for which exemption is sought; or
    (5) The study sponsor(s) fails to initiate the required testing by 
the deadlines adopted in the test rule; or
    (6) The study sponsor(s) fails to submit data as required in the 
test standard and deadlines for submission of test data as adopted in 
the test rule or as modified in accordance with Sec. 790.55.
    (b) EPA will notify the exemption applicant by certified mail or 
Federal Register notice of EPA's determination that the exemption 
application is denied.


<R05>
Sec. 790.90  Appeal of denial of exemption application.

    (a) Within 30 days after receipt of notification that EPA has denied 
an application for exemption, the applicant may file an appeal with EPA.
    (b) The appeal shall indicate the basis for the applicant's request 
for reconsideration.
    (c)(1) The applicant may also include a request for a hearing. 
Hearings will be held according to the procedures described in 
Sec. 790.97.
    (2) Hearing requests must be in writing and must be received by EPA 
within 30 days of receipt of the letter or publication of the Federal 
Register notice described in Sec. 790.88(b). Hearing requests must 
provide reasons why a hearing is necessary.
    (d) If EPA determines that there are material issues of fact, then 
the request for a hearing will be granted. If EPA denies a hearing 
request, EPA will base its decision on the written submission.
    (e) EPA will notify the applicant of its decision within 60 days 
after EPA receives the appeal described in paragraph (a) of this section 
or within 60 days after completion of a hearing described in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (f) The filing of an appeal from the denial of an exemption shall 
not act to stay the applicant's legal obligations under a test rule 
promulgated under section 4 of the Act.

[[Page 25]]


<R05>
Sec. 790.93  Termination of conditional exemption.

    (a) EPA shall terminate a conditional exemption if it determines 
that:
    (1) The test which provided the basis for approval of the exemption 
application has not been started by the deadlines for initiation of 
testing adopted in the test rule or modified in accordance with 
Sec. 790.55; or
    (2) Data required by the test rule have not been generated in 
accordance with the test standards or submitted in accordance with the 
deadlines for submission of test data that were adopted in the test rule 
or modified in accordance with Sec. 790.55; or
    (3) The testing has not been conducted or the data have not been 
generated in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice requirements 
in part 792 of this chapter.

Register notice of EPA's intent to terminate that conditional exemption.
    (c) Within 30 days after receipt of a letter of notification or 
publication of a notice in the Federal Register that EPA intends to 
terminate a conditional exemption, the exemption holder may submit 
information to rebut EPA's preliminary decision or notify EPA by letter 
of its intent to conduct the required test pursuant to the test standard 
established in the final test rule. Such a letter of intent shall 
contain all of the information required by Sec. 790.45(c).
    (d)(1) The exemption holder may also include a request for a 
hearing. Hearings will be held in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in Sec. 790.97.
    (2) Hearing requests must be in writing and must be received by EPA 
within 30 days after receipt of the letter or publication in the Federal 
Register notice described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) EPA will notify the exemption holder by certified letter or by 
Federal Register notice of EPA's final decision concerning termination 
of conditional exemptions and will give instructions as to what actions 
the former exemption holder must take to avoid being found in violation 
of the test rule.


<R05>
Sec. 790.97  Hearing procedures.

    (a) Hearing requests must be in writing to EPA and must include the 
applicant's basis for appealing EPA's decision.
    (b) If more than one applicant has requested a hearing on similar 
grounds, all of those appeals will be considered at the same hearing 
unless confidentiality claims preclude a joint hearing.
    (c) EPA will notify each applicant of EPA's decision within 60 days 
after the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 790.99  Statement of financial responsibility.

    Each applicant for an exemption shall submit the following sworn 
statement with his or her application:

    I understand that if this application is granted before the 
reimbursement period described in section 4(c)(3)(B) of TSCA expires, I 
must pay fair and equitable reimbursement to the person or persons who 
incurred or shared in the costs of complying with the requirement to 
submit data and upon whose data the granting of my application was 
based.

Appendix A to Subpart E--Schedule for Developing Consent Agreements and 
                               Test Rules

    EPA intends to follow the schedule set forth in this Appendix to 
evaluate testing candidates, conduct negotiations, develop consent 
agreements where appropriate, and propose and promulate test rules in 
those instances where testing can be required under section 4(a) of TSCA 
but agreement cannot be reached in timely manner on a consent agreement. 
Where deadlines are imposed by the statute, they are binding on EPA and 
will be observed by the Agency. The remaining dates represent targets 
that EPA intends to meet.
    This schedule is based on what EPA currently believes are reasonable 
target dates. As EPA gains experience with the process and determines 
the feasibility of these schedules, it may adjust the schedule 
accordingly. EPA will solicit public comment before implementing any 
changes in the schedule.

date of receiving the complete list of parties. After the hearing 
officer is appointed, however, no new or different claim may be 
submitted except with the hearing officer's consent.
    (b) Pre-hearing conference. At the request of the parties or at the 
discretion of the American Arbitration Association, a pre-hearing 
conference with a representative of the American Arbitration Association 
and the parties or their counsel will be scheduled in appropriate cases 
to arrange for an exchange of information and the stipulation of 
uncontested facts so as to expedite the proceedings.
    (c) Fixing of locale. The parties may mutually agree on the locale 
where the hearing is to be held. If the locale is not designated within 
45 days from the time the complete list of parties is received, the 
American Arbitration Association shall have power to determine the 
locale. Its decision shall be final and binding. If any party requests, 
and informs the other parties of its request, that the hearing be held 
in a specific locale and the other parties file no objection thereto 
within 14 days of the request, the locale shall be the one requested.
    (d) Time and place. The hearing officer shall fix the time and place 
for each hearing. The American Arbitration Association will mail notice 
to each party at least 14 days in advance.


<R05>
Sec. 791.29  Appointment of hearing officer.

    (a) Qualifications of hearing officer. All hearing officers shall be 
neutral, subject to disqualification for the reasons specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Appointment from panel. Promptly after receiving the complete 
list of parties at the close of the notice period described in 
Sec. 791.22, the American Arbitration Association shall submit 
simultaneously to each party to the dispute an identical list of names. 
Each party to the dispute shall have thirty days from the mailing date 
in which to cross off any names objected to, number the remaining names 
to indicate the order of preference, and return the list to the American 
Arbitration Association. If a party does not return the list within the 
time specified, all persons named therein shall be deemed acceptable to 
that party. From among the persons who have been approved on all lists, 
and in accordance with the designated order of mutual preference, the 
American Arbitration Association shall invite the acceptance of a 
hearing officer to serve. If the parties fail to agree upon any of the 
persons named, or if acceptable hearing officers are unable to act, or 
if for any other reason the appointment cannot be made from the 
submitted lists, the American Arbitration Association shall have the 
power to make the appointment without the submission of any additional 
list.
    (c) Nationality of hearing officer in international dispute. If one 
of the parties is a national or resident of a country other than the 
United States, the hearing officer shall upon the request of any party, 
be appointed from among the nationals of a country other than that of 
the parties.
    (d) Number of hearing officers. The dispute shall be heard and 
determined by one hearing officer unless the American Arbitration 
Association, in its discretion, directs that a greater number of hearing 
officers be appointed.
    (e) Notice of appointment. Notice of the appointment of the hearing 
officer, together with a copy of these rules, and the signed acceptance 
of the hearing officer shall be filed prior to the opening of the first 
hearing.
    (f) Disclosure and challenge procedure. A person appointed as 
hearing officer shall disclose to the American Arbitration Association 
any circumstances likely to affect impartiality, including any bias or 
any financial or personal interest in the result of the hearing or any 
past or present relationship with the parties or their counsel. Upon 
receipt of such information from such hearing officer or other source, 
the American Arbitration Association shall communicate such information 
to the parties, and, if it deems it appropriate to do so, to the hearing 
officer and others. Thereafter, the American Arbitration Association 
shall determine whether the hearing officer should be disqualified and 
shall inform the parties of its decision, which shall be conclusive.

[[Page 29]]

    (g) Vacancies. If any hearing officer should resign, die, withdraw, 
refuse, be disqualified or be unable to perform the duties of the 
office, the American Arbitration Association may, on proof satisfactory 
to it, declare the office vacant. Vacancies shall be filled in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of these rules and the matter 
shall be reheard unless the parties shall agree otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 791.30  Hearing procedures.

    (a) Representation by counsel. Any party may be represented by 
counsel. A party intending to be so represented shall notify the other 
parties and the American Arbitration Association of the name and address 
of counsel at least 5 days prior to the date set for the hearing at 
which counsel is first to appear. When a hearing is initiated by 
counsel, or where an attorney replies for the other party, such notice 
is deemed to have been given.
    (b) Stenographic record. The American Arbitration Association shall 
make the necessary arrangements for the taking of a stenographic record. 
The parties shall share the cost of such record.
    (c) Attendance at hearings. The hearing officer shall have the power 
to require the exclusion of anyone, including a party or other essential 
person, during the testimony of any witness to protect confidential 
business information. It shall be discretionary with the hearing officer 
to determine the propriety of the attendance of any other person.
    (d) Oaths. Hearing officers shall swear or affirm their neutrality 
and their dedication to a fair and equitable resolution. Witnesses shall 
swear or affirm that they are telling the truth.
    (e) Order of proceedings. (1) A hearing shall be opened by the 
filing of the oath of the hearing officer and by the recording of the 
place, time and date of the hearing, the presence of the hearing officer 
and parties, and counsel, if any, and by the receipt by the hearing 
officer of the request for hearing and answer, if any.
    (2) The hearing officer may, at the beginning of the hearing, ask 
for statements clarifying the issues involved.
    (3) The party or parties seeking reimbursement shall then present a 
claim and proofs and witnesses, who shall submit to questions or other 
examination. The party or parties from whom reimbursement is sought 
shall then present a defense and proofs and witnesses, who shall submit 
to questions or other examination. The hearing officer has discretion to 
vary this procedure but shall afford full and equal opportunity to all 
parties for the presentation of any material or relevant proofs.
    (4) Exhibits, when offered by any party, shall be received in 
evidence by the hearing officer. The names and addresses of all 
witnesses and exhibits in order received shall be made a part of the 
record.
    (f) Hearing in the absence of a party. A hearing may proceed in the 
absence of any party which, after due notice, fails to be present or 
fails to obtain an adjournment. An award shall not be made solely on the 
default of a party. The hearing officer shall require the parties who 
are present to submit such evidence as the hearing officer may require 
for the making of an award.
    (g) Evidence. (1) The parties may offer such evidence as they desire 
and shall produce such additional evidence as the hearing officer may 
deem necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute. The 
hearing officer shall be the judge of the relevancy and materiality of 
the evidence offered and conformity to legal rules of evidence shall not 
be necessary. All evidence shall be taken in the presence of all the 
hearing officers and of all the parties, except where any of the parties 
is absent in default, has waived the right to be present, or has been 
excluded by the hearing officer to protect confidential business 
information.
    (2) All documents not filed with the hearing officer at the hearing, 
but arranged for by agreement of the parties, shall be filed with the 
American Arbitration Association for transmission to the hearing 
officer, according to the agreed-upon schedule. All parties shall be 
afforded opportunity to examine such documents.
    (h) Evidence by affidavit and filing of documents. The hearing 
officer shall receive and consider the evidence of witnesses by 
affidavit, but shall give it only such weight as the hearing officer

[[Page 30]]

deems it entitled to after consideration of any objections made to its 
admission.
    (i) Closing of hearings. The hearing officer shall specifically 
inquire of all parties whether they have any further proofs to offer or 
witnesses to be heard. Upon receiving negative replies, the hearing 
officer shall declare the hearings closed and record the time of closing 
of the hearing. If briefs are to be filed, the hearings shall be 
declared closed as of the final date set by the hearing officer for the 
receipt of briefs. If documents are to be filed as provided for in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section and the date set for their receipt is 
later than that set for the receipt of briefs, the later date shall be 
the date of closing the hearings.
    (j) Reopening of hearings. The hearings may be reopened on the 
hearing officer's own motion, or upon application of a party at any time 
before the award is made. If the reopening of the hearings would prevent 
the making of the award within the specified time the matter may not be 
reopened, unless the parties agree upon the extension of the time limit.
    (k) Waiver of oral hearings. The parties may provide, by written 
agreement, for the waiver of oral hearings. If the parties are unable to 
agree as to the procedure, the American Arbitration Association shall 
specify a fair and equitable procedure.
    (l) Waiver of rules. Any party who proceeds with the hearing after 
knowledge that any provision or requirement of these rules has not been 
complied with and who fails to state objection thereto in writing, shall 
be deemed to have waived the right to object.
    (m) Extensions of time. The parties may modify any period of time by 
mutual agreement. The American Arbitration Association for good cause 
may extend any period of time established by these rules, except the 
time for making the award. (Sec. 791.37(a)) The American Arbitration 
Association shall notify the parties of any such extension of time and 
its reason therefor.
    (n) Communication with hearing officer. There shall be no direct 
communication between the parties and a hearing officer other than at 
oral hearings. Any other oral or written communications from the parties 
to the hearing officer shall be directed to the American Arbitration 
Association for transmittal to the hearing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 791.31  Expedited procedures.

    Unless the American Arbitration Association in its discretion 
determines otherwise, the Expedited Procedures described in this section 
shall be applied in any case where the total claim of any party does not 
exceed $5,000, exclusive of interest and hearing costs, and may be 
applied in other cases if the parties agree.
    (a) Application of rules. The expedited hearings will be conducted 
according to the same procedures as the regular ones, except for those 
specifically changed by the expedited rules in this section, 
Sec. 791.31.
    (b) Notice by telephone. The parties shall accept all notices from 
the American Arbitration Association by telephone. Such notices by the 
American Arbitration Association shall subsequently be confirmed in 
writing to the parties. Notwithstanding the failure to confirm in 
writing any notice or objection hereunder, the proceeding shall 
nonetheless be valid if notice or obligation has, in fact, been given by 
telephone.
    (c) Appointment and qualifications of hearing officers. The American 
Arbitration Association shall submit simultaneously to each party to the 
dispute an identical list of five persons from which one hearing officer 
shall be appointed. Each party shall have the right to strike two names 
from the list on a peremptory basis. The list is returnable to the 
American Arbitration Association within 10 days from the date of 
mailing. If for any reasons the appointment cannot be made from the 
list, the American Arbitration Association shall have the authority to 
make the appointment without the submission of additional lists. Such 
appointment shall be subject to disqualification for the reasons 
specified in Sec. 791.29(f). The parties shall be given notice by 
telephone by the American Arbitration Association of the appointment of 
the hearing officer. The parties shall notify the American Arbitration 
Association, by telephone, within 7 days of any objections to the 
hearing

[[Page 31]]

officer(s) appointed. Any objection by a party to such hearing officer 
shall be confirmed in writing to the American Arbitration Association 
with a copy to the other parties.
    (d) Time and place of hearing. The hearing officer shall fix the 
date, time and place of the hearing. The American Arbitration 
Association will notify the parties by telephone, 7 days in advance of 
the hearing date. Formal notice of hearing will be sent by the American 
Arbitration Association to the parties.
    (e) The hearing. Generally, the hearing shall be completed within 1 
day. The hearing officer, for good cause shown, may schedule an 
additional hearing to be held within 5 days.
    (f) Time of award. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the 
Award shall be rendered not later than 15 business days from the date of 
the closing of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 791.34  Serving of notice.

    (a) Each party shall be deemed to have consented that any papers, 
notices or process necessary or proper for the initiation or 
continuation of a hearing under these rules and for any appeal to EPA or 
any court action in connection therewith may be served upon such party 
by mail addressed to such party or its attorney at its last known 
address or by personal service, within or without the state wherein the 
arbitration is to be held (whether such party be within or without the 
United States of America), provided that reasonable opportunity to be 
heard with regard thereto has been granted such party.
    (b) The American Arbitration Association shall, upon the written 
request of a party, furnish to such party, at its expense, certified 
facsimiles of any papers in the American Arbitration Association's 
possession that may be required in appeal to EPA or judicial proceedings 
relating to the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 791.37  The award.

    (a) Time of award. The award shall be made promptly by the hearing 
officer and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, no later than 30 
days from the date of closing the hearings, or if oral hearings have 
been waived, from the date of transmitting the final statements and 
proofs to the hearing officer.
    (b) Form of award. The award shall be in writing and shall be signed 
either by the sole hearing officer or by at least a majority if there is 
more than one. It shall contain a concise statement of its basis and 
rationale, and a timetable for payment of any ordered reimbursement.
    (c) Delivery of award to parties. Parties shall accept as legal 
delivery of the award the delivery of the award or a true copy thereof 
by certified mail to the party at its last known address or to its 
attorney, or by personal service.


<R05>
Sec. 791.39  Fees and expenses.

    (a) Administrative fees. (1) As a not-for-profit organization, the 
American Arbitration Association shall prescribe an Administrative Fee 
Schedule and a Refund Schedule to compensate it for the cost of 
providing administrative services. The schedule in effect at the time of 
filing or the time of refund shall be applicable.
    (2) The administrative fees shall be advanced by the initiating 
party or parties, subject to final apportionment by the hearing officer 
in the award. The administrative fee is increased by 10 percent of the 
original for each additional party.
    (3) Fees and expenses in excess of the limit contained in section 
26(b) of TSCA ($2,500 per person, or $100 per small business) will be 
paid by EPA.
    (b) Expenses. Subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all 
expenses of the hearing, including the cost of recording (though not 
transcribing) the hearing and required traveling and other expenses of 
the hearing officer and of American Arbitration Association 
representatives, and the expenses of any witness or the cost of any 
proofs produced at the direct request of the hearing officer, shall be 
borne equally by the parties, unless they agree otherwise, or unless the 
hearing officer, in the award, assesses such expenses or any part 
thereof against any specified party or parties.
    (c) Hearing officer's fee. Hearing officers will normally serve 
without a fee. In prolonged or special cases the American Arbitration 
Association in consultation with the Administrator may

[[Page 32]]

determine that payment of a fee by the parties is appropriate and may 
establish a reasonable amount, taking into account the extent of service 
by the hearing officer and other relevant circumstances of the case. Any 
arrangements for compensation shall be made through the American 
Arbitration Association and not directly between the parties and the 
hearing officer.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Basis for Proposed Order


<R05>
Sec. 791.40  Basis for the proposed order.

    (a) The hearing officer shall propose a fair and equitable amount of 
reimbursement. The formula in paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
presumed to be fair and equitable as applied to all persons subject to a 
test rule. However, the hearing officer has the discretion to modify the 
formula, or to use some other basis for allocation if necessary. 
Additional factors that may be taken into account include, but are not 
limited to, relative amounts of exposure attributable to each person and 
the effect of the reimbursement share on competitive position.
    (b) In general, each person's share of the test cost shall be in 
proportion to its share of the total production volume of the test 
chemical:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                V<INF>x                      
                                  R<INF>x  =   C ---------                   
                                                V<INF>t                      
                                                                        

Where:

R=the reimbursement share owed by company X.
C=the total cost of the testing required by the test rule.
V<INF>x</INF>=the volume of the test chemical produced or imported by 
          company X over the period defined by Sec. 791.48.
V<INF>t</INF>=the total volume of the test chemical produced or imported 
          over the period defined by Sec. 791.48.

    (c) The burden of proposing modifications to the formula shall lie 
with the party requesting the modification.


<R05>
Sec. 791.45  Processors.

    (a) Generally, processors will be deemed to have fulfilled their 
testing and reimbursement responsibilities indirectly, through higher 
prices passed on by those directly responsible, the manufacturers. There 
are three circumstances in which processors will have a responsibility 
to provide reimbursement directly to those paying for the testing:
    (1) When a test rule or subsequent Federal Register notice 
pertaining to a test rule expressly obligates processors as well as 
manufacturers to assume direct testing and data reimbursement 
responsibilities.
    (2) When one or more manufacturers demonstrate to the hearing 
officer that it is necessary to include processors in order to provide 
fair and equitable reimbursement in a specific case.
    (3) When one or more processors voluntarily agree to reimburse 
manufacturers for a portion of test costs. Only those processors who 
volunteer will incur the obligation.
    (b) A hearing including processors shall be initiated in the same 
way as those including only manufacturers. Voluntary negotiations must 
be attempted in good faith first, and the request for a hearing must 
contain the names of the parties and a description of the unsuccessful 
negotiations.
    (c) When processors as well as manufacturers are required to provide 
reimbursement, the hearing officer will decide for each case how the 
reimbursement should be allocated among the participating parties. When 
a test rule is applicable solely to processors, the hearing officer will 
apply the formula to the amount of the test chemical purchased or 
processed.


<R05>
Sec. 791.48  Production volume.

    (a) Production volume will be measured over a period that begins one 
calendar year before publication of the final test rule in the Federal 
Register and continues up to the latest data available upon resolution 
of a dispute.
    (b) For the purpose of determining fair reimbursement shares, 
production volume shall include amounts of the test chemical imported in 
bulk form and mixtures, and the total domestic production of the 
chemical including that produced as a byproduct. Impurities will not be 
included unless the test rule specifically includes them.

[[Page 33]]

    (c) Amounts of the test chemical manufactured for export will not be 
included unless covered by a finding under TSCA section 12(a)(2).
    (d) Chemicals excluded from the jurisdiction of TSCA by section 
3(2)(B) need not be included in the computation of production volume. 
(Chemicals used as intermediates to produce pesticides are covered by 
TSCA.)
    (e) The burden of establishing the fact that particular amounts of 
the test chemical are produced for exempt purposes lies with the party 
seeking to exclude those amounts from the calculation of his production 
volume.


<R05>
Sec. 791.50  Costs.

    (a) All costs reasonable and necessary to comply with the test rule, 
taking into account the practices of other laboratories in conducting 
similar tests, are eligible for reimbursement. Necessary costs include:
    (1) Direct and indirect costs of planning, conducting, analyzing and 
submitting the test results to EPA.
    (2) A reasonable profit, and a reasonable rate of interest and 
depreciation on the tester's initial capital investment.
    (3) The cost of repeating or repairing tests where failure was 
demonstrably due to some cause other than negligence of the tester.
    (b) Costs attributable to tests beyond those specified by EPA shall 
not be eligible for reimbursement under this rule.


<R05>
Sec. 791.52  Multiple tests.

    When more than one of a particular kind of test required by the test 
rule is performed, the additional costs will be shared among all those 
holding exemptions. The costs of all the tests will be added together 
and each exemption holder shall be responsible for a share of the total 
which is equal to its share of the total production of the test 
chemical. The exemption holders shall divide their shares between test 
sponsors in proportion to the costs of their respective tests. Those 
sponsoring a particular test do not have to obtain exemptions for that 
test and therefore do not have reimbursement responsibilities for the 
same tests done by others.


<R04>
                            Subpart D--Review


<R05>
Sec. 791.60  Review.

    (a) The hearing officer's proposed order shall become the final 
Agency order 30 days after issuance unless within the 30-day period one 
of the parties requests Agency review or the Administrator of his own 
initiative decides to review the proposed order.
    (b) The proposed order may be reviewed upon the record of the 
hearing and the petitions for review. If necesary, the Administrator may 
order the transcription of the stenographic record of the hearing, 
written briefs, oral arguments or any other reasonable aids to making an 
equitable decision.
    (c) The final Agency order may be reviewed in federal court as 
provided by 26 U.S.C. 2603(c).


<R04>
                         Subpart E--Final Order


<R05>
Sec. 791.85  Availablity of final Agency order.

    The final Agency order shall be available to the public for 
inspection and copying pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), subject to 
necessary confidentiality restrictions.


<R04>
                       Subpart F--Prohibited Acts


<R05>
Sec. 791.105  Prohibited acts.

    Failure to provide information required by the Agency or to pay the 
amounts awarded under this rule within time alloted in the final order 
shall constitute a violation of 15 U.S.C. 2614(1) or 2614(3).

    (b) EPA, at its discretion, may not consider reliable for purposes 
of showing that a chemical substance or mixture does not present a risk 
of injury to health or the environment any study which was not conducted 
in accordance with this part. EPA, at its discretion, may rely upon such 
studies for purposes of showing adverse effects. The determination that 
a study will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the 
sponsor of a required test of the obligation under any applicable 
statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.
    (c) If data submitted to fulfill a requirement of a testing consent 
agreement or a test rule issued under section 4 of TSCA are not 
developed in accordance with this part, EPA may determine that the 
sponsor has not fulfilled its obligations under section 4 of TSCA and 
may require the sponsor to develop data in accordance with the 
requirements of this part in order to satisfy such obligations.

Sec. 795.70  Indirect photolysis screening test: Sunlight photolysis in waters containing dissolved humic substances.

    (a) Introduction. (1) Chemicals dissolved in natural waters are 
subject to two types of photoreaction. In the first case, the chemical 
of interest absorbs sunlight directly and is transformed to products 
when unstable excited states of the molecule decompose. In the second 
case, reaction of dissolved chemical is the result of chemical or 
electronic excitation transfer from light-absorbing humic species in the 
natural water. In contrast to direct photolysis, this photoreaction is 
governed initially by the spectroscopic properties of the natural water.
    (2) In general, both indirect and direct processes can proceed 
simultaneously. Under favorable conditions the measurement of a 
photoreaction rate constant in sunlight (K<INF>pE</INF>) in a natural 
water body will yield a net value that is the sum of two first-order 
reaction rate constants for the direct (k<INF>DE</INF>) and indirect 
(k<INF>IE</INF>) pathways which can be expressed by the relationship

                               Equation 1

k<INF>pE</INF>=k<INF>DE</INF>+k<INF>IE</INF>.

This relationship is obtained when the reaction volume is optically thin 
so that a negligible fraction of the incident light is absorbed and is 
sufficiently dilute in test chemical; thus the direct and indirect 
photoreaction processes become first-order.
    (3) In pure water only, direct photoreaction is possible, although 
hydrolysis, biotransformation, sorption, and volatilization also can 
decrease the concentraton of a test chemical. By measuring 
k<INF>pE</INF> in a natural water and k<INF>DE</INF> in pure water, 
k<INF>IE</INF> can be calculated.
    (4) Two protocols have been written that measure k<INF>DE</INF> in 
sunlight or predict k<INF>DE</INF> in sunlight from laboratory 
measurements with monochromatic light (USEPA (1984) under paragraph 
(f)(14) and (15) of this section; Mill et al. (1981) under paragraph 
(f)(9) of this section; Mill et al. (1982) under paragraph (f)(10) of 
this section; Mill et al. (1983) under paragraphs (f)(11) of this 
section). As a preface to the use of the present protocol, it is not 
necessary to know k<INF>DE</INF>; it will be determined under conditions 
that definitively establish whether k<INF>IE</INF> is significant with 
respect to k<INF>DE</INF>.
    (5) This protocol provides a cost effective test method for 
measuring k<INF>IE</INF> for test chemicals in a natural water 
(synthetic humic water, SHW) derived from commercial humic material. It 
describes the preparation and standardization of SHW. To implement the 
method, a test chemical is exposed to sunlight in round tubes containing 
SHW and tubes containing pure water for defined periods of time based on 
a screening test.
    (6) To correct for variations in solar irradiance during the 
reaction period, an actinometer is simultaneously insolated. From these 
data, an indirect photoreaction rate constant is calculated that is 
applicable to clear-sky, near-surface, conditions in fresh water bodies.
    (7) In contrast to k<INF>DE</INF>, which, once measured, can be 
calculated for different seasons and latitudes, k<INF>IE</INF> only

[[Page 47]]

applies to the season and latitude for which it is determined. This 
condition exists because the solar action spectrum for indirect 
photoreaction in humic-containing waters is not generally known and 
would be expected to change for different test chemicals. For this 
reason, k<INF>pE</INF>, which contains k<INF>IE</INF>, is likewise valid 
only for the experimental data and latitude.
    (8) The value of k<INF>pE</INF> represents an atypical quantity 
because k<INF>IE</INF> will change somewhat from water body to water 
body as the amount and quality of dissolved aquatic humic substances 
change. Studies have shown, however, that for optically-matched natural 
waters, these differences are usually within a factor of two (Zepp et 
al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(17) of this section).
    (9) This protocol consists of three separate phases that should be 
completed in the following order: In Phase 1, SHW is prepared and 
adjusted; in Phase 2, the test chemical is irradiated in SHW and pure 
water (PW) to obtain approximate sunlight photoreaction rate constants 
and to determine whether direct and indirect photoprocesses are 
important; in Phase 3, the test chemical is again irradiated in PW and 
SHW. To correct for photobleaching of SHW and also solar irradiance 
variations, tubes containing SHW and actinometer solutions are exposed 
simultaneously. From these data k<INF>pE</INF> is calculated that is the 
sum of k<INF>IE</INF> and k<INF>DE</INF> (Equation 1) (Winterle and Mill 
(1985) under paragraph (f)(12) of this section).
    (b) Phase 1--Preparation and standardization of synthetic natural 
water--(1) Approach. (i) Recent studies have demonstrated that natural 
waters can promote the indirect (or sensitized) photoreaction of 
dissolved organic chemicals. This reactivity is imparted by dissolved 
organic material (DOM) in the form of humic substances. These materials 
absorb sunlight and produce reactive intermediates that include singlet 
oxygen (<SUP>1</SUP>0<INF>2</INF>) (Zepp et al. (1977) under paragraph 
(f)(20) of this section, Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(17) of 
this section, Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(18) of this 
section, Wolff et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(16) of this section, 
Haag et al. (1984) under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, Haag et al. 
(1984) under paragraph (f)(7) of this section); peroxy radicals 
(RO<INF>2</INF>-) (Mill et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(9) of this 
section; Mill et al. (1983) under paragraph (f)(8) of this section); 
hydroxyl radicals (HO-) (Mill et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(9) of 
this section, Draper and Crosby (1981, 1984) under paragraphs (f)(3) and 
(4) of this section); superoxide anion (0<INF>2</INF><SUP>-</SUP>-) and 
hydroperoxy radicals (HO<INF></INF>-). (Cooper and Zika (1983) under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, Draper and Crosby (1983) under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section); and triplet excited states of the 
humic substances (Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(17) of this 
section, Zepp et al. (1985) under paragraph (f)(21) of this section). 
Synthetic humic waters, prepared by extracting commercial humic or 
fulvic materials with water, photoreact similarly to natural waters when 
optically matched (Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraphs (f)(17) and (18) 
of this section).
    (ii) The indirect photoreactivity of a chemical in a natural water 
will depend on its response to these reactive intermediates, and 
possibly others yet unknown, as well as the ability of the water to 
generate such species. This latter feature will vary from water-to-water 
in an unpredictable way, judged by the complexity of the situation.
    (iii) The approach to standardizing a test for indirect 
photoreactivity is to use a synthetic humic water (SHW) prepared by 
water-extracting commercial humic material. This material is 
inexpensive, and available to any laboratory, in contrast to a specific 
natural water. The SHW can be diluted to a dissolved organic carbon 
(DOC) content and uv-visible absorbance typical of most surface fresh 
waters.
    (iv) In recent studies it has been found that the reactivity of SHW 
mixtures depends on pH, and also the history of sunlight exposure (Mill 
et al. (1983) under paragraph (f)(11) of this section). The SHW 
solutions initially photobleach with a time-dependent rate constant. As 
such, an SHW test system has been designed that is buffered to maintain 
pH and is pre-aged in sunlight to produce, subsequently, a predictable 
bleaching behavior.
    (v) The purpose of Phase 1 is to prepare, pre-age, and dilute SHW to 
a

[[Page 48]]

standard mixture under defined, reproducible conditions.
    (2) Procedure. (i) Twenty grams of Aldrich humic acid are added to a 
clean 2-liter Pyrex Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is filled with 2 liters 
of 0.1 percent NaOH solution. A stir bar is added to the flask, the 
flask is capped, and the solution is stirred for 1 hour at room 
temperature. At the end of this time the dark brown supernatant is 
decanted off and either filtered through coarse filter paper or 
centrifuged and then filtered through 0.4 )m microfilter. The pH is 
adjusted to 7.0 with dilute H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> and filter 
sterilized through a 0.2 )m filter into a rigorously cleaned 2-liter 
Erlenmeyer flask. This mixture contains roughly 60 ppm DOC and the 
absorbance (in a 1 cm path length cell) is approximately 1.7 at 313 nm 
and 0.7 at 370 nm.
    (ii) Pre-aging is accomplished by exposing the concentrated solution 
in the 2-liter flask to direct sunlight for 4 days in early spring or 
late fall; 3 days in late spring, summer, or early fall. At this time 
the absorbance of the solution is measured at 370 nm, and a dilution 
factor is calculated to decrease the absorbance to 0.50 in a 1 cm path 
length cell. If necessary, the pH is re-adjusted to 7.0. Finally, the 
mixture is brought to exact dilution with a precalculated volume of 
reagent-grade water to give a final absorbance of 0.500 in a 1-cm path 
length cell at 370 nm. It is tightly capped and refrigerated.
    (iii) This mixture is SHW stock solution. Before use it is diluted 
10-fold with 0.010 M phosphate buffer to produce a pH 7.0 mixture with 
an absorbance of 5.00 x 10<SUP>-2</SUP> at 370 nm, and a dissolved 
organic carbon of about 5 ppm. Such values are characteristic of many 
surface fresh waters.
    (3) Rationale. The foregoing procedure is designed to produce a 
standard humic-containing solution that is pH controlled, and 
sufficiently aged that its photobleaching first-order rate constant is 
not time dependent. It has been demonstrated that after 7 days of winter 
sunlight exposure, SHW solutions photobleached with a nearly constant 
rate constant (Mill et al. (1983) under paragraph (f)(11) of this 
section).
    (c) Phase 2--Screening test--(1) Introduction and purpose. (i) Phase 
2 measurements provide approximate solar photolysis rate constants and 
half-lives of test chemicals in PW and SHW. If the photoreaction rate in 
SHW is significantly larger than in PW (factor of > 2X) then the test 
chemical is subject to indirect photoreaction and Phase 3 is necessary. 
Phase 2 data are needed for more accurate Phase 3 measurements, which 
require parallel solar irradiation of actinometer and test chemical 
solutions. The actinometer composition is adjusted according to the 
results of Phase 2 for each chemical, to equalize as much as possible 
photoreaction rate constants of chemical in SHW and actinometer.
    (ii) In Phase 2, sunlight photoreaction rate constants are measured 
in round tubes containing SHW and then mathematically corrected to a 
flat water surface geometry. These rate constants are not corrected to 
clear-sky conditions.
    (2) Procedure. (i) Solutions of test chemicals should be prepared 
using sterile, air-saturated, 0.010 M, pH 7.0 phosphate buffer and 
reagent-grade (or purer) chemicals.\1\ Reaction mixtures should be 
prepared with chemicals at concentrations at less than one-half their 
solubility in pure water and at concentrations such that, at any 
wavelengths above 290 nm, the absorbance in a standard quartz sample 
cell with a 1-cm path length is less than 0.05. If the chemicals are too 
insoluble in water to permit reasonable handling or analytical 
procedures, 1-volume percent acetonitrile may be added to the buffer as 
a cosolvent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\The water should be ASTM Type IIA, or an equivalent grade.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) This solution should be mixed 9.00:1.00 by volume with PW or 
SHW stock solution to provide working solutions. In the case of SHW, it 
gives a ten-fold dilution of SHW stock solution. Six mL aliquots of each 
working solution should then be transferred to separate 12  x  100 mm 
quartz tubes with screw tops and tightly sealed with Mininert valves.\2\ 
Twenty four tubes are required for each chemical solution

[[Page 49]]

(12 samples and 12 dark controls), to give a total of 48 tubes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Mininert Teflon sampling vials are available from Alltech 
Associates, Inc., 202 Campus Dr., Arlington Heights, IL 60004.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) The sample tubes are mounted in a photolysis rack with the 
tops facing geographically north and inclined 30 deg. from the 
horizontal. The rack should be placed outdoors over a black background 
in a location free of shadows and excessive reflection.
    (iv) Reaction progress should be measured with an analytical 
technique that provides a precision of at least <plus-minus>5 percent. 
High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatograph (GC) 
have proven to be the most general and precise analytical techniques.
    (v) Sample and control solution concentrations are calculated by 
averaging analytical measurements for each solution. Control solutions 
should be analyzed at least twice at zero time and at other times to 
determine whether any loss of chemical in controls or samples has 
occurred by some adventitious process during the experiment.
    (vi) Whenever possible the following procedures should be completed 
in clear, warm, weather so that solutions will photolyze more quickly 
and not freeze.
    (A) Starting at noon on day zero, expose to sunlight 24 sample tubes 
mounted on the rack described above. Tape 24 foil-wrapped controls to 
the bottom of the rack.
    (B) Analyze two sample tubes and two unexposed controls in PW and 
SHW for chemical at 24 hours. Calculate the round tube photolysis rate 
constants (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF> 
if the percent conversions are J 20 percent but F 80 percent. The rate 
constants (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF> 
are calculated, respectively, from Equations 2 and 3:

                               Equation 2

(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>=(1/t)Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
          C<INF>t</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> (in d<SUP>-1</SUP>)

                               Equation 3

(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF>=(1/t)Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
          C<INF>t</INF>)<INF>W</INF> (in d<SUP>-1</SUP>),

where the subscript identifies a reaction in SHW or PW; t is the 
photolysis time in calendar days; C<INF>o</INF> is the initial molar 
concentration; and C<INF>t</INF> is the molar concentration in the 
irradiated tube at t. In this case t=1 day.
    (C) If less than 20 percent conversion occurs in SHW in 1 day, 
repeat the procedure for SHW and PW at 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, or 16 
days, or until 20 percent conversion is reached. Do not extend the 
experiment past 16 days. If less than 20 percent photoreaction occurs in 
SHW at the end of 16 days the chemical is ``photoinert''. Phase 3 is not 
applicable.
    (D) If more than 80 percent photoreaction occurs at the end of day 1 
in SHW, repeat the experiment with eight each of the remaining foil-
wrapped PW and SHW controls. Divide these sets into four sample tubes 
each, leaving four foil-wrapped controls taped to the bottom of the 
rack.
    (1) Expose tubes of chemical in SHW and PW to sunlight starting at 
0900 hours and remove one tube and one control at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours. 
Analyze all tubes the next day.
    (2) Extimate (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> for the first tube in 
which photoreaction is J 20 percent but F 80 percent. If more than 80 
percent conversion occurs in the first SHW tube, report: ``The half-life 
is less than one hour'' and end all testing. The chemical is 
``photolabile.'' Phase 3 is not applicable.
    (3) The rate constants (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF> are calculated from equations 2 and 3 but 
the time of irradiation must be adjusted to reflect the fact that day-
averaged rate constants are approximately one-third of rate constants 
averaged over only 8 daylight hours. For 1 hour of insolation enter 
t=0.125 day into equation 2. For reaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours 
enter 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 days, respectively. Proceed to Phase 3 testing.
    (4) Once (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF> are measured, determine the ratio R from 
equation 4:

                               Equation 4

R=(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>/(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF>.

The coefficient R, defined by Equation 4, is equal to 
[(k<INF>I</INF>+k<INF>D</INF>)/k<INF>D</INF>]. If R is in the range 0 to 
1, the photoreaction is inhibited by the synthetic humic water and Phase 
3 does not apply. If R is in the range 1 to 2, the test chemical is 
marginally susceptable to indirect photolysis. In this case, Phase 3 
studies are optional. If R is greater than 2, Phase 3 measurements are 
necessary to measure k<INF>pE</INF> and to evaluate k<INF>IE</INF>.
    (vii) Since the rate of photolysis in tubes is faster than the rate 
in natural

[[Page 50]]

water bodies, values of near-surface photolysis rate constants in 
natural and pure water bodies, k<INF>pE</INF> and k<INF>DE</INF>, 
respectively, can be obtained from (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW </INF>and 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF> from Equations 5 and 6:

                               Equation 5

k<INF>pE</INF>=0.45(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>

                               Equation 6

k<INF>DE</INF>=0.45(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>W</INF>.

The factor 0.45 is an approximate geometric correction for scattered 
light in tubes versus horizontal surfaces. A rough value of 
k<INF>IE</INF>, the rate constant for indirect photolysis in natural 
waters or SHW, can be estimated from the difference between 
k<INF>pE</INF> and k<INF>DE</INF> using Equation 7:

                               Equation 7

k<INF>IE</INF>=k<INF>pE</INF>-k<INF>DE</INF>.

    (3) Criteria for Phase 2. (i) If no loss of chemical is found in 
dark control solutions compared with the analysis in tubes at zero time 
(within experimental error), any loss of chemical in sunlight is assumed 
to be due to photolysis, and the procedure provides a valid estimate of 
k<INF>pE</INF> and k<INF>DE</INF>. Any loss of chemical in the dark-
control solutions may indicate the intervention of some other loss 
process such as hydrolysis, microbial degradation, or volatilization. In 
this case, more detailed experiments are needed to trace the problem and 
if possible eliminate or minimize the source of loss.
    (ii) Rate constants determined by the Phase 2 protocol depend upon 
latitude, season, and weather conditions. Note that 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and k<INF>D</INF> values apply to round 
tubes and k<INF>pE</INF> and k<INF>DE</INF> values apply to a natural 
water body. Because both (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and k<INF>D</INF> 
are measured under the same conditions the ratio 
((k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>/k<INF>D</INF>) is a valid measure of the 
susceptibility of a chemical to indirect photolysis. However, since SHW 
is subject to photobleaching, (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> will 
decrease with time because the indirect rate will diminish. Therefore, R 
>2 is considered to be a conservative limit because 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> will become systematically smaller with 
time.
    (4) Rationale. The Phase 2 protocol is a simple procedure for 
evaluating direct and indirect sunlight photolysis rate constants of a 
chemical at a specific time of year and latitude. It provides a rough 
rate constant for the chemical in SHW that is necessary for Phase 3 
testing. By comparison with the direct photoreaction rate constant, it 
can be seen whether the chemical is subject to indirect photoreaction 
and whether Phase 3 tests are necessary.
    (5) Scope and limitations. (i) Phase 2 testing separates test 
chemicals into three convenient categories: ``Photolabile'', 
``photoinert'', and those chemicals having sunlight half-lives in round 
tubes in the range of 1 hour to 50 days. Chemicals in the first two 
categories fall outside the practical limits of the test, and cannot be 
used in Phase 3. All other chemicals are suitable for Phase 3 testing.
    (ii) The test procedure is simple and inexpensive, but does require 
that the chemical dissolve in water at sufficient concentrations to be 
measured by some analytical technique but not have appreciable 
absorbance in the range 290 to 825 nm. Phase 2 tests should be done 
during a clear-sky period to obtain the best results. Testing will be 
less accurate for chemicals with half-lives of less than 1 day because 
dramatic fluctuations in sunlight intensity can arise from transient 
weather conditions and the difficulty of assigning equivalent reaction 
times. Normal diurnal variations also affect the photolysis rate 
constant. Phase 3 tests should be started as soon as possible after the 
Phase 2 tests to ensure that the (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> estimate 
remains valid.
    (6) Illustrative Example. (i) Chemical A was dissolved in 0.010 M pH 
7.0 buffer. The solution was filtered through a 0.2 )m filter, air 
saturated, and analyzed. It contained 1.7 x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> M A, five-
fold less than its water solubility of 8.5 x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> M at 
25 deg.C. A uv spectrum (1-cm path length) versus buffer blank showed no 
absorbance greater than 0.05 in the wavelength interval 290 to 825 nm, a 
condition required for the Phase 2 protocol. The 180 mL mixture was 
diluted by the addition of 20 mL of SHW stock solution.
    (ii) The SHW solution of A was photolyzed in sealed quartz tubes 
(12 x 100 mm) in the fall season starting on October 1. At the end of 1 
and 2 days, respectively, the concentration of

[[Page 51]]

A was found to be 1.13 x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> M and 0.92 x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> 
M compared to unchanged dark controls (1.53 x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> M).
    (iii) The tube photolysis rate constant of chemical A was calculated 
from Equation 2 under paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B) of this section. The first 
time point at day 1 was used because the fraction of A remaining was in 
the range 20 to 80 percent:

(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>=(1/1d)Pn(1.53 x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP>/1.13 
          x 10 <SUP>-5</SUP>) (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>=0.30 
          d<SUP>-1</SUP>.

    (iv) From this value, k<INF>pE</INF> was found to be 0.14 
d-<SUP>1</SUP> using equation 5 under paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this 
section:

k<INF>pE</INF>=0.45(0.30 d<SUP>-1</SUP>)=0.14d<SUP>-1</SUP>.

    (v) From measurements in pure water, k<INF>D</INF> for chemical A 
was found to be 0.085 d<SUP>-1</SUP>. Because the ratio of 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>/k<INF>D</INF>(=3.5) is greater than 2, 
Phase 3 experiments were started.
    (d) Phase 3--Indirect photoreaction with actinometer: Calculation of 
k<INF>IE</INF> and k<INF>pE</INF>--(1) Introduction and purpose.
    (i) The purpose of Phase 3 is to measure k<INF>Io</INF>, the 
indirect photolysis rate constant in tubes, and then to calculate 
k<INF>pE</INF> for the test chemical in a natural water. If the 
approximate (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> determined in Phase 2 is not 
significantly greater than k<INF>D</INF> measured for the experiment 
date of Phase 2, then Phase 3 is unnecessary because the test chemical 
is not subject to indirect photoreaction.
    (ii) In the case (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> is significantly 
larger than k<INF>D</INF>, Phase 3 is necessary. The rate constant 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> is used to choose an actinometer 
composition that matches the actinometer rate to the test chemical rate. 
Test chemical solutions in SHW and in pure water buffer are then 
irradiated in sunlight in parallel with actinometer solutions, all in 
tubes.
    (iii) The actinometer used is the p-nitroacetophenone-pyridine 
(PNAP/PYR) system developed by Dulin and Mill (1982) under paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section and is used in two EPA test guidelines (USEPA 
(1984) under paragraphs (f) (14) and (15) of this section). By varying 
the pyridine concentration, the PNAP photolysis half-life can be 
adjusted over a range of several hours to several weeks. The starting 
PNAP concentration is held constant.
    (iv) SHW is subject to photobleaching that decreases its ability to 
promote indirect photolysis based on its ability to absorb sunlight. 
This effect will be significant when the test period exceeds a few days. 
To correct for photobleaching, tubes containing SHW are irradiated in 
action to the other tubes above.
    (v) At any time, the loss of test chemical is given by Equation 8 
assuming actinometric correction to constant light flux:

                               Equation 8

-(d[C]/dt)=k<INF>I</INF>[C]+k<INF>D</INF>[C].

    (vi) The indirect photolysis rate constant, k<INF>I</INF>, is 
actually time dependent because SHW photobleaches; the rate constant 
k<INF>I</INF>, after pre-aging, obeys the formula:

                               Equation 9

k<INF>I</INF>=k<INF>Io</INF> exp(-kt),

in which k<INF>Io</INF> is the initial indirect photoreaction rate 
constant and k is the SHW photobleaching rate constant. After 
substituting equation 9 for k<INF>I</INF> in Equation 8 under paragraph 
(d)(1)(v) of this section, and rearranging, one obtains

-(d[C]/[C]=k<INF>Io</INF>[exp(-kt)]dt+k<INF>D</INF>dt.

This expression is integrated to give Equation 10:

                               Equation 10

Pn(C<INF></INF><INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>SHW</INF>=(k<INF>Io</INF>/
          k)[1-exp(-kt)]+k<INF>D</INF>t.

The term (k<INF>Io</INF>/k) can now be evaluated. Since in pure water, 
Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>W</INF>=k<INF>D</INF>t, then subtracting this 
equation from Equation 10 gives

                               Equation 11

Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>SHW</INF>-Pn(c<INF>o</INF>/
          C)<INF>W</INF>=(k<INF>Io</INF>/k)[1-exp(-kt)].

The photobleaching fraction, [1-exp(-kt)], is equivalent to the 
expression [1-(A<INF>370</INF>/A deg.<INF>370</INF>)], where 
A deg.<INF>370</INF> and A<INF>370</INF> are the absorbances at 370 nm, 
and are proportional to humic sensitizer content at times zero and t. 
Therefore, (k<INF>Io</INF>/k) is derived from the slope of a linear 
regression using [Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>SHW</INF>-Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
C)<INF>W</INF>] as the dependent variable and [1-(A<INF>370</INF>/
A deg.<INF>370</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>] as the independent variable.
    (vii) To evaluate k<INF>Io</INF>, the parameter k has to be 
evaluated under standard sunlight conditions. Therefore, the

[[Page 52]]

photolysis rate constant for the PNAP/PYR actinometer (k<INF>A</INF>) is 
used to evaluate k by linear regression on Equation 12:

                               Equation 12

Pn(A deg.<INF>370</INF>/A<INF>370</INF>)=(k/
          k<INF>A</INF>)Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>PNAP</INF>,

where the slope is (k/k<INF>A</INF>) and the value of k<INF>A</INF> is 
calculated from the concentration of pyridine and the absorption of 
light by PNAP: k<INF>A</INF>=2.2(0.0169)[PYR]k<INF>a</INF>. Values of 
k<INF>a</INF> are listed in the following Table 1.

\2\ For use in Equation 15 under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.   

The value of k<INF>Io</INF> is then given by Equation 13:

                               Equation 13

k<INF>Io</INF>=(k<INF>Io</INF>/k)(k/k<INF>A</INF>)k<INF>A</INF>.

    (viii) To obtain k<INF>D</INF>, determine the ratio (k<INF>D</INF>/
k<INF>A</INF>) from a linear regression of Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
C)<INF>W</INF> versus Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>PNAP</INF> according to 
Equation 13a:

                              Equation 13a

Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>W</INF>=(k<INF>D</INF>/
          k<INF>A</INF>)Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C)<INF>PNAP</INF>.

The slope is (k<INF>D</INF>/k<INF>A</INF>), and k<INF>D</INF> is 
obtained by multiplication of this slope with the known value of 
k<INF>A</INF>: i.e., k<INF>D</INF>=(k<INF>D</INF>/
k<INF>A</INF>)k<INF>A</INF>.
    (ix) Then, (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> values in SHW are 
determined by summing k<INF>D</INF> and K<INF>Io</INF> as follows:

                               Equation 14

(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>=k<INF>Io</INF>+k<INF>D</INF>.

    (x) Finally, k<INF>pE</INF> is calculated from the precise 
relationship, Equation 5a:

                               Equation 5a

k<INF>pE</INF>=0.455(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>.

    (2) Procedure. (i) Using the test chemical photoreaction rate 
constant in round tubes, (k<INF>p</INF>) <INF>SHW,</INF> determined in 
Phase 2 under paragraph (c) of this section, and the absorption rate 
constant, k<greek-a> found in Table 1, under paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of 
this section, calculate the molar pyridine concentration required by the 
PNAP/PYR actinometer using Equation 15:

                               Equation 15

[PYR]/M=26.9[(k<INF>p</INF>) <INF>SHW</INF>/k<INF>a</INF>].

This pyridine concentration makes the actinometer rate constant match 
the test chemical rate constant.
    (A) The variable k<INF>a</INF> (= @ e <INF>ga</INF> L<INF>g</INF>) 
is equal to the day-averaged rate constant for sunlight absorption by 
PNAP (USEPA (1984) under paragraph (f)(14) of this section; Mill et al. 
(1982) under paragraph (f)(10) of this section, Zepp and Cline (1977) 
under paragraph (f)(19) of this section) which changes with season and 
latitude.
    (B) The variable k<INF>a</INF> is selected from Table 1 under 
paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this section for the season nearest the mid-
experiment date of Phase 2 studies and the decadic latitude nearest the 
experimental site.
    (ii) Once [PYR] is determined, an actinometer solution is prepared 
by adding 1.00 mL of 1.0 x 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M (0.165 gms/100 mL) PNAP 
stock solution (in CH<INF>3</INF> CN solvent) and the required volume, 
V, of PYR to a 1 liter volumetric flask. The flask is then filled with 
distilled water to give 1 liter of solution. The volume V can be 
calculated from Equation 16:

                               Equation 16

V/mL=[PYR]/0.0124.

The PNAP/PYR solutions should be wrapped with aluminum foil and kept out 
of bright light after preparation.
    (iii) The following solutions should be prepared and individually 
added in 6.00 mL aliquots to 12/100 mm quartz sample tubes; 8 tubes 
should be filled with each solution:
    (A) PNAP/PYR actinometer solution.
    (B) Test chemical in pH 7.0, 0.010 M phosphate buffer.
    (C) Test chemcial in pH 7.0, 0.010 M phosphate buffer/SHW.
    (D) pH 7.0, 0.010 M phosphate buffer/SHW. Four tubes of each set are 
wrapped in foil and used as controls.

[[Page 53]]

    (iv) The tubes are placed in the photolysis rack (Phase 2, 
Procedure) at 0900 hours on day zero, with the controls taped to the 
bottom of the rack. One tube of each composition is removed, along with 
their respective controls, according to a schedule found in Table 2, 
which categorizes sampling times on the basis of 
(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> determined in Phase 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v) The tubes containing PNAP, test chemical, and their controls are 
analyzed for residual concentrations soon after the end of the 
experiment. PNAP is conveniently analyzed by HPLC, using a 30 cm 
C<INF>18</INF> reverse phase column and a uv detector set at 280 nm. The 
mobile phase is 2 percent acetic acid, 50 percent acetonitrile and 48 
percent water (2 mL/min flow rate). Tubes containing only SHW (solution 
D) should be analyzed by absorption spectroscopy at 370 nm after storage 
at 4 deg.C in the dark. The absorbance range to be measured is 0.05 to 
0.01 AU (1 cm).
    (vi) If controls are well-behaved and show no significant loss of 
chemical or absorbance change, then k<INF>I</INF> can be calculated. In 
tabular form (see Table 4 under paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this 
section) arrange the quantities Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C<INF>t</INF>) 
<INF>SHW</INF>, Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/C<INF>t</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>, 
[1-(A<INF>370</INF>/A<SUP>o</SUP><INF>370</INF>)], 
Pn(A<SUP>o</SUP><INF>370</INF>/A<INF>370</INF>), and Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/

under paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section in the form of Equation 17,

                               Equation 17

plot the quantities [Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
C<INF>t</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>-Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
C<INF>t</INF>)<INF>W</INF>] versus the independent variable 
[1-(A<INF>370</INF>/A<SUP>o</SUP><INF>370</INF>)]. Obtain the slope (S1) 
by least square linear regression. Under the assumptions of the 
protocol, S1=(k<INF>Io</INF>/k).
    (vii) According to Equation 12 under paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this 
section, plot the quantities Pn(A<SUP>o</SUP><INF>370</INF>/
A<INF>370</INF>) versus the independent variable Pn(C<INF>o</INF>/
C<INF>t</INF>)<INF>PNAP</INF>. Obtain the slope (S2) by least squares 
linear regression on Equation 12 under paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this 
section. Under the assumptions of the protocol, S2=(k/k<INF>A</INF>).
    (viii) Then, using Equation 13a under paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this 
section, determine the slope (S3) by least squares linear regression. 
Under the assumptions of the protocol, S3 is equal to (k<INF>D</INF>/
k<INF>A</INF>).
    (ix) From Equation 18

                               Equation 18

k<INF>A</INF>=0.0372[PYR]k<INF>a</INF>,

calculate k<INF>A</INF> using k<INF>a</INF> values found in Table 1 
under paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this section. The value of k<INF>a</INF> 
chosen must correspond to the date closest to the mid-experiment date 
and latitude closest to that of the experimental site.
    (x) The indirect photoreaction rate constant, k<INF>Io</INF>, is 
determined using Equation 19,

                               Equation 19

k<INF>Io</INF>=(S1)(k<INF>A</INF>)(S2),

by incorporating the quantities k<INF>A</INF>, S1, and S2 determined as 
described in paragraphs (d)(2) (ix), (vi), and (vii) of this section, 
respectively.
    (xi) The rate constant k<INF>D</INF> is calculated from Equation 20,

                               Equation 20

k<INF>D</INF>=(S3)(k<INF>A</INF>),

using the quantities S3 and k<INF>A</INF> determined as described above.
    (xii) Then, (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> is obtained by summing 
k<INF>D</INF> and k<INF>Io</INF>, as described by Equation 14 in 
paragraph (d)(1)(ix) of this section:

                               Equation 14

(k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF>=k<INF>Io</INF>+k<INF>D</INF>.

    (xiii) Finally, k<INF>pE</INF> is obtained by multiplying 
(k<INF>p</INF>) <INF>SNW </INF>by the factor 0.455, as described by 
Equation 5a in paragraph (d)(1)(x) of this section:

                               Equation 5a

k<INF>pE</INF>=0.455 (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF> SHW</INF>

[[Page 54]]

As determined, k<INF>pE</INF> is the net environmental photoreaction 
rate constant. It applies to clear sky conditions and is valid for 
predicting surface photoreaction rates in an average humic containing 
freshwater body. It is strictly valid only for the experimental latitude 
and season.
    (3) Criteria for Phase 3. As in Phase 2, Phase 3 tests are assumed 
valid if the dark controls are well behaved and show no significant loss 
of chemical. In such a case, loss of test chemical in irradiated samples 
is due to photoreaction.
    (4) Rationale. Simultaneous irradiation of a test chemical and 
actinometer provide a means of evaluating sunlight intensities during 
the reaction period. Parallel irradiation of SHW solutions allows 
evaluation of the extent of photobleaching and loss of sensitizing 
ability of the natural water.
    (5) Scope and limitations of Phase 3 protocol. Test chemicals that 
are classified as having half-lives in SHW in the range of 1 hour to 50 
days in Phase 2 listing are suitable for use in Phase 3 testing. Such 
chemicals have photoreaction half-lives in a range accommodated by the 
PNAP/PYR actinometry in sunlight and also accommodate the persistence of 
SHW in sunlight.
    (6) Illustrative example. (i) From Phase 2 testing, under paragraph 
(c)(6)(iii) of this section, chemical A was found to have a photolysis 
rate constant, (k<INF>p</INF>) <INF>SHW</INF>' of 0.30 d<SUP>-1</SUP> in 
fall in round tubes at latitude 33 deg.N. Using Table 1 under paragraph 
(d)(1)(vii) of this section for 30 deg.N, the nearest decadic latitude, 
a fall value of k<INF>a</INF> equal to 333 d<SUP>-1</SUP> is found for 
PNAP. Substitution of (k<INF>p</INF>)<INF>SHW</INF> and k<INF>a</INF> 
into Equation 15 under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section gives [PYR] = 
0.0242 M. This is the concentration of pyridine that gives an 
actinometer rate constant of 0.30 d<SUP>-1</SUP> in round tubes in fall 
at this latitude.
    (ii) The actinometer solution was made up by adding a volume of 
pyridine (1.95 mL) calculated from equation 16 under paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section to a 1 liter volumetric flask containing 1.00 
mL of 1.00  x  10<SUP>-2</SUP> M PNAP in acetonitrile. The flask was 
filled to the mark with distilled water to give final concentrations of 
[PYR]=0.0242 M and [PNAP]=1.00 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M. Ten tubes of each of 
the following solutions were placed in the photolysis rack at 1,200 
hours on day zero:
    (A) Chemical A (1.53 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M) in standard SHW (0.010 M, 
pH 7 phosphate buffer).
    (B) Chemical A (1.53 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>), in 0.010 M, pH 7 phosphate 
buffer.
    (C) SHW standard solution diluted with water 0.90 to 1.00 to match 
solution A.
    (D) PNAP/PYR actinometer solution. Ten additional foil-wrapped 
controls of each mixture were taped to the bottom of the rack.
    (iii) The test chemical had been placed in category B, Table 2 under 
the paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, on the basis of its Phase 2 
rate constant under paragraph (c) of this section. Accordingly, two 
tubes of each irradiated solution and two tubes of each blank solution 
were removed at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 days at 1,200 hours. The averaged 
analytical results obtained at the end of the experiment are shown in 
the following Table 3.

        Equation 12 under paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this section.
    (D) Using the data in columns 3 and 6 in Table 4 under paragraph 
(d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, slope S3 was calculated by regression 
from Equation 13a under paragraph (d)(1)(viii) of this section and was 
found to be 0.428 with correlation coefficient euqal to 0.99997.
    (E) Using Equation 18 under paragraph (d)(2)(ix) of this section, 
k<INF>A</INF> was found to be =0.300 d<SUP>-1</SUP>.
    (F) The values of S1, S2, and k<INF>A</INF> were then combined in 
Equation 19 under paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section to give 
k<INF>Io</INF> as follows:

                               Equation 19

k<INF>Io</INF>=(4.96)(0.300)(0.295)=0.439 d<SUP>-1</SUP>.

    (G) The rate constant k<INF>D</INF> was calculated from the product 
of S3 and k<INF>A</INF> as expressed in Equation 20 under paragraph 
(d)(2)(xi) of this section as follows:

[[Page 56]]

                               Equation 20

k<INF>D</INF>=(0.428)(0.300)=0.128d<SUP>-1</SUP>.

    (H) The sum of k<INF>D</INF> and k<INF>Io</INF> was multiplied by 
0.455 to obtain k<INF>pE</INF> as follows:

                               Equation 21

k<INF>pE</INF>=(0.455)(0.439+0.128)d<SUP>-1</SUP>=0.258 d<SUP>-1</SUP>.

    (I) Since k<INF>pE</INF> is a first-order rate constant, the half-
life, t<INF>1/2E</INF>, is given by Equation 22:

                               Equation 22

t<INF>1/2E</INF>=0.693/k<INF>pE</INF>.

Substituting the value of k<INF>pE</INF> from Equation 21 under 
paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(H) of this section in Equation 22 yielded

                               Equation 23

t<INF>1/2E</INF>=0.693/0.258d<SUP>-1</SUP>=2.7 d.

         Subpart C--Provisional Environmental Effects Guidelines


<R05>
Sec. 795.120  Gammarid acute toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data 
on the acute toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures subject to 
environmental effects test regulations under the Toxic Substances 
Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 (15 U.S.C. 2601 et. 
seq.)). This guideline describes a test to develop data on the acute 
toxicity of chemicals to gammarids. The United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) will use data from this test in assessing the 
hazard of a chemical to aquatic organisms.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of TSCA and in part 
792 of this chapter, Good Laboratory Practice Standards, apply to this 
test guideline. The following definitions also apply to this guideline:
    Death means the lack of reaction of a test organism to gentle 
prodding.
    Flow-through means a continuous or an intermittent passage of test 
solution or dilution water through a test chamber or a holding or 
acclimation tank, with no recycling.
    LC50 means the median lethal concentration, i.e., that concentration 
of a chemical in air or water killing 50 percent of the test batch of 
organisms within a particular period of exposure (which shall be 
stated).

[[Page 59]]

    Loading means the ratio of the biomass of gammarids (grams, wet 
weight) to the volume (liters) of test solution in either a test chamber 
or passing through it in a 24-hour period.
    Solvent means a substance (e.g., acetone) which is combined with the 
test substance to facilitate introduction of the test substance into the 
dilution water.
    Static system means a test chamber in which the test solution is not 
renewed during the period of the test.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. In preparation for the 
test, test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution 
water. If a flow-through test is performed, the flow of dilution water 
through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired. In a static test, 
the test substance is introduced into each test chamber. In a flow-
through test, the rate in which the test substance is added is adjusted 
to establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in 
each test chamber. The test is started by randomly introducing 
gammarids, which have been acclimated to the test conditions, into the 
test chambers. Gammarids in the test chambers are observed periodically 
during the test; the dead gammarids are removed and the findings 
recorded. Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, and the 
concentration of test substance in test chambers are measured at 
specified intervals. Data collected during the test are used to develop 
concentration--response curves and LC50 values for the test substance.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Range-finding test. (i) A range-finding test should be conducted 
to establish test substance concentrations to be used for the definitive 
test.
    (ii) The gammarids shall be exposed to a wide-range of 
concentrations of the test substance (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/1, etc.), 
usually under static conditions.
    (iii) A minimum of five gammarids should be exposed to each 
concentration of test substance for a period of 96 hours. The exposure 
period may be shortened if data suitable for determining concentrations 
in the definitive test can be obtained in less time. Nominal 
concentrations of the test substance may be acceptable.
    (4) Definitive test. (i) The purpose of the definitive test is to 
determine the 24, 48, 72, and 96--hour LC50 values and the 
concentration-response curves.
    (ii) A minimum of 20 gammarids per concentration shall be exposed to 
five or more concentrations of the test substance chosen in a geometric 
series in which the ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 
64 mg/L). The range and number of concentrations to which the organisms 
are exposed shall be such that in 96 hours there is at least one 
concentration resulting in mortality greater than 50 and less than 100 
percent, and one concentration causing greater than zero and less than 
50 percent mortality. An equal number of gammarids may be placed in two 
or more replicate test chambers. Solvents should be avoided, if 
possible. If solvents have to be used, a solvent control, as well as a 
dilution control, shall be tested at the highest solvent concentration 
employed in the treatments. The solvent should not be toxic or have an 
effect on the toxicity of the test substance. The concentration of 
solvent should not exceed 0.1 ml/L.
    (iii) Every test shall include a concurrent control using gammarids 
from the same population or culture container. The control group shall 
be exposed to the same dilution water, conditions and procedures, except 
that none of the test substance shall be is added to the chamber.
    (iv) The dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature and pH of the 
test solution shall be measured at the beginning of the test and at 24, 
48, 72 and 96 hours in at least one replicate each of the control, and 
the highest, lowest and middle test concentrations.
    (v) The test duration is 96 hours. The test is unacceptable if more 
than 10 percent of the control organisms die during the test.
    (vi) In addition to death, any abnormal behavior or appearance shall 
also be reported.
    (vii) Gammarids shall be randomly assigned to the test chambers. 
Test chambers shall be positioned within the testing area in a random 
manner or in a way in which appropriate statistical analyses can be used 
to determine whether there is any variation due to placement.

[[Page 60]]

    (viii) Gammarids shall be introduced into the test chambers after 
the test substance has been added.
    (ix) Observations on compound solubility shall be recorded. The 
investigator should record the appearance of surface slicks, 
precipitates, or material adhering to the sides of the test chambers.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Analytical measurements--(i) Water quality analysis. The 
hardness, acidity, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, TOC or COD, and 
particulate matter of the dilution water shall be measured at the 
beginning of each definitive test.
    (ii) Collection of samples for measurement of test substance. Each 
sample to be analyzed for the test substance concentrations shall be 
taken at a location midway between the top, bottom, and sides of the 
test chamber. Samples should not include any surface scum or material 
dislodged from the bottom or sides. Samples shall be analyzed 
immediately or handled and stored in a manner which minimizes loss of 
test substance through microbial degradation, photogradation, chemical 
reaction, volatilization, or sorption.
    (iii) Measurement of test substance. (A) For static tests, the 
concentration of dissolved test substance (that which passes through a 
0.45 micron filter) shall be measured in each test chamber at least at 
the beginning (zero-hour, before gammarids are added) and at the end of 
the test. During flow-through tests, the concentration of dissolved test 
substance shall be measured in each test chamber at least at 0 and 96-
hours and in at least one chamber whenever a malfunction of the test 
substance delivery system is observed.
    (B) The analytical methods used to measure the amount of test 
substance in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test. This 
involves adding a known amount of the test substance to each of three 
water samples taken from a chamber containing dilution water and the 
same number of gammarids as are placed in each test chamber. The nominal 
concentrations of the test substance in these samples should span the 
concentration range to be used in the test. Validation of the analytical 
method should be performed on at least two separate days prior to 
starting the test.
    (C) An analytical method is not acceptable if likely degradation 
products of the test substance give positive or negative interferences, 
unless it is shown that such degradation products are not present in the 
test chambers during the test.
    (D) Among replicate test chambers, the measured concentrations shall 
not vary more than 20 percent. The measured concentration of the test 
substance in any chamber during the test shall not vary more than plus 
or minus 30 percent from the measured concentration in that chamber at 
zero time.
    (E) The mean measured concentration of dissolved test substance 
shall be used to calculate all LC50's and to plot all concentration-
response curves.
    (d) Test conditions for definitive test--(1) Test species--(i) 
Selection. (A) The amphipods, Gammarus fasciatus, G. pseudolimnaeus, and 
G. lacustris are specified for this test.
    (B) Gammarids can be cultured in the laboratory or collected from 
natural sources. If collected, they must be held in the laboratory for 
at least 14 days prior to testing.
    (C) Gammarids used in a particular test shall be of similar age and/
or size and from the same source or culture population.
    (ii) Acclimation. If the holding water is from the same source as 
the dilution water, acclimation to the dilution water shall be done 
gradually over a 48-hour period. The gammarids then shall be held at 
least 7 days in the dilution water prior to testing. Any changes in 
water temperature should not exceed 2  deg.C per day. Gammarids should 
be held for a minimum of 7 days at the test temperature prior to 
testing.

    (iii) Care and handling. Gammarids shall be cultured in dilution 
water under similar environmental conditions to those used in the test. 
Organisms shall be handled as little as possible. When handling is 
necessary it should be done as gently, carefully and quickly as 
possible. During culturing and acclimation, gammarids shall be observed 
carefully for signs of stress and mortality. Dead and abnormal 
individuals shall be discarded.


[[Page 61]]


    (iv) Feeding. The organisms shall not be fed during testing. During 
culturing, holding, and acclimation, a sufficient quantity of deciduous 
leaves, such as maple, aspen, or birch, should be placed in the culture 
and holding containers to cover the bottom with several layers. These 
leaves should be aged for at least 30 days in a flow-through system 
before putting them in aquaria. As these leaves are eaten, more aged 
leaves should be added. Pelleted fish food may also be added.

    (2) Facilities--(i) Apparatus--(A) Facilities needed to perform this 
test include:

    (1) Containers for culturing, acclimating and testing gammarids;

    (2) Containers for aging leaves under flow-through conditions;

    (3) A mechanism for controlling and maintaining the water 
temperature during the culturing, acclimation and test periods;

    (4) Apparatus for straining particulate matter, removing gas 
bubbles, or aerating the dilution water, as necessary; and

    (5) An apparatus for providing a 16-hour light and 8-hour dark 
photoperiod with a 15- to 30-minute transition period.

    (B) Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and 
disturbances that may affect the test organism.

    (C) Test chambers shall be covered loosely to reduce the loss of 
test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the 
entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.

    (ii) Construction materials. Construction materials and equipment 
that may contact the stock solution, test solution or dilution water 
should not contain substances that can be leached or dissolved into 
aqueous solutions in quantities that can alter the test results. 
Materials and equipment that contact stock or test solutions should be 
chosen to minimize sorption of test substances. Glass, stainless steel, 
and perfluorocarbon plastic should be used wherever possible. Concrete, 
fiberglass, or plastic (e.g., PVC) may be used for holding tanks, 
acclimation tanks, and water supply systems, but they should be aged 
prior to use. Rubber, coopper, brass, galvanized metal, and lead should 
not come in contact with the dilution water, stock solution, or test 
solution.
    (iii) Test substance delivery system. In flow-through tests, 
diluters, metering pump systems or other suitable devices shall be used 
to deliver the test substance to the test chambers. The system used 
shall be calibrated before each test. The general operation of the test 
substance delivery system shall be checked twice daily during a test. 
The 24-hour flow shall be equal to at least five times the volume of the 
test chamber. During a test, the flow rates should not vary more than 10 
percent from one test chamber to another.
    (iv) Test chambers. Test chambers shall contain at least one liter 
of test solution. Test chambers made of stainless steel should be 
welded, not soldered. Test chambers made of glass should be glued using 
clear silicone adhesive. As little adhesive as possible should be left 
exposed in the interior of the chamber. A substrate, such as a bent 
piece of stainless steel screen, should be placed on the bottom of each 
test chamber to provide cover for the gammarids.
    (v) Cleaning of test system. Test substance delivery systems and 
test chambers should be cleaned before each test. They should be washed 
with detergent and then rinsed sequentially with clean water, pesticide-
free acetone, clean water, and 5-percent nitric acid, followed by two or 
more changes of dilution water.
    (vi) Dilution water. (A) Clean surface or ground water, 
reconstituted water, or dechlorinated tap water is acceptable as 
dilution water if gammarids will survive in it for the duration of the 
culturing, acclimating, and testing periods without showing signs of 
strees. The quality of the dilution water should be constant enough that 
the month-to-month variation in hardness, acidity, alkalinity, 
conductivity, TOC or COD, and particulate matter is not more than 10 
percent. The pH should be constant within 0.4 unit. In addition, the 
dilution water should meet the following specifications measured at 
least twice a year:

  organic chlorine.........................  25 ng/L                    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) If the dilution water is from a ground or surface water source, 
conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) or chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) shall be measured. Reconstituted water can be made by adding 
specific amounts of reagent-grade chemicals to deionized or distilled 
water. Glass-distilled or carbon-filtered deionized water with a 
conductivity less than 1 micromho/cm is acceptable as the diluent for 
making reconstituted water.
    (C) The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the dilution water 
shall be between 90 and 100 percent saturation. If necessary, the 
dilution water can be aerated before the addition of the test substance. 
All reconstituted water should be aerated before use.
    (3) Test parameters. Environmental parameters during the test shall 
be maintained as specified below:
    (i) Water temperature of 18 <plus-minus> 1 deg.C.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent 
saturation.
    (iii) The number of gammarids placed in a test chamber shall not be 
so great as to affect the results of the test. Ten gammarids per liter 
is the recommended level of loading for the static test. Loading 
requirements for the flow-through test will vary depending on the flow 
rate of dilution water. The loading should not cause the dissolved 
oxygen concentration to fall below the recommended levels.
    (iv) Photoperiod of 16 hours light and 8 hours darkness.
    (e) Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the EPA all data 
developed by the test that are suggestive or predictive of toxicity. In

Sec. 795.225  Dermal pharmacokinetics of DGBE and DGBA.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of these studies is to determine:
    (1) The absorption of diethylene glycol butyl ether (DGBE) after 
administration by the dermal route.
    (2) The biotransformation of DGBE administered dermally.
    (3) The dermal absorption of DGBE and diethylene glycol butyl ether 
acetate (DGBA).
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species. The species 
utilized for investigating DGBE and DGBA shall be the rat, a species for 
which historical data on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of many 
compounds are available and which is used extensively in percutaneous 
absorption studies.
    (ii) Animals. Adult female Sprague Dawley rats shall be used. The 
rats shall be 7 to 8 weeks old and weigh 180 to 220 grams. Prior to 
testing, the animals shall be selected at random for each group. Animals 
showing signs of ill health shall not be used.
    (iii) Animal care. (A) The animals should be housed in 
environmentally controlled rooms with 10 to 15 air changes per hour. The 
rooms should be maintained at a temperature of 25 <plus-minus> 2 deg.C 
and humidity of 50 <plus-minus>10 percent with a 12-hour light/dark 
cycle per day. The rats should be isolated for at least 7 days prior to 
use.
    (B) During the acclimatization period, the rats should be housed in 
cages on hardwood chip bedding. All animals shall be provided with 
conventional laboratory diets and water ad libitum.
    (2) Administration of DGBE and DGBA--(i) Test substances. These 
studies require the use of <SUP>14</SUP>C-labeled DGBE and DGBA. The use 
of <SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBE and <SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBA is required for the 
determinations in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section 
because they will facilitate the work and improve the reliability of 
quantitative determinations.

[[Page 64]]

    (ii) Dosage and treatment. (A) Two doses of DGBA shall be used in 
the study, a ``low'' dose and a ``high'' dose. Three doses of DGBE shall 
be used in the study, a neat ``low'' dose, an aqueous ``low'' dose, and 
neat ``high'' dose. When administered dermally, the ``high'' dose level 
should ideally induce some overt toxicity such as weight loss. The 
``low'' dose level should correspond to a no observed effect level.
    (B) For dermal treatment, the doses shall be applied in a volume 
adequate to deliver the prescribed doses. The backs of the rats should 
be lightly shaved with an electric clipper shortly before treatment. The 
dose shall be applied with a micropipette on a specific area (for 
example, 2 cm<SUP>2</SUP>) on the freshly shaven skin.
    (iii) Washing efficiency study. Before initiation of the dermal 
absorption studies described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, 
an initial washing efficiency experiment shall be performed to assess 
the extent of removal of the applied DGBE and DGBA by washing with soap 
and water. Groups of four rats should be lightly anesthetized with 
sodium pentobarbital. These animals shall then be treated with dermal 
doses of test substance at the low dose level. Soon after application (5 
to 10 minutes) the treated animals shall be washed with soap and water 
then housed in individual metabolism cages for excreta collection. Urine 
and feces shall be collected at 8, 24, and 48 hours following dosing. 
Collection of excreta shall continue every 24 hours if a significant 
amounts of DGBE, DGBA, or metabolites continue to be eliminated.
    (iv) Determination of absorption, biotransformation, and excretion. 
(A) Eight animals shall be dosed once dermally with the low dose of 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBE.
    (B) Eight animals shall be dosed once dermally with the high dose of 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBE.
    (C) Eight animals shall be dosed once dermally with the low dose of 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBA.
    (D) Eight animals shall be dosed once dermally with the high dose of 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBA.
    (E) The high and low doses of <SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBE and 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBA shall be kept on the skin for 24 hours. After 
application, the animals shall be placed in metabolism cages for excreta 
collection. After 24 hours, any test material remaining on the skin will 
be washed off and the containment cell removed. Radiolabeled material in 
the wash will be accounted for in the total recovery. Urine and feces 
shall be collected at 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing, and if 
necessary, daily thereafter until at least 90 percent of the dose has 
been excreted or until 7 days after dosing, whichever occurs first.
    (3) Observation of animals--(i) Urinary and fecal excretion. The 
quantities of total <SUP>14</SUP>C excreted in urine and feces by rats 
dosed as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section shall be 
determined at 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after dosing, and if necessary, 
daily thereafter until at least 90 percent of the dose has been excreted 
or until 7 days after dosing (whichever occurs first). Four animals from 
each group shall be used for this purpose.
    (ii) Biotransformation after dermal dosing. Appropriate qualitative 
and quantitative methods shall be used to assay urine specimens 
collected from rats dosed with DGBE as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
of this section. Any metabolite which comprises greater than 10 percent 
of the dose shall be identified.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form.
    (2) Evaluation of results. All observed results, quantitative or 
incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified in the TSCA Good Laboratory Practice Standards, in part 792, 
subpart J of this chapter, the following specific information shall be 
reported:
    (i) Species, strain, and supplier of laboratory animals.
    (ii) Information on the degree (i.e., specific activity for a 
radiolabel) and sites of labeling of the test substances.
    (iii) A full description of the sensitivity and precision of all 
procedures used to produce the data.
    (iv) Relative percent absorption by the dermal route for rats 
administered low and high doses of <SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBE and 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-DGBA.

[[Page 65]]

    (v) Quantity of isotope, together with percent recovery of the 
administered dose, in feces and urine.
    (vi) Biotransformation pathways and quantities of DGBE and 
metabolites in urine collected after administering single high and low 
dermal doses to rats.

Sec. 795.228  Oral/dermal pharmacokinetics.

    (a) Purpose. The purposes of these studies are to: (1) Ascertain 
whether the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of a chemical substance or 
mixture (``test substance'') are similar after oral and dermal 
administration.
    (2) Determine bioavailability of a test substance after oral and 
dermal administration.
    (3) Examine the effects of repeated dosing on the pharmacokinetics 
and metabolism of the test substance.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Bioavailability refers to the rate and relative 
amount of administered test substance which reaches the systemic 
circulation.
    (2) Metabolism means the study of the sum of the processes by which 
a particular substance is handled in the body and includes absorption, 
tissue distribution, biotransformation, and excretion.
    (3) Percent absorption means 100 times the ratio between total 
excretion of radioactivity following oral or dermal administration and 
total excretion following intravenous administration of test substance.
    (4) Pharmacokinetics means the study of the rates of absorption, 
tissue distribution, biotransformation, and excretion.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species. The rat 
shall be used for pharmacokinetics testing because it has been used 
extensively for metabolic and toxicological studies. For dermal 
bioavailability studies, the rat and the mini-pig shall be used.
    (ii) Test animals. For pharmacokinetics testing and dermal studies, 
adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, 7 to 9 weeks of age, shall be 
used. For dermal studies, young adult mini-pigs shall also be used. The 
animals should be purchased from a reputable dealer and shall be 
identified upon arrival at the testing laboratory. The animals shall be 
selected at random for the test groups and any animal showing signs of 
ill health shall not be used. In all studies, unless otherwise 
specified, each test group shall contain at least 4 animals of each sex 
for a total of at least 8 animals.
    (iii) Animal care. (A) The animals shall be housed in 
environmentally controlled rooms with at least 10 air changes per hour. 
The rooms shall be maintained at a temperature of 24 <plus-minus> 2 
deg.C and humidity of 50 <plus-minus> 20 percent with a 12-hour light/
dark cycle per day. The animals shall be kept in a quarantine facility 
for at least 7 days prior to use and shall be acclimated to the 
experimental environment for a minimum of 48 hours prior to 
administration of the test substance.
    (B) During the acclimatization period, the animals shall be housed 
in suitable cages. All animals shall be provided with certified feed and 
tap water ad libitum. The mini-pig diet shall be supplemented with 
adequate amounts of ascorbic acid in the drinking water.
    (2) Administration of test substance--(i) Test substance. The use of 
a radioactive test substance is required for all studies. Ideally, the 
purity, radioactive and nonradioactive, is greater than 99 percent. The 
radioactive and nonradioactive test substances shall be chromatographed 
separately and together to establish purity and identity. If the purity 
is less than 99 percent or if the chromatograms differ significantly, 
EPA should be consulted.
    (ii) Dosage and treatment--(A) Intravenous. The low dose of test 
substance, in an appropriate vehicle, shall be administered 
intravenously to groups of rats and mini-pigs of each sex. If feasible, 
the same low dose should be used for intravenous, oral, and dermal 
studies.
    (B) Oral. Two doses of text substance shall be used in the oral 
study, a low dose and a high dose. The high dose should ideally induce 
some overt toxicity, such as weight loss. The low dose should correspond 
to a no-observed effect level. The oral dosing shall be accomplished by 
gavage or by administering the encapsulated test substance. If feasible, 
the same high and

[[Page 66]]

low doses should be used for oral and dermal studies.
    (C) Dermal. (1) Dermal treatment. For dermal treatment, two doses, 
comparable to the low and high oral doses, shall be dissolved in a 
suitable vehicle and applied in volumes adequate to deliver comparable 
doses. The backs of the animals should be lightly shaved with an 
electric clipper 24 hours before treatment. The test substance shall be 
applied to the intact shaven skin (approximately 2 cm\2\ for rats, 5 
cm\2\ for mini-pigs). The dosed areas shall be protected with a suitable 
porous covering which is secured in place, and the animals shall be 
housed separately.
    (2) Washing efficacy study. Before initiation of the dermal 
absorption studies, an initial washing efficacy experiment shall be 
conducted to assess the removal of the applied low dose of the test 
substance by washing the exposed skin area with soap and water and an 
appropriate organic solvent. The low dose shall be applied to 4 rats and 
4 mini-pigs in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(1) of this 
section. After application (5 to 10 minutes), the treated areas of 2 
rats and 2 mini-pigs shall be washed with soap and water and the treated 
areas of the remaining rats and pigs shall be washed with an appropriate 
solvent. The amounts of test substance recovered in the washings shall 
be determined to assess efficacy of its removal by washing.
    (iii) Dosing and sampling schedule--(A) Rat studies. After 
administration of the test substance, each rat shall be placed in a 
metabolic unit to facilitate collection of excreta. For the dermal 
studies, excreta from the rats shall also be collected during the 6 hour 
exposure periods. At the end of each collection period, the metabolic 
units shall be cleaned to recover any excreta that might adhere to them. 
All studies, except the repeated dosing study, shall be terminated at 7 
days or after at least 90 percent of the radioactivity has been 
recovered in the excreta, whichever occurs first.
    (1) Intravenous study. Group A shall be dosed once intravenously at 
the low dose of test substance.
    (2) Oral study. (i) Group B shall be dosed once per os with the low 
dose of test substance.
    (ii) Group C shall be dosed once per os with the high dose of test 
substance.
    (3) Dermal studies. Unless precluded by corrosivity, the test 
substance shall be applied and kept on the skin for a minimum of 6 
hours. At the time of removal of the porous covering, the treated area 
shall be washed with an appropriate solvent to remove any test substance 
that may be on the skin surface. Both the covering and the washing shall 
be assayed to recover residual radioactivity. At the termination of the 
studies, each animal shall be sacrificed and the exposed skin area 
removed. An appropriate section of the skin shall be solubilized and 
assayed for radio-activity to ascertain if the skin acts as a reservoir 
for the test substance. Studies on the dermal absorption of corrosive 
test substances should be discussed with EPA prior to initiation.
    (i) Group D shall be dosed once dermally with the low dose of test 
compound.
    (ii) Group E shall be dosed once dermally with the high dose of the 
test substance.
    (4) Repeated dosing study. Group F shall receive a series of single 
daily oral low doses of nonradioactive test substance over a period of 
at least 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last nonradioactive dose, a 
single oral low dose of radioactive test substance shall be 
administered. Following dosing with the radioactive substance, the rats 
shall be placed in individual metabolic units as described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section. The study shall be terminated at 7 days 
after the last dose, or after at least 90 percent of the radioactivity 
has been recovered in the excreta, whichever occurs first.
    (B) Mini-Pig studies. For all mini-pig studies, the test groups 
shall consist of four young adult animals. After administration of the 
test substance, each mini-pig shall be kept in a metabolic unit to 
facilitate collection of excreta. At the end of each collection period, 
the metabolic units are to be cleaned to recover any excreta that might 
adhere to them. All studies shall be terminated at 7 days, or after at 
least 90 percent of the radio-activity has been recovered in the 
excreta, whichever occurs first.

[[Page 67]]

    (1) Intravenous study. Group G is to be dosed once intravenously at 
the low dose of the test substance.

intravenous routes, (i.e., Group A), the concentration of radioactivity 
in blood and excreta shall be measured following administration. In 
groups administered the test substance by the oral and dermal route 
(i.e., Groups B, C, D, E and F), the concentration of radioactivity in 
blood and excreta shall be measured at selected time intervals during 
and following the exposure period.

dosing.
    (2) Extent of absorption. The total quantities of radioactivity 
shall be determined for excerta collected daily for 7 days or until at 
least 90 percent of the radioactivity has been recovered in the excreta.
    (3) Excretion. The quantities of radioactivity eliminated in the 
urine, feces, and expired air shall be determined separately at 
appropriate time intervals. The collection of carbon dioxide may be 
discontinued when less than one percent of the dose is found to be 
exhaled as radioactive carbon dioxide in 24 hours.
    (4) Tissue distribution. At the termination of each study, the 
quantities of radioactivity in blood and in various tissues, including 
bone, brain, fat, gastrointestinal tract, gonads, heart, kidney, liver, 
lungs, muscle, skin, and residual carcass of each animal shall be 
determined.
    (5) Changes in pharmacokinetics. Results of pharmacokinetics 
measurements (i.e., bioavailability and extent of absorption, tissue 
distribution, and excretion) obtained in rats receiving the single low 
oral dose of the test substance (Groups B and C) shall be compared to 
the corresponding results obtained in rats receiving repeated oral doses 
of the test substance (Group F).

quantitative methods shall be used to assay urine, feces, and expired 
air collected from rats. Efforts shall be made to identify any 
metabolite which comprises 5 percent or more of the administered dose 
and the major radioactive components of blood.
    (2) Changes in biotransformation. Appropriate qualitative and 
quantitative assay methodology shall be used to compare the composition 
of radioactive compounds in excreta from rats receiving a single oral 
dose (Groups B and C) with those in the excreta from rats receiving 
repeated oral doses (Group H).

dermal and inhalation administration.
    (2) Compare the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the test 
substances after intravenous, dermal, and inhalation administration.
    (3) Examine the effects of repeated doses on the pharmacokinetics 
and metabolism of the test substances.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Bioavailability refers to the relative amount 
of administered test substance which reaches the systemic circulation 
and the rate at which this process occurs.
    (2) Metabolism means the sum of the enzymatic and nonenzymatic 
processes by which a particular substance is handled in the body.
    (3) Pharmacokinetics means the study of the rates of absorption, 
tissue distribution, biotransformation, and excretion.
    (4) Low dose should correspond to 1 /10 of the high dose.
    (5) High dose shall not exceed the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 
ideally should induce minimal toxicity.
    (6) Test substance refers to the unlabeled and both radiolabeled 
mixtures (<SUP>14</SUP>C-n-hexane and <SUP>14</SUP>C-methylcyclopentane) 
of commercial hexane used in the testing.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species. The rat 
shall be used for pharmacokinetics testing because it has been used 
extensively for metabolic and toxicological studies.
    (ii) Test animals. Adult male and female rats shall be used for 
testing. The rats shall be 7 to 9 weeks old and their weight range 
should be comparable from group to group. The animals shall be purchased 
from a reputable dealer and shall be permanently identified upon 
arrival. The animals shall be selected at random for the testing groups, 
and any animal showing signs of ill health shall not be used.
    (iii) Animal care. (A) Animal care and housing shall be in 
accordance with DHHS/PHS NIH Publication No. 86-23, 1985, ``Guidelines 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.''
    (B) The animals shall be housed in environmentally controlled rooms 
with at least 10 air changes per hour. The rooms shall be maintained at 
a temperature of 18 to 26 degrees centigrade and humidity of 40 to 70 
percent with a 12-hour light/dark cycle per day. The animal subjects 
shall be kept in a quarantine facility for at least 7 days prior to use, 
and shall be acclimated to the experimental environment for a minimum of 
48 hours prior to treatment.
    (C) During the acclimatization period, the rats shall be housed in 
suitable cages. All animals shall be provided with certified feed and

    (2) Administration of test substances--(i) Test substances. The 
study will require the use of both radiolabeled and unlabeled test 
substances. All unlabeled commercial hexane shall be from the same lot 
number. Two kinds of radiolabeled test substances will be tested. 
<SUP>14</SUP>C-n-hexane shall be the only radiolabeled component of one, 
and <SUP>14</SUP>C-MCP shall be the only radiolabeled component of the 
other test substance. The use of both radiolabeled test substances is 
required for all pharmacokinetics and metabolism studies described in 
this rule, except for the bioavailability measurements required in 
(c)(4)(i)(A) of this section. The bioavailability measurements need

[[Page 72]]

only be conducted with the test substance containing <SUP>14</SUP>C-n-
hexane or an unlabeled test substance may be used if it can be 
demonstrated that the analytical sensitivity of the method used with the 
unlabeled test substance is equal to or greater than the sensitivity 
which could be obtained with the radiolabeled test substance. If an 
unlabeled test substance is used for bioavailability measurements, these 
measurements shall be extended to include relevant metabolites of n-
hexane. These test substances shall contain at least 40 liquid volume 
percent but no more than 55 liquid volume percent n-hexane and no less 
than 10 liquid volume percent methylcyclopentane (MCP) and otherwise 
conform to the specifications prescribed in the American Society for

notice of any change in this material will be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) Dosage and treatment--(A) Intravenous. An appropriate dose of 
the test substance shall be administered intravenously. The intravenous 
data obtained in this portion of the study shall be suitable for the 
determination of absorption, distribution, and excretion parameters of 
the test substance. Factors that should be considered in the selection 
of the intravenous doses are: The acute toxicity of the test substance, 
the availability of a suitable vehicle (if saline is unsuitable) and the 
solubility of the test substance in the vehicle.
    (B) Inhalation. Two concentrations of each test substance shall be 
used in this portion of the study, a low concentration and a high 
concentration. The high concentration should induce minimal toxicity, 
but shall not exceed the lower explosive limit (LEL). The low 
concentration shall correspond to 1/10 of the high concentration. 
Inhalation treatment shall be conducted using a ``nose-cone'' or ``head 
only'' apparatus to reduce ingestion of the test substance through 
``grooming'' or dermal absorption.
    (C) Dermal. Dermal absorption studies should be conducted by the 
methodology of Susten, A.S., Dames, B.L. and Niemeier, R.W., ``In vivo 
percutaneous absorption studies of volatile solvents in hairless mice. 
I. Description of a skin depot'', In: Journal of Applied Toxicology 
6:43-46, (1986), or by some other suitable method because the test 
substances have significant volatility. The high and low doses shall be 
tested in rats.
    (iii) Dosing and sampling schedule. Each experimental group shall 
contain at least four animals of each sex. After administration of the 
test substance, each rat shall be placed in an individual metabolic unit 
for collection of urine, feces, and expired air. For the dermal studies, 
excreta from the rats shall also be collected during the exposure 
periods. At the end of each collection period, the metabolic units shall 
be cleaned to recover any excreta that might adhere to the units. All 
studies, except the repeated dose studies, shall be terminated at 7 
days, or after at least 90 percent of the administered radioactivity has 
been recovered in the excreta, whichever occurs first. All studies 
described below shall be conducted separately with each radiolabeled 
test substance.
    (A) Intravenous study. Group A shall be given a single intravenous 
dose of the radiolabeled test substance to result in a level of 
commercial hexane in the blood that approximates the level from the 
other routes of exposure so

[[Page 73]]

that the data can be used to determine absorption and excretion 
parameters.
    (B) Inhalation studies. A single 6-hour exposure period shall be 
used for each group.
    (1) Group B shall be exposed to a mixture of the radiolabeled test 
substance in air at the low concentration.
    (2) Group C shall be exposed to a mixture of the radiolabeled test 
substance in air at the high concentration.
    (C) Dermal studies. The test substance shall be applied and kept on 
the skin for a minimum of 6 hours. The covering apparatus components 
shall be assayed to recover residual radioactivity. At the termination 
of the studies, each animal shall be sacrificed and the exposed skin 
area removed. An appropriate section of the skin shall be solubilized 
and assayed for radioactivity to ascertain whether the skin acts as a 
reservoir for the test substance.
    (1) Group D shall be given one dermal, low dose of the radiolabeled 
test substance.
    (2) Group E shall be given one dermal, high dose of the radiolabeled 
test substance.
    (D) Repeated dosing study. Group F shall receive a series of single 
daily 6-hour inhalation exposures to unlabeled test substance at the low 
dose over a period of at least 7 days. A single 6-hour inhalation 
exposure to the radiolabeled test substance at the low dose shall be 
administered 24 hours after the last unlabeled exposure. Following 
administration of the radiolabeled substance, the rats shall be placed 
in individual metabolic units and excreta collected. The study shall be 
terminated 7 days after the last exposure, or after at least 90 percent 
of the radioactivity has been recovered in the excreta, whichever occurs 
first.
    (3) Types of studies--(i) Pharmacokinetics studies. Groups A through 
F shall be used to determine the kinetics of absorption of the test 
substance. In animal subjects administered the test substance 
intravenously (i.e., Group A), the concentration of test substance in 
blood and excreta shall be measured following administration. In animal 
subjects administered the test substance by the inhalation and dermal 
routes (i.e., Groups B through F), the concentration of test substance 
in blood shall be measured at selected time intervals during and 
following the exposure period. In animal subjects administered the test 
substance by the inhalation route (i.e., Groups B, C, and F) the 
concentration of test substance in excreta shall be measured following 
exposure. In animal subjects administered the test substance by the 
dermal route (i.e., Groups D and E) the concentration of test substance 
in excreta shall be measured during and following exposure. These 
measurements allow calculation of uptake, half lives, and clearance. In 
addition, in the groups administered the test substance by inhalation 
(i.e., Groups B, C, and F), the concentration of test substance in the 
exposure chamber air shall be measured at selected time intervals during 
the exposure period.
    (ii) Metabolism studies. Groups A through F shall be used to 
determine the metabolism of the test substance. Excreta (urine, feces, 
and expired air) shall be collected for identification and measurement 
of the quantities of test substance and metabolites.
    (4) Measurements--(i) Pharmacokinetics. At least four animals from 
each group shall be used for these purposes.
    (A) Bioavailability. The levels of test substance and relevant 
metabolites, as appropriate, shall be determined in whole blood, blood 
plasma or blood serum at appropriate intervals after initiation of 
intravenous, dermal, and inhalation exposure. The sampling intervals 
should be compatible with the exposure route under study. The 
determinations need only be done on animals administered the test 
substance containing <SUP>14</SUP>C-n-hexane or, if the analytical 
sensitivity is equal or greater, unlabeled test substance may be used.
    (B) Extent of absorption. The total quantities of radioactivity 
shall be determined for excreta collected daily for 7 days, or until at 
least 90 percent of theradioactivity has been recovered in the excreta, 
whichever occurs first.
    (C) Excretion. The quantities of radioactivity eliminated in the 
urine, feces, and expired air shall be determined separately at time 
intervals that provide accurate measurement of clearance and excretory 
rates. The collection of carbon dioxide may be discontinued when less 
than one percent of

[[Page 74]]

the dose is found to be exhaled as radioactive carbon dioxide in 24 
hours.
    (D) Tissue distribution. At the termination of each study, the 
quantities of radioactivity shall be determined in blood and in various 
tissues, including bone, brain, fat, gastrointestinal tract, gonads, 
heart, kidney, liver, lungs, muscle, skin, spleen, thymus, and residual 
carcass of each animal.
    (E) Change in pharmacokinetics. Results of pharmacokinetics 
measurements (i.e., biotransformation, extent of absorption, tissue 
distribution, and excretion) obtained in rats receiving the single 
inhalation exposure to the low dose of the test substance (Group B) 
shall be compared to the corresponding results obtained in rats 
receiving repeated inhalation exposures to the low dose of the test 
substance (Group F).
    (ii) Metabolism. At least four animals from each group shall be used 
for these purposes.
    (A) Biotransformation. Appropriate qualitative and quantitative 
methods shall be used to assay urine, feces, and expired air collected 
from rats. Efforts shall be made to identify any metabolite which 
comprises 5 percent or more of the dose administered.
    (B) Changes in biotransformation. Appropriate qualitative and 
quantitative assay methods shall be used to compare the composition of 
radioactive compounds in excreta from rats receiving a single inhalation 
exposure (Groups B and C) with that from rats receiving repeated 
inhalation exposures (Group F).
    (d) Data and reporting. The final test report shall include the 
following:
    (1) Presentation of results. Numerical data shall be summarized in 
tabular form. Pharmacokinetics data shall also be presented in graphical 
form. Qualitative observations shall also be reported.
    (2) Evaluation of results. All data shall be evaluated by 
appropriate statistical methods.
    (3) Reporting results. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified in 40 CFR part 792, the following information shall be 
reported.
    (i) Strain of laboratory animals.
    (ii) Chemical characterization of the test substances, including:
    (A) For the radiolabeled test substances, information on the sites 
and degree of radiolabeling, including type of label, specific activity,

    (vi) Tissue distribution reported as quantity of radioactivity in 
blood, in various tissues including bone, brain, fat, gastrointestinal 
tract, gonads, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, skin, spleen, thymus, 
and in residual carcass.
    (vii) Biotransformation pathways, to the extent possible, and 
quantities of the test substances and metabolites in excreta collected 
after administering single high and low doses.
    (viii) Biotransformation pathways, to the extent possible, and 
quantities of test substances and metabolites in excreta collected after 
administering repeated low doses.
    (ix) Pharmacokinetics models to the extent they can be developed

Sec. 795.250  Developmental neurotoxicity screen.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of a chemical, it is important to determine when 
acceptable exposures in the adult may not be acceptable to a developing 
organism. This test is designed to provide information on the potential 
functional and morphologic hazards to the nervous system which may arise 
in the offspring from exposure of the

[[Page 75]]

mother during pregnancy and lactation.
    (b) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
to several groups of pregnant animals during gestation and lactation, 
one dose level being used per group. Offspring are randomly selected 
from within litters for neurotoxicity evaluation. The evaluation 
includes observation to detect gross neurological and behavioral 
abnormalities, determination of motor activity, neuropathological 
evaluation, and brain weights. Measurements are carried out periodically 
during both postnatal development and adulthood.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Testing should be performed in the Sprague Dawley rat.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals (nulliparous females) shall be used.
    (iii) Sex. Pregnant females shall be used at each dose level.
    (iv) Number of animals. The objective is for a sufficient number of 
pregnant rats to be exposed to ensure that an adequate number of 
offspring are produced for neurotoxicity evaluation. At least 20 litters 
are recommended at each dose level. This number assumes a coefficient of 
variation of 20 to 25 percent for most behavioral tests. If, based upon 
experience with historical control data or data for positive controls in 
a given laboratory, the coefficient of variation for a given task is 
higher than 20 to 25 percent, then calculation of appropriate sample 
sizes to detect a 20 percent change from control values with 80 percent 
power would need to be done. For most designs, calculations can be made 
according to Dixon and Massey (1957) under paragraph (e)(5) of this 
section, Neter and Wasserman (1974) under paragraph (e)(10) of this 
section, Sokal and Rohlf (1969) under paragraph (e)(11) of this section, 
or Jensen (1972) under paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
    (A) On day 4 after birth, the size of each litter should be adjusted 
by eliminating extra pups by random selection to yield, as nearly as 
possible, 4 males and 4 females per litter. Whenever the number of male 
or female pups prevents having 4 of each sex per litter, partial 
adjustment (for example, 5 males and 3 females) is permitted. 
Adjustments are not appropriate for litters of less than 8 pups. 
Elimination of runts only is not appropriate. Individual pups should be 
identified uniquely after standardization of litters. A method that may 
be used can be found in Adams et al. (1985) under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (B) After standardization of litters, males and females shall be 
randomly assigned to one of each of three behavioral tasks. 
Alternatively, more than one of the behavioral tasks may be conducted in 
the same animal. In the latter case, a minimum of 1 to 2 days should 
separate the tests when conducted at about the same age.
    (C) One male and one female shall be randomly selected from each 
litter for sacrifice at weaning as specified in paragraph (c)(8) of this 
section.
    (2) Control group. A concurrent control group shall be used. This 
group shall be a sham treated group, or, if a vehicle is used in 
administering the test substance, a vehicle control group. Animals in 
the control groups shall be handled in an identical manner to test group 
animals. The vehicle shall neither be developmentally toxic nor have 
effects on reproduction.
    (3) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) At least 3 dose levels plus 
a control (vehicle control, if a vehicle is used) shall be used.
    (ii) If the substance has been shown to be developmentally toxic 
either in a standard developmental toxicity study or a pilot study, the 
highest dose level shall be the maximum dose which will not induce in 
utero or neonatal deaths or malformations sufficient to preclude a 
meaningful evaluation of neurotoxicity.
    (iii) In the absence of standard developmental toxicity, unless 
limited by the physicochemical nature or biologicial properties of the 
substance, the highest dose level shall induce some overt maternal 
toxicity but shall not result in a reduction in weight gain exceeding 20 
percent during gestation and lactation.
    (iv) The lowest dose should not produce any grossly observable 
evidence of either maternal or developmental neurotoxicity.

[[Page 76]]

    (v) The intermediate dose(s) shall be equally spaced between the 
highest and lowest dose.
    (4) Dosing period. Day 0 in the test is the day on which a vaginal 
plug and/or sperm are observed. The dose period shall cover the period 
from day 6 of gestation through weaning (21 days postnatally).
    (5) Administration of test substance. The test substance or vehicle 
should be administered orally by intubation. The test substance shall be 
administered at the same time each day. The animals shall be weighed 
periodically and the dosage based on the most recent weight 
determination.
    (6) Observation of dams. (i) A gross examination of the dams shall 
be made at least once each day, before daily treatment. The animals 
shall be observed by trained technicians who are blind with respect to 
the animal's treatment, using standardized procedures to maximize inter-
observer reliability. Where possible, it is advisable that the same 
observer be used to evaluate the animals in a given study. If this is 
not possible, some demonstration of inter-observer reliability is 
required.
    (ii) During the treatment and observation periods, cage-side 
observations shall include:
    (A) Any responses with respect to body position, activity level, 
coordination of movement, and gait.
    (B) Any unusual or bizarre behavior including, but not limited to 
headflicking, head searching, compulsive biting or licking, self-
mutilation, circling, and walking backwards.
    (C) The presence of:
    (1) Convulsions.
    (2) Tremors.
    (3) Increased levels of lacrimation and/or red-colored tears.
    (4) Increased levels of salivation.
    (5) Piloerection.
    (6) Pupillary dilation or constriction.
    (7) Unusual respiration (shallow, labored, dyspneic, gasping, and 
retching) and/or mouth breathing.
    (8) Diarrhea.
    (9) Excessive or diminished urination.
    (10) Vocalization.
    (iii) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, 
including the time of onset, the degree and duration.
    (iv) Animals shall be weighed at least weekly.
    (v) The day of delivery of litters shall be recorded.
    (7) Study conduct--(i) Observation of offspring. (A) All offspring 
shall be examined cage-side daily for gross signs of mortality and 
morbidity.
    (B) All offspring shall be examined outside the cage for gross signs 
of toxicity whenever they are weighed or removed from their cages for 
behavioral testing. The offspring shall be observed by trained 
technicians, who are blind with respect to the animal's treatment using 
standardized procedures to maximize inter-observer reliability. Where 
possible, it is advisable that the same observer be used to evaluate the 
animals in a given study. If this is not possible, some demonstration of 
inter-observer reliability is required. At a minimum, the end points 
outlined in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section shall be monitored as 
appropriate for the developmental stage being observed.
    (C) Any gross signs of toxicity in the offspring shall be recorded 
as they are observed, including the time of onset, the degree, and 
duration.
    (ii) Developmental landmarks. Live pups should be counted and 
litters weighed by weighing each individual pup at birth, or soon 
thereafter, and on days 4, 7, 13, 17, and 21, and biweekly thereafter. 
The age of the pups at the time of the appearance of the following 
developmental landmarks shall be determined:
    (A) Vaginal opening. General procedure for this determination may be 
found in Adams et al. (1985) under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (B) Testes descent. General procedure for this determination may be 
found in Adams et al. (1985) under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Motor activity. (A) Motor activity shall be monitored 
specifically on days 13, 17, 21, 45 (<plus-minus>2 days), and 60 
(<plus-minus>2 days). Motor activity shall be monitored by an automated 
activity recording apparatus. The device used shall be capable of 
detecting both increases and decreases in activity, i.e., baseline 
activity as measured by the device shall not be so low as to preclude 
decreases nor so high as to preclude increases. Each

[[Page 77]]

device shall be tested by standard procedures to ensure, to the extent 
possible, reliability of operation across devices and testing of animals 
within dose groups shall be balanced across devices.
    (B) Each animal shall be tested individually. The test session shall 
be long enough to demonstrate habituation of motor activity in control 
animals, i.e., to approach asymptotic levels by the last 20 percent of 
the session. Animals' activity counts shall be collected in equal time 
periods of no greater than 10 minutes duration. All sessions shall have 
the same duration. Treatment groups shall be counter-balanced across 
test times.
    (C) Efforts shall be made to ensure that variations in the test 
conditions are minimal and are not systematically related to treatment. 
Among the variables which can affect motor activity are sound level, 
size, and shape of the test cage, temperature, relative humidity, 
lighting conditions, odors, use of home cage or novel test cage, and 
environmental distractions.
    (D) Additional information on the conduct of a motor activity study 
may be obtained in the TSCA motor activity guideline, in Sec. 798.6200 
of this chapter.
    (iv) Auditory startle test. An auditory startle habituation test 
shall be performed on the offspring on days 22 and 60. Details on the 
conduct of this testing may be obtained in Adams et al. (1985) under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section. In performing the auditory startle 
task, the mean response amplitude on each block of 10 trials (5 blocks 
of 10 trials per session on each day of testing) shall be made. While 
use of pre-pulse inhibition is not a requirement, it may be used at the 
discretion of the investigator. Details on the conduct of this testing 
may be obtained from Ison (1984) under paragraph (e)(7) of this section.
    (v) Active avoidance test. Active avoidance testing shall be 
conducted beginning at 60 to 61 days of age. Details on the apparatus 
may be obtained in Brush and Knaff (1959) and on the conduct of testing 
from Brush (1962), under paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(4) of this section, 
respectively; reviews on active avoidance conditioning by Brush (1971) 
and McAllister and McAllister (1971) can be found under paragraphs 
(e)(3) and (e)(9) of this section, respectively. In performing the 
active avoidance task, the following measures should be made:
    (A) Mean number of shuttles during the adaptation period preceding 
each daily session.
    (B) Mean number and latency of avoidances per session, presented in 
blocks of 10 trials (2 blocks of 10 trials per session across 5 
sessions).
    (C) Mean number and latency of escapes per session, presented in 
blocks of 10 trials as above.
    (D) Mean duration of shocks per session, presented in blocks of 10 
trials as above.
    (E) Mean number of shuttles during the inter-trial intervals.
    (8) Post-mortem evaluation--(i) Age of animals. One male and one 
female per litter shall be sacrificed at weaning and the remainder 
following the last behavioral measures. Neuropathology and brain weight 
determinations shall be made on animals sacrificed at weaning and after 
the last behavioral measures.
    (ii) Neuropathology. Details for the conduct of neuropathology 
evaluation may be obtained in the TSCA neuropathology guideline, in 
Sec. 798.6400 of this chapter. At least 6 offspring per dose group shall 
be randomly selected from each sacrificed group (weaning and adulthood) 
for neuropathologic evaluation. These animals shall be balanced across 
litters, and equal numbers of males and females shall be used. The 
remaining sacrificed animals shall be used to determine brain weight. 
Animals shall be perfused in situ by a generally recognized technique. 
After perfusion, the brain and spinal cord shall be removed and gross 
abnormalities noted. Cross-sections of the following areas shall be 
examined: The forebrain, the center of the cerebrum and midbrain, the 
cerebellum and pons, and the medulla oblongata; the spinal cord at 
cervical and lumbar swelling; Gasserian ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, 
dorsal and ventral root fibers, proximal sciatic nerve (mid-thigh and 
sciatic notch), sural nerve (at knee), and tibial nerve (at knee). 
Tissue samples from

[[Page 78]]

both the central and peripheral nervous system shall be further 
immersion-fixed and stored in appropriate fixative for further 
examination. After dehydration, tissue specimens shall be cleared with 
xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast except for the sural nerve 
which should be embedded in plastic. A method for plastic embedding is 
described by Spencer et al. under paragraph (e)(12) of this section. 
Tissue sections shall be prepared from the tissue blocks. The following 
general testing sequence is recommended for gathering histopathological 
data:
    (A) General staining. A general staining procedure shall be 
performed on all tissue specimens in the highest treatment group. 
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) shall be used for this purpose. The staining 
shall be differentiated properly to achieve bluish nuclei with pinkish 
background.
    (B) Special stains. Based on the results of the general staining, 
selected sites and cellular components shall be further evaluated by use 
of specific techniques. If H&E screening does not provide such 
information, a battery of stains shall be used to assess the following 
components in all appropriate required samples: Neuronal body (e.g., 
Einarson's gallocyanin), axon (e.g., Kluver's Luxol Fast Blue), and 
neurofibrils (e.g., Bielchosky). In addition, nerve fiber teasing shall 
be used. A section of normal tissue shall be included in each staining 
to assure that adequate staining has occurred. Any changes shall be 
noted and representative photographs shall be taken. If lesions are 
observed, the special techniques shall be repeated in the next lower 
treatment group until no further lesions are detectable.
    (C) Alternative technique. If the anatomical locus of expected 
neuropathology is well-defined, epoxy-embedded sections stained with 
toluidine blue may be used for small sized tissue samples. This 
technique obviates the need for special stains.
    (iii) Brain weight. At least 10 animals that are not sacrificed for 
histopathology shall be used to determine brain weight. The animals 
shall be decapitated and the brains carefully removed, blotted, chilled, 
and weighed. The following dissection shall be performed on an ice-
cooled glass plate: First, the rhombencephalon is separated by a 
transverse section from the rest of the brain and dissected into the 
cerebellum and the medulla oblongata/pons. A transverse section is made 
at the level of the ``optic chiasma'' which delimits the anterior part 
of the hypothalamus and passes through the anterior commissure. The 
cortex is peeled from the posterior section and added to the anterior 
section. This divides the brain into four sections, the telencephalon, 
the diencephalon/mid-brain, the medulla oblongata/pons, and the 
cerebellum. Sections shall be weighed as soon as possible after 
dissection to avoid drying. Detailed methodology is available in 
Glowinski and Iversen (1966) under paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (d) Data reporting and evaluation. In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified in part 792, subpart J of this chapter, the final 
test report shall include the following information.
    (1) Description of system and test methods. (i) A detailed 
description of the procedures used to standardize observation and 
operational definitions for scoring observations.
    (ii) Positive control data from the laboratory performing the test 
that demonstrate the sensitivity of the procedures being used. These 
data do not have to be from studies using prenatal exposures. However, 
the laboratory must demonstrate competence in testing neonatal animals 
perinatally exposed to chemicals and establish test norms for the 
appropriate age group.
    (iii) Procedures for calibrating and assuring the equivalence of 
devices and balancing treatment groups.
    (iv) A short justification explaining any decisions where 
professional judgement is involved such as fixation technique and choice 
of stains.
    (2) Results. The following information shall be arranged by test 
group dose level.
    (i) In tabular form, data for each animal shall be provided showing:
    (A) Its identification number and litter from which it came.
    (B) Its body weight and score on each developmental landmark at each 
observation time; total session activity counts and intrasession 
subtotals on

[[Page 79]]

each day measured; auditory startle response magnitude session counts 
and intrasession subtotals on each day measured; avoidance session 
counts and intrasession counts on each day measured; time and cause of 
death (if appropriate); locations, nature or frequency, and severity of 
the lesions; total brain weight; absolute weight of each of the four 
sections; and weight of each section as a percentage of total brain 
weight. A commonly used scale such as 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ for degree of 
severity of lesions ranging from very slight to extensive may be used 
for morphologic evaluation. Any diagnoses derived from neurologic signs 
and lesions, including naturally occurring diseases or conditions, shall 
also be recorded.
    (ii) Summary data for each group shall include:
    (A) The number of animals at the start of the test.
    (B) Body weights of the dams during gestation and lactation.
    (C) Litter size and mean weight at birth.
    (D) The number of animals showing each observation score at each 
observation time.
    (E) The percentage of animals showing each abnormal sign at each 
observation time.
    (F) The mean and standard deviation for each continuous end point at 
each observation time. These will include body weight, motor activity 
counts, acoustic startle responses, performance in active avoidance 
tests, and brain weights (both absolute and relative).
    (G) The number of animals in which any lesion was found.
    (H) The number of animals affected by each different type of lesion, 
the average grade of each type of lesion, and the frequency of each 
different type and/or location of lesions.
    (3) Evaluation of data. An evaluation of the test results shall be 
made. The evaluation shall include the relationship between the doses of 
the test substance and the presence or absence, incidence, and severity 
of any neurotoxic effect. The evaluation shall include appropriate 
statistical analyses. The choice of analyses shall consider tests 
appropriate to the experimental design and needed adjustments for 
multiple comparisons.

Sec. 796.1050  Absorption in aqueous solution: Ultraviolet/visible spectra.

    (a) Introductory information--(1) Guidance information. (i) 
Molecular formula.
    (ii) Structural formula.
    (2) Standard documents. The spectrophotometric method is based on 
national standards and consensus methods which are applied to measure 
the absorption spectra.
    (b) Method--(1)(i) Introduction, purpose, scope, relevance, 
application and limits of test. (A) The primary environmental purpose in 
determining the ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) absorption spectrum of a 
chemical compound is to have some indication of the wavelengths at which 
the compounds may be susceptible to photochemical degradation. Since 
photochemical degradation is likely to occur in both the atmosphere and 
the aquatic environment, spectra appropriate to these media will be 
informative concerning the need for further persistence testing.
    (B) Degradation will depend upon the total energy absorbed in 
specific wavelength regions. Such energy absorption is characterized by 
both molar absorption coefficient (molar extinction coefficient) and 
band width. However, the absence of measurable absorption does not 
preclude the possibility of photodegradation.
    (ii) Definitions and units. The UV-VIS absorption spectrum of a 
solution is a function of the concentration, c<INF>1</INF>, expressed in 
mol/L, of all absorbing species present; the path length, d, of the 
spectrophotometer cell, expressed in cm; and the molar absorption 
(extinction) coefficient, <greek-e><INF><greek-i></INF>, of each 
species. The absorbance (optical density) A of the solution is then 
given by:

                                                                                                                
                                                       <greek-S>                                                
                                                 A=d              <greek-e><INF>ici                                  
                                                           i                                                    
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                

For a resolvable absorbance peak, the band width <greek-l> is the 
wavelength range, expressed in nm=10<SUP>-9</SUP> m, of the peak at half 
the absorbance maximum.
    (iii) Reference substances. (A) The reference substances need not be 
employed in all cases when investigating a new substance. They are 
provided primarily so that calibration of the method may be performed 
from time to time and to offer the chance to compare the results when 
another method is applied.
    (B) Reference compounds appropriate for the calibration of the 
system are:

See also paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (iv) Principle of the test method. This method utilizes a double-
beam spectrophotometer which records only the absorption differences 
between the blank and test solutions to give the spectrum of the 
chemical being tested.
    (v) Quality criteria--Reproducibility and sensitivity. (A) 
Reproducibility and sensitivity, need not be measured directly. Instead, 
the accuracy of the system in measuring the spectra of reference 
compounds will be defined so as to assure appropriate reproducibility 
and sensitivity. It is preferable to use a recording double-beam 
spectrophotometer to obtain the UV-VIS spectrum of the test compound. 
Such an instrument should have a photometric accuracy of 
<plus-minus>0.02 units over the absorbance range of 0 to 2 units. It 
should be capable of recording absorbances at wavelengths of 200 to 750 
nanometers nm with a wavelength accuracy of <plus-minus>0.5 nm. The 
cells employed with the instrument must necessarily be transparent over 
this wavelength range and must have a path length determined to within 1 
percent. To ensure that the instrument is performing satisfactorily, 
spectra for test solutions of K<INF>2</INF>Cr<INF>2</INF>O<INF>7</INF> 
(for absorbance accuracy) and holmium glass (for wavelength accuracy) 
should be run periodically.
    (B) In the event that a recording double-beam instrument is not 
available, it will be necessary to determine the absorbance of the test 
solution in a single-beam instrument at 5-nm intervals over the entire 
wavelength range and at 1-nm intervals where there are indicated 
absorbance maxima. Wavelength and absorbance tests should be done as 
with the double-beam instrument.
    (2) Description of the test procedure--(i) Preparation--(A) 
Preparation of test solutions. (1) Solutions should be prepared by 
accurately weighing an appropriate amount of the purest form of the test 
substance available. This should be made up in a concentration which 
will result in at least one absorbance maximum in the range 0.5 to 1.5 
units.
    (2) The absorption of a compound is due to its particular chemical 
form. It is often the case that different forms are present, depending 
on whether the medium is acidic, basic, or neutral. Consequently, 
spectra under all three conditions are required where solubility and 
concentration allow. Where it is not possible to obtain sufficient 
concentrations in any of the aqueous media, a suitable organic solvent 
should be used (methanol preferred).
    (3) The acid medium should have a pH of less than 2, and the basic 
medium should be at least pH 10. The solvent for the neutral solution, 
and for preparing the acidic and basic ones, should be distilled water, 
transparent to ultraviolet radiation down to 200 nm. If methanol must be 
used, acidic and basic solutions can be prepared by adding 10 percent by 
volume of HCl or NaOH in aqueous solution ([HCl], [NaOH]=1 mol/L).
    (4) In theory, all chemical species other than that being tested are 
present in both beams and would therefore not appear in the recorded 
spectrum of a double-beam instrument. In practice, because the solvent 
is usually present in great excess, there is a threshold value of 
wavelength below which it is not possible to record the spectrum of the 
test chemical. Such a wavelength will be a property of the solvent or of 
the test medium. In general, distilled water is useful from 200 nm 
(dissolved ions will often increase this), methanol from 210 nm, hexane 
from 210 nm, acetonitrile from 215 nm and dichloromethane from 235 nm.
    (B) Blank solutions. A blank must be prepared which contains the 
solvent and all chemical species other than the test chemical. The 
absorption spectrum of this solution should be recorded in a manner 
identical to that of the test solution and preferably on the same chart. 
This ``baseline'' spectrum should never record an absorbance reading 
varying more than <plus-minus>0.05 from the nominal zero value.
    (C) Cells. Cell pathlengths are usually between 0.1 cm and 10 cm. 
Cell lengths should be selected to permit recording of at least one 
maximum in the absorbance range of 0.5 to 1.5 units. Which set of cells 
should be used will be governed by the concentration and the absorbance 
of the test solution as indicated by the Beer-Lambert Law. The cells 
should be transparent over

[[Page 82]]

the range of the spectrum being recorded, and the path-lengths should be 
known to an accuracy of at least 1 per cent. Cells should be thoroughly 
cleaned in an appropriate manner (chromic acid is useful for quartz 
cells) and rinsed several times with the test or blank solutions.
    (ii) Performance of the test. Both cells to be employed should be 
rinsed with the blank solution and then filled with same. The instrument 
should be set to scan at a rate appropriate for the required wavelength 
resolution and the spectrum of the blank recorded. The sample cell 
should then be rinsed and filled with the test solution and the scanning 
repeated, preferably on the same spectrum chart, to display the 
baseline. The test should be carried out at 25 deg. C.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) The molar 
absorption coefficient <greek-e> should be calculated for all absorbance 
maxima of the test substance. The formula for this calculation is:

                                                                        
                                               A                        
                               <greek-e>= ----------- ,                 
                                            c,<INF>i x d                     
                                                                        

where the quantities are as defined above (see Definitions and units).
    (ii) For each peak which is capable of being resolved, either as 
recorded or by extrapolated symmetrical peaks, the bandwidth should be 
recorded.
    (2) Test report. (i) The report should contain a copy of each of the 
three spectra (3 pH conditions). If neither water nor methanol solutions 
are feasible, there will be only one spectrum. Spectra should include a 
readable wave-length scale. Each spectrum should be clearly marked with 
the test conditions.
    (ii) For each maximum in each spectrum, the <greek-e> value and 
bandwidth (when applicable) should be calculated and reported, along 
with the wavelength of the maximum. This should be presented in tabular 
form.
    (iii) The various test conditions should be included, such as scan 
speed, the name and model of the spectrophotom-eter, the slit width 
(where available), cell type and path length, the concentrations of the 
test substance, and the nature and acidity of the solvent medium. A 
recent test spectrum on appropriate reference materials for photometric 
and wavelength accuracy should also be submitted (see Reproducibility 
and sensitivity).

this test guideline, the following references should be consulted:

<R05>
Sec. 796.1950  Vapor pressure.

    (a) Introduction--(1) Background and purpose. (i) Volatilization, 
the evaporative loss of a chemical, depends upon the vapor pressure of 
chemical and on environmental conditions which influence diffusion from 
a surface. Volatilization is an important source of material for 
airborne transport and may lead to the distribution of a chemical over 
wide areas and into bodies of water far from the site of release. Vapor 
pressure values provide indications of the tendency of pure substances 
to vaporize in an unperturbed situation, and thus provide a method for 
ranking the relative volatilities of chemicals. Vapor pressure data 
combined with water solubility data permit the calculation of Henry's 
law constant, a parameter essential to the calculation of volatility 
from water.
    (ii) Chemicals with relatively low vapor pressures, high 
adsorptivity onto solids, or high solubility in water are less likely to 
vaporize and become airborne than chemicals with high vapor pressures or 
with low water solubility or low adsorptivity to solids and sediments. 
In addition, chemicals that are likely to be gases at ambient 
temperatures and which have low water solubility and low adsorptive 
tendencies are less likely to transport and persist in soils and water. 
Such chemicals are less likely to biodegrade or hydrolyze and are prime 
candidates for atmospheric oxidation and photolysis (e.g., smog 
formation or stratospheric alterations). On the other hand, nonvolatile

[[Page 83]]

chemicals are less frequently involved in atmosphere transport, so that 
concerns regarding them should focus on soils and water.
    (iii) Vapor pressure data are an important consideration in the 
design of other chemical fate and effects tests; for example, in 
preventing or accounting for the loss of violatile chemicals during the 
course of the test.
    (2) Definitions and units. (i) ``Desorption efficiency'' of a 
particular compound applied to a sorbent and subsequently extracted with 
a solvent is the weight of the compound which can be recovered from the 
sorbent divided by the weight of the compound originally sorbed.
    (ii) ``Pascal'' (Pa) is the standard international unit of vapor 
pressure and is defined as newtons per square meter (N/m<SUP>2</SUP>). A 
newton is the force necessary to give acceleration of one meter per 
second squared to one kilogram of mass.
    (iii) The ``torr'' is a unit of pressure which equals 133.3 pascals 
or 1 mm Hg at 0  deg.C.
    (iv) ``Vapor pressure'' is the pressure at which a liquid or solid 
is in equilibrium with its vapor at a given temperature.
    (v) ``Volatilization'' is the loss of a substance to the air from a 
surface or from solution by evaporation.
    (3) Principle of the test methods. (i) The isoteniscope procedure 
uses a standardized technique [ASTM 1978] that was developed to measure 
the vapor pressure of certain liquid hydrocarbons. The sample is 
purified within the equipment by removing dissolved and entrained gases 
until the measured vapor pressure is constant, a process called 
``degassing.'' Impurities more volatile than the sample will tend to 
increase the observed vapor pressure and thus must be minimized or 
removed. Results are subject to only slight error for samples containing 
nonvolatile impurities.
    (ii) Gas saturation (or transpiration) procedures use a current of 
inert gas passed through or over the test material slowly enough to 
ensure saturation and subsequent analysis of either the loss of material 
or the amount (and sometimes kind) of vapor generated. Gas saturation 
procedures have been described by Spencer and Cliath (1969) under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Results are easy to obtain and can be 
quite precise. The same procedures also can be used to study 
volatilization from laboratory scale environmental simulations. Vapor 
pressure is computed on the assumption that the total pressure of a 
mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of the separate or 
component gases and that the ideal gas law is obeyed. The partial 
pressure of the vapor under study can be calculated from the total gas 
volume and the weight of the material vaporized. If v is the volume 
which contains w grams of the vaporized material having a molecular 
weight M, and if p is the pressure of the vapor in equilibrium at 
temperature T (K), then the vapor pressure, p, of the sample is 
calculated by

    p=(w/M)(RT/v),

where R is the gas constant (8.31 Pa m<SUP>2</SUP>mol<SUP>-1</SUP> 
K<SUP>-1</SUP>) when the pressure is in pascals (Pa) and the volume is 
in cubic meters. As noted by Spencer and Cliath (1970) under paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section, direct vapor pressure measurements by gas 
saturation techniques are more directly related to the volatilization of 
chemicals than are other techniques.
    (iii) In an effort to improve upon the procedure described by 
Spencer and Cliath (1969) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and to 
determine the applicability of the gas saturation method to a wide 
variety of chemical types and structures, EPA has sponsored research and 
development work at SRI International (EPA 1982) under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section. The procedures described in this Test Guideline are 
those developed under that contract and have been evaluated with a wide 
variety of chemicals of differing structure and vapor pressures.
    (4) Applicability and specificity. (i) A procedure for measuring the 
vapor pressure of materials released to the environment ideally would 
cover a wide range of vapor pressure values, at ambient temperatures. No 
single procedure can cover this range, so two different procedures are 
described in this section, each suited for a different part

[[Page 84]]

of the range. The isoteniscope procedure is for pure liquids with vapor 
pressures from 0.1 to 100 kPa. For vapor pressures of 10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 
10 <SUP>3</SUP> Pa, a gas saturation procedure is to be used.
    (ii) With respect to the isoteniscope method, if compounds that boil 
close to or form azeotropes with the test material are present, it is 
necessary to remove the interfering compounds and use pure test 
material. Impurities more volatile than the sample will tend to increase 
the observed vapor pressure above its true value but the purification 
steps will tend to remove these impurities. Soluble, nonvolatile 
impurities will decrease the apparent vapor pressure. However, because 
the isoteniscope procedure is a static, fixed-volume method in which an 
insignificant fraction of the liquid sample is vaporized, it is subject 
to only slight error for samples containing nonvolatile impurities. That 
is, the nonvolatile impurities will not be concentrated due to 
vaporization of the sample.
    (iii) The gas saturation method is applicable to solid or liquid 
chemicals. Since the vapor pressure measurements are made at ambient 
temperatures, the need to extrapolate data from high temperatures is not 
necessary and high temperature extrapolation, which can often cause 
serious errors, is avoided. The method is most reliable for vapor 
pressures below 10 <SUP>3</SUP> Pa. Above this limit, the vapor 
pressures are generally overestimated, probably due to aerosol 
formation. Finally, the gas saturation method is applicable to the 
determination of the vapor pressure of impure materials.
    (b) Test Procedures--(1) Test conditions. (i) The apparatus in the 
isoteniscope method is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (ii) The apparatus used in the gas saturation method is described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Performance of the tests--(i) Isoteniscope Procedure. The 
isoteniscope procedure described as ANSI/ASTM Method D 2879-86 is 
applicable for the measurement of vapor pressures of liquids with vapor 
pressures of 0.1 to 100 kilopascals (kPa) (0.75 to 750 torr). ASTM D 
2879-86 is available for inspection at the Office of the Federal 
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. This 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Office of 
the Federal Register. This material is incorporated as it exists on the 
date of approval and a notice of any change in this material will be 
published in the Federal Register. Copies of the incorporated material 
may be obtained from the Non-Confidential Information Center (NCIC) 
(7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Room B-607 NEM, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, 
between the hours of 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays excluding legal 
holidays, or from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 
1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. The isoteniscope method 
involves placing liquid sample in a thermostated bulb (the isoteniscope) 
connected to a manometer and a vacuum pump. Dissolved and entrained 
gases are removed from the sample in the isoteniscope by degassing the 
sample at reduced presssure. The vapor pressure of the sample at 
selected temperatures is determined by balancing the pressure due to the 
vapor of the sample against a known pressure of an inert gas. The vapor 
pressure of the test compound is determined in triplicate at 
25<plus-minus>0.5  deg.C and at any other suitable temperatures 
(<plus-minus>0.5 deg.). It is important that additional vapor pressure 
measurements be made at other temperatures, as necessary, to assure that 
there is no need for further degassing, as described in the ASTM method.
    (ii) Gas saturation procedure. (A) The test procedures require the 
use of a constant-temperature box as depicted in the following Figure 1.

[[Page 85]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.036


        Figure 1--Schematic Diagram of Vapor Saturation Apparatus
The insulated box, containing sample holders, may be of any suitable 
size and shape. The sketch in Figure 1 shows a box containing three 
solid sample holders and three liquid sample holders, which allows for 
the triplicate analysis of either a solid or liquid sample. The 
temperature within the box is controlled to <plus-minus>0.5 deg. or 
better. Nitrogen gas, split into six streams and controlled by fine 
needle valves (approximately 0.79 mm orifice), flows into the box via 
3.8 mm (0.125 in.) i.d. copper tubing. After temperature equilibration, 
the gas flows through the sample and the sorbent trap and exits from the 
box. The flow rate of the effluent carrier gas is measured at room 
temperature with a bubble flow meter or other suitable device. The flow 
rate is checked frequently during the experiment to assure that there is 
an accurate value for the total volume of carrier gas. The flow rate is 
used to calculate the total volume (at room temperature) of gas that has 
passed through the sample and sorbent [(vol/time)  x  time = volume]. 
The vapor pressure of the test substance can be calculated from the 
total gas volume and the mass of sample vaporized. If v is the volume of 
gas that transported mass w of the vaporized test material having a 
molecular weight M, and if p is the equilibrium vapor pressure of the 
sample at temperature T, then p is calculated by the equation

    p=(w/M)(RT/v).

In this equation, R is the gas constant (8.31 Pa m<SUP>3</SUP>mol<SUP>-1</SUP> 
K<SUP>-1</SUP>). The pressure is expressed in pascals (Pa), the volume 
in cubic meters (m<SUP>3</SUP>), mass in grams and T in kelvins (K). 
T=273.15+t, if t is measured in degrees Celsius ( deg.C).
    (B) Solid samples are loaded into 5 mm i.d. glass tubing between 
glass wool plugs. The following Figure 2 depicts a drawing of a sample 
holder and absorber system.

    (C) Liquid samples are contained in a holder as shown in the 
following Figure 3.

                Figure 3--Liquid Compound Sampling System
The most reproducible method for measuring the vapor pressure of liquids 
is to coat the liquid on glass beads and to pack the holder in the 
designated place with these beads.
    (D) At very low vapor pressures and sorbent loadings, adsorption of 
the chemical on the glass wool separating the sample and the sorbent and 
on the glass surfaces may be a serious problem. Therefore, very low 
loadings should be avoided whenever possible. Incoming nitrogen gas 
(containing no interfering impurities) passes through a coarse frit and 
bubbles through a 38 cm column of liquid sample. The stream passes 
through a glass wool column to trap aerosols and then through a sorbent 
tube, as described above. The pressure drop across the glass wool column 
and the sorbent tube are negligible.
    (E) With both solid and liquid samples, at the end of the sampling 
time, the front and backup sorbent sections are analyzed separately. The 
compound on each section is desorbed by adding the sorbent from that 
section to 1.0 ml of desorption solvent in a small vial and allowing the 
mixture to stand at a suitable temperature until no more test compound 
desorbs. It is extremely important that the desorption solvent contain 
no impurities which would interfere with the analytical method of 
choice. The resulting solutions are analyzed quantitatively by a 
suitable analytical method to determine the weight of sample desorbed 
from each section. The choice of the analytical method, sorbent, and 
desorption solvent is dictated by the nature of the test material. 
Commonly used sorbents include charcoal, Tenax GC, and XAD-2. Describe 
in detail the sorbent, desorption solvent, and analytical methods 
employed.
    (F) Measure the desorption efficiency for every combination of 
sample, sorbent, and solvent used. The desorption efficiency is 
determined by injecting a known mass of sample onto a sorbent and later 
desorbing it and analyzing for the mass recovered. For each combination 
of sample, sorbent, and solvent used, carry out the determination in 
triplicate at each of three concentrations. Desorption efficiency may 
vary with the concentration of the actual sample and it is important to 
measure the efficiency at or near the concentration of sample under gas 
saturation test procedure conditions.
    (G) To assure that the gas is indeed saturated with test compound 
vapor,

[[Page 87]]

sample each compound at three differing gas flow rates. Appropriate flow 
rates will depend on the test compound and test temperature. If the 
calculated vapor pressure shows no dependence on flow rate, then the gas 
is assumed to be saturated.
    (c) Data and reporting. (1) Report the triplicate calculated vapor 
pressures for the test material at each temperature, the average 
calculated vapor pressure at each temperature, and the standard 
deviation.
    (2) Provide a description of analytical methods used to analyze for 
the test material and all analytical results.
    (3) For the isoteniscope procedure, include the plot of p vs. the 
reciprocal of the temperature in K, developed during the degasing step 
and showing linearity in the region of 298.15 K (25<SUP> +</SUP>C) and 
any other required test temperatures.
    (4) For the gas saturation procedure, include the data on the 
calculation of vapor pressure at three or more gas flow rates at each 
test temperature, showing no dependence on flow rate. Include a 
description of sorbents and solvents employed and the desorption 
efficiency calculations.
    (5) Provide a description of any difficulties experienced or any 
other pertinent information.

guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 796.2750  Sediment and soil adsorption isotherm.

    (a)  Introduction--(1) Background and purpose. The adsorption of 
chemicals to sediments and soils is an important process that affects a 
chemical's distribution in the environment. If a chemical is adsorbed to 
soil particles, it will remain on the soil surface and will not reach 
ground water. If a chemical is not adsorbed, it will leach through the 
soil profile and may reach ground waters and then surface waters. 
Similarly, if a chemical adsorbed to sediment, it will accumulate in the 
bed and suspended load of aquatic systems. If a chemical is not adsorbed 
to sediment, it will accumulate in the water column of aquatic systems. 
Information on the adsorption potential is needed under certain 
circumstances to assess the transport of chemicals in the environment. 
This section describes procedures that will enable sponsors to determine 
the adsorption isotherm of a chemical on sediments and soils.
    (2)  Definitions and units. (i) The ``cation exchange capacity'' 
(CEC) is the sum total of exchangeable cations that a sediment or soil 
can adsorb. The CEC is expressed in milliequivalents of negative charge 
per 100 grams (meq/100g) or milliequivalents of negative charge per gram 
(meq/g) of soil or sediment.
    (ii) ``Clay mineral analysis'' is the estimation or determination of 
the kinds of clay-size minerals and the amount present in a sediment or 
soil.
    (iii) ``Organic matter'' is the organic fraction of the sediment or 
soil; it includes plant and animal residues at various stages of 
decomposition, cells and tissues of soil organisms, and substances 
synthesized by the microbial population.
    (iv) ``Particle size analysis'' is the determination of the various 
amounts of the different particle sizes in a sample (i.e., sand, silt, 
clay), usually by sedimentation, sieving, micrometry, or combinations of 
these methods. The names and diameter range commonly used in the United 
States are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Name                            Diameter range        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very coarse sand.......................  2.0 to 1.0 mm                  

[[Page 88]]

                                                                        
Coarse sand............................  1.0 to 0.5 mm                  
Medium sand............................  0.5 to 0.25 mm                 
Fine sand..............................  0.25 to 0.125 mm               
Very fine sand.........................  0.125 to 0.062 mm              
Silt...................................  0.062 to 0.002 mm              
Clay...................................  <0.002 mm                      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v) The ``pH'' of a sediment or soil is the negative logarithm to 
the base ten of the hydrogen ion activity of the sediment or soil 
suspension. It is usually measured by a suitable sensing electrode 
coupled with a suitable reference electrode at a 1/1 solid/solution 
ratio by weight.
    (vi) The adsorption ratio, ``K<INF>d</INF>,'' is the amount of test 
chemical adsorbed by a sediment or soil (i.e., the solid phase) divided 
by the amount of test chemical in the solution phase, which is in 
equilibrium with the solid phase, at a fixed solid/solution ratio.
    (vii) ``Sediment'' is the unconsolidated inorganic and organic 
material that is suspended in and being transported by surface water, or 
has settled out and has deposited into beds.
    (viii) ``Soil'' is the unconsolidated mineral material on the 
immediate surface of the earth that serves as a natural medium for the 
growth of land plants. Its formation and properties are determined by 
various factors such as parent material, climate, macro- and 
microorganisms, topography, and time.
    (ix) ``Soil aggregate'' is the combination or arrangement of soil 
separates (sand, silt, clay) into secondary units. These units may be 
arranged in the soil profile in a distinctive characteristic pattern 
that can be classified according to size, shape, and degree of 
distinctness into classes, types, and grades.
    (x) ``Soil classification'' is the systematic arrangement of soils 
into groups or categories. Broad groupings are based on general soil 
characteristics while subdivisions are based on more detailed 
differences in specific properties. The soil classification system used 
in this standard and the one used today in the United States is the 7th 
Approximation-Comprehensive System. The ranking of subdivisions under 
this system is: Order, Suborder, Great group, family, and series.
    (xi) A ``soil horizon'' is a layer of soil approximately parallel to 
the land surface. Adjacent layers differ in physical, chemical, and 
biological properties such as color, structure, texture, consistency, 
kinds and numbers of organisms present, and degree of acidity or 
alkalinity.
    (xii) ``Soil Order'' is the broadest category of soil classification 
and is based on the general similarities of soil physical/chemical 
properties. The formation of soil by similar general genetic processes 
causes these similarities. The Soil Orders found in the United States 
are: Alfisol, Aridisol, Entisol, Histosol, Inceptisol, Mollisol, Oxisol, 
Spodosol, Ultisol, and Vertisol.
    (xiii) ``Soil series'' is the basic unit of soil classification and 
is a subdivision of a family. A series consists of soils that were 
developed under comparable climatic and vegetational conditions. The 
soils comprising a series are essentially alike in all major profile 
characteristics except for the texture of the ``A'' horizon (i.e., the 
surface layer of soil).
    (xiv) ``Soil texture'' is a classification of soils that is based on 
the relative proportions of the various soil separates present. The soil 
textural classes are: clay, sandy clay, silty clay, clay loam, silty 
clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silt, sandy loam, loamy 
sand, and sand.
    (3) Principle of the test method. (i) The extent of adsorption of a 
chemical onto sediment or soil is measured, using this test guideline, 
by equilibrating aqueous solutions containing different, but 
environmentally realistic, concentrations of the test chemical with a 
known quantity of sediment or soil. After equilibrium is reached, the 
distribution of the chemical between the water phase and the solid phase 
is quantitatively measured by a suitable analytical method. Then, 
sorption constants are calculated by using the Freundlich equation:

                               Equation 1

x/m=C<INF>s</INF>=KC<INF>e</INF> <SUP>l/n</SUP>

where:

C<INF>e</INF>=Equilibrium concentration of the chemical in the solution 
          phase
C<INF>s</INF>=Equilibrium concentration of the chemical in the solid 
          phase
K=Freundlich adsorption coefficient
m=The mass of the solid in grams
<SUP>l/n</SUP>=Exponent where n is a constant

[[Page 89]]

x=The mass in micrograms of the chemical adsorbed by m grams of solid.

Logarithmetic transformation of the Freundlich equation yields the 
following linear relationship:

                               Equation 2

log C<INF>s</INF>=log K+(l/n) log C<INF>e</INF>

    (ii) In order to estimate the environmental movement of the test 
chemical, the values K and l/n are compared with the values of other 
chemicals whose behavior in soil and sediment systems is well-documented 
in scientific literature.
    (iii) The adsorption isotherm (AI) test has many desirable features. 
First, adsorption results are highly reproducible. The test provides 
excellent quantitative data readily amenable to statistical analyses. 
Also, it has relatively modest requirements for chemicals, soils, 
laboratory space, and equipment. It allows solution phase organic 
chemical determinations that are relatively uncomplicated. A chemical 
extraction-mass balance procedure to elicit information on chemical 
transformations occurring at colloid interfaces can be incorporated into 
this test. The ease of performing the isotherm test and mass balance 
will depend upon the physical/chemical properties of the test chemical 
and the availability of suitable analytical techniques to measure the 
chemical.
    (iv) The papers by Aharonson and Kafkafi (1975) under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, Harvey (1974) under paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, Murray (1975) under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, Saltzman 
(1972) under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, Weber (1971) under 
paragraph (d)(6) of this section, and Wu (1975) under paragraph (d)(7) 
of this section served as the basis for this section. The soil and 
colloid chemistry literature and the analytical chemistry literature 
substantiate the experimental conditions and procedures specified in 
this guideline as accepted, standard procedures.
    (4) Applicability and specificity. The AI Test Guideline can be used 
to determine the soil and sediment adsorption potential of sparingly 
water soluble to infinitely soluble chemicals. In general, a chemical 
having a water solubility of less than 0.5 ppm need not be tested with 
soil as the solid phase, since the literature indicates that these 
chemicals are, in general, immobile in soils, see Goring and Hamaker 
(1972) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. However, this does not 
preclude future soil adsorption/transformation testing of these 
chemicals if more refined data are needed for the assessment process.
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Test conditions--(i) Special laboratory 
equipment. (A) Equilibrating solutions that contain, besides the test 
chemical, 0.01M calcium nitrate dissolved in sterilized, distilled-
deionized H<INF>2</INF>O adjusted to neutral pH 7 by boiling to remove 
CO<INF>2</INF>.
    (B) Containers shall be composed of material that (1) adsorb 
negligible amounts of test chemical, and (2) withstand high speed 
centrifugation. The volume of the container is not a major 
consideration; however, it is extremely important that the amount of 
soil or sediment and the solid/solution ratio used in the study result 
in minimal container headspace. It is also extremely important that the 
containers be sterilized before use.
    (C) A 150 micron (100 mesh) stainless-steel or brass sieve.
    (D) Drying oven, with circulating air, that can attain 100  deg.C.
    (E) Vortex mixer or a comparable device.
    (F) Rotary shaker or a comparable device.
    (G) High speed temperature-controlled centrifuge capable of 
sedimenting particles greater than 0.5 micron from aqueous solution.
    (ii) Temperature. The test procedure shall be performed at 
23<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    (iii) Replications. Three replications of the experimental 
treatments shall be used.
    (iv) Soil pretreatment. The following soil pretreatment steps shall 
be performed under the following conditions:
    (A) Decrease the water content, air or oven-dry soils at or below 50 
 deg.C.
    (B) Reduce aggregate size before and during sieving, crush and grind 
dried soil very gently.
    (C) Eliminate microbial growth during the test period using a 
chemical or physical treatment that does not alter or minimally alters 
the soil surface properties.

[[Page 90]]

    (D) Sieve soils with a 100 mesh stainless-steel or brass sieve.
    (E) Store all solutions and soils at temperatures between 0 and 5 
deg.C.
    (v) Sediment pretreatment.  The following sediment pretreatment 
steps shall be performed under the following conditions:
    (A) Decrease the H<INF>2</INF>O content by air or oven-drying 
sediments at or below 50   deg.C. Sediments should not be dried 
completely and should remain moist at all times prior to testing and 
analysis.
    (B) Eliminate microbial growth during the test period by using a 
chemical and/or physical treatment that does not alter or minimally 
alters the colloid surface's properties.
    (C) Store at temperatures between 0 and 5  deg.C.
    (vi) Solid/solution ratio. The solid/solution ratio shall be equal 
to or greater than 1/10. If possible, the ratios should be equal to or 
greater than 1/5. The sediment or soil dry weight after drying for a 24-
hour minimum at 90  deg.C is recommended for use as the weight of the 
solid for ratio and data calculations. If an insufficient amount of 
chemical remains in the water phase for quantification, the solid/
solution ratio should be adjusted so that measurable amounts of the test 
chemical remain in solution.
    (vii) Equilibration time. The equilibration time will depend upon 
the length of time needed for the parent chemical to attain an 
equilibrium distribution between the solid phase and the aqueous 
solution phase. The equilibration time shall be determined by the 
following procedure:
    (A) Equilibrate one solution containing a known concentration of the 
test chemical with the sediment or soil in a solid/solution ratio equal 
to or greater than \1/10\ and preferably equal to or greater than \1/5\. 
It is important that the concentration of the test chemical in the 
equilibrating solution (1) does not exceed one-half of its solubility 
and (2) should be 10 ppm or less at the end of the equilibration period.
    (B) Measure the concentration of the chemical in the solution phase 
at frequent intervals during the equilibration period.
    (C) Determine the equilibration time by plotting the measured 
concentration versus time of sampling; the equilibration time is the 
minimum period of time needed to establish a rate of change of solution 
concentration of 5 percent or less per 24 hours.
    (viii) Centrifugation time. Calculate the centrifugation time, 
t<INF>c</INF>, necessary to remove particles from solution greater than 
approximately 0.5 <greek-m>m (5 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> <greek-m>m) equivalent 
diameter (which represents all particles except the fine clay fraction) 
using the following equation:

                               Equation 3

t<INF>c</INF>(min)=1.41 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> [log(R<INF>2</INF>/
          R<INF>1</INF>)]/N<SUP>2</SUP>

where:

t<INF>c</INF>=centrifuge time in minutes
R<INF>2</INF>=distance from centrifuge spindle to deposition surface of 
          centrifuge
R<INF>1</INF>=distance from spindle to surface of the sample
N=number of revolutions of the centrifuge per minute.

    (ix) Storage of solutions. If the chemical analysis is delayed 
during the course of the experiment, store all solutions between 0 and 5 
 deg.C.
    (x) Solvents for extraction. It is important that the solvent used 
to extract the chemical from the sediment or soil is reagent grade or 
better. Solvents shall contain no impurities which could interfere with 
the determination of the test compound.
    (2) Test procedure--(i) Equilibration. Add six solutions containing 
different concentrations of the test chemical to at least one gram of 
each solid. The initial concentration of the test chemical in these 
solutions will depend on the affinity the chemical has for the sediment 
or soil. Therefore, after equilibrium is attained, it is extremely 
important that the highest concentration of the test chemical in the 
equilibrating solution does not exceed 10 ppm, is at least one order of 
magnitude greater than the lowest concentration reported, and does not 
exceed one half of its solubility.
    (A) Immediately after the solutions are added to the solids, tightly 
cap the containers and vigorously agitate them for several minutes with 
a vortex mixture or similar device.
    (B) Shake the containers throughout the equilibration period at a 
rate that

[[Page 91]]

suspends all solids in the solution phase.
    (ii) Centrifugation. When the equilibration time has expired, 
centrifuge the containers for t<INF>c</INF> minutes.
    (iii) Chemical extraction. (A) After centrifugation, remove the 
supernatant aqueous phase from the solid-solution mixture.
    (B) Extract the chemical adsorbed on the sediment or soil colloid 
surfaces with solvent.
    (iv) Chemical analysis. Determine the amount of parent test chemical 
in the aqueous equilibrating solution and organic solvent extractions. 
Use any method or combination of methods suitable for the identification 
and quantitative detection of the parent test chemical.
    (c) Reporting. Report the following information:
    (1) Temperature at which the test was conducted.
    (2) Detailed description of the analytical technique(s) used in the 
chemical extraction, recovery, and quantitative analysis of the parent 
chemical.
    (3) Amount of parent test chemical applied, the amount recovered, 
and the percent recovered.
    (4) Extent of adsorption by containers and the approach used to 
correct the data for adsorption by containers.
    (5) The individual observations, the mean values, and graphical 
plots of x/m as a function of C<INF>e</INF> for each sediment or soil 
for (i) the equilibration time determination and (ii) the isotherm 
determination.
    (6) The quantities K, n, and l/n.
    (7) Soil information: Soil Order, series, texture, sampling 
location, horizon, general clay fraction mineralogy.
    (8) Sediment information: sampling location, general clay fraction 
mineralogy.
    (9) Sediment and soil physical-chemical properties: percent sand, 
silt, and clay (particle size analysis); percent organic matter; pH (1/1 
solids/H<INF>2</INF>O); and cation exchange capacity.
    (10) The procedures used to determine the physical/chemical 
properties listed under paragraphs (c) (7) through (9) of this section.

guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 796.3100  Aerobic aquatic biodegradation.

    (a) Introduction--(1) Purpose. (i) This Guideline is designed to 
develop data on the rate and extent of aerobic biodegradation that might 
occur when chemical substances are released to aquatic environments. A 
high biodegradability result in this test provides evidence that the 
test substance will be biodegradable in natural aerobic freshwater 
environments.
    (ii) On the contrary, a low biodegradation result may have other 
causes than poor biodegradability of the test substance. Inhibition of 
the microbial inoculum by the test substance at the test concentration 
may be observed. In such cases, further work is needed to

[[Page 92]]

assess the aerobic aquatic biodegradability and to determine the 
concentrations at which toxic effects are evident. An estimate of the 
expected environmental concentration will help to put toxic effects into 
perspective.
    (2) Definitions. (i) ``Adaptation'' is the process by which a 
substance induces the synthesis of any degradative enzymes necessary to 
catalyze the transformation of that substance.
    (ii) ``Ultimate Biodegradability'' is the breakdown of an organic 
compound to CO<INF>2</INF>, water, the oxides or mineral salts of other 
elements and/or to products associated with normal metabolic processes 
of microorganisms.
    (iii) ``Ready Biodegradability'' is an expression used to describe 
those substances which, in certain biodegradation test procedures, 
produce positive results that are unequivocal and which lead to the 
reasonable assumption that the substance will undergo rapid and ultimate 
biodegradation in aerobic aquatic environments.
    (3) Principle of the test method. This Guideline method is based on 
the method described by William Gledhill (1975) under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section. The method consists of a 2-week inoculum buildup period 
during which soil and sewage microorganisms are provided the opportunity 
to adapt to the test compound. This inoculum is added to a specially 
equipped Erlenmeyer flask containing a defined medium with test 
substance. A reservoir holding barium hydroxide solution is suspended in 
the test flask. After inoculation, the test flasks are sparged with 
CO<INF>2</INF>-free air, sealed, and incubated, with shaking in the 
dark. Periodically, samples of the test mixture containing water-soluble 
test substances are analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the 
Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> from the reservoirs is titrated to measure the amount 
of CO<INF>2</INF> evolved. Differences in the extent of DOC 
disappearance and CO<INF>2</INF> evolution between control flasks 
containing no test substance, and flasks containing test substance are 
used to estimate the degree of ultimate biodegradation.
    (4) Prerequisites. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the 
test substance shall be calculated or, if this is not possible, 
analyzed, to enable the percent of theoretical yield of carbon dioxide 
and percent of DOC loss to be calculated.
    (5) Guideline information. (i) Information on the relative 
proportions of the major components of the test substance will be useful 
in interpreting the results obtained, particularly in those cases where 
the result lies close to a ``pass level.''
    (ii) Information on the toxicity of the chemical may be useful in 
the interpretation of low results and in the selection of appropriate 
test concentrations.
    (6) Reference substances. Where investigating a chemical substance, 
reference compounds may be useful and an inventory of suitable reference 
compounds needs to be identified. In order to check the activity of the 
inoculum the use of a reference compound is desirable. Aniline, sodium 
citrate, dextrose, phthalic acid and trimellitic acid will exhibit 
ultimate biodegradation under the conditions of this Test Guideline 
method. These reference substances must yield 60 percent of theoretical 
maximum CO<INF>2</INF> and show a removal of 70 percent DOC within 28 
days. Otherwise the test is regarded as invalid and shall be repeated 
using an inoculum from a different source.
    (7) Reproducibility. The reproducibility of the method has not yet 
been determined; however it is believed to be appropriate for a 
screening test which has solely an acceptance but no rejective function.
    (8) Sensitivity. The sensitivity of the method is determined by the 
ability to measure the endogenous CO<INF>2</INF> production of the 
inoculum in the blank flask and by the sensitivity limit of the 
dissolved organic carbon analysis. If the test is adapted to handle 
\14\C-labeled test substances, test substance concentrations can be much 
lower.
    (9) Possibility of standardization. This possibility exists. The 
major difficulty is to standardize the inoculum in such a way that 
interlaboratory reproducibility is ensured.
    (10) Possibility of automation. None at present, although parts of 
the analyses may be automated.
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Preparations--(i) Apparatus. The shake 
flask apparatus under the following Figure 1 contains 10 mL of 0.2N 
Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> in an open

[[Page 93]]

container suspended over 1 liter of culture medium in a 2-liter 
Erlenmeyer flask.

        Figure 1--Shake-Flask System for Carbon Dioxide Evolution

The Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> container is made by placing a constriction just 
above the 10 mL mark of a 50 mL heavy-duty centrifuge tube and attaching 
the centrifuge tube to a 2 mm I.D.  x 9 mm O.D. glass tube by means of 3 
glass support rods. The centrifuge tube opening is large enough to 
permit CO<INF>2</INF> to diffuse into the Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF>, while the 
constriction permits transferal of the flask to and from the shaker 
without Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> spillage into the medium. For periodic 
removal and addition of base from the center well, a polypropylene 
capillary tube, attached at one end to a 10 ml disposable syringe, is 
inserted through the 9 mm O.D. glass tube into the Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> 
reservoir. The reservoir access port is easily sealed during incubation 
with a serum bottle stopper. Two glass tubes are added for sparging, 
venting, and medium sampling. The tops of these tubes are connected with 
a short section of flexible tubing during incubation.
    (ii) Reagents and stock solutions. (A) Stock solutions, I, II, and 
III under the following Table 1.
    (B) Yeast extract.
    (C) Vitamin-free casamino acids.
    (D) 70 percent O<INF>2</INF> in nitrogen or CO<INF>2</INF>-free air.
    (E) 0.2N Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF>.
    (F) 0.1 N HCl.
    (G) 20 percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>.
    (H) Phenolphthalein.
    (I) Dilution water--distilled, deionized water (DIW).
    (iii) Soil Inoculum. A fresh sample of an organically rich soil is 
used as the inoculum in the ultimate biodegradation test. Soil is 
collected, prepared, and stored according to the recommendations of 
Pramer and Bartha (1972) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The 
soil surface is cleared of litter and a soil sample is obtained 10 to 20 
cm below the surface. The sample is screened through a sieve with 2 to 5 
mm openings and stored in a polyethylene bag at 2 to 4  deg.C for not 
more than 30 days prior to use. The soil is

[[Page 94]]

never allowed to air-dry, and shall not be frozen during storage.

\1\= Each liter of test medium contains 1 mL of each solution.          
\2\= Final pH is adjusted to 3.0 with 0.10 N HCl.                       

    (iv) Acclimation Medium. Acclimation medium is prepared by adding, 
for each liter of distilled, deionized water (DIW): 1 mL each of 
solutions I, II, and III in Table 1 in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, 1.0 gm of soil inoculum (prepared according to paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section), 2.0 mL of aerated mixed liquor (obtained 
from an activated sludge treatment plant not more than 2 days prior to 
commencing the acclimation phase, and stored in the interim at 4  deg.C) 
and 50 mL raw domestic influent sewage. This medium is mixed for 15 
minutes and filtered through a glass wool plug in a glass funnel. The 
filtrate is permitted to stand for 1 hour, refiltered through glass 
wool, and supplemented with 25 mg/L each of Difco vitamin-free casamino 
acids and yeast extract. Appropriate volumes are added to 2-liter 
Erlenmeyer flasks. Test compounds are added incrementally during the 
acclimation period at concentrations equivalent to 4, 8, and 8 mg/L 
carbon on days 0, 7, and 11, respectively. On day 14, the medium is 
refiltered through glass wool prior to use in the test. For evaluating 
the biodegradability of a series of functionally or structurally related 
chemicals, media from all inoculum flasks may be combined before final 
filtration.
    (2) Procedures. (i) Inoculum (100 mL of acclimation medium) is added 
to 900 mL DIW containing 1 mL each of solutions I, II, and III in Table 
1 under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer 
flask. Test compound equivalent to 10 mg/liter carbon is added to each 
of the replicate flasks containing the test medium. Ten mL of 0.2 N Ba 
(OH)<INF>2</INF> are added to the suspended reservoir in each flask and 
duplicate 10 mL samples of Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> are also saved as 
titration blanks for analysis with test samples. Flasks are sparged with 
CO<INF>2</INF>-free air (for volatile test materials, sparging is done 
prior to addition of the chemical), sealed, and placed on a gyrotary 
shaker (approximately 125 rpm) at 20 to 25  deg.C in the dark. For each 
set of experiments, each test, reference, inhibited, and control system 
should be analyzed at time zero and at a minimum of four other times 
from time zero through day 28. Sampling must be made with sufficient 
frequency to allow for a smooth plot of biodegradation with time. 
Sampling times should be varied by the investigator as deemed 
appropriate to match the rate of degradation of the test substance. 
Tests may be terminated when biodegradation reaches a plateau and is 
consistent (<plus-minus>10 percent) over 3 consecutive days or on day 
28, whichever occurs first. For chemicals which are water soluble at the 
test concentration, an adequate volume (5 to 10 mL) of medium is removed 
for DOC analysis. Each sample for DOC analysis should be filtered 
through a membrane filter of 0.45 micrometer pore diameter before DOC 
analysis. For all test and reference compounds, Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> from 
the center well is removed for analysis. The center well is rinsed with 
10 mL CO<INF>2</INF>-free DIW and is refilled with fresh base. Rinse 
water is combined with the Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> sample to be analyzed. 
Flasks are resealed and placed on the shaker. On the day prior to 
terminating the test, 3 mL of 20 percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> are 
added to the medium to release carbonate bound CO<INF>2</INF>.
    (ii) For each set of experiments, each test substance shall be 
tested in triplicate.
    (iii) For each set of experiments, one or two reference compounds 
are included to assess the microbial activity of the test medium. 
Duplicate reference flasks are prepared by adding reference compound 
equivalent to 10

[[Page 95]]

mg/liter carbon to each of two flasks containing the test medium. 
Reference compounds which are positive for ultimate biodegradability 
include: sodium citrate, dextrose, phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, and 
aniline.
    (iv) For each test set, triplicate controls receiving inoculated 
medium and no test compound, plus all test and reference flasks, are 
analyzed for CO<INF>2</INF> evolution and DOC removal. Results from 
analysis of the control flasks (DOC, CO<INF>2</INF> evolution, etc.) are 
subtracted from corresponding experimental flasks containing test 
compound in order to arrive at the net effect due to the test compound.
    (v) A test system containing a growth inhibitor should be 
established as a control for each substance tested for biodegradation by 
this method. That inhibited system must contain the same amount of 
water, mineral nutrients, inoculum, and test substance used in the 
uninhibited test systems, plus 50 mg/L mercuric chloride 
(HgCl<INF>2</INF>) to inhibit microbial activity.
    (vi) Flasks shall be incubated in the dark to minimize both 
photochemical reactions and algal growth. Appropriate sterile controls 
or controls containing a metabolic inhibitor, such as 50 mg/1 
HgCl<INF>2</INF>, are needed to correct for interferences due to 
nonbiological degradation. With volatile organic materials, sparging 
with CO<INF>2</INF>-free air is performed only once, just prior to 
addition of the test chemical. Analyses for CO<INF>2</INF> evolution and 
DOC removal are conducted within 2 to 3 hours of sampling to minimize 
interferences which may occur in storage. All glassware should be free 
of organic carbon contaminants.
    (3) Analytical measurements. The quantity of CO<INF>2</INF> evolved 
is measured by titration of the entire Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> sample (10 mL 
Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF>+10 mL rinse water) with 0.1 N HCl to the 
phenolphthalein end point. Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> blanks are also 
supplemented with 10 mL CO<INF>2</INF>-free DIW and titrated in a 
similar manner. Samples (5 mL) for DOC are centrifuged and/or filtered 
and supernatant or filtrate analyzed by a suitable total organic carbon 
method.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Test compound 
(10 mg carbon) is theoretically converted to 0.833 mmol CO<INF>2</INF>. 
Absorbed CO<INF>2</INF> precipitates as BaCO<INF>3</INF> from 
Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF>, causing a reduction in alkalinity by the equivalent 
of 16.67 mL of 0.1 N HCl for complete conversion of the test compound 
carbon to CO<INF>2</INF>. Therefore, the percent theoretical 
CO<INF>2</INF> evolved from the test compound is calculated at any 
sampling time from the formula:

Percent CO<INF>2</INF> evolution=[(TF-CF)/16.67] 100 (for 10 mg/L test 
          compound carbon)

where:

TF=mL 0.1 N HCl required to titrate Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> samples from the 
          test flask
CF=mL 0.1 N HCl required to titrate Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> samples from the 
          control flask.

    (ii) The cumulative percent CO<INF>2</INF> evolution at any sample 
time is calculated as the summation of the percent CO<INF>2</INF> 
evolved at all sample points of the test.
    (iii) The percent DOC disappearance from the test compound is 
calculated from the following equation:

Percent DOC Removal=[1-(DTF<INF>x</INF>-DCF<INF>x</INF>)/
          (DTF<INF>o</INF>-DCF<INF>o</INF>)] 100

where:

DTF=Dissolved organic carbon from test flask
DCF=Dissolved organic carbon from control flask
o=Day zero measurements
x=Day of measurements during test.

    (iv) The difference between the amount of 0.1 N HCl used for the 
Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> titration blank samples and the Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> 
samples from the control units (no test compound) is an indication of 
the activity of the microorganisms in the test system. In general, this 
difference is approximately 1 to 3 mL of 0.1 N HCl at each sampling 
time. A finding of no difference in the titration volumes between these 
two samples indicates a poor inoculum. In this case, the validity of the 
test results is questionable and the test set shall be rerun beginning 
with the acclimation phase.
    (v) CO<INF>2</INF> evolution in the reference flasks is also 
indicative of the activity of the microbial test system. The suggested 
reference compounds should all yield final CO<INF>2</INF> evolution 
values of at least 60 percent of theoretical CO<INF>2</INF>. If, for any 
test set, the percent theoretical CO<INF>2</INF> evolution value for the 
reference

[[Page 96]]

flasks is outside this range, the test results are considered invalid 
and the test is rerun.
    (vi) Inhibition by the test compound is indicated by lower 
CO<INF>2</INF> evolution in the test flasks than in the control flasks. 
If inhibition is noted, the study for this compound is rerun beginning 
with the acclimation phase. During the test phase for inhibitory 
compounds, the test chemical is added incrementally according to the 
schedule: Day 0--0.5 mg/liter as organic carbon, Day 2--1 mg/liter C, 
Day 4--1.5 mg/liter C, Day 7--2 mg/liter C, Day 10--5 mg/liter C. For 
this case, the Ba(OH)<INF>2</INF> is sampled on Day 10, and weekly 
thereafter. The total test duration remains 28 days.
    (vii) The use of <SUP>14</SUP>C-labeled chemicals is not required. 
If appropriately labeled test substance is readily available and if the 
investigator chooses to use this procedure with labeled test substance, 
this is an acceptable alternative. If this option is chosen, the 
investigator may use lower test substance concentrations if those 
concentrations are more representative of environmental levels.
    (2) Test report. (i) For each test and reference compound, the 
following data shall be reported.
    (ii) Information on the inoculum, including source, collection date, 
handling, storage and adaptation possibilities (i.e., that the inoculum 
might have been exposed to the test substance either before or after 
collection and prior to use in the test).
    (iii) Results from each test, reference, inhibited (with 
HgCl<INF>2</INF>) and control system at each sampling time, including an 
average result for the triplicate test substance systems and the 
standard deviation for that average.
    (iv) Average cumulative percent theoretical CO<INF>2</INF> evolution 
over the test duration.
    (v) Dissolved organic carbon due to test compound at each sampling 
time (DTF-DCF).
    (vi) Average percent DOC removal at each sampling time.
    (vii) Twenty-eight day standard deviation for percent CO<INF>2</INF> 
evolution and DOC removal.

guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 796.3500  Hydrolysis as a function of pH at 25  deg.C.

    (a) Introduction--(1) Background and purpose. (i) Water is one of 
the most widely distributed substances in the environment. It covers a 
large portion of the earth's surface as oceans, rivers, and lakes. The 
soil also contains water, as does the atmosphere in the form of water 
vapor. As a result of this ubiquitousness, chemicals introduced into the 
environment almost always come into contact with aqueous media. Certain 
classes of these chemicals, upon such contact, can undergo hydrolysis, 
which is one of the most common reactions controlling chemical stability 
and is, therefore, one of the main chemical degradation paths of these 
substances in the environment.
    (ii) Since hydrolysis can be such an important degradation path for 
certain classes of chemicals, it is necessary, in assessing the fate of 
these chemicals in the environment, to know whether, at what rate, and 
under what conditions a substance will hydrolyze. Some of these 
reactions can occur so rapidly that there may be greater concern about 
the products of the transformation than about the parent compounds. In 
other cases, a substance will be resistant to hydrolysis under typical 
environmental conditions, while, in still other instances, the substance 
may have an intermediate stability that can result in the necessity for 
an assessment of both the original compound and its transformation 
products. The importance of transformation of chemicals via hydrolysis 
in aqueous media in the environment can be determined quantitatively 
from data on hydrolysis rate constants. This hydrolysis Test Guideline 
represents a

[[Page 97]]

test to allow one to determine rates of hydrolysis at any pH of 
environmental concern at 25  deg.C.
    (2) Definitions and units. (i) ``Hydrolysis'' is defined as the 
reaction of an organic chemical with water, such that one or more bonds 
are broken and the reaction products of the transformation incorporate 
the elements of water (H<INF>2</INF>O).
    (ii) ``Elimination'' is defined in this Test Guideline to be a 
reaction of an organic chemical (RX) in water in which the X group is 
lost. These reactions generally follow the same type of rate laws that 
hydrolysis reactions follow and, thus, are also covered in this Test 
Guideline.
    (iii) A ``first-order reaction'' is defined as a reaction in which 
the rate of disappearance of the chemical substance being tested is 
directly proportional to the concentration of the chemical substance and 
is not a function of the concentrations of any other substances present 
in the reaction mixture.
    (iv) The ``half-life'' of a chemical is defined as the time required 
for the concentration of the chemical substance being tested to be 
reduced to one-half its initial value.
    (v) ``Hydrolysis'' refers to a reaction of an organic chemical with 
water such that one or more bonds are broken and the reaction products 
incorporate the elements of water (H<INF>2</INF>O). This type of 
transformation often results in the net exchange of a group X, on an 
organic chemical RX, for the OH group from water. This can be written 
as:

    RX+HOH<r-arrow>ROH+HX.

    (A) Another result of hydrolysis can be the incorporation of both H 
and OH in a single product. An example of this is the hydrolysis of 
epoxides, which can be represented by
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    (B) The hydrolysis reaction can be catalyzed by acidic or basic 
species, including OH<SUP>-</SUP> and H<INF>3</INF>O<SUP>+</SUP> 
(H<SUP>+</SUP>). The promotion of the reaction by 
H<INF>3</INF>O<SUP>-</SUP> or OH<SUP>-</SUP> is called specific acid or 
specific base catalysis, respectively, as contrasted with general acid 
or base catalysis encountered with other cationic or anionic species. 
Usually, the rate law for chemical RX can be written as:

                               Equation 1

-d[RX]/<INF>d+</INF> = k<INF>h</INF>[RX]=k<INF>A</INF>[H<SUP>+</SUP>] 
          [RX]
+k<INF>B</INF>[OH<SUP>-</SUP>] [RX]+k<SUP>,</SUP><INF>N</INF> 
          [H<INF>2</INF>O] [RX],

where K<INF>A</INF>, k<INF>B</INF> and k'<INF>N</INF> are the second-
order rate constants for acid and base catalyzed and neutral water 
processes, respectively. In dilute solutions, such as are encountered in 
following this Test Guideline, water is present in great excess and its 
concentration is, thus, essentially constant during the course of the 
hydrolysis reaction. At fixed pH, the reaction, therefore, becomes 
pseudo first-order, and the rate constant (k<INF>h</INF>) can be written 
as:

                               Equation 2

k<INF>h</INF>=k<INF>A</INF> [H<SUP>+</SUP>]+k<INF>B</INF> 
          [OH<SUP>-</SUP>]+k<INF>N</INF>,

where k<INF>N</INF> is the first-order neutral water rate constant. 
Since this is a pseudo first-order process, the half-life is independent 
of the concentration and can be written as:

                               Equation 3

t<INF>1/2</INF>=0.693/k<INF>h</INF>.

At constant pH, Equation 1 can be integrated to yield the first order 
rate expression

                               Equation 4

log<INF>10</INF> C=- (k<INF>h</INF>t/<INF>2.303</INF>)+log<INF>10</INF> 
          C<INF>o</INF>,

where C is the concentration of the test chemical at time t and 
C<INF>o</INF> is the initial chemical concentration (t=0).
    (C) At a given pH, Equation 2 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this 
section contains three unknowns, k<INF>A</INF>, k<INF>B</INF>, and 
k<INF>N</INF>. Therefore, three equations (i.e., measurements at three 
different pH's at a fixed temperature) are required if one wishes to 
solve for these quantities. Making suitable approximations for 
quantities that are negligible, the expressions for k<INF>A</INF>, 
k<INF>B</INF>, and k<INF>N</INF> using values of k<INF>h</INF> measured 
at pH 3, 7, and 11 are:

                               Equation 5

k<INF>A</INF>=10<SUP>3</SUP> [k<INF>h</INF> (3)-k<INF>h</INF> 
          (7)+10<SUP>-4</SUP> k<INF>h</INF> (11)]

[[Page 98]]

k<INF>B</INF>=10<SUP>3</SUP> [k<INF>h</INF> (11)-k<INF>h</INF> 
          (7)+10<SUP>-4</SUP> k<INF>h</INF> (3)]
k<INF>N</INF>=k<INF>h</INF> (7)-10<SUP>-4</SUP> [k<INF>h</INF> 
          (3)+k<INF>h</INF> (11)]

The calculated rate constants from equation 5 under this paragraph can 
be employed in equation 2 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section 
to calculate the hydrolysis rate of a chemical at any pH of 
environmental concern.
    (D) The equations under paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply 
whether the test chemical has one or more hydrolyzable groups. In the 
latter case, the rate may be written as:

                               Equation 6

-d[RX]/<INF>dt</INF>= [RX]+k<INF>2</INF> [RX]+ . . . . +k<INF>n</INF>
[RX]=(k<INF>1</INF>+k<INF>2</INF>+ . . . . . k<INF>n</INF>) 
          [RX]=k<INF>h</INF> [RX].

Equation 6 applies to the hydrolysis rate of a molecule having n 
hydrolyzable groups, each of which follows first-order reaction 
kinetics. The measured k<INF>h</INF> is now the sum of the individual 
reaction rates and is the only rate constant required in this section.
    (3) Principle of the test method. Procedures described in this 
section enable sponsors to obtain quantitative information on hydrolysis 
rates through a determination of hydrolysis rate constants and half-
lives of chemicals at pH 3.00, 7.00, and 11.00 at 25  deg.C. The three 
measured rate constants are used to determine the acidic, basic, and 
neutral rate constants associated with a hydrolytic reaction. The latter 
constants can then be employed in determining the hydrolysis rates of 
chemicals at any pH of environmental concern at 25  deg.C.
    (4) Applicability and specificity. There are several different 
common classes of organic chemicals that are subject to hydrolysis 
transformation, including esters, amides, lactones, carbamates, 
organophosphates, and alkyl halides. Processes other than nucleophilic 
displacement by water can also take place. Among these are elimination 
reactions that exhibit behavior similar to hydrolysis and, therefore, 
are also covered in this section.
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Test conditions--(i) Special laboratory 
equipment. (A) A thermostatic bath that can be maintained at a 
temperature of 25<plus-minus>1  deg.C.
    (B) A pH meter that can resolve differences of 0.05 pH units or 
less.
    (C) Stoppered volumetric flasks (no grease) or glass ampoules that 
can be sealed.
    (ii) Purity of water. Reagent-grade water (e.g., water meeting ASTM 
Type IIA standards or an equivalent grade) shall be used to minimize 
biodegradation. ASTM Type IIA water is described in ASTM D 1193-77 
(Reapproved 1983), ``Standard Specification for Reagent Water.'' ASTM D 
1193-77 (Reapproved 1983) is available for inspection at the Office of 
the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, 
Washington, DC. This incorporation by reference was approved by the 
Director of the Office of the Federal Register. This material is 
incorporated as it exists on the date of approval and a notice of any 
change in this material will be published in the Federal Register. 
Copies of the incorporated material may be obtained from the Non-
Confidential Information Center (NCIC) (7407), Office of Pollution 
Prevention and Toxics, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Room B-607 
NEM, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, between the hours of 12 p.m. 
and 4 p.m. weekdays excluding legal holidays, or from the American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, 
Philadelphia, PA 19103.
    (iii) Sterilization. All glassware shall be sterilized. Aseptic 
conditions shall be used in the preparation of all solutions and in 
carrying out all hydrolysis experiments to eliminate or minimize 
biodegradation. Glassware can be sterilized in an autoclave or by any 
other suitable method.
    (iv) Precautions for volatility. If the chemical is volatile the 
reaction vessels shall be almost completely filled and sealed.
    (v) Temperature controls. All hydrolysis reactions shall be carried 
out at 25  deg.C (<plus-minus>1  deg.C) and with the temperature 
controlled to <plus-minus>0.1  deg.C.
    (vi) pH conditions. It is recommended that all hydrolysis 
experiments be performed at pH 3.00, 7.00, and 11.00 <plus-minus> 0.05 
using the appropriate buffers described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of 
this section.
    (vii) Concentration of solutions of chemical substances. The 
concentration of the test chemical shall be less than one-half the 
chemical's solubility in water but not greater than 10<SUP>-3</SUP>M.

[[Page 99]]

    (viii) Effect of acidic and basic groups. Complications can arise 
upon measuring the rate of hydrolysis of chemicals that reversibly 
ionize or are protonated in the pH range 3.00 to 11.00. Therefore, for 
these chemicals, it is recommended that these hydrolysis tests be 
performed at pH 5.00, 7.00, and 900<plus-minus>0.05 using the 
appropriate buffers described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of 
this section. If a test chemical reversibly ionizes or protonates in the 
pH range 5.00 to 9.00, then it is recommended that additional hydrolysis 
tests should be carried out at pH 6.00 and 8.00<plus-minus>0.05 using 
the buffers described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
    (ix) Buffer catalysis. For certain chemicals, buffers may catalyze 
the hydrolysis reaction. If this is suspected, hydrolysis rate 
determination shall be carried out with the appropriate buffers and the 
same experiments repeated at buffer concentrations lowered by at least a 
factor of five. If the hydrolysis reaction produces a change of greater 
than 0.05 pH units in the lower concentration buffers at the end of the 
measurement time, the test chemical concentrations also shall be lowered 
by at least a factor of five. Alternatively, test chemical 
concentrations and buffer concentrations may both be lowered 
simultaneously by a factor of five. A sufficient criterion for 
minimization of buffer catalysis is an observed equality in the 
hydrolysis rate constant for two different solutions differing in buffer 
or test chemical concentration by a factor of five.
    (x) Photosensitive chemicals. The solution absorption spectrum can 
be employed to determine whether a particular chemical is potentially 
subject to photolytic transformation upon exposure to light. For 
chemicals that absorb light of wavelengths greater than 290 nm, the 
hydrolysis experiment shall be carried out in the dark, under amber or 
red safelights, in amber or red glassware, or employing other suitable 
methods for preventing photolysis. The absorption spectrum of the 
chemical in aqueous solution can be measured under Sec. 796.1050.
    (xi) Chemical analysis of solutions. In determining the 
concentrations of the test chemicals in solution, any suitable 
analytical method may be employed, although methods which are specific 
for the compound to be tested are preferred. Chromatographic methods are 
recommended because of their compound specificity in analyzing the 
parent chemical without interferences from impurities. Whenever 
practicable, the chosen analytical method should have a precision within 
<plus-minus>5 percent.
    (2) Preparation--(i) Reagents and solutions--(A) Buffer solutions. 
Prepare buffer solutions using reagent-grade chemicals and reagent-grade 
water as follows:
    (1) pH 3.00: use 250 mL of 0.100M potassium hydrogen phthalate; 111 
mL of 0.100M hydrochloric acid; and adjust volume to 500 mL with 
reagent-grade water.
    (2) pH 7.00: use 250 mL of 0.100M potassium dihydrogen phosphate; 
145 mL of 0.100M sodium hydroxide; and adjust volume to 500 mL with 
reagent-grade water.
    (3) pH 11.00: use 250 mL of 0.0500M sodium bicarbonate; 113 mL of 
0.100M sodium hydroxide; and adjust volume to 500 mL with reagent-grade 
water.
    (B) Additional buffer solutions. For chemicals that ionize or are 
protonated as discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, 
prepare buffers using reagent-grade water and reagent-grade chemicals as 
follows:
    (1) pH 5.00: use 250 mL of 0.100M potassium hydrogen phthalate; 113 
mL of 0.100M sodium hydroxide; and adjust volume to 500 mL with reagent-
grade water.
    (2) pH 6.00: use 250 mL of 0.100M potassium dihydrogen phosphate; 28 
mL of 0.100M sodium hydroxide; and adjust volume to 500 mL with reagent-
grade water.
    (3) pH 8.00: use 250 mL of 0.100M potassium dihydrogen phosphate; 
234 mL of 0.100M sodium hydroxide; and adjust volume to 500 mL with 
reagent-grade water.
    (4) pH 9.00: use 250 mL of 0.0250M borax 
(Na<INF>2</INF>B<INF>4</INF>O<INF>7</INF>); 23 mL of 0.100M hydrochloric 
aid; and adjust volume to 500 mL with reagent-grade water.
    (C) Adjustment of buffer concentrations. (1) The concentrations of 
all the above buffer solutions are the maximum concentration to be 
employed in carrying out hydrolysis measurements. If the

[[Page 100]]

initial concentration of the test chemical is less than 
10<SUP>-3</SUP>M, the buffer concentration shall be lowered by a 
corresponding amount; e.g., if the initial test chemical concentration 
is 10<SUP>-4</SUP>M, the concentration of the above buffers shall be 
reduced by a factor of 10. In addition, for those reactions in which an 
acid or base is not a reaction product, the minimum buffer concentration 
necessary for maintaining the pH within +0.05 units shall be employed.
    (2) Check the pH of all buffer solutions with a pH meter at 25 
deg.C and adjust the pH to the proper value, if necessary.
    (D) Preparation of test solution. (1) If the test chemical is 
readily soluble in water, prepare an aqueous solution of the chemical in 
the appropriate buffer and determine the concentration of the chemical. 
Alternatively, a solution of the chemical in water may be prepared and 
added to an appropriate buffer solution and the concentration of the 
chemical then determined. In the latter case, the aliquot shall be small 
enough so that the concentration of the buffer in the final solution and 
the pH of the solution remain essentially unchanged. Do not employ heat 
in dissolving the chemical. The final concentration shall not be greater 
than one-half the chemical's solubility in water and not greater than 
10<SUP>-3</SUP>M.
    (2) If the test chemical is too insoluble in pure water to permit 
reasonable handling and analytical procedures, it is recommended that 
the chemical be dissolved in reagent-grade acetonitrile and buffer 
solution and then added to an aliquot of the acetonitrile solution. Do 
not employ heat to dissolve the chemical in acetonitrile. The final 
concentration of the test chemical shall not be greater than one-half 
the chemical's solubility in water and not greater than 
10<SUP>-3</SUP>M. In addition, the final concentration of the 
acetonitrile shall be one volume percent or less.
    (3) Performance of the test. Carry out all hydrolysis experiments by 
employing one of the procedures described in this paragraph. Prepare the 
test solutions as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section at pH 
3.00, 7.00, and 11.00<plus-minus>0.05, and determine the initial test 
chemical concentration (C<INF>o</INF>) in triplicate. Analyze each 
reaction mixture in triplicate at regular intervals, employing one of 
the following procedures:
    (i) Procedure 1. Analyze each test solution at regular intervals to 
provide a minimum of six measurements with the extent of hydrolysis 
between 20 to 70 percent. Rates should be rapid enough so that 60 to 70 
percent of the chemical is hydrolyzed in 672 hours.
    (ii) Procedure 2. If the reaction is too slow to conveniently follow 
hydrolysis to high conversion in 672 hours but still rapid enough to 
attain at least 20 percent conversion, take 15 to 20 time points at 
regular intervals after 10 percent conversion is attained.
    (iii) Procedure 3. (A) If chemical hydrolysis is less than 20 
percent after 672 hours, determine the concentration (C) after this time 
period.
    (B) If the pH at the end of concentration measurements employing any 
of the above three procedures has changed by more than 0.05 units from 
the initial pH, repeat the experiment using a solution having a test 
chemical concentration lowered sufficiently to keep the pH variation 
within 0.05 pH units.
    (iv) Analytical methodology. Select an analytical method that is 
most applicable to the analysis of the specific chemical being tested 
under paragraph (b)(1)(xi) of this section.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) If Procedure 1 
or 2 were employed in making concentration measurements, use a linear 
regression analysis with Equation 4 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this 
section to calculate k<INF>h</INF> at 25  deg.C for each pH employed in 
the hydrolysis experiments. Calculate the coefficient of determination 
(R<SUP>2</SUP>) for each rate constant. Use Equation 3 under paragraph 
(a)(2)(v)(B) of this section to calculate the hydrolysis half-life using 
k<INF>h</INF>.
    (ii) If Procedure 3 was employed in making rate measurements, use 
the mean initial concentration (C<INF>o</INF>) and the mean 
concentration of chemical (C) in Equation 4 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) 
of this section to calculate k<INF>h</INF> for each pH used in the 
experiments. Calculate the hydrolysis half-life using k<INF>h</INF> in 
Equation 3 under paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section.

[[Page 101]]

    (iii) For each set of three concentration replicates, calculate the 
mean value of C and the standard deviation.
    (iv) For test chemicals that are not ionized or protonated between 
pH 3 and 11, calculate k<INF>A</INF>, k<INF>B</INF>, and k<INF>N</INF> 
using Equation 5.
    (2) Specific analytical and recovery procedures. (i) Provide a 
detailed description or reference for the analytical procedure used, 
including the calibration data and precision.
    (ii) If extraction methods were used to separate the solute from the 
aqueous solution, provide a description of the extraction method as well 
as the recovery data.
    (3) Test data report. (i) For Procedures 1 and 2, report 
k<INF>h</INF>, the hydrolysis half-life (t<INF>1</INF>/2), and the 
coefficient of determination (R<SUP>2</SUP>) for each pH employed in the 
rate measurements. In addition, report the individual values, the mean 
value, and the standard deviation for each set of replicate 
concentration measurements. Finally, report k<INF>A</INF>, 
k<INF>B</INF>, and k<INF>N</INF>.
    (ii) For Procedure 3, report k<INF>h</INF> and the half-life for 
each pH employed in the rate measurements. In addition, report the 
individual values, the mean value, and the standard deviation for each 
set of replicate concentration measurements. Finally, report 
k<INF>A</INF>, k<INF>B</INF>, and k<INF>N</INF>.
    (iii) If, after 672 hours, the concentration (C) is the same as the 
initial concentration (C<INF>o</INF>) within experimental error, then 
k<INF>h</INF> cannot be calculated and the chemical can be reported as 
being persistent with respect to hydrolysis.

<R05>
Sec. 797.1050  Algal acute toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. The guideline in this section is intended for use in 
developing data on the acute toxicity of chemical substances and 
mixtures (``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test 
regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-
469, 90 Stat. 2003, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes 
test procedures and conditions using freshwater and marine algae to 
develop data on the phytotoxicity of chemicals. The United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) will use data from these 
tests in assessing the hazard of a chemical to the environment.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the definitions in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter apply to this test 
guideline. The following definitions also apply to this guideline:
    (1) Algicidal means having the property of killing algae.
    (2) Algistatic means having the property of inhibiting algal growth.
    (3) ECx means the experimentally derived chemical concentration that 
is calculated to effect X percent of the test criterion.
    (4) Growth means a relative measure of the viability of an algal 
population based on the number and/or weight of algal cells per volume 
of nutrient medium or test solution in a specified period of time.
    (5) Static system means a test container in which the test solution 
is not renewed during the period of the test.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) In preparation for 
the test, fill test containers with appropriate volumes of nutrient 
medium and/or test solution. Start the test by introducing

[[Page 102]]

algae into the test and control containers in the growth chambers. 
Environmental conditions within the growth chambers are established at 
predetermined limits.
    (ii) At the end of 96 hours enumerate the algal cells in all 
containers to determine inhibition or stimulation of growth in test 
containers compared to controls. Use data to define the concentration-
response curve, and calculate the EC<INF>10</INF>, EC<INF>50</INF>, and 
EC<INF>90</INF> values.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Range-finding test. (i) A range-finding test should be conducted 
to determine:
    (A) If definitive testing is necessary.
    (B) Test chemical concentrations for the definitive test.
    (ii) Algae are exposed to a widely spaced (e.g., log interval) 
chemical concentration series. The lowest value in the series, exclusive 
of controls, should be at the chemical's detection limit. The upper 
value, for water soluble compounds, should be the saturation 
concentration. No replicates are required; and nominal concentrations of 
the chemical are acceptable unless definitive testing is not required.
    (iii) The test is performed once for each of the recommended algal 
species or selected alternates. Test chambers should contain equal 
volumes of test solution and approximately 1 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> 
Selenastrum cells/ml or 7.7 x 10\4\ Skeletonema cells/ml of test 
solution. The algae should be exposed to each concentration of test 
chemical for up to 96 hours. The exposure period may be shortened if 
data suitable for the purposes of the range-finding test can be obtained 
in less time.
    (iv) Definitive testing is not necessary if the highest chemical 
concentration tested (water saturation concentration or 1000 mg/l) 
results in less than a 50 percent reduction in growth or if the lowest 
concentration tested (analytical detection limit) results in greater 
than a 50 percent reduction in growth.
    (4) Definitive test. (i) The purpose of the definitive test is to 
determine the concentration response curves, the EC<INF>10</INF>'s, 
EC<INF>50</INF>'s, and EC<INF>90</INF>'s for algal growth for each 
species tested, with a minimum amount of testing beyond the range-
finding test.
    (ii) Algae should be exposed to five or more concentrations of the 
test chemical in a geometric series in which the ratio is between 1.5 
and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 mg/l). Algae shall be placed in a 
minimum of three replicate test containers for each concentration of 
test chemical and control. More than three replicates may be required to 
provide sufficient quantities of test solution for determination of test 
substance concentration at the end of the test. Each test chamber should 
contain equal volumes of test solution and approximately 
1 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> Selenastrum cells/ml or 7.7 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> 
Skeletonema cells/ml of test solution. The chemical concentrations 
should result in greater than 90 percent of algal growth being inhibited 
or stimulated at the highest concentrations of test substance compared 
to controls.
    (iii) Every test shall include a control consisting of the same 
nutrient medium, conditions, procedures, and algae from the same 
culture, except that none of the test substance is added. If a carrier 
is present in any of the test chambers, a separate carrier control is 
required.
    (iv) The test begins when algae from 5- to 10-day-old stock cultures 
are placed in the test chambers containing test solutions having the 
appropriate concentrations of the test substance. Algal growth in 
controls should reach the logarithmic growth phase by 96 hours. If 
logarithmic growth cannot be demonstrated, the test shall be repeated. 
At the end of 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours the algal growth response (number 
or weight of algal cells/ml) in all test containers and controls shall 
be determined by an indirect (spectrophotometry, electronic cell 
counters, dry weight, etc.) or a direct (actual microscopic cell count) 
method. Indirect methods shall be calibrated by a direct microscopic 
count. The percentage inhibition or stimulation of growth for each 
concentration, EC<INF>10</INF>, EC<INF>50</INF>, EC<INF>90</INF> and the 
concentration-response curves are determined from these counts.
    (v) At the end of the definitive test, the following additional 
analyses of algal growth response shall be performed:
    (A) Determine whether the altered growth response between controls 
and

[[Page 103]]

test algae was due to a change in relative cell numbers, cell sizes or 
both. Also note any unusual cell shapes, color differences, 
flocculations, adherence of algae to test containers, or aggregation of 
algal cells.
    (B) In test concentrations where growth is maximally inhibited, 
algistatic effects may be differentiated from algicidal effects by the 
following two methods for Skeletonema and by the second method for 
Selenastrum.
    (1) Add 0.5 ml of a 0.1 percent solution (weight/volume) of Evans 
blue stain to a 1 milliliter aliquot of algae from a control container 
and to a 1 milliliter aliquot of algae from the test container having 
the lowest concentration of test chemical which completely inhibited 
algal growth (if algal growth was not completely inhibited, select an 
aliquot of algae for staining from the test container having the highest 
concentration of test chemical which inhibited algal growth). Wait 10 to 
30 minutes, examine microscopically, and determine the percent of the 
cells which stain blue (indicating cell mortality). A staining control 
shall be performed concurrently using heat-killed or formaldehyde-
preserved algal cells; 100 percent of these cells shall stain blue.
    (2) Remove 0.5 ml aliquots of test solution containing growth-
inhibited algae from each replicate test container having the 
concentration of test substance evaluated in paragraph (c)(4)(v)(B)(1) 
of this section. Combine these aliquots into a new test container and 
add a sufficient volume of fresh nutrient medium to dilute the test 
chemical to a concentration which does not affect growth. Incubate this 
subculture under the environmental conditions used in the definitive 
test for a period of up to 9 days, and observe for algal growth to 
determine if the algistatic effect noted after the 96-hour test is 
reversible. This subculture test may be discontinued as soon as growth 
occurs.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Analytical measurements--(i) Chemical. (A) Glass distilled or 
deionized water shall be used in the preparation of the nutrient medium. 
The pH of the test solution shall be measured in the control and test 
containers at the beginning and at the end of the definitive test. The 
concentration of test chemical in the test containers shall be 
determined at the beginning and end of the definitive test by standard 
analytical methods which have been validated prior to the test. An 
analytical method is unacceptable if likely degradation products of the 
chemical, such as hydrolysis and oxidation products, give positive or 
negative interference.
    (B) At the end of the test and after aliquots have been removed for 
algal growth-response determinations, microscopic examination, mortal 
staining, or subculturing, the replicate test containers for each 
chemical concentration may be pooled into one sample. An aliquot of the 
pooled sample may then be taken and the concentration of test chemical 
determined. In addition, the concentration of test chemical associated 
with the algae alone should be determined. Separate and concentrate the 
algal cells from the test solution by centrifuging or filtering the 
remaining pooled sample and measure the test substance concentration in 
the algal-cell concentrate.
    (ii) Numerical. Algal growth response (as percent of inhibition or 
stimulation in the test solutions compared to the controls) is 
calculated at the end of the test. Mean and standard deviation should be 
calculated and plotted for each treatment and control. Appropriate 
statistical analyses should provide a goodness-of-fit determination for 
the concentration response curves. The concentration response curves are 
plotted using the mean measured test solution concentrations obtained at 
the end of the test.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species. Species of algae recommended 
as test organisms for this test are the freshwater green alga, 
Selenastrum capricornutum, and the marine diatom, Skeletonema costatum. 
Algae to be used in acute toxicity tests may be initially obtained from 
commercial sources and subsequently cultured using sterile technique. 
Toxicity testing shall not be performed until algal cultures are shown 
to be actively growing (i.e., capable of logarithmic growth within the 
test period) in at least 2 subcultures lasting 7 days each prior to the 
start of

[[Page 104]]

the definitive test. All algae used for a particular test shall be from 
the same source and the same stock culture. Test algae shall not have 
been used in a previous test, either in a treatment or a control.
    (2) Facilities--(i) General. (A) Facilities needed to perform this 
test include: a growth chamber or a controlled environment room that can 
hold the test containers and will maintain the air temperature, lighting 
intensity and photoperiod specified in this test guideline; apparatus 
for culturing and enumerating algae; a source of distilled and/or 
deionized water; and apparatus for carrying out analyses of the test 
chemical.
    (B) Disposal facilities should be adequate to accommodate spent 
glassware, algae and test solutions at the end of the test and any bench 
covering, lab clothing, or other contaminated materials.
    (ii) Test containers. Erlenmeyer flasks should be used for test 
containers. The flasks may be of any volume between 125 and 500 ml as 
long as the same size is used throughout a test and the test solution 
volume does not exceed 50 percent of the flask volume.
    (iii) Cleaning and sterilization. New test containers may contain 
substances which inhibit growth of algae. They shall therefore be 
cleaned thoroughly and used several times to culture algae before being 
used in toxicity testing. All glassware used in algal culturing or 
testing shall be cleaned and sterilized prior to use according to 
standard good laboratory practices.
    (iv) Conditioning. Test containers should be conditioned by a rinse 
with the appropriate test solutions prior to the start of the test. 
Decant and add fresh test solutions after an appropriate conditioning 
period for the test chemical.
    (v) Nutrient medium. (A) Formulation and sterilization of nutrient 
medium used for algal culture and preparation of test solutions should 
conform to those currently recommended by the U.S. EPA for freshwater 
and marine algal bioassays. No chelating agents are to be included in 
the nutrient medium used for test solution preparation. Nutrient medium 
should be freshly prepared for algal testing and may be dispensed in 
appropriate volumes in test containers and sterilized by autoclaving or 
filtration. The pH of the nutrient medium shall be 7.5 (<plus-minus>0.1) 
for Selenastrum and 8.1 (<plus-minus>0.1) for Skeletonema at the start 
of the test and may be adjusted prior to test chemical addition with 
0.1N NaOH or HC1.
    (B) Dilution water used for preparation of nutrient medium and test 
solutions should be filtered, deionized or glass distilled. Saltwater 
for marine algal nutrient medium and test solutions should be prepared 
by adding a commercial, synthetic, sea salt formulation or a modified 
synthetic seawater formulation to distilled/deionized water to a 
concentration of 30 parts per thousand.
    (vi) Carriers. Nutrient medium shall be used in making stock 
solutions of the test chemical. If a carrier other than nutrient medium 
is absolutely necessary to dissolve the chemical, the volume used shall 
not exceed the minimum volume necessary to dissolve or suspend the 
chemical in the test solution.
    (3) Test parameters. (i) The test temperature shall be 24  deg.C for 
Selenastrum and 20  deg.C for Skeletonema. Excursions from the test 
temperature shall be no greater than <plus-minus>2  deg.C. Temperature 
should be recorded hourly during the test.
    (ii) Test chambers containing Selenastrum shall be illuminated 
continuously and those containing Skeletonema shall be provided a 14-
hour light and 10-hour dark photoperiod with a 30 minute transition 
period under fluorescent lamps providing 300 <plus-minus> 25 uEin/m\2\ 
sec (approximately 400 ft-c) measured adjacent to the test chambers at 
the level of test solution.
    (iii) Stock algal cultures should be shaken twice daily by hand. 
Test containers shall be placed on a rotary shaking apparatus and 
oscillated at approximately 100 cycles/minute for Selenastrum and at 
approximately 60 cycles/minute for Skeletonema during the test. The rate 
of oscillation should be determined at least once daily during testing.
    (iv) The pH of nutrient medium in which algae are subcultured shall 
be 7.5 (<plus-minus>0.1) for Selenastrum and 8.1 (<plus-minus>0.1) for 
Skeletonema, and is not adjusted after the addition of the algae. The pH 
of all

[[Page 105]]

test solutions shall be measured at the beginning and end of the test.

Sec. 797.1300  Daphnid acute toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data 
on the acute toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures 
(``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test regulations under 
the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003, 
15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes an acute toxicity 
test in which daphnids (Daphnia magna or D. pulex) are exposed to a 
chemical in static and flow-through systems. The United States 
Environmental Protection Agency will use data from this test in 
assessing the hazard a chemical may present in the aquatic environment.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and part 792--Good Laboratory Practice 
Standards of this chapter apply to this test guideline. In addition, the 
following definitions apply to this guideline:
    (1) Brood stock means the animals which are cultured to produce test 
organisms through reproduction.
    (2) EC<INF>50</INF> means that experimentally derived concentration 
of test substance in dilution water that is calculated to affect 50 
percent of a test population during continuous exposure over a specified 
period of time. In this guideline, the effect measured is 
immobilization.
    (3) Ephippium means a resting egg which develops under the carapace 
in response to stress conditions in daphnids.

[[Page 106]]

    (4) Flow-through means a continuous or an intermittent passage of 
test solution or dilution water through a test chamber or culture tank 
with no recycling.
    (5) Immobilization means the lack of movement by the test organisms 
except for minor activity of the appendages.
    (6) Loading means the ratio of daphnid biomass (grams, wet weight) 
to the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber at a point in 
time, or passing through the test chamber during a specific interval.
    (7) Static system means a test system in which the test solution and 
test organisms are placed in the test chamber and kept there for the 
duration of the test without renewal of the test solution.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) Test chambers are 
filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. In the flow-through 
test, the flow of dilution water through each chamber is adjusted to the 
rate desired. The test chemical is introduced into each treatment 
chamber. The addition of test chemical in the flow-through system is 
conducted at a rate which is sufficient to establish and maintain the 
desired concentration in the test chamber. The test is started within 30 
minutes after the test chemical has been added and uniformly distributed 
in static test chambers or after the concentration of test chemical in 
each flow-through test chamber reaches the prescribed level and remains 
stable. At the initiation of the test, daphnids which have been cultured 
and acclimated in accordance with the test design are randomly placed 
into the test chambers. Daphnids in the test chambers are observed 
periodically during the test, the immobile daphnids removed, and the 
findings recorded.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, the 
concentration of test chemical and other water quality parameters are 
measured at specified intervals in selected test chambers. Data are 
collected during the test to develop concentration-response curves and 
determine EC<INF>50</INF> values for the test chemical.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Range-finding test. (i) A range-finding test should be conducted 
to establish test solution concentrations for the definitive test.
    (ii) The daphnids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced 
concentrations of the test chemical (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/1, etc.), 
usually under static conditions.
    (iii) A minimum of five daphnids should be exposed to each 
concentration of test chemical for a period of 48 hours. The exposure 
period may be shortened if data suitable for the purpose of the range-
finding test can be obtained in less time. No replicates are required 
and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.
    (4) Definitive test. (i) The purpose of the definitive test is to 
determine the concentration-response curves and the 24- and 48-hour 
EC<INF>50</INF> values with the minimum amount of testing beyond the 
range-finding test.
    (ii) A minimum of 20 daphnids per concentration shall be exposed to 
five or more concentrations of the chemical chosen in a geometric series 
in which the ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 
mg/l). An equal number of daphnids shall be placed in two or more 
replicates. If solvents, solubilizing agents or emulsifiers have to be 
used, they shall be commonly used carriers and shall not possess a 
synergistic or antagonistic effect on the toxicity of the test chemical. 
The concentration of solvent should not exceed 0.1 mg/l. The 
concentration ranges shall be selected to determine the concentration-
response curves and EC<INF>50</INF> values at 24 and 48 hours. 
Concentration of test chemical in test solutions should be analyzed 
prior to use.
    (iii) Every test shall include controls consisting of the same 
dilution water, conditions, procedures and daphnids from the same 
population (culture container), except that none of the chemical is 
added.
    (iv) The dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature and pH shall be 
measured at the beginning and end of the test in each chamber.
    (v) The test duration is 48 hours. The test is unacceptable if more 
than 10 percent of the control organisms are immobilized during the 48-
hour test period. Each test chamber shall be

[[Page 107]]

checked for immobilized daphnids at 24 and 48 hours after the beginning 
of the test. Concentration-response curves and 24-hour and 48-hour 
EC<INF>50</INF> values for immobilization shall be determined along with 
their 95 percent confidence limits.
    (vi) In addition to immobility, any abnormal behavior or appearance 
shall also be reported.
    (vii) Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test 
chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias 
from the distributions. In addition, test chambers within the testing 
area shall be positioned in a random manner or in a way in which 
appropriate statistical analyses can be used to determine the variation 
due to placement.
    (viii) The concentration of the test chemical in the chambers should 
be measured as often as is feasible during the test. In the static test 
the concentration of test chemical shall be measured, at a minimum, at 
the beginning of the test and at the end of the test in each test 
chamber. In the flow-through test the concentration of test chemical 
shall be measured at a minimum:
    (A) In each chamber at the beginning of the test and at 48 hours 
after the start of the test;
    (B) In at least one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is 
detected in any part of the test substance delivery system.

Among replicate test chambers of a treatment concentration, the measured 
concentration of the test chemical shall not vary more than 
<plus-minus>20 percent.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Analytical measurements. (i) Test chemical. Deionized water 
should be used in making stock solutions of the test chemical. Standard 
analytical methods should be used whenever available in performing the 
analyses. The analytical method used to measure the amount of test 
chemical in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test by 
appropriate laboratory practices. Any analytical method is not 
acceptable if likely degradation products of the test chemical, such as 
hydrolysis and oxidation products, give positive or negative 
interferences which cannot be systematically identified and corrected 
mathematically.
    (ii) Numerical. The number of immobilized daphnids shall be counted 
during each definitive test. Appropriate statistical analyses should 
provide a goodness-of-fit determination for the concentration-response 
curves. A 24- and 48-hour EC<INF>50</INF> and corresponding 95 percent 
interval shall be calculated.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species--(i) Selection. (A) The 
cladocerans, Daphnia magna or D. pulex, are the test species to be used 
in this test. Either species may be used for testing of a particular 
chemical. The species identity of the test organisms should be verified 
using appropriate systematic keys. First instar daphnids, <ls-thn-eq>24 
hours old, are to be used to start the test.
    (B) Daphnids to be used in acute toxicity tests should be cultured 
at the test facility. Records should be kept regarding the source of the 
initial stock and culturing techniques. All organisms used for a 
particular test shall have originated from the same culture population.
    (C) Daphnids shall not be used for a test (1) if cultures contain 
ephippia; (2) if adults in the cultures do not produce young before day 
12; (3) if more than 20 percent of the culture stock die during the 2 
days preceding the test; (4) if adults in the culture do not produce an 
average of at least 3 young per adult per day over the 7-day period 
prior to the test and (5) if daphnids have been used in any portion of a 
previous test, either in a treatment or in a control.
    (ii) Acclimation. (A) Brood daphnids shall be maintained in 100-
percent dilution water at the test temperature for at least 48 hours 
prior to the start of the test. This is easily accomplished by culturing 
them in the dilution water at the test temperature. During production of 
neonates, daphnids should not be fed.
    (B) During culturing and acclimation to the dilution water, daphnids 
should be maintained in facilities with background colors and light 
intensities similar to those of the testing area.
    (iii) Care and handling. (A) Daphnids should be cultured in dilution 
water under similar environmental conditions to those used in the test. 
Organisms should be handled as little as

[[Page 108]]

possible. When handling is necessary it should be done as gently, 
carefully, and quickly as possible. During culturing and acclimation, 
daphnids should be observed carefully for ephippia and other signs of 
stress, physical damage and mortality. Dead and abnormal individuals 
shall be discarded. Organisms that touch dry surfaces or are dropped or 
injured in handling shall be discarded.
    (B) Smooth glass tubes (I.D. greater than 5 mm) equipped with rubber 
bulb should be used for transferring daphnids with minimal culture media 
carry-over. Care should be exercised to introduce the daphnids below the 
surface of any solution to avoid trapping air under the carapace.
    (iv) Feeding. A variety of foods (e.g., unicellular green algae) 
have been demonstrated to be adequate for daphnid culture. Daphnids 
shall not be fed during testing.
    (2) Facilities--(i) Apparatus. (A) Facilities needed to perform this 
test include: (1) Containers for culturing and acclimating daphnids; (2) 
a mechanism for controlling and maintaining the water temperature during 
the culturing, acclimation, and test periods; (3) apparatus for 
straining particulate matter, removing gas bubbles, or aerating the 
water as necessary; and (4) an apparatus for providing a 16-hour light 
and 8-hour dark photoperiod with a 15 to 30 minute transition period. In 
addition, the flow-through system shall contain appropriate test 
chambers in which to expose daphnids to the test chemical and an 
appropriate test substance delivery system.
    (B) Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and 
disturbances that may affect the test organisms.
    (C) Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of 
test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the 
entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.
    (ii) Construction materials. (A) Materials and equipment that 
contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test 
chemicals from the dilution water and should not contain substances that 
can be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect the 
test results.
    (B) For static tests, daphnids can be conveniently exposed to the 
test chemical in 250 ml beakers or other suitable containers.
    (C) For flow-through tests, daphnids can be exposed in glass or 
stainless steel containers with stainless steel or nylon screen bottoms. 
The containers should be suspended in the test chamber in such a manner 
to insure that the test solution flows regularly into and out of the 
container and that the daphnids are always submerged in at least 5 
centimeters of test solution. Test chambers can be constructed using 250 
ml beakers or other suitable containers equipped with screened overflow 
holes, standpipes or V-shaped notches.
    (iii) Dilution water. (A) Surface or ground water, reconstituted 
water or dechlorinated tap water are acceptable as dilution water if 
daphnids will survive in it for the duration of the culturing, 
acclimation and testing periods without showing signs of stress. The 
quality of the dilution water should be constant and should meet the 
following specifications:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Substance                      Maximum concentration   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Particulate matter........................  20 mg/liter.                
Total organic carbon or...................  2 mg/liter.                 
      Chemical oxygen demand..............  5 mg/liter.                 
Un-ionized ammonia........................  1 <greek-m>g/liter.         
Residual chlorine.........................  <3 <greek-m>g/liter.        
Total organophosphorus pesticides.........  50 ng/liter.                
Total organochlorine pesticides plus        50 ng/liter.                
 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or.                                   
Organic chlorine..........................  25 ng/liter.                
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) The above water quality parameters under paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall be measured at least twice a year 
or whenever it is suspected that these characteristics may have changed 
significantly. If dechlorinated tap water is used, daily chlorine 
analysis shall be performed.
    (C) If the diluent water is from a ground or surface water source, 
conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) or chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) shall be measured. Reconstituted water can be made by adding 
specific amounts of reagent-grade chemicals to deionized or distilled 
water.

[[Page 109]]

Glass distilled or carbon-filtered deionized water with a conductivity 
less than 1 <greek-m>ohm/cm is acceptable as the diluent for making 
reconstituted water.
    (iv) Cleaning. All test equipment and test chambers shall be cleaned 
before each use using standard laboratory procedures.
    (v) Test substance delivery system. In flow-through tests, 
proportional diluters, metering pump systems, or other suitable devices 
should be used to deliver test chemical to the test chambers. The system 
shall be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining 
the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test 
chemical in each chamber. The general operation of the test substance 
delivery system should be checked twice during a test. The 24-hour flow 
through a test chamber shall be equal to at least 5 times the volume of 
the test chamber. During a test, the flow rates should not vary more 
than 10 percent from any one test chamber to another.
    (3) Test parameters. Environmental parameters of the water contained 
in test chambers shall be maintained as specified below:
    (i) The test temperature shall be 20  deg.C. Excursions from the 
test temperature shall be no greater than <plus-minus>2  deg.C.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent 
saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done 
before the addition of the test chemical. All treatment and control 
chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.
    (iii) The number of daphnids placed in a test chamber shall not 
affect test results. Loading shall not exceed 40 daphnids per liter test 
solution in the static system. In the flow-through test, loading limits 
will vary depending on the flow rate of dilution water. Loading shall 
not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below the 
recommended levels.
    (iv) Photoperiod of 16 hours light and 8 hours darkness.
    (e) Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the U.S. EPA all data 
developed by the test that are suggestive or predictive of acute 
toxicity and all concomitant gross toxicological manifestations. In 
addition to the reporting requirements prescribed in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter, the reporting of test 
data shall include the following:

the chambers, the way the test was begun (e.g., conditioning, test 
chemical additions), the number of test organisms per test chamber, the 
number of replicates per treatment, the lighting, the method of test 
chemical introduction or the test substance delivery system and the flow 
rate (in flow-through test) expressed as volume additions per 24 hours.

periodically transferred to fresh test solution of the same composition.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) Test chambers are 
filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. In the flow-through 
test the flow of dilution water through each chamber is then adjusted to 
the rate desired. The test substance is introduced into each test 
chamber. The addition of test substance in the flow-through system is 
done at a rate which is sufficient to establish and maintain the desired 
concentration of test substance in the test chamber.
    (ii) The test is started within 30 minutes after the test substance 
has been added and uniformly distributed in the test chambers in the 
renewal test or after the concentration of test substance in each test 
chamber of the flow-through test system reaches the prescribed level and

Concentration-response curves, EC<INF>50</INF> values and associated 95 
percent confidence limits for adult immobilization shall be determined 
for day 21. An MATC shall be determined for the most sensitive test

per adult, and number of immobilized young per adult).
    (vi) In addition to immobility, any abnormal behavior or appearance 
shall also be reported.
    (vii) Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test 
chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias

due to placement.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Analytical measurements. (i) Test chemical. Deionized water 
should be used in making stock solutions of the test substance. Standard

Appropriate statistical tests (e.g., analysis of variance, mean 
separation test) should be used to test for significant chemical effects 
on chronic test criteria (cumulative number of immobilized adults, 
cumulative number of offspring per adult and cumulative number of 
immobilized offspring per adult) on day 21. An MATC shall be calculated 
using these chronic test criteria.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species--(i) Selection. (A) The 
cladocerans, Daphnia magna or D. pulex, are the species to be used in 
this test. Either species can be utilized for testing of a particular 
chemical. The species identity of the test organisms should be verified 
using appropriate systematic keys.
    (B) First instar daphnids, <ls-thn-eq>24 hours old, are to be used 
to start the test.
    (ii) Acquisition. (A) Daphnids to be used in chronic toxicity tests 
should be cultured at the test facility. Records should be kept 
regarding the source of the initial stock and culturing techniques. All 
organisms used for a particular test shall have originated from the same 
culture population.
    (B) Daphnids shall not be used for a test if:
    (1) Cultures contain ephippia.
    (2) Adults in the cultures do not produce young before day 12.
    (3) More than 20 percent of the culture stock die in the 2 days 
preceding the test.
    (4) Adults in the culture do not produce an average of at least 3 
young per adult per day over the 7-day period prior to the test.
    (5) Daphnids have been used in any portion of a previous test either 
in a treatment or in a control.
    (iii) Feeding. (A) During the test the daphnids shall be fed the 
same diet and with the same frequency as that used for culturing and 
acclimation. All treatments and control(s) shall receive, as near as 
reasonably possible, the same ration of food on a per-animal basis.
    (B) The food concentration depends on the type used. Food 
concentrations should be sufficient to support normal growth and 
development and to allow for asexual (parthenogenic) reproduction. For 
automatic feeding devices, a suggested rate is 5 to 7 mg food (either 
solids or algal cells, dry weight) per liter dilution water or test 
solution. For manual once-a-day feeding, a suggested rate is 15 mg food 
(dry weight) per liter dilution water or test solution.
    (iv) Loading. The number of test organisms placed in a test chamber 
shall not affect test results. Loading shall not exceed 40 daphnids per 
liter in the renewal system. In the flow-through test, loading limits 
will vary depending on the flow rate of the dilution water. Loading 
shall not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below the 
recommended level.
    (v) Care and handling of test organisms. (A) Daphnids should be 
cultured in dilution water under similar environmental conditions to 
those used in the test. A variety of foods have been demonstrated to be 
adequate for daphnid culture. They include algae, yeasts and a variety 
of mixtures.
    (B) Organisms should be handled as little as possible. When handling 
is necessary it should be done as gently, carefully, and quickly as 
possible. During culturing and acclimation, daphnids should be observed 
carefully for ephippia and other signs of stress, physical damage, and 
mortality. Dead and abnormal individuals shall be discarded. Organisms 
that touch dry surfaces or are dropped or injured during handling shall 
be discarded.
    (C) Smooth glass tubes (I.D. greater than 5mm) equipped with a 
rubber bulb can be used for transferring daphnids with minimal culture 
media carry-over.
    (D) Care should be exercised to introduce the daphnids below the 
surface of any solution so as not to trap air under the carapace.
    (vi) Acclimation. (A) Brood daphnids shall be maintained in 100 
percent dilution water at the test temperature for at least 48 hours 
prior to the start of the test. This is easily accomplished by culturing 
them in dilution water at the test temperature. During acclimation, 
daphnids shall be fed the same food as will be used for the definitive 
test.
    (B) During culturing and acclimation to the dilution water, daphnids 
should

[[Page 113]]

be maintained in facilities with background colors and light intensities 
similar to those of the testing area.
    (2) Facilities--(i) General. (A) Facilities needed to perform this 
test include:
    (1) Containers for culturing and acclimating daphnids.
    (2) A mechanism for controlling and maintaining the water 
temperature during the culturing, acclimation and test periods.
    (3) Apparatus for straining particulate matter, removing gas 
bubbles, or aerating the water when water supplies contain particulate 
matter, gas bubbles, or insufficient dissolved oxygen, respectively.
    (4) An apparatus for providing a 16-hour light and 8-hour dark 
photoperiod.
    (5) An apparatus to introduce food if continuous or intermittent 
feeding is used.
    (6) In addition, the flow-through test shall contain appropriate 
test chambers in which to expose daphnids to the test substance and an 
appropriate test substance delivery system.
    (B) Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and other 
disturbances that may affect the test organisms.
    (ii) Test chambers. (A) Materials and equipment that contact test 
solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals from 
the dilution water and should not contain substances that can be leached 
into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect test results.
    (B) For renewal tests, daphnids can be conveniently exposed to the 
test solution in 250 ml beakers or other suitable containers.
    (C) For flow-through tests daphnids can be exposed in glass or 
stainless steel containers with stainless steel or nylon screen bottoms. 
Such containers shall be suspended in the test chamber in such a manner 
to ensure that the test solution flows regularly into and out of the 
container and that the daphnids are always submerged in at least 5 
centimeters of test solution. Test chambers can be constructed using 250 
ml beakers or other suitable containers equipped with screened overflow 
holes, standpipes or V-shaped notches.
    (D) Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of 
test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the 
entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.
    (iii) Test substance delivery system. (A) In the flow-through test, 
proportional diluters, metering pump systems or other suitable systems 
should be used to deliver the test substance to the test chambers.
    (B) The test substance delivery system shall be calibrated before 
each test. Calibration includes determining the flow rate through each 
chamber and the concentration of the test substance in each chamber. The 
general operation of the test substance delivery system should be 
checked twice daily during a test. The 24-hour flow rate through a test 
chamber shall be equal to at least five times the volume of the test 
chamber. During a test, the flow rates shall not vary more than 10 
percent from any one test chamber to another. For the renewal test, test 
substance dilution water shall be completely replaced at least once 
every 3 days.
    (iv) Dilution water. (A) Surface or ground water, reconstituted 
water, or dechlorinated tap water are acceptable as dilution water if 
daphnids will survive in it for the duration of the culturing, 
acclimation, and testing periods without showing signs of stress. The 
quality of the dilution water should be constant and should meet the 
following specificiations:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Substance                      Maximum concentration   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Particulate matter.........................  20 mg/l.                   
Total organic carbon or....................  2 mg/l.                    
      Chemical oxygen demand...............  5 mg/l.                    
Un-ionized ammonia.........................  20 <greek-m>g/l.           
Residual chlorine..........................  <3 <greek-m>g/l.           
Total organophosphorus pesticides..........  50 ng/l.                   
Total organochlorine pesticides plus         50 ng/l.                   
 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).                                      
      or organic chlorine..................  25 ng/l.                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) The water quality characteristics listed above shall be measured 
at least twice a year or when it is suspected that these characteristics 
may have changed significantly. If dechlorinated

[[Page 114]]

tap water is used, daily chlorine analysis shall be performed.
    (C) If the diluent water is from a ground or surface water source, 
conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) or chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) shall be measured. Reconstituted water can be made by adding 
specific amounts of reagent-grade chemicals to deionized or distilled 
water. Glass distilled or carbon filtered deionized water with a 
conductivity of less than 1 microohm/cm is acceptable as the diluent for 
making reconstituted water.
    (D) If the test substance is not soluble in water an appropriate 
carrier should be used.
    (v) Cleaning of test system. All test equipment and test chambers 
shall be cleaned before each use following standard laboratory 
procedures. Cleaning of test chambers may be necessary during the 
testing period.
    (3) Test parameters. (i) Environmental conditions of the water 
contained in test chambers should be maintained as specified in this 
paragraph:
    (A) The test temperature shall be 20  deg.C. Excursions from the 
test temperature shall be no greater than <plus-minus>2  deg.C.
    (B) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent 
saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done 
before the addition of the test substance. All treatment and control 
chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.
    (C) Photoperiod of 16-hours light and 8-hours darkness.
    (ii) Additional measurements include:
    (A) The concentration of the test substance in the chambers shall be 
measured during the test.
    (B) At a minimum, the concentration of test substance should be 
measured as follows:
    (1) In each chamber before the test.
    (2) In each chamber on days 7, 14, and 21 of the test.
    (3) In at least one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is 
detected in any part of the test substance delivery system. Equal 
aliquots of test solution may be removed from each replicate chamber and 
pooled for analysis. Among replicate test chambers of a treatment 
concentration, the measured concentration of the test substance should 
not vary more than 20 percent.
    (4) An apparatus for providing a 16-hour light and 8-hour dark 
photoperiod.
    (C) The dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature and pH shall be 
measured at the beginning of the test and on days 7, 14, and 21 in at 
least two chambers of the high, middle, low, and control test 
concentrations.
    (e) Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency all data developed by the test that are suggestive or 
predictive of chronic toxicity and all associated toxicologic 
manifestations. In addition to the reporting requirements prescribed in 
the part 792--Good Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter the 
reporting of test data shall include the following:
    (1) The name of the test, sponsor, testing laboratory, study 
director, principal investigator, and dates of testing.
    (2) A detailed description of the test substance including its 
source, lot number, composition (identity and concentration of major 
ingredients and major impurities), known physical and chemical 
properties, and any carriers or other additives used and their 
concentrations.
    (3) The source of the dilution water, its chemical characteristics 
(e.g., conductivity, hardness, pH), and a description of any 
pretreatment.
    (4) Detailed information about the daphnids used as brood stock, 
including the scientific name and method of verification, age, source, 
treatments, feeding history, acclimation procedures, and culture 
methods. The age of the daphnids used in the test shall be reported.
    (5) A description of the test chambers, the volume of solution in 
the chambers, the way the test was begun (e.g., conditioning, test 
substance additions), the number of test organisms per test chamber, the 
number of replicates per treatment, the lighting, the renewal process 
and schedule for the renewal chronic test, the test substance delivery 
system and flow rate expressed as volume additions per 24 hours for the 
flow-through chronic

[[Page 115]]

test, and the method of feeding (manual or continuous) and type of food.
    (6) The concentration of the test substance in test chambers at 
times designated for renewal and flow-through tests.
    (7) The number and percentage of organisms that show any adverse 
effect in each test chamber at each observation period.
    (8) The cumulative adult and offspring immobilization values and the 
progeny produced at designated observation times, the time (days) to 
first brood and the number of offspring per adult in the control 
replicates and in each treatment replicate.
    (9) All chemical analyses of water quality and test substance 
concentrations, including methods, method validations and reagent 
blanks.
    (10) The data records of the culture, acclimation, and test 
temperatures.
    (11) Any deviation from this test guideline, and anything unusual 
about the test, (e.g., dilution failure, temperature fluctuations).
    (12) The MATC to be reported is calculated as the geometric mean 
between the lowest measured test substance concentration that had a 
significant (p<ls-thn-eq>0.05) effect and the highest measured test 
substance concentration that had no significant (p<ls-thn-eq>0.05) 
effect on day 21 of the test. The most sensitive of the test criteria 
(number of adult animals immobilized, the number of young per female and 
the number of immobilized young per female) is used to calculate the 
MATC. The criterion selected for MATC computation is the one which 
exhibits an effect (a statistically significant difference between 
treatment and control groups; p<ls-thn-eq>0.05) at the lowest test 
substance concentration for the shortest period of exposure. Appropriate 
statistical tests (analysis of variance, mean separation test) shall be 
used to test for significant test substance effects. The statistical 
tests employed and the results of these tests shall be reported.
    (13) Concentration-response curves utilizing the average measured 
test substance concentration shall be fitted to cumulative adult 
immobilization data at 21 days. A statistical test of goodness-of-fit 
shall be performed and the results reported.
    (14) An EC<INF>50</INF> value based on adult immobilization with 
corresponding 95 percent confidence limits when sufficient data are 
present for day 21. These calculations shall be made using the average 
measured concentration of the test substance.

<R05>
Sec. 797.1400  Fish acute toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline may be used to develop data on the acute 
toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures (``chemicals'') subject to 
environmental effects test regulations under the Toxic Substances 
Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et 
seq.). This guideline prescribes tests to be used to develop data on the 
acute toxicity of chemicals to fish. The United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) will use data from these tests in assessing the 
hazard of a chemical to the environment.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA), and the definitions in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter apply to this test 
guideline. The following definitions also apply to this guideline:
    (1) Acclimation means the physiological compensation by test 
organisms to new environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, hardness, 
pH).
    (2) Acute toxicity test means a method used to determine the 
concentration of a substance that produces a toxic effect on a specified 
percentage of test organisms in a short period of time (e.g., 96 hours). 
In this guideline, death is used as the measure of toxicity.
    (3) Carrier means a solvent used to dissolve a test substance prior 
to delivery to the test chamber.
    (4) Conditioning means the exposure of construction materials, test 
chambers, and testing apparatus to dilution water or to test solutions 
prior to the start of a test in order to minimize the sorption of the 
test substance onto the test facilities or the leaching of substances 
from the test facilities into the dilution water or test solution.
    (5) Death means the lack of opercular movement by a test fish.

[[Page 116]]

    (6) Flow-through means a continuous or an intermittent passage of 
test solution or dilution water through a test chamber, or a holding or 
acclimation tank with no recycling.
    (7) Incipient LC<INF>50</INF> means that test substance 
concentration, calculated from experimentally-derived mortality data, 
that is lethal to 50 percent of a test population when exposure to the 
test substance is continued until the mean increase in mortality does 
not exceed 10 percent in any concentration over a 24-hour period.
    (8) LC<INF>50</INF> means that test substance concentration, 
calculated from experimentally-derived mortality data, that is lethal to 
50 percent of a test population during continuous exposure over a 
specified period of time.
    (9) Loading means the ratio of fish biomass (grams, wet weight) to 
the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber or passing 
through it in a 24-hour period.
    (10) Static means the test solution is not renewed during the period 
of the test.
    (11) Test solution means the test substance and the dilution water 
in which the test substance is dissolved or suspended.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) Test chambers are 
filled with appropriate volumes of dilution water. If a flow-through 
test is performed, the flow of dilution water through each chamber is 
adjusted to the rate desired.
    (ii) The test substance is introduced into each test chamber. In a 
flow-through test, the amount of test substance which is added to the 
dilution water is adjusted to establish and maintain the desired 
concentration of test substance in each test chamber.
    (iii) Test fish which have been acclimated in accordance with the 
test design are introduced into the test and control chambers by 
stratified random assignment.
    (iv) Fish in the test and control chambers are observed periodically 
during the test; dead fish are removed at least twice each day and the 
findings are recorded.
    (v) The dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature and the 
concentration of test substance are measured at intervals in selected 
test chambers.
    (vi) Concentration-response curves and LC<INF>50</INF> values for 
the test substance are developed from the mortality data collected 
during the test.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Range finding test. If the toxicity of the test substance is not 
already known, a range finding test should be performed to determine the 
range of concentrations to be used in the definitive test. The highest 
concentration of test substance for use in the range finding test should 
not exceed its solubility in water or the permissible amount of the 
carrier used.
    (4) Definitive test. (i) A minimum of 20 fish should be exposed to 
each of five or more test substance concentrations. The range of 
concentrations to which the fish are exposed should be such that in 96 
hours there are at least two partial mortality exposures bracketing 50 
percent survival.
    (ii) For exposure to each concentration of a test substance, an 
equal number of test fish shall be placed in two or more replicate test 
chambers. Test fish shall be impartially distributed among test chambers 
in such a manner that test results show no significant bias from the 
distributions.
    (iii) Every test shall include a control consisting of the same 
dilution water, conditions, procedures, and fish from the same group 
used in the test, except that none of the test substance is added.
    (iv) Mortality data collected during the test are used to calculate 
a 96-hour LC<INF>50</INF>. The 24-, 48-, and 72-hour values should be 
calculated whenever there is sufficient mortality data to determine such 
values. If the 96-hour LC<INF>50</INF> is less than 50 percent of the 
estimated 48-hour LC<INF>50</INF> in a flow-through test, the test shall 
be continued until the mean increase in mortality at any test 
concentration does not exceed 10 percent over a 24-hour period or until 
14 days.
    (v) Test fish shall not be fed while they are being exposed to the 
test substance under static conditions or during the first 96 hours of 
flow-through testing. If the test continues past 96 hours, the fish 
should be fed a suitable food at a maintenance level every other day 
beginning on test day 5. Any

[[Page 117]]

excess food and the fecal material should be removed when observed.
    (5) Test results. (i) Death is the primary criterion used in this 
test guideline to evaluate the toxicity of the test substance.
    (ii) In addition to death, any abnormal behavior such as, but not 
limited to, erratic swimming, loss of reflex, increased excitability, 
lethargy, or any changes in appearance or physiology such as 
discoloration, excessive mucous production, hyperventilation, opaque 
eyes, curved spine, or hemorrhaging shall be recorded.
    (iii) Observations on compound solubility shall be recorded. The 
investigator shall report the appearance of surface slicks, 
precipitates, or material adhering to the sides of the test chamber.
    (iv) Each test and control chamber shall be checked for dead fish 
and observations recorded at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the 
beginning of the test or within one hour of the designated times. If the 
test is continued past 96 hours, additional observations shall be made 
every 24 hours until termination.
    (v) The mortality data is used to calculate LC<INF>50</INF>'s and 
their 95 percent confidence limits, and to plot concentration-response 
curves for each time interval whenever sufficient data exists. The 
methods recommended for use in calculating LC<INF>50</INF>'s include 
probit, logit, binomial, and moving average angle.
    (vi) A test is unacceptable if more than 10 percent of the control 
fish die or exhibit abnormal behavior during a 96-hour test. If a flow-
through test is continued past 96 hours, the maximum allowable 
additional mortality is 10 percent.
    (6) Analytical measurements--(i) Water quality analysis. (A) The 
hardness, acidity, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, TOC or COD, and 
particulate matter of the dilution water should be measured at the 
beginning of each static test and at the beginning and end of each flow-
through test. The month to month variation of the above values should be 
less than 10 percent and the pH should vary less than 0.4 units.
    (B) During static tests, the dissolved oxygen concentration, 
temperature, and pH shall be measured in each test chamber at the 
beginning and end of the test. The test solution volume shall not be 
reduced by more than 10 percent as a result of these measurements.
    (C) During flow-through tests, dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH 
measurements shall be made in each chamber at the beginning and end of 
the test.
    (ii) Collection of samples for measurement of test substance. Test 
solution samples to be analyzed for the test substance should be taken 
midway between the top, bottom, and sides of the test chamber. These 
samples should not include any surface scum or material dislodged from 
the bottom or sides. Samples should be analyzed immediately or handled 
and stored in a manner which minimizes loss of test substance through 
microbial degradation, photodegradation, chemical reaction, 
volatilization, or sorption.
    (iii) Measurement of test substance. (A) For static tests, the 
concentration of the test substance shall be measured at a minimum in 
each test chamber at each test concentration at the beginning (0-hour, 
before fish are added) and at the end of the test. During flow-through 
tests, the concentration of test substance shall be measured as follows:
    (1) In at least the chamber of each test concentration at 0-hour.
    (2) In at least the chamber of each test concentration at 96-hours 
and every 4 days thereafter, as long as the test is continued.
    (3) In at least one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is 
detected in any part of the test substance delivery system.
    (4) Equal aliquots of test solution may be removed from each 
replicate chamber and pooled for analysis.
    (B) Filters and their holders used for determining the dissolved 
test substance concentrations should be prewashed with several volumes 
of distilled water and undergo a final rinse with test solution. Glass 
or stainless steel filter holders are best for organic test substances, 
while plastic holders are best for metals. The sample should be filtered 
within 30 minutes after it is taken from the test chamber.
    (C) The analytical methods used to measure the amount of test 
substance in a sample shall be validated before

[[Page 118]]

beginning the test. The accuracy of a method should be verified by a 
method such as using known additions. This involves adding a known 
amount of the test substance to three water samples taken from a chamber 
containing dilution water and the same number and species of fish as are 
used in the test. The nominal concentration of the test substance in 
those samples should span the concentration range to be used in the 
test.
    (D) An analytical method is not acceptable if likely degradation 
products of the test substance give positive or negative interferences, 
unless it is shown that such degradation products are not present in the 
test chambers during the test.
    (E) In addition to analyzing samples of test solution, at least one 
reagent blank, containing all reagents used, should also be analyzed.
    (F) If the measured concentrations of dissolved test substance are 
considerably lower (e.g., <50 percent) than the nominal concentrations, 
the total test substance concentration should be measured in the highest 
test concentration.
    (G) Among replicate test chambers, the measured concentrations shall 
not vary more than 20 percent. The measured concentration of the test 
substance in any chamber during the test should not vary more than 30 
percent from the measured concentration at time 0.
    (H) The mean measured concentration of test substance shall be used 
to calculate all LC<INF>60</INF>'s and to plot all concentration-
response curves.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species--(i) Selection. The test 
species for this test are the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), bluegill 
(Lepomis macrochirus) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The 
particular species of fish to be used will be prescribed in the test 
rule.
    (ii) Age and condition of fish. (A) Juvenile fish shall be used. 
Fish used in a particular test shall be the same age and be of normal 
size and appearance for their age. The longest fish shall not be more 
than twice the length of the shortest.
    (B) All newly acquired fish should be quarantined and observed for 
at least 14 days prior to use in a test.
    (C) Fish shall not be used for a test if they appear stressed or if 
more than five percent die during the 48 hours immediately prior to the 
test.
    (iii) Acclimation of test fish. (A) If the holding water is not from 
the same source as the test dilution water, acclimation to the dilution 
water should be done gradually over a 48-hour period. The fish should 
then be held an additional 14 days in the dilution water prior to 
testing. Any changes in water temperature should not exceed 3  deg.C per 
day. Fish should be held for a minimum of 7 days at the test temperature 
prior to testing.
    (B) During the final 48-hours of acclimation, fish should be 
maintained in facilities with background colors and light intensities 
similar to those of the testing area and should not be fed.
    (2) Facilities--(i) General. Facilities needed to perform this test 
include:
    (A) Flow-through tanks for holding and acclimating fish.
    (B) A mechanism for controlling and maintaining the water 
temperature during the holding, acclimation and test periods.
    (C) Apparatus for straining particulate matter, removing gas 
bubbles, or insufficient dissolved oxygen, respectively.
    (D) Apparatus for providing a 16-hour light and 8-hour dark 
photoperiod with a 15- to 30-minute transition period.
    (E) Chambers for exposing test fish to the test substance.
    (F) A test substance delivery system for flow-through tests.
    (ii) Construction materials. Construction materials and commercially 
purchased equipment that may contact the stock solution, test solution, 
or dilution water should not contain substances that can be leached or 
dissolved into aqueous solutions in quantities that can alter the test 
results. Materials and equipment that contact stock or test solutions 
should be chosen to minimize sorption of test chemicals. Glass, 
stainless steel, and perfluorocarbon plastic should be used whenever 
possible. Concrete, fiberglass, or plastic (e.g., PVC) may be used for 
holding tanks, acclimation tanks, and water supply systems, but they 
should be used to remove rust particles. Rubber, copper, brass, 
galvanized metal,

[[Page 119]]

epoxy glues, and lead should not come in contact with the dilution 
water, stock solution, or test solution.
    (iii) Test substance delivery system. In flow-through tests, 
diluters, metering pump systems, or other suitable devices should be 
used to deliver the test substance to the test chambers. The system used 
should be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining 
the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test 
substance delivered to each chamber. The general operation of the test 
substance delivery system should be checked twice daily during a test. 
The 24-hour flow rate through a test chamber should be a minimum of 6 
tank volumes. During a test, the flow rates should not vary more than 10 
percent from one test chamber to another.
    (iv) Test chambers. Test chambers made of stainless steel should be 
welded, not soldered. Test chambers made of glass should be fused or 
bonded using clear silicone adhesive. As little adhesive as possible 
should be left exposed in the interior of the chamber.
    (v) Cleaning of test system. Test substance delivery systems and 
test chambers should be cleaned before each test. They should be washed 
with detergent and then rinsed in sequence with clean water, pesticide-
free acetone, clean water, and 5 percent nitric acid, followed by two or 
more changes of dilution water.
    (vi) Dilution water. (A) Clean surface or ground water reconstituted 
water, or dechlorinated tap water is acceptable as dilution water if the 
test fish will survive in it for the duration of the holding, 
acclimating, and testing periods without showing signs of stress, such 
as discoloration, hemorrhaging, disorientation or other unusual 
behavior. The quality of the dilution water should be constant and 
should meet the following specifications measured at least twice a year:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Substance                             Maximum          
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Particulate matter........................  20 mg/liter.                
Total organic carbon or...................  2 mg/liter.                 
      chemical oxygen demand..............  5 mg/liter.                 
Un-ionized ammonia........................  1 <greek-m>g/liter.         
Residual chlorine.........................  1 <greek-m>g/liter.         
Total organochloring pesticides...........  50 <greek-m>g/liter.        
Total organocholorine pesticides plus       50 <greek-m>g/liter.        
 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).                                      
      or organic chlorine.................  25 <greek-m>g/liter.        
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the dilution water 
should be between 90 and 100 percent saturation; 9.8 to 10.9 mg/l for 
tests with trout, and 8.0 to 8.9 mg/l for tests with bluegill or fathead 
minnow at sea level. If necessary, the dilution water can be aerated 
before the addition of the test substance. All reconstituted water 
should be aerated before use. Buffered soft water should be aerated 
before but not after the addition of buffers.
    (C) If disease organisms are present in the dilution water in 
sufficient numbers to cause infection, they should be killed or removed 
by suitable equipment.
    (D) Glass distilled or carbon filtered deionized water with a 
conductivity less than 1 micromho/cm is acceptable for use in making 
reconstituted water. If the reconstituted water is prepared from a 
ground or surface water source, conductivity, and total organic carbon 
(TOC) or chemical oxygen demand (COD) should be measured on each batch.
    (vii) Carriers. (A) Distilled water should be used in making stock 
solutions of the test substance. If the stock volume however is more 
than 10 percent of the test solution volume, dilution water should be 
used. If a carrier is absolutely necessary to dissolve the test 
substance, the volume used should not exceed the minimum volume 
necessary to dissolve or suspend the test substance in the test 
solution. If the test substance is a mixture, formulation, or commercial 
product, none of the ingredients is considered a carrier unless an extra 
amount is used to prepare the stock solution.
    (B) Triethylene glycol and dimethyl formamide are the prefered 
carriers, but acetone may also be used. The concentration of triethylene 
glycol in the test solution should not exceed 80 mg/1. The concentration 
of dimethyl formamide or acetone in the test solution should not exceed 
5.0 mg/1.
    (3) Test parameters--(i) Loading. The number of fish placed in a 
test chamber should not be so great as to affect the results of the 
test. The loading should not be so great that the test substance

[[Page 120]]

concentrations are decreased by more than 20 percent due to uptake by 
the fish. In static tests, loading should not exceed 0.5 grams of fish 
per liter of solution in the test chamber at any one time. In flow-
through tests loading should not exceed 0.5 grams of fish per liter of 
test solution passing through the chamber in 24 hours. These loading 
rates should be sufficient to maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration above the recommended levels and the ammonia concentration 
below 20 <greek-m>g/l.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration. (A) During static tests with 
rainbow trout the dissolved oxygen in each test chamber shall be greater 
than 5.5 mg/1. In tests with bluegill and fathead minnows, the DO shall 
be maintained above 4.5 mg/1.
    (B) During flow-through tests the dissolved oxygen concentration 
shall be maintained above 8.2 mg/1 in tests with trout and above 6.6 mg/
l in tests with bluegills or fathead minnows.
    (iii) Temperature. The test temperature shall be 22  deg.C for 
bluegill and fathead minnow and 12  deg.C for rainbow trout. Excursions 
from the test temperature shall be no greater than <plus-minus>2  deg.C. 
The temperature shall be measured at least hourly in one test chamber.
    (iv) Light. A 16-hour light and 8-hour dark photoperiod should be 
maintained.
    (e) Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the EPA all data 
developed by the test that are suggestive or predictive of toxicity. In 
addition to the reporting requirements prescribed in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter, the reported test data 
shall include the following:
    (1) The source of the dilution water, a description of any 
pretreatment, and the measured hardness, acidity, alkalinity, pH, 
conductivity, TOC or COD and particulate matter.

sampling periods.
    (8) The number of dead and live tests organisms, the percentage of

generated, the 24-, 48-, 72-, and incipient LC<INF>50</INF> values, 
their 95 percent confidence limits, and the methods used to calculate 
the LC<INF>50</INF> values and their confidence limits.

Sec. 797.1600  Fish early life stage toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline is intended to be used for assessing the 
propensity of chemical substances to produce adverse effects to fish 
during the early stages of their growth and development. This guideline 
describes the conditions and procedures for the continuous exposure of 
several representative species to a chemical substance

[[Page 121]]

during egg, fry and early juvenile life stages. The Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) will use data from this test in assessing the 
potential hazard of the test substance to the aquatic environment.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the definitions in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards, apply to this section. In addition, the

the solubility of the test substance in dilution water.
    (3) ``Conditioning'' exposure of construction materials, test

the test species is exposed.
    (6) ``Early life stage toxicity test'' a test to determine the 
minimum concentration of a substance which produces a statistically 
significant observable effect on hatching, survival, development and/or 
growth of a fish species continuously exposed during the period of their 
early development.
    (7) ``Embryo cup'' a small glass jar or similar container with a 
screened bottom in which the embryos of some species (i.e., minnow) are 
placed during the incubation period and which is normally oscillated to 
ensure a flow of water through the cup.
    (8) ``Flow through'' refers to the continuous or very frequent 
passage of fresh test solution through a test chamber with no recycling.

during a specific interval (normally a 24-hr. period).
    (11) ``No observed effect concentration (NOEC)'' the highest tested 
concentration in an acceptable early life stage test: (i) which did not 
cause the occurrence of any specified adverse effect (statistically 
different from the control at the 95 percent level); and (ii) below 
which no tested concentration caused such an occurrence.
    (12) ``Observed effect concentration (OEC)'' the lowest tested 
concentration in an acceptable early life stage test: (i) Which caused 
the occurrence of any specified adverse effect (statistically different 
from the control at the 95 percent level); and (ii) above which all 
tested concentrations caused such an occurrence.

organisms are maintained during exposure to test solution.
    (16) ``Test solution'' dilution water with a test substance 
dissolved or suspended in it.
    (17) ``Test substance'' the specific form of a chemical substance or 
mixture that is used to develop data.
    (c) Test Procedures--(1) Summary of test. (i) The early life stage 
toxicity test with fish involves exposure of newly fertilized embryos to 
various concentrations of a test substance. Exposure continues for 28 
days post hatch for the minnows and 60 days post hatch for the trout 
species. During this time

[[Page 122]]

various observations and measurements are made in a specific manner and 
schedule in order to determine the lowest effect and highest no-effect 
concentrations of the test substance.
    (ii) A minimum of five exposure (treatment) concentrations of a test 
substance and one control are required to conduct an early life stage 
toxicity test. The concentration of the test substance in each treatment 
is usually 50 percent of that in the next higher treatment level.
    (iii) For each exposure concentration of the test substance and for 
each control (i.e., regular control and carrier control is required) 
there shall be:
    (A) At least two replicate test chambers, each containing one or 
more embryo incubation trays or cups; and there shall be no water 
connections between the replicate test chambers;
    (B) At least 60 embryos divided equally in such a manner that test 
results show no significant bias from the distributions, between the 
embryo incubation trays or cups for each test concentration and control 
(i.e., 30 per embryo cup with 2 replicates);
    (C) All surviving larvae divided equally between the test chambers 
for each test concentration and control (e.g., 30 larvae per test 
chamber with 2 replicates).
    (iv) Duration. (A) For fathead minnow and sheepshead minnow a test 
begins when the newly fertilized minnow embryos (less than 48-hours old) 
are placed in the embryo cups and are exposed to the test solution 
concentrations. The test terminates following 28 days of post-hatch 
exposure, i.e., 28 days after the newly hatched fry are transferred from 
the embryo cups into the test chambers.
    (B) For brook trout and rainbow trout a test begins when newly 
fertilized trout embryos (less than 96-hours old) are placed in the 
embryo trays or cups and are exposed to the test solution 
concentrations. The test terminates following 60 days of post-hatch 
exposure (for an approximate total exposure period of 90 days).
    (C) For silverside a test begins with newly fertilized embryos (less 
than or equal to 48 hours old) and is terminated 28 days after hatching. 
The chorionic fibrils should be cut before randomly placing the embryos 
in the egg incubation cups.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Range-finding test. (i) A range finding test is normally 
performed with the test substance to determine the test concentrations 
to be used in the early life stage toxicity test, especially when the 
toxicity is unknown. It is recommended that the test substance 
concentrations be selected based on information gained from a 4- to 10-
day flow-through toxicity test with juveniles of the selected test 
species.
    (ii) The highest concentration selected for the early life stage 
toxicity test should approximate the lowest concentration indicated in 
any previous testing to cause a significant reduction in survival. The 
range of concentrations selected is expected to include both observed 
effect and no-observed effect levels. The dilution factor between 
concentrations is normally 0.50, however, other dilution factors may be 
used as necessary.
    (4) Definitive test--(i) General. (A) A test shall not be initiated 
until after the test conditions have been met and the test substance 
delivery system has been observed functioning properly for 48-hours. 
This includes temperature stability, flow requirements of dilution 
water, lighting requirements, and the function of strainers and air 
traps included in the water-supply system, and other conditions as 
specified previously.
    (B) New holding and test facilities should be tested with sensitive 
organisms (i.e., juvenile test species or daphnids) before use to assure 
that the facilities or substances possibly leaching from the equipment 
will not adversely affect the test organisms during an actual test.
    (C) Embryos should be acclimated for as long as practical to the 
test temperature and dilution water prior to the initiation of the test.
    (D) When embryos are received from an outside culture source (i.e., 
rainbow and brook trout) at a temperature at variance with the 
recommended test temperature they shall be acclimated to the test 
temperature. When eggs are received, they should be immediately unpacked 
and the temperature of the surrounding water determined. Sudden

[[Page 123]]

temperature changes should be avoided. Acclimation to the appropriate 
test temperature should be accomplished within a period of 6 hours, and 
should incorporate the use of dilution water.
    (E) Embryos should be visually inspected prior to placement in the 
embryo cups or screen trays. All dead embryos shall be discarded. Dead 
embryos can be discerned by a change in coloration from that of living 
embryos (e.g., trout embryos turn white when dead). During visual 
inspection, empty shells, opaque embryos, and embryos with fungus or 
partial shells attached shall be removed and discarded. If less than 50 
percent of the eggs to be used appear to be healthy, all embryos in such 
a lot shall be discarded.
    (ii) Embryo incubation procedures. (A) Embryos can be distributed to 
the embryo cups or screen trays using a pipette with a large bore or a 
similar apparatus. Newly-hatched silverside fry are very sensitive to 
handling; the egg incubation cups should not be handled at all the first 
5 days after hatching begins. Just before hatching is expected to begin, 
the embryos should be transferred to clean incubation cups. Trout 
embryos can be distributed by using a small container which has been 
precalibrated to determine the approximate number of embryos it can 
hold; embryos are measured volumetrically in this manner, and are then 
poured onto the screen tray (or embryo cup). Trout embryos should be 
separated on the screen tray so that they are not in contact with each 
other. A final count will ensure the actual number on the screen tray. 
After random assignment, the screen trays or embryo cups are placed in 
the test chambers.
    (B) Each day until hatch the embryos are visually examined. Minnow 
embryos may be examined with the aid of a magnifying viewer. Trout 
embryos should not be touched. Trout embryos should be maintained in low 
intensity light or in darkness until 1-week post hatch, and are usually 
examined with the aid of a flashlight or under low intensity light. Dead 
embryos should be removed and discarded. Any embryos which are heavily 
infected with fungus shall be discarded and shall be subtracted from the 
initial number of embryos used as a basis for the calculations of 
percentage hatch.
    (C) When embryos begin to hatch they should not be handled.
    (iii) Initiation of fry exposure. (A) Forty-eight hours after the 
first hatch in each treatment level, or when hatching is completed, the 
live young fish shall be counted and transferred from each embryo cup 
into the appropriate test chamber. For silverside, all surviving fry are 
not counted until six days after hatching and are not transferred to 
embryo cups. All of the normal and abnormal fry shall be gently released 
into the test chamber by allowing the fry to swim out of each embryo 
cup; nets shall not be used. The trout embryos incubated on screen trays 
will hatch out in the test chambers, therefore handling of fish is not 
necessary.
    (B) If necessary, fry can be transferred from one replicate embryo 
cup to the other replicate within a test concentration to achieve equal 
numbers in each replicate chamber.
    (C) The number of live fry, live normal fry, live embryos, dead 
embryos and unaccounted for embryos for each cup shall be recorded when 
hatching is deemed complete. Those fry which are visibly (without the 
use of a dissecting scope or magnifying viewer) lethargic or grossly 
abnormal (either in swimming behavior or physical appearance) shall be 
counted. Late hatching embryos shall be left in the embryo cups to 
determine if they will eventually hatch or not. The range of time-to-
hatch (to the nearest day) for each cup shall be recorded.
    (iv) Time to first feeding. (A) The first feeding for the fathead 
and sheepshead minnow fry shall begin shortly after transfer of the fry 
from the embryo cups to the test chambers. Silversides are fed the first 
day after hatch. Trout species initiate feeding at swim-up. The trout 
fry shall be fed trout starter mash three times a day ad libitum, with 
excess food siphoned off daily. The minnow fry shall be fed live newly-
hatched brine shrimp nauplii (Artemia salina) at least three times a 
day.
    (B) For the first seven days, feeding shall be done at minimum 
intervals of four hours (i.e., 8 am, 12 noon, and 4 pm); thereafter the 
fry shall be fed as indicated below.

[[Page 124]]

    (v) Feeding. (A) The fathead and sheepshead minnow fry shall be fed 
newly hatched brine shrimp nauplii for the duration of the test at 
approximately 4-hour intervals three times a day during the week and 
twice on the weekend after the first week. Trout fry shall be fed at 
similar intervals and may receive live brine shrimp nauplii in addition 
to the trout starter food after the first week. Between days 1 and 8 
after first hatching, silverside fry are fed the rotifer, Brachionus 
plicatilis, three times daily at a concentration of 5,000 to 10,000 
organisms per egg cup (based on 15 fish/cup). From days 9 to 11, the fry 
shall be fed approximately 2,500 newly hatched brine shrimp (Artemia) 
nauplii and 5,000 to 10,000 rotifers twice daily. For the remainder of 
the test, the fish will be fed brine shrimp exclusively. The number of 
organisms used should be gradually increased to approximately 5,000 
nauplii by test day 28.
    (B) An identical amount of food should be provided to each chamber. 
Fish should be fed ad libitum for 30 minutes with excess food siphoned 
off the bottom once daily if necessary.
    (C) Fish should not be fed for the last 24 hours prior to 
termination of the test.
    (vi) Carriers. Water should be used in making up the test stock 
solutions. If carriers other than water are absolutely necessary, the 
amount used should be the minimum necessary to achieve solution of the 
test substance. Triethylene glycol and dimethyl formamide are preferred, 
but ethanol and acetone can be used if necessary. Carrier concentrations 
selected should be kept constant at all treatment levels.
    (vii) Controls. Every test requires a control that consists of the 
same dilution water, conditions, procedures, and test organisms from the 
same group used in the other test chambers, except that none of the test 
substance is added. If a carrier (solvent) is used, a separate carrier 
control is required in addition to the regular control. The carrier 
control shall be identical to the regular control except that the 
highest amount of carrier present in any treatment is added to this 
control. If the test substance is a mixture, formulation, or commercial 
product, none of the ingredients is considered a carrier unless an extra 
amount is used to prepare the stock solution.
    (viii) Randomization. The location of all test chambers within the 
test system shall be randomized. A representative sample of the test 
embryos should be impartially distributed by adding to each cup or 
screen tray no more than 20 percent of the number of embryos to be 
placed in each cup or screen tray and repeating the process until each 
cup or screen tray contains the specified number of embryos. 
Alternatively, the embryos can be assigned by random assignment of a 
small group (e.g., 1 to 5) of embryos to each embryo cup or screen tray, 
followed by random assignment of a second group of equal number to each 
cup or tray, which is continued until the appropriate number of embryos 
are contained in each embryo cup or screen tray. The method of 
randomization used shall be reported.
    (ix) Observations. During the embryo exposure period observations 
shall be made to check for mortality. During the exposure period of the 
fry, observations shall be made to check for mortality and to note the 
physical appearance and behavior of the young fish. The biological 
responses are used in combination with physical and chemical data in 
evaluating the overall lethal and sublethal effects of the test 
substance. Additional information on the specific methodology for the 
data obtained during the test procedure are discussed in the following 
sections.
    (x) Biological data. (A) Death of embryos shall be recorded daily.
    (B) When hatching commences, daily records of the number of embryos 
remaining in each embryo cup are required. This information is necessary 
to quantify the hatching success. A record of all deformed larvae shall 
be kept throughout the entire post-hatch exposure. Time to swim-up shall 
be recorded for the trout. Upon transfer of fry from the embryo cups to 
the test chambers, daily counts of the number of live fish should be 
made. At a minimum, live fish shall be counted on days 4, 11, 18, 25 and 
(weekly thereafter for the trout species) finally on termination of the 
test.

[[Page 125]]

    (C) The criteria for death of young fish is usually immobility, 
especially absence of respiratory movement, and lack of reaction to 
gentle prodding. Deaths should be recorded daily and dead fish removed 
when discovered.
    (D) Daily and at termination of the test, the number of fish that 
appear (without the use of a magnifying viewer) to be abnormal in 
behavior (e.g., swimming erratic or uncoordinated, obviously lethargic, 
hyperventilating, or over excited, etc.) or in physical appearance 
(e.g., hemorrhaging, producing excessive mucous, or are discolored, 
deformed, etc.) shall be recorded and reported in detail.
    (E) All physical abnormalities (e.g., stunted bodies, scoliosis, 
etc.) shall be photographed and the deformed fish which die, or are 
sacrificed at the termination of the test, shall be preserved for 
possible future pathological examination.
    (F) At termination, all surviving fish shall be measured for growth. 
Standard length measurements should be made directly with a caliper, but 
may be measured photographically. Measurements shall be made to the 
nearest millimeter (0.1 mm is desirable). Weight measurements shall also 
be made for each fish alive at termination (wet, blotted dry, and to the 
nearest 0.01 g for the minnows and 0.1 g for the trout). If the fish 
exposed to the toxicant appear to be edematous compared to control fish, 
determination of dry, rather than wet, weight is recommended.
    (G) Special physiological, biochemical and histological 
investigations on embryos, fry, and juveniles may be deemed appropriate 
and shall be performed on a case by case basis.
    (5) Test results. (i) Data from toxicity tests are usually either 
continuous (e.g. length or weight measurements) or dichotomous (e.g. 
number hatching or surviving) in nature. Several methods are available 
and acceptable for statistical analysis of data derived from early life 
stage toxicity tests; however, the actual statistical methodology to 
analyze and interpret the test results shall be reported in detail.
    (ii) The significance level for all statistical testing shall be a 
minimum of P=0.05 (95 percent confidence level).
    (A) Example of statistical analysis. (1) Mortality data for the 
embryonic stage, fry stage and for both stages in replicate exposure 
chambers should first be analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with interaction model. This analysis will determine if 
replicates are significantly different from each other. If a significant 
difference between replicates or a significant interaction exists, cause 
for the difference should be determined. Modification should then be 
made in the test apparatus or in handling procedures for future toxicity 
tests. Further calculations should incorporate the separation of 
replicates. If no significant difference is observed, replicates may be 
pooled in further analyses.
    (2) After consideration of replicate responses, mortality data 
should then be subjected to one-way ANOVA. The purpose of this analysis 
is to determine if a significant difference exists in the percentage 
mortality between control fish and those exposed to the test material.
    (3) If the one-way ANOVA results in a F ratio that is significant, 
it would be acceptable to perform t-tests on the control versus each 
concentration. A second technique is to identify treatment means that 
are significantly different; this method should involve the additional 
assumption that the true mean response decreases generally with 
increasing concentration. The researcher may also be interested in 
determining significant differences between concentrations.
    (4) Growth data should also be analyzed by one-way ANOVA with the 
inclusion of a covariate to account for possible differences in growth 
of surviving fry in embryo cup(s) that contain fewer individuals. This 
condition can occur in cases when the same amount of food is given to 
each test chamber regardless of the number of survivors.
    (B) Test data to be analyzed. Data to be statistically analyzed are:
    (1) Percentage of healthy, fertile embryos at 40-48 hours after 
initiation of the test. Percentage is based upon initial number used.
    (2) Percentage of embryos that produce live fry for release into 
test

[[Page 126]]

chambers. Percentage is based on number of embryos remaining after 
thinning.
    (3) Percentage of embryos that produce live, normal fry for release 
into test chambers. Percentage is based upon number of embryos remaining 
after thinning.
    (4) Percentage of fry survival at swim-up for trout. Percentage is 
based upon number of embryos remaining after thinning.
    (5) Percentage of embryos that produce live fish at end of test. 
Percentage is based upon number of embryos remaining after thinning.
    (6) Percentage of embryos that produce live, normal fish at end of 
test. Percentage is based upon number of embryos remaining after 
thinning.
    (7) Weights and lengths of individual fish alive at the end of the 
test.
    (C) It is important that fish length and weight measurements be 
associated with individual test chambers since the density of the fish 
and available food should be considered in the growth of the organism.
    (iii) Acceptability criteria. (A) An early life stage toxicity test 
is not acceptable unless at least one of the following criteria is 
significantly different (p=0.05) from control organisms when compared 
with treated organisms, and the responses are concentration-dependent: 
mortality of embryos, hatching success, mortality of fry (at swim-up for 
trout), total mortality throughout the test, and growth (i.e. weight). 
If no significant effects occur, but the concentrations tested were the 
highest possible due to solubility or other physio-chemical limitations, 
the data will be considered for acceptance.
    (B) In addition to obtaining significant effects on the exposed test 
species, a measure of acceptability in the response of control fish is 
also required.
    (C) A test is not acceptable if the average survival of the control 
fish at the end of the test is less than 80 percent or if survival in 
any one control chamber is less than 70 percent. For silversides, a test 
is not acceptable if the average overall survival of the control embryos 
and fish at the end of the test is less than 60 percent.
    (D) If a carrier is used, the criteria for effect (mortality of 
embryos and fry, growth, etc.) used in the comparison of control and 
exposed test organisms shall also be applied to the control and control 
with carrier chambers. For the test to be considered acceptable, no 
significant difference shall exist between these criteria.
    (E) A test is not acceptable if the relative standard deviation 
(RSD=100 times the standard deviation divided by the mean) of the 
weights of the fish that were alive at the end of the test in any 
control test chamber is greater than 40 percent.
    (6) Analytical measurements--(i) Analysis of water quality. 
Measurement of certain dilution water quality parameters shall be 
performed every 6 months, to determine the consistency of the dilution 
water quality. In addition, if data in 30-day increments are not 
available to show that freshwater dilution water is constant, 
measurements of hardness, alkalinity, pH, acidity, conductivity, TOC or 
COD and particulate matter should be conducted once a week in the 
highest test substance concentration. Measurement of calcium, magnesium, 
sodium, potassium, chloride, and sulfate is desirable.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen measurement. The dissolved oxygen 
concentration shall be measured in each test chamber at the beginning of 
the test and at least once weekly thereafter (as long as live organisms 
are present) in two replicates of the control and the high, medium, and 
low test substance concentrations.
    (iii) Temperature measurement. Temperatures shall be recorded in all 
test chambers at the beginning of the test, once weekly thereafter and 
at least hourly in one test chamber. When possible, the hourly 
measurement shall be alternated between test chambers and between 
replicates.
    (iv) Test substance measurement. (A) Prior to the addition of the 
test substance to the dilution water, it is recommended that the test 
substance stock solution be analyzed to verify the concentration. After 
addition of the test substance, the concentration of test substance 
should be measured at the beginning of the test in each test 
concentration and control(s), and at least once a week thereafter. Equal

[[Page 127]]

aliquots of test solution may be removed from each replicate chamber and 
pooled for analysis. If a malfunction in the delivery system is 
discovered, water samples shall be taken from the affected test chambers 
immediately and analyzed.
    (B) The measured concentration of test substance in any chamber 
should be no more than 30 percent higher or lower than the concentration 
calculated from the composition of the stock solution and the 
calibration of the test substance delivery system. If the difference is 
more than 30 percent, the concentration of test substance in the 
solution flowing into the exposure chamber (influent) should be 
analyzed. These results will indicate whether the problem is in the 
stock solution, the test substance delivery system or in the test 
chamber. Measurement of degradation products of the test substance is 
recommended if a reduction of the test substance concentration occurs in 
the test chamber.
    (v) Sampling and analysis methodology. (A) Generally, total test 
substance measurements are sufficient; however, the chemical 
characteristics of the test substance may require both dissolved and 
suspended test substance measurements.
    (B) For measurement of the test substance, water samples shall be 
taken midway between the top, bottom, and sides of the test chamber and 
should not include any surface scum or material stirred up from the 
bottom or sides. Samples of test solutions shall be handled and stored 
appropriately to minimize loss of test substance by microbial 
degradation, photodegradation, chemical reaction, volatilization, or 
sorption.
    (C) Chemical and physical analyses shall be performed using 
standardized methods whenever possible. The analytical method used to 
measure the concentration of the test substance in the test solution 
shall be validated before the beginning of the test. At a minimum, a 
measure of the accuracy of the method should be obtained on each of two 
separate days by using the method of known additions, and using dilution 
water from a tank containing test organisms. Three samples should be 
analyzed at the next-to-lowest test substance concentration. It is also 
desirable to study the accuracy and precision of the analytical method 
for test guideline determination by use of reference (split) samples, or 
interlaboratory studies, and by comparison with alternative, reference, 
or corroborative methods of analysis.
    (D) An analytical method is not acceptable if likely degradation 
products of the test substance, such as hydrolysis and oxidation 
products, give positive or negative interferences, unless it is shown 
that such degradation products are not present in the test chambers 
during the test. In general, atomic absorption spectrophotometric 
methods for metals and gas chromatographic methods for organic compounds 
are preferable to colorimetric methods.
    (E) In addition to analyzing samples of test solution, at least one 
reagent blank also should be analyzed when a reagent is used in the 
analysis. Also, at least one sample for the method of known additions 
should be prepared by adding test substance at the concentration used in 
the toxicity test.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species. (i) One or more of the 
recommended test species will be specified in rules under part 799 of 
this chapter requiring testing of specific chemicals. The recommended 
test species are:
    (A) Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas Rafinesque).
    (B) Sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus).
    (C) Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis).
    (D) Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri).
    (E) Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia).
    (F) Tidewater silverside (Menidia peninsulae).
    (ii) Embryos used to initiate the early life stage test shall be 
less than 48 hours old for the fathead and sheepshead minnows, 
silversides, and less than 96 hours old for the brook trout and rainbow 
trout. In addition, the following requirements shall be met:
    (A) All embryos used in the test shall be from the same source. 
Embryos shall be obtained from a stock cultured in-house when possible, 
and maintained under the same parameters as specified

[[Page 128]]

for the test conditions. When it is necessary to obtain embryos from an 
external source, caution should be exercised to ensure embryo viability 
and to minimize the possibility of fungal growth. A description of the 
brood stock history or embryo source shall be made available to EPA upon 
request.
    (B) Test species shall be cared for and handled properly in order to 
avoid unnecessary stress. To maintain test species in good condition and 
to maximize growth, crowding shall be prevented, and the dissolved 
oxygen level shall be maintained near saturation.
    (C) Embryos and fish shall be handled as little as possible. Embryos 
shall be counted and periodically inspected until hatching begins. When 
larvae begin to hatch, they shall not be handled. Transfer of minnow 
larvae from embryo cups to test chambers shall not involve the use of 
nets. No handling is necessary following introduction into the test 
chambers until termination of the test.
    (D) If fathead minnow embryos are obtained from in-house culture 
units, the embryos should be gently removed from the spawning substrate. 
The method for separating the fertilized eggs from the substrate is 
important and can affect the viability of the embryos; therefore the 
finger-rolling procedure is recommended.
    (E) Disease treatment. Chemical treatments to cure or prevent 
diseases should not be used before, and should not be used during a 
test. All prior treatments of brood stock should be reported in detail. 
Severely diseased organisms should be destroyed.
    (2) Test facilities--(i) Construction materials. Construction 
materials and equipment that contact stock solutions, test solutions, or 
dilution water into which test embryos or fish are placed should not 
contain any substances that can be leached or dissolved into aqueous 
solutions in quantities that can affect test results. Materials and 
equipment that contact stock or test solutions should be chosen to 
minimize sorption of test chemicals from dilution water. Glass, 316 
stainless steel, nylon screen and perfluorocarbon plastic (e.g., 
Teflon<Register>) are acceptable materials. Concrete or rigid 
(unplasticized) plastic may be used for holding and acclimation tanks, 
and for water supply systems, but they should be thoroughly conditioned 
before use. If cast iron pipe is used in freshwater supply systems, 
colloidal iron may leach into the dilution water and strainers should be 
used to remove rust particles. Natural rubber, copper, brass, galvanized 
metal, epoxy glues, and flexible tubing should not come in contact with 
dilution water, stock solutions, or test solutions.
    (ii) Test chambers (exposure chambers). (A) Stainless steel test 
chambers should be welded or glued with silicone adhesive, and not 
soldered. Glass should be fused or bonded using clear silicone adhesive. 
Epoxy glues are not recommended, but if used ample curing time should be 
allowed prior to use. As little adhesive as possible should be in 
contact with the water.
    (B) Many different sizes of test chambers have been used 
successfully. The size, shape and depth of the test chamber is 
acceptable if the specified flow rate and loading requirements can be 
achieved.
    (C) The actual arrangement of the test chambers can be important to 
the statistical analysis of the test data. Test chambers can be arranged 
totally on one level (tier) side by side, or on two levels with each 
level having one of the replicate test substance concentrations or 
controls. Regardless of the arrangement, it shall be reported in detail 
and considered in the data analysis.
    (iii) Embryo incubation apparatus. (A) Recommended embryo incubation 
apparatus include embryo cups for the minnow species and screen trays 
for the trout species, although embryo cups can be used for the trout 
species. Embryo cups are normally constructed from approximately 4-5 cm 
inside diameter, 7-8 cm high, glass jars with the end cut off or similar 
sized sections of polyethylene tubing. One end of the jar or tubing is 
covered with stainless steel or nylon screen (approximately 40 meshes 
per inch is recommended). Embryo cups for silversides are normally 
constructed by using silicone adhesive to glue a 10-cm high, 363-um 
nylon mesh tube inside a 9-cm I.D. glass Petri dish bottom. The embryo 
cups shall be

[[Page 129]]

appropriately labeled and then suspended in the test chamber in such a 
manner as to ensure that the test solution regularly flows through the 
cup and that the embryos are always submerged but are not agitated too 
vigorously. Cups may be oscillated by a rocker arm apparatus with a low 
rpm motor (e.g., 2 rpm) to maintain the required flow of test water. The 
vertical-travel distance of the rocker arm apparatus during oscillation 
is normally 2.5-4.0 cm. The water level in the test chambers may also be 
varied by means of a self-starting siphon in order to ensure exchange of 
water in the embryo cups.
    (B) The trout embryo incubation trays can be made from stainless 
steel screen (or other acceptable material such as plastic) of about 3-4 
mm mesh. The screen tray should be supported above the bottom of the 
test chamber by two folds of screen or other devices which function as 
legs or supports. The edges of the screen tray should be turned up to 
prevent bump spills and to prevent the embryos from rolling off in the 
event of excessive turbulence. Suspending or supporting the screen tray 
off the bottom ensures adequate water circulation around the embryos and 
avoids contact of embryos with possible bottom debris.
    (iv) Test substance delivery system. (A) The choice of a specific 
delivery system depends upon the specific properties and requirements of 
the test substance. The apparatus used should accurately and precisely 
deliver the appropriate amount of stock solution and dilution water to 
the test chambers. The system selected shall be calibrated before each 
test. Calibration includes determining the flow rate through each 
chamber, and the proportion of stock solution to dilution water 
delivered to each chamber. The general operation of the test substance 
delivery system shall be checked at least twice daily for normal 
operation throughout the test. A minimum of five test substance 
concentrations and one control shall be used for each test.
    (B) The proportional diluter and modified proportional diluter 
systems and metering pump systems have proven suitable and have received 
extensive use.
    (C) Mixing chambers shall be used between the diluter and the test 
chamber(s). This may be a small container or flow-splitting chamber to 
promote mixing of test substance stock solution and dilution water, and 
is positioned between the diluter and the test chambers for each 
concentration. If a proportional diluter is used, separate delivery 
tubes shall run from the flow-splitting chamber to each replicate test 
chamber. Daily checks on this latter system shall be made.
    (D) Silverside fry are injured easily and are susceptible to 
impingement on the mesh of the incubation cups. Consequently, water flow 
into and out of the cups when counting fry must be at a slow rate. This 
can be accomplished by using small diameter (e.g., 2 mm I.D.) capillary 
tubes to drain the test solution from spitter boxes into the replicate 
test chambers. The use of a self-starting siphon to gradually lower 
(i.e., less than or equal to 1 min.) the water level approximately 2 cm 
in the test chamber is recommended. A minimum water depth of 5 cm should 
be maintained in the cups. Although it may be satisfactory, a rocker-arm 
type apparatus has not yet been used with silversides.
    (v) Other equipment required. (A) An apparatus for removing 
undesirable organisms, particulate matter and air bubbles.
    (B) An apparatus for aerating water.
    (C) A suitable magnifying viewer for examination of minnow embryos.
    (D) A suitable apparatus for the precise measurement of growth of 
the fish, including both length (e.g., with metric or ruler caliper or 
photographic equipment) and weight.
    (E) Facilities for providing a continuous supply of live brine 
shrimp nauplii (Artemia salina).
    (F) For silversides, facilities for providing a supply of rotifers 
(Brachionus plicatilis) for approximately 11 days.
    (G) Facilities (or access to facilities) for performing the required 
water chemistry analyses.
    (vi) Cleaning of equipment. (A) Test substance delivery systems and 
test chambers should be cleaned before use. Test chambers should be 
cleaned during the test as needed to maintain the dissolved oxygen 
concentration, and to

[[Page 130]]

prevent clogging of the embryo cup screens and narrow flow passages.
    (B) Debris can be removed with a rubber bulb and large pipette or by 
siphoning with a glass tube attached to a flexible hose. Debris should 
be run into a bucket light enough to observe that no live fish are 
accidentally discarded.
    (vii) Dilution water--(A) General. (1) A constant supply of 
acceptable dilution water should be available for use throughout the 
test. Dilution water shall be of a minimum quality such that the test 
species selected will survive in it for the duration of testing without 
showing signs of stress (e.g., loss of pigmentation, disorientation, 
poor response to external stimuli, excessive mucous secretion, lethargy, 
lack of feeding, or other unusual behavior). A better criterion for an 
acceptable dilution water for tests on early life stages should be such 
that the species selected for testing will survive, grow, and reproduce 
satisfactorily in it.
    (2) The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the dilution water 
(fresh or salt) shall be between 90 percent and 100 percent saturation. 
When necessary, dilution water should be aerated by means of airstones, 
surface aerators, or screen tubes before the introduction of the test 
substance.
    (3) Water that is contaminated with undesirable microoganisms (e.g., 
fish pathogens) shall not be used. If such contamination is suspected, 
the water should be passed through a properly maintained ultraviolet 
sterilizer equipped with an intensity meter before use. Efficacy of the 
sterilizer can be determined by using standard plate count methods.
    (B) Freshwater. (1) Natural water (clean surface or ground water) is 
preferred, however, dechlorinated tap water may be used as a last 
resort. Reconstituted freshwater is not recommended as a practical 
dilution water for the early life stage toxicity test because of the 
large volume of water required.
    (2) Particulate and dissolved substance concentrations should be 
measured at least twice a year and should meet the following 
specifications:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Substance                      Concentration maximum    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Particulate matter.......................  <20 mg/liter.                
Total organic carbon (TOC)...............  <2 mg/liter.                 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD).............  <5 mg/liter.                 
Un-ionized ammonia.......................  <1 <greek-m>g/liter.         
Residual chlorine........................  <1 <greek-m>g/liter.         
Total organoposphorus pesticides.........  <50 ng/liter.                
Total organochlorine pesticides plus       <50 ng/liter.                
 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).                                      
Total organic chlorine...................  <25 ng/liter.                
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) During any one month, freshwater dilution water should not vary 
more than 10 percent from the respective monthly averages of hardness, 
alkalinity and specific conductance; the monthly pH range should be less 
than 0.4 pH units.
    (C) Saltwater. (1) Marine dilution water is considered to be of 
constant quality if the minimum salinity is greater than 15<SUP>0</SUP>/
<INF>00</INF> and the weekly range of the salinity is less than 
15<SUP>0</SUP>/<INF>00</INF>. The monthly range of pH shall be less than 
0.8 pH units. Saltwater shall be filtered to remove larval predators. A 
pore size of <ls-thn-eq>20 micrometers (um) is recommended. For 
silversides, the recommended salinity is 20 ppt and shall be maintained 
between 15 and 25 ppt throughout testing.
    (2) Artificial sea salts may be added to natural seawater during 
periods of low salinity to maintain salinity above 15<SUP>0</SUP>/
<INF>00</INF>.
    (3) Test parameters--(i) Dissolved oxygen concentration. It is 
recommended that the dissolved oxygen concentration be maintained 
between 90 and 100 percent saturation; but it shall be no less than 75 
percent saturation at all times for both minnow species and between 90 
and 100 percent saturation for the trout species in all test chambers. 
Dilution water in the head box may be aerated, but the test solution 
itself shall not be aerated.
    (ii) Loading and flow rate. (A) The loading in test chambers should 
not exceed 0.1 grams of fish per liter of test solution passing through 
the test chamber in 24 hours. The flow rate to each chamber should be a 
minimum of 6 tank volumes per 24 hours. During a test, the flow rates 
should not vary more than 10 percent from any one test chamber to any 
other.
    (B) A lower loading or higher flow rate or both shall be used if 
necessary to meet the following three criteria at

[[Page 131]]

all times during the test in each chamber containing live test 
organisms:
    (1) The concentration of dissolved oxygen shall not fall below 75 
percent saturation for the fathead and sheepshead minnows and 90 percent 
for the rainbow and brook trout;
    (2) The concentration of un-ionized ammonia should not exceed 1 
<greek-m>g/1; and
    (3) The concentration of toxicant should not be lowered (i.e., 
caused by uptake by the test organisms and/or materials on the sides and 
bottoms of the chambers) more than 20 percent of the mean measured 
concentration.
    (iii) Temperature. (A) The recommended test temperatures are:
    (1) Fathead minnow----25  deg.C for all life stages.
    (2) Sheepshead minnow----30  deg.C for all life stages.
    (3) Rainbow and brook trout----10  deg.C for embryos. 12  deg.C for 
fry and alevins.
    (4) Atlantic and tidewater silversides----25  deg.C for all life 
stages.
    (B) Excursions from the test temperature shall be no greater than 
<plus-minus>2.0  deg.C. It is recommended that the test system be 
equipped with an automatic alarm system to alert staff of instantaneous 
temperature changes in excess of 2  deg.C. If the water is heated (i.e., 
for minnow species), precautions should be taken to ensure that 
supersaturation of dissolved gases is avoided. Temperatures shall be 
recorded in all test chambers at the beginning of the test and weekly 
thereafter. The temperature shall be recorded at least hourly in one 
test chamber throughout the test.
    (iv) Light. (A) Brook and rainbow trout embryos shall be maintained 
in darkness or very low light intensity through one week post-hatch, at 
which time a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark photoperiod shall be 
provided.
    (B) For fathead and sheepshead minnows, a 16-hour light and 8-hour 
dark (or 12:12) photoperiod shall be used throughout the test period.
    (C) For silversides, a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark photoperiod 
shall be used throughout the test period.
    (D) A 15-minute to 30-minute transition period between light and 
dark is optional.
    (E) Light intensities ranging from 30 to 100 lumens at the water 
surface shall be provided; the intensity selected should be duplicated 
as closely as possible for all test chambers.
    (e) Reporting. A report of the results of an early life stage 
toxicity test shall include the following:
    (1) Name of test, sponsor, investigator, laboratory, and dates of 
test duration.

<R05>
Sec. 797.1930  Mysid shrimp acute toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data 
on the acute toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures 
(``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test regulations under 
the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003, 
15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes a test using mysid 
shrimp as test organisms to develop data on the acute toxicity of 
chemicals. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will 
use data from these tests in assessing the hazard of a chemical to the 
aquatic environment.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and in part 792--Good Laboratory Practice 
Standards of this chapter, apply to this test guideline. The following 
definitions also apply to this guideline.
    (1) ``Death'' means the lack of reaction of a test organism to 
gentle prodding.
    (2) ``Flow-through'' means a continuous or an intermittent passage 
of test solution or dilution water through a test chamber or a holding 
or acclimation tank, with no recycling.
    (3) ``LC<INF>50</INF>'' means that experimentally derived 
concentration of test substance that is calculated to kill 50 percent of 
a test population during continuous exposure over a specified period of 
time.
    (4) ``Loading'' means the ratio of test organisms biomass (grams, 
wet weight) to the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber.
    (5) ``Retention chamber'' means a structure within a flow-through 
test chamber which confines the test organisms, facilitating observation 
of test organisms and eliminating loss of organisms in outflow water.
    (6) ``Static system'' means a test chamber in which the test 
solution is not renewed during the period of the test.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. In preparation for the 
test, test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution 
water. If a flow-through test is performed, the flow of dilution water 
through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired. The test substance 
is introduced into each test chamber. In a flow-through test, the rate 
at which the test substance is added is adjusted to establish and 
maintain the desired concentration of test substance in each test 
chamber. The test is started by randomly introducing mysids acclimated 
in accordance with the test design into the test chambers. Mysids in the 
test chambers are observed periodically during the test, the dead mysids 
removed and the findings recorded. Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, 
temperature, salinity, the concentration of test substance, and other 
water quality characteristics are measured at specified intervals in 
test chambers. Data collected during the test are used to develop 
concentration-response curves and LC<INF>50</INF> values for the test 
substance.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Range-finding test. (i) A range-finding test should be conducted 
to determine:
    (A) Which life stage (juvenile or young adult) is to be utilized in 
the definitive test.
    (B) The test solution concentrations for the definitive test.
    (ii) The mysids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced 
concentrations of test substance (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/l, etc.), usually 
under static conditions.
    (iii) This test should be conducted with both newly hatched juvenile 
(< 24 hours old) and young adult (5 to 6 days old) mysids. For each age 
class (juvenile or young adult), a minimum of 10 mysids should be 
exposed to each concentration of test substance for up to

[[Page 133]]

96 hours. The exposure period may be shortened if data suitable for the 
purpose of the range-finding test can be obtained in less time. The age 
class which is most sensitive to the test substance in the range-finding 
test shall be utilized in the definitive test. When no apparent 
difference in sensitivity of the two life stages is found, juveniles 
shall be utilized in the definitive test. No replicates are required, 
and nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.
    (4) Definitive test. (i) The purpose of the definitive test is to 
determine the concentration-response curves and the 48- and 96-hour 
LC<INF>50</INF> values with the minimum amount of testing beyond the 
range-finding test.
    (ii) The definitive test shall be conducted on the mysid life stage 
(juveniles or young adults) which is most sensitive to the test 
substance being evaluated.
    (iii) A minimum of 20 mysids per concentration shall be exposed to 
five or more concentrations of the chemical chosen in a geometric series 
in which the ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 
mg/l). An equal number of mysids shall be placed in two or more 
replicates. If solvents, solubilizing agents or emulsifiers have to be 
used, they shall be commonly used carriers and shall not possess a 
synergistic or antagonistic effect on the toxicity of the test 
substance. The concentration of solvent shall not exceed 0.1 ml/1. The 
concentration ranges shall be selected to determine the concentration-
response curves and LC<INF>50 </INF>values at 48 and 96 hours.
    (iv) Every test shall include controls consisting of the same 
dilution water, conditions, procedures, and mysids from the same 
population or culture container, except that none of the chemical is 
added.
    (v) The dissolved oxygen concentration temperature, salinity, and pH 
shall be measured at the beginning and end of the test in each chamber.
    (vi) The test duration is 96 hours. The test is unacceptable if more 
than 10 percent of the control organisms die or exhibit abnormal 
behavior during the 96 hour test period. Each test chamber should be 
checked for dead mysids at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the beginning 
of the test. Concentration-response curves and 24-, 48-, 72- and 96-hour 
LC<INF>50</INF> values should be determined along with their 95 percent 
confidence limits.
    (vii) In addition to death, any abnormal behavior or appearance 
shall also be reported.
    (viii) Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test 
chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias 
from the distributions. In addition, test chambers within the testing 
area shall be positioned in a random manner or in a way in which 
appropriated statistical analyses can be used to determine the variation 
due to placement.
    (ix) The concentration of the test substance in the chambers should 
be measured as often as is feasible during the test. At a minimum, 
during static tests the concentration of test substance shall be 
measured at each concentration at the beginning and at the end of the 
test. During the flow-through test, the concentration of test substance 
should be measured at the beginning and end of the test and in at least 
one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is detected in any part 
of the test substance delivery system. Equal aliquots of test solution 
may be removed from each replicate chamber and pooled for analysis. 
Among replicate test chambers of a treatment concentration, the measured 
concentration of the test substance should not vary more than 20 
percent.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Analytical measurements--(i) Test chemical. Deionized water 
should be used in making stock solutions of the test substance. Standard 
analytical methods should be used whenever available in performing the 
analyses. The analytical method used to measure the amount of test 
substance in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test by 
appropriate laboratory practices. An analytical method is not acceptable 
if likely degradation products of the test substance, such as hydrolysis 
and oxidation products, give positive or negative interferences which 
cannot be systematically identified and corrected mathematically.
    (ii) Numerical. The number of dead mysids shall be counted during 
each

[[Page 134]]

definitive test. Appropriate statistical analyses should provide a 
goodness-of-fit determination for the concentration-response curves. A 
48- and 96-hour LC<INF>50 </INF>and corresponding 95 percent interval 
shall be calculated.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species--(i) Selection. (A) The mysid 
shrimp, Mysidopsis bahia, is the organism specified for these tests. 
Either juvenile (<24 hours old) or young adult (5 to 6 days old) mysids 
are to be used to start the test.
    (B) Mysids to be used in chronic toxicity tests should originate 
from laboratory cultures in order to ensure the individuals are of 
similar age and experimental history. Mysids used for establishing 
laboratory cultures may be purchased commercially or collected from 
appropriate natural areas. Because of similarities with other mysids 
species, taxonomic verification should be obtained from the commercial 
supplier by experienced laboratory personnel or by an outside expert.
    (C) Mysids used in a particular test shall be of similar age and be 
of normal size and appearance for their age. Mysids shall not be used 
for a test if they exhibit abnormal behavior or if they have been used 
in a previous test, either in a treatment or in a control group.
    (ii) Acclimation. (A) Any change in the temperature and chemistry of 
the dilution water used for holding or culturing the test organisms to 
those of the test shall be gradual. Within a 24-hour period, changes in 
water temperature shall not exceed 1  deg.C, while salinity changes 
shall not exceed 5 percent.
    (B) During acclimation mysids should be maintained in facilities 
with background colors and light intensities similar to those of the 
testing areas.
    (iii) Care and handling. Methods for the care and handling of mysids 
such as those described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section can be used 
during holding, culturing and testing periods.
    (iv) Feeding. Mysids should be fed during testing. Any food utilized 
should support survival, growth and reproduction of the mysids. A 
recommended food is live Artemia spp. (48-hour-old nauplii).
    (2) Facilities--(i) Apparatus. (A) Facilities which may be needed to 
perform this test include: (1) flow-through or recirculating tanks for 
holding and acclimating mysids; (2) a mechanism for controlling and 
maintaining the water temperature during the holding, acclimation and 
test periods; (3) apparatus for straining particulate matter, removing 
gas bubbles, or aerating the water, as necessary; and (4) an apparatus 
for providing a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark photoperiod with a 15 to 
30 minute transition period. In addition, for flow-through tests, flow-
through chambers and a test substance delivery system are required. 
Furthermore, it is recommended that mysids be held in retention chambers 
within test chambers to facilitate observations and eliminate loss of 
test organisms through outflow water. For static tests, suitable 
chambers for exposing test mysids to the test substance are required. 
Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and disturbances 
that may affect the test organisms.
    (B) Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of 
test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the 
entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.
    (ii) Cleaning. Test substance delivery systems and test chambers 
shall be cleaned before each test following standard laboratory 
practices.
    (iii) Construction materials. (A) Materials and equipment that 
contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test 
chemicals from dilution water and should not contain substances that can 
be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect test 
results.
    (B) For use in the flow-through test, retention chambers utilized 
for confinement of test organisms can be constructed with netting 
material of appropriate mesh size.
    (iv) Dilution water. (A) Natural or artificial seawater is 
acceptable as dilution water if mysids will survive and successfully 
reproduce in it for the duration of the holding, acclimating and testing 
periods without showing signs of stress, such as reduced growth and 
fecundity. Mysids shall be cultured and tested in dilution water from 
the same origin.

[[Page 135]]

    (B) Natural seawater shall be filtered through a filter with a pore 
size of <20 microns prior to use in a test.
    (C) Artificial seawater can be prepared by adding commercially 
available formulations or by adding specific amounts of reagent-grade 
chemicals to deionized water. Deionized water with a conductivity less 
than 1 <greek-m> ohm/cm at 12  deg.C is acceptable for making artificial 
seawater. When deionized water is prepared from a ground or surface 
water source, conductivity and total organic carbon (or chemical oxygen 
demand) shall be measured on each batch.
    (v) Test substance delivery system. In flow-through tests, 
proportional diluters, metering pumps, or other suitable systems should 
be used to deliver test substance to the test chambers. The system used 
shall be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining 
the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test 
substance in each chamber. The general operation of the test substance 
delivery system should be checked twice daily during a test. The 24-hour 
flow through a test chamber shall be equal to at least 5 times the 
volume of the test chamber. During a test, the flow rates should not 
vary more than 10 percent among test chambers or across time.
    (3) Test parameters. Environmental parameters of the water contained 
in test chambers shall be maintained as specified below:
    (i) The test temperature shall be 25 deg.C. Excursions from the test 
temperature shall be not greater than <plus-minus> 2 deg.C.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent 
saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done 
before the addition of the test substance. All treatment and control 
chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.
    (iii) The number of mysids placed in a test solution shall not be so 
great as to affect results of the test. Loading shall not exceed 30 
mysids per liter for a static test. Loading requirements for the flow-
through test will vary depending on the flow rate of dilution water. The 
loading shall not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below 
the recommended levels.
    (iv) Photoperiod of 14 hours light and 10 hours darkness, with a 15 
to 30 minute transition period.
    (v) Salinity of 20 parts per thousand <plus-minus>3 percent.
    (e) Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the EPA all data 
developed during the test that are suggestive or predictive of acute 
toxicity and all concomitant toxicologic manifestations. In addition to 
the general reporting requirements prescribed in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter, the reporting of test 
data shall include the following:
    (1) The source of the dilution water, its chemical characteristics 
(e.g., salinity, pH, etc.) and a description of any pretreatment.
    (2) Detailed information about the test organisms, including the 
scientific name and method of verification, age, source, history, 
abnormal behavior, acclimation procedures and food used.
    (3) A description of the test chambers, the depth and volume of 
solution in the chamber, the way the test was begun (e.g., conditioning, 
test substance additions, etc.), the number of organisms per treatment, 
the number of replicates, the loading, the lighting, the test substance 
delivery system and the flow rate expressed as volume additions per 24 
hours.
    (4) The measured concentration of test substance in test chambers at 
the times designated.
    (5) The number and percentage of organisms that died or showed any 
other adverse effects in the control and in each treatment at each 
observation period.
    (6) Concentration-response curves shall be fitted to mortality data 
collected at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. A statistical test of goodness-
of-fit shall be performed and the results reported.
    (7) The 96-hour LC<INF>50 </INF>and when sufficient data have been 
generated, the 24-, 48-, and 72-hour LC<INF>50</INF>'s and the 
corresponding 95-percent confidence limits and the methods used to 
calculate the values. These calculations shall be made using the average 
measured concentration of the test substance.
    (8) Methods and data records of all chemical analyses of water 
quality and

[[Page 136]]

test substance concentrations, including method validations and reagent 
blanks.
    (9) The data records of the holding, acclimation and test 
temperature and salinity.

Sec. 797.1950  Mysid shrimp chronic toxicity test.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data 
on the chronic toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures 
(``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test regulations under 
the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003, 
15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes tests using mysids as 
test organisms to develop data on the chronic toxicity of chemicals. The 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will use data from 
these tests in assessing the hazard of a chemical to the aquatic 
environment.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and in part 792--Good Laboratory Practice 
Standards of this chapter apply to this test guideline. The following 
definitions also apply to this guideline:
    (1) ``Chronic toxicity test'' means a method used to determine the 
concentration of a substance that produces an adverse effect from 
prolonged exposure of an organism to that substance. In this test, 
mortality, number of young per female and growth are used as measures of 
chronic toxicity.
    (2) ``Death'' means the lack of reaction of a test organism to 
gentle prodding.
    (3) ``Flow-through'' means a continuous or an intermittent passage 
of test solution or dilution water through a test chamber or a holding 
or acclimation tank, with no recycling.
    (4) ``G1 (Generation 1)'' means those mysids which are used to begin 
the test, also referred to as adults; G2 (Generation 2) are the young 
produced by G1.
    (5) ``LC<INF>50</INF>'' means that experimentally derived 
concentration of test substance that is calculated to kill 50 percent of 
a test population during continuous exposure over a specified period of 
time.
    (6) ``Loading'' means the ratio of test organism biomass (gram, wet 
weight) to the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber.
    (7) ``MATC'' (Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration) means the 
maximum concentration at which a chemical can be present and not be 
toxic to the test organism.
    (8) ``Retention chamber'' means a structure within a flow-through 
test chamber which confines the test organisms, facilitating observation 
of test organisms and eliminating washout from test chambers.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Summary of the test. (i) In preparation for 
the test, the flow of test solution through each chamber is adjusted to 
the rate desired. The test substance is introduced into each test 
chamber. The rate at which the test substance is added is adjusted to 
establish and maintain the desired concentration of test substance in 
each test chamber. The test is started by randomly introducing mysids 
acclimated in accordance with the test design into retention chambers 
within the test and the control chambers. Mysids in the test and control 
chambers are observed periodically during the test, the dead mysids 
removed and the findings reported.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, salinity, the 
concentration of test substance and other water quality characteristics 
are measured at specified intervals in selected test chambers.
    (iii) Data collected during the test are used to develop a MATC 
(Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration) and quantify effects on 
specific chronic parameters.
    (2) [Reserved]

[[Page 137]]

    (3) Range-finding test. (i) A range-finding test should be conducted 
to establish test solution concentrations for the definitive test.
    (ii) The mysids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced 
concentrations of the test substance (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/l), usually 
under static conditions.
    (iii) A minimum of 10 mysids should be exposed to each concentration 
of test substance for a period of time which allows estimation of 
appropriate chronic test concentrations. No replicates are required and 
nominal concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.
    (4) Definitive test. (i) The purpose of the definitive test is to 
determine concentration-response curves, LC<INF>50</INF> values, and 
effects of a chemical on growth and reproduction during chronic 
exposure.
    (ii) A minimum of 40 mysids per concentration shall be exposed to 
four or more concentrations of the chemical chosen in a geometric series 
in which the ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 
mg/1). An equal number of mysids shall be placed in two or more 
replicates. If solvents, solubilizing agents or emulsifiers have to be 
used, they shall be commonly used carriers and shall not possess a 
synergistic or antagonistic effect on the toxicity of the test 
substance. The concentration of solvent should not exceed 0.1 ml/1. The 
concentration ranges should be selected to determine the concentration 
response curves, LC<INF>50</INF> values and MATC. Concentration of test 
substance in test solutions should be analyzed prior to use.
    (iii) Every test should include controls consisting of the same 
dilution water, conditions, procedures and mysids from the same 
population or culture container, except that none of the chemical is 
added.
    (iv) The dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, salinity, and 
pH shall be measured weekly in each chamber.
    (v) The test duration is 28 days. The test is unacceptable if more 
than 20 percent of the control organisms die, appear stressed or are 
diseased during the test. The number of dead mysids in each chamber 
shall be recorded on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the test. At the time 
when sexual characteristics are discernible in the mysids (approximately 
10 to 12 days in controls; possible delays may occur in mysids exposed 
to test substances), the number of males and females (identified by 
ventral brood pouch) in each chamber shall be recorded. Body length (as 
measured by total midline body length, from the anterior tip of the 
carapace to the posterior margin of the uropod) shall be recorded for 
males and females at the time when sex can be determined simultaneously 
for all mysids in control and treatment groups. This time cannot be 
specified because of possible delays in sexual maturation of mysids 
exposed to test substances. A second observation of male and female body 
lengths shall be conducted on day 28 of the test. To reduce stress on 
the mysids, body lengths can be recorded by photography through a 
stereomicroscope with appropriate scaling information. As offspring are 
produced by the G1 mysids (approximately 13 to 16 days in controls), the 
young shall be counted and separated into retention chambers at the same 
test substance concentration as the chambers where they originated. If 
available prior to termination of the test, observations on the 
mortality, number of males and females and male and female body length 
shall be recorded for the G2 mysids. Concentration-response curves, 
LC<INF>50</INF> values and associated 95 percent confidence limits for 
the number of dead mysids (G1) shall be determined for days 7, 14, 21, 
and 28. An MATC shall be determined for the most sensitive test criteria 
measured (cumulative mortality of adult mysids, number of young per 
female, and body lengths of adult males and females).
    (vi) In addition to death, any abnormal behavior or appearance shall 
also be reported.
    (vii) Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test 
chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias 
from the distributions. In addition, test chambers within the testing 
area shall be positioned in a random manner or in a way in which 
appropriate statistical analyses can be used to determined the variation 
due to placement.

[[Page 138]]

    (viii) The concentration of the test substance in the chambers 
should be measured as often as is feasible during the test. The 
concentration of test substance shall be measured:
    (A) At each test concentration at the beginning of the test and on 
days 7, 14, 21, and 28; and
    (B) In at least one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is 
detected in any part of the test substance delivery system.

Equal aliquots of test solutions may be removed from each test chamber 
and pooled for analysis. Among replicate test chambers of a treatment 
concentration, the measured concentration of the test substance should 
not vary more than 20 percent.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Analytical measurements--(i) Test chemical. Deionized water 
should be used in making stock solutions of the test substance. Standard 
analytical methods should be employed whenever available in performing 
the analyses. The analytical method used to measure the amount of test 
substance in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test by 
appropriate laboratory practices. An analytical method is not acceptable 
if likely degradation products of the test substance, such as hydrolysis 
and oxidation products, give positive or negative interferences which 
cannot be systematically identified and corrected mathematically.
    (ii) Numerical. (A) The number of dead mysids, cumulative young per 
female, and body lengths of male and female mysids shall be recorded 
during each definitive test. Appropriate statistical analyses shall 
provide a goodness-of-fit determination for the day 7, 14, 21 and 28 
adult (Gl) death concentration-response curves.
    (B) A 7-, 14-, 21- and 28-day LC<INF>50</INF>, based on adult (Gl) 
death, and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals shall be 
calculated. Appropriate statistical tests (e.g., analysis of variance, 
mean separation test) should be used to test for significant chemical 
effects on chronic test criteria (cumulative mortality of adults, 
cumulative number of young per female and body lengths of adult male and 
females) on designated days. An MATC shall be calculated using these 
chronic tests criteria.
    (d) Test conditions--(1) Test species--(i) Selection. (A) The mysid 
shrimp, Mysidopsis bahia, is the organism specified for these tests. 
Juvenile mysids, <ls-thn-eq>24 hours old, are to be used to start the 
test.
    (B) Mysids to be used in chronic toxicity tests should originate 
from laboratory cultures in order to ensure the individuals are of 
similar age and experimental history. Mysids used for establishing 
laboratory cultures may be purchased commercially or collected from 
appropriate natural areas. Because of similarities with other mysid 
species, taxonomic verification should be obtained from the commercial 
supplier, by experienced laboratory personnel, or by an outside expert.
    (C) Mysids used in a particular test shall be of similar age and be 
of normal size and appearance for their age.
    (D) Mysids shall not be used for a test if they exhibit abnormal 
behavior, or if they have been used in a previous test, either in a 
treatment or in a control group.
    (ii) Acclimation. (A) Any change in the temperature and chemistry of 
the water used for holding or culturing the test organisms to those of 
the test should be gradual. Within a 24-hour period, changes in water 
temperature should not exceed 1  deg.C, while salinity changes should 
not exceed 5 percent.
    (B) During acclimation mysids should be maintained in facilities 
with background colors and light intensities similar to those of the 
testing areas.
    (iii) Care and handling. Methods for the care and handling of mysids 
such as those described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section can be used 
during holding, culturing and testing periods.
    (iv) Feeding. Mysids should be fed during testing. Any food utilized 
should support survival, growth and reproduction of the mysids. A 
recommended food is live Artemia spp. nauplii (approximately 48 hours 
old).
    (2) Facilities--(i) Apparatus. (A) Facilities which may be needed to 
perform this test include: (1) flow-through or recirculating tanks for 
holding and acclimating mysids; (2) a mechanism for controlling and 
maintaining the water temperature during the holding,

[[Page 139]]

acclimation and test periods; (3) apparatus for straining particulate 
matter, removing gas bubbles, or aerating the water, as necessary; and 
(4) an apparatus for providing a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark 
photoperiod with a 15- to 30-minute transition period. In addition, 
flow-through chambers and a test substance delivery system are required. 
It is recommended that mysids be held in retention chambers within test 
chambers to facilitate observations and eliminate loss through outflow 
water.
    (B) Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and 
disturbances that may affect test organisms.
    (C) Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of 
test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the 
entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.
    (ii) Cleaning. Test substance delivery systems and test chambers 
shall be cleaned before each use following standard laboratory 
practices.
    (iii) Construction materials. (A) Materials and equipment that 
contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize sorption of test 
chemicals from the dilution water and should not contain substances that 
can be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that can affect the 
test results.
    (B) Retention chambers utilized for confinement of test organisms 
can be constructed with netting material of appropriate mesh size.
    (iv) Dilution water. (A) Natural or artificial seawater is 
acceptable as dilution water if mysids will survive and successfully 
reproduce in it for the duration of the holding, acclimating and testing 
periods without showing signs of stress, such as reduced growth and 
fecundity. Mysids shall be cultured and tested in dilution water from 
the same origin.
    (B) Natural seawater shall be filtered through a filter with a pore 
size of >20 microns prior to use in a test.
    (C) Artificial seawater can be prepared by adding commercially 
available formulations or by adding specific amounts of reagent-grade 
chemicals to deionized or glass-distilled water. Deionized water with a 
conductivity less than 1 <greek-m> ohm/cm at 12  deg.C is acceptable as 
the diluent for making artificial seawater. When deionized water is 
prepared from a ground or surface water source, conductivity and total 
organic carbon (or chemical oxygen demand) shall be measured on each 
batch.
    (v) Test substance delivery system. Proportional diluters, metering 
pumps, or other suitable systems should be used to deliver test 
substance to the test chambers. The system used shall be calibrated 
before each test. Calibration includes determining the flow rate and the 
concentration of the test substance in each chamber. The general 
operation of the test substance delivery system should be checked twice 
daily during a test. The 24-hour flow rate through a chamber shall be 
equal to at least 5 times the volume of the chamber. The flow rates 
should not vary more than 10 percent among chambers or across time.
    (3) Test parameters. Environmental parameters of the water contained 
in test chambers shall be maintained as specified below:
    (i) The test temperature shall be 25 deg.C. Excursions from the test 
temperature shall be no greater than <plus-minus> 2 deg.C.
    (ii) Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent 
saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done 
before the addition of the test substance. All treatment and control 
chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.
    (iii) The number of mysids placed in a test solution shall not be so 
great as to affect results of the test. Loading requirements for the 
test will vary depending on the flow rate of dilution water. The loading 
shall not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below the 
recommended levels.
    (iv) Photoperiod of 14 hours light and 10 hours darkness, with a 15-
30 minute transition period.
    (v) Salinity of 20 parts per thousand <plus-minus>3 percent.
    (e) Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the EPA all data 
developed by the test that are suggestive or predictive of chronic 
toxicity and all concomitant toxicologic manifestations. In addition to 
the general reporting requirements prescribed in part 792--Good 
Laboratory Practice Standards of

[[Page 140]]

delivery system, and the flow rate expressed as volume additions per 24 
hours.
    (4) The measured concentration of test substance in test chambers at 
the times designated.
    (5) The first time (day) that sexual characteristics can be observed 
in controls and in each test substance concentration.

each concentration.
    (7) The means (average of replicates) and respective 95 percent 
confidence intervals for:
    (i) Body length of males and females at the first observation day 
(depending on time of sexual maturation) and on day 28.
    (ii) Cumulative number of young produced per female on day 28.
    (iii) Cumulative number of dead adults on day 7, 14, 21 and 28.
    (iv) If available prior to test termination (day 28), effects on G2 
mysids (number of males and females, body length of males and females 
and cumulative mortality).
    (8) The MATC is calculated as the geometric mean between the lowest 
measured test substance concentration that had a significant (P<0.05) 
effect and the highest measured test substance concentration that had no 
significant (P<0.05) effect in the chronic test. The most sensitive of 
the test criteria for adult (Gl) mysids (cumulative number of dead 
mysids, body lengths of males and females or the number of young per 
female) is used to calculate the MATC. The criterion selected for MATC 
computation is the one which exhibits an effect (a statistically 
significant difference between treatment and control groups; P<0.05) at 
the lowest test substance concentration for the shortest period of 
exposure. Appropriate statistical tests (analysis of variance, mean 
separation test) should be used to test for significant chemical 
effects. The statistical tests employed and the results of these tests 
shall be reported.
    (9) Concentration-response curves shall be fitted to the cumulative 
number of adult dead for days 7, 14, 21, and 28. A statistical test of 
goodness-of-fit shall be performed and the results reported.
    (10) An LC<INF>50</INF> value based on the number of dead adults 
with corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals for days 7, 14, 21 
and 28. These calculations shall be made using the average measured 
concentration of the test substance.
    (11) Methods and data records of all chemical analyses of water 
quality and test substance concentrations, including method validations 
and reagent blanks.
    (12) The data records of the holding, acclimation and test 
temperature and salinity.

Sec. 798.2250  Dermal toxicity.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of a chemical, the determination of subchronic dermal 
toxicity may be carried out after initial information on toxicity has 
been obtained by acute testing. The subchronic dermal study has been 
designed to permit the determination of the no-observed-effect level and 
toxic effects associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test 
substance for a period of 90 days. The test is not capable of 
determining those effects that have a long latency period for 
development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life shortening). It provides 
information on health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure by 
the dermal route over a limited period of time. It will provide 
information on target organs, the possibilities of accumulation, and can 
be of use in selecting dose levels for chronic studies and for 
establishing safety criteria for human exposure.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Subchronic dermal toxicity is the adverse 
effects occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of 
experimental animals to a chemical by dermal application for part 
(approximately 10 percent) of a life span.
    (2) Dose in a dermal test is the amount of test substance applied to 
the skin (applied daily in subchronic tests). Dose is expressed as 
weight of the substance (g, mg) per unit weight of test animal (e.g., 
mg/kg).
    (3) No-effect level/No-toxic-effect level/No-adverse-effect level/
No-observed-effect level is the maximum dose used in a test which 
produces no observed adverse effects. A no-observed-effect level is 
expressed in terms of the weight of a test substance given daily per 
unit weight of test animal (mg/kg).
    (4) Cumulative toxicity is the adverse effects of repeated doses 
occurring as a result of prolonged action on, or increased concentration 
of the administered test substance or its metabolites in susceptible 
tissues.
    (c) Principle of the test method. The test substance is applied 
daily to the skin in graduated doses to several groups of experimental 
animals, one dose level per unit group, for a period of 90 days. During 
the period of application the animals are observed daily to detect signs 
of toxicity. Animals which

[[Page 142]]

die during the test are necropsied, and at the conclusion of the test 
the surviving animals are sacrificed and necropsied and appropriate 
histopathological examinations carried out.
    (d) Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 1,000 mg/kg 
body weight (expected human exposure may indicate the need for a higher 
dose level), using the procedures described for this study, produces no 
observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based 
upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using 
three dose levels might not be necessary.
    (e) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. A 
mammalian species shall be used for testing. The rat, rabbit, or guinea 
pig may be used, although the albino rabbit is preferred. The albino 
rabbit is preferred because of its size, skin permeability, and 
extensive data base. Commonly used laboratory strains shall be employed. 
If another mammalian species is used, the tester shall provide 
justification/reasoning for its selection.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals shall be used. The following weight 
ranges at the start of the test are suggested in order to provide 
animals of a size which facilitates the conduct of the test: rats, 200 
to 300 g; rabbits, 2.0 to 3.0 kg; guinea pigs, 350 to 450 g.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex with healthy 
skin shall be used at each dose level.
    (B) The females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (iv) Numbers. (A) At least 20 animals (10 females and 10 males) 
shall be used at each dose level.
    (B) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number shall be increased 
by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before completion of 
the study.
    (2) Control groups. A concurrent control group is required. This 
group shall be an untreated or sham-treated control group or, if a 
vehicle is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control 
group. If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be 
made available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.
    (3) Satellite group. A satellite group of 20 animals (10 animals per 
sex) may be treated with the high dose level for 90 days and observed 
for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence, of toxic effects 
for a posttreatment period of appropriate length, normally not less than 
28 days.
    (4) Dose level and dose selection. (i) In subchronic toxicity tests, 
it is desirable to have a dose-response relationship as well as a no-
observed-toxic-effect level. Therefore, at least 3 dose levels with a 
control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the 
concentration of vehicle at the highest exposure level) shall be used. 
Doses should be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range 
of toxic effects. The data shall be sufficient to produce a dose-
response curve.
    (ii) The highest dose level should result in toxic effects but not 
produce severe skin irritation or an incidence of fatalities which would 
prevent a meaningful evaluation.
    (iii) The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of 
toxicity. Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure, the 
lowest dose level should exceed this.
    (iv) Ideally, the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal 
observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used, 
the dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic 
effects.
    (v) In the low and intermediate groups and in the controls the 
incidence of fatalities should be low, to permit a meaningful evaluation 
of the results.
    (5) Exposure conditions. The animals are treated with test 
substance, ideally for at least 6 hours per day on a 7-day per week 
basis, for a period of 90 days. However, based primarily on practical 
considerations, application on a 5-day per week basis is considered to 
be acceptable.
    (6) Observation period. (i) Duration of observation shall be at 
least 90 days.
    (ii) Animals in the satellite group scheduled for followup 
observations should be kept for at least 28 days further without 
treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, toxic effects.

[[Page 143]]

    (7) Preparation of animal skin. (i) Shortly before testing, fur 
shall be clipped from the dorsal area of the trunk of the test animals. 
Shaving may be employed, but it should be carried out approximately 24 
hours before the test. Repeat clipping or shaving is usually needed at 
approximately weekly intervals. When clipping or shaving the fur, care 
should be taken to avoid abrading the skin, which could alter its 
permeability.
    (ii) Not less than 10 percent of the body surface area should be 
clear for the application of the test substance. The weight of the 
animal should be taken into account when deciding on the area to be 
cleared and on the dimensions of any covering used.
    (iii) When testing solids, which may be pulverized if appropriate, 
the test substance should be moistened sufficiently with water or, where 
necessary, a suitable vehicle to ensure good contact with the skin. When 
a vehicle is used, the influence of the vehicle on toxicity of and 
penetration of the skin by the test substance should be taken into 
account.
    (8) Application of the test substance. (i) The test substance shall 
be applied uniformly over an area which is approximately 10 percent of 
the total body surface area. With highly toxic substances, the surface 
area covered may be less, but as much of the area shall be covered with 
as thin and uniform a film as possible.
    (ii) During the exposure period, the test substance shall be held in 
contact with the skin with a porous gauze dressing and nonirritating 
tape. The test site shall be further covered in a suitable manner to 
retain the gauze dressing and test substance and ensure that the animals 
cannot ingest the test substance. Restrainers may be used to prevent the 
ingestion of the test substance, but complete immobilization is not a 
recommended method.
    (9) Observation of animals. (i) Each animal shall be observed daily, 
and if necessary handled to appraise its physical condition.
    (ii) Additional observations shall be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, 
including the time of onset, the degree, and duration.
    (iv) Cage-side observations shall include, but not be limited to, 
changes in skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, respiratory, 
circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity 
and behavior pattern.
    (v) Animals shall be weighed weekly. Feed consumption shall also be 
determined weekly if abnormal body weight changes are observed.
    (vi) At the end of the study period, all survivors in the 
nonsatellite treatment groups shall be sacrificed. Moribund animals 
shall be removed and sacrificed when noticed.
    (10) Clinical examinations. (i) The following examinations shall be 
made on all animals of each sex in each group:
    (A) Certain hematology determinations shall be carried out at least 
two times during the test period on all groups of animals including 
concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just prior to terminal 
sacrifice at the end of the test period. Hematology determinations which 
are appropriate to all studies: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, 
erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure 
of clotting potential such as clotting time, prothrombin time, 
thromboplastin time, or platelet count.
    (B) Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be 
carried out at least two times during the test period on all groups of 
animals including concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just 
prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Clinical 
biochemistry test areas which are considered appropriate to all studies: 
Electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and liver and kidney 
function. The selection of specific tests will be influenced by 
observations on the mode of action of the substance. Suggested 
determinations: Calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, 
fasting glucose (with period of fasting appropriate to the species), 
serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (now

[[Page 144]]

known as serum alanine aminotransferase), serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase (now known as serum aspartate aminotransferase), ornithine 
decarboxylase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen 
blood creatinine, total bilirubin, and total serum protein measurements. 
Other determinations which may be necessary for an adequate 
toxicological evaluation include: Analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/
base balance, methemoglobin, and cholinesterase activity. Additional 
clinical biochemistry may be employed, where necessary, to extend the 
investigation of observed effects.
    (ii) The following examinations shall be made on high dose and 
control groups. If changes in the eyes are detected all animals should 
be examined.
    (A) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or 
equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to exposure to the 
test substance and at the termination of the study.
    (B) Urinalysis is not recommended on a routine basis, but only when 
there is an indication based on expected or observed toxicity.
    (11) Gross necropsy. (i) All animals shall be subjected to a full 
gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the 
body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities 
and their contents.
    (ii) The liver, kidneys, adrenals, brain, and gonads shall be 
weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection, to avoid drying. In 
addition, for the rodent, the brain; for the non-rodent, the thyroid 
with parathyroids also shall be weighed wet.
    (iii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples 
thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: All gross lesions; lungs--which should be 
removed intact, weighed, and treated with a suitable fixative to ensure 
that lung structure is maintained (perfusion with the fixative is 
considered to be an effective procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues; 
brain--including sections of medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and 
cerebral cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart; 
sternum with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; 
adrenals; pancreas; gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs 
(epididymis, prostate, and, if present, seminal vesicles); aorta; 
(skin); gall bladder (if present); esophagus; stomach; duodenum; 
jejunum; ileum; cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative 
lymph node; (mammary gland); (thigh musculature); peripheral nerve; 
(eyes); (femur--including articular surface); (spinal cord at three 
levels--cervical, midthoracic, and lumbar); and (zymbal and exorbital 
lachrymal glands).
    (12) Histopathology. The following histopathology shall be 
performed:
    (i) Full histopathology on normal and treated skin and on organs and 
tissues, listed above, of all animals in the control and high dose 
groups.
    (ii) All gross lesions in all animals.
    (iii) Target organs in all animals.
    (iv) The tissues listed in parenthesis in paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of 
this section, if indicated by signs of toxicity or expected target organ 
involvement.
    (v) Lungs of animals (rodents) in the low and intermediate dose 
groups shall be subjected to histopathological examination for evidence 
of infection, since this provides a convenient assessment of the state 
of health of the animals.
    (vi) When a satellite group is used, histopathology shall be 
performed on tissues and organs identified as showing effects in the 
treated groups.
    (f) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, 
the types of lesions, and the percentage of animals displaying each type 
of lesion.
    (ii) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, should be 
evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted 
statistical method may be used; the statistical methods should be 
selected during the design of the study.
    (2) Evaluation of results. The findings of a subchronic dermal 
toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of 
preceding studies and considered in terms of the observed toxic effects 
and the necropsy and

[[Page 145]]

histopathological findings. The evaluation should include the 
relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence or 
absence, the incidence and severity, of abnormalities, including 
behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target 
organs, body weight changes, effect on mortality and any other general 
or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted subchronic test should 
provide a satisfactory estimation of a no-effect level.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified in the EPA Good Laboratory Practice Standards under 40 CFR 
part 792, subpart J, the following specific information shall be 
reported.
    (i) Group animal data. Tabulation of toxic response data by species, 
strain, sex and exposure level for:

Sec. 798.2450  Inhalation toxicity.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of a gas, volatile substance, or aerosol/particulate, 
determination of subchronic inhalation toxicity may be carried out after 
initial information on toxicity has been obtained by acute testing. The 
subchronic inhalation study has been designed to permit the 
determination of the no-observed-effect level and toxic effects 
associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test substance for 
a period of 90 days. The test is not capable of determining those 
effects that have a long latency period for development (e.g., 
carcinogenicity and life shortening). It provides information on health 
hazards likely to arise from repeated exposures by the inhalation route 
over a limited period of time. It will provide information on target 
organs, the possibilities of accumulation, and can be of use in 
selecting dose levels for chronic studies and for establishing safety 
criteria for human exposure. Hazards of inhaled substances are 
influenced by the inherent toxicity and by physical factors such as 
volatility and particle size.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Subchronic inhalation toxicity is the adverse 
effects occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of 
experimental animals to a chemical by inhalation for part (approximately 
10 percent) of a life span.
    (2) Aerodynamic diameter applies to the size of particles of 
aerosols. It is the diameter of a sphere of unit density

[[Page 146]]

which behaves aerodynamically as the particle of the test substance. It 
is used to compare particles of different size and densities and to 
predict where in the respiratory tract such particles may be deposited. 
This term is used in contrast to measured or geometric diameter which is 
representative of actual diameters which in themselves cannot be related 
to deposition within the respiratory tract.
    (3) The geometric mean diameter or the median diameter is the 
calculated aerodynamic diameter which divides the particles of an 
aerosol in half based on the weight of the particles. Fifty percent of 
the particles by weight will be larger than the median diameter and 50 
percent of the particles will be smaller than the median diameter. The 
median diameter describes the particle size distribution of any aerosol 
based on the weight and size of the particles.
    (4) Inhalable diameter refers to that aerodynamic diameter of a 
particle which is considered to be inhalable for the organism. It is 
used to refer to particles which are capable of being inhaled and may be 
deposited anywhere within the respiratory tract from the trachea to the 
alveoli. For man, inhalable diameter is considered as 15 micrometers or 
less.
    (5) Dose refers to an exposure level. Exposure is expressed as 
weight or volume of test substance per volume of air (mg/l), or as parts 
per million (ppm).
    (6) No-effect level/No-toxic-effect level/No-adverse-effect level/
No-observed-effect level is the maximum dose used in a test which 
produces no observed adverse effects. A no-observed-effect level is 
expressed in terms of weight or volume of test substance given daily per 
unit volume of air (mg/l or ppm).
    (7) Cumulative toxicity is the adverse effects of repeated doses 
occuring as a result of prolonged action on, or increased concentration 
of the administered test substance or its metabolites in susceptible 
tissues.
    (c) Principle of the test method. Several groups of experimental 
animals are exposed daily for a defined period to the test substance in 
graduated concentrations, one concentration being used per group, for a 
period of 90 days. During the period of administration, the animals are 
observed daily to detect signs of toxicity. Animals which die during the 
test are necropsied and at the conclusion of the test, surviving animals 
are sacrificed and necropsied and appropriate histopathological 
examinations carried out.
    (d) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. A 
mammalian species shall be used for testing. A variety of rodent species 
may be used, although the rat is the preferred species. Commonly used 
laboratory strains shall be employed. If another mammalian species is 
used, the tester shall provide justification/ reasoning for its 
selection.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals shall be used. At the commencement of 
the study the weight variation of animals shall not exceed 
<plus-minus>20 percent of the mean weight for each sex.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex shall be used at 
each dose level.
    (B) Females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (iv) Numbers. (A) At least 20 rodents (10 females and 10 males) 
shall be used for each test group. If another mammalian species is 
selected (e.g. dog, rabbit, or non-human primate), at least 8 animals (4 
males and 4 females) shall be used.
    (B) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number of animals shall 
be increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before 
the completion of the study.
    (2) Control groups. A concurrent control group is required. This 
group shall be an untreated or sham-treated control group. Except for 
treatment with the test substance, animals in the control group shall be 
handled in a manner identical to the test group animals. Where a vehicle 
is used to help generate an appropriate concentration of the substance 
in the atmosphere, a vehicle control group shall be used. If the toxic 
properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be made available, 
both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.
    (3) Satellite group. A satellite group of 20 animals (10 animals per 
sex) may be treated with the high concentration

[[Page 147]]

level for 90 days and observed for reversibility, persistence, or 
delayed occurrence of toxic effects for a post-treatment period of 
appropriate length, normally not less than 28 days.
    (4) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) In subchronic toxicity 
tests, it is desirable to have a concentration-response relationship as 
well as a no-observed-toxic-effect level. Therefore, at least 3 
concentration levels with a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle 
control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the highest 
exposure level) shall be used. Concentrations should be spaced 
appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The 
data should be sufficient to produce a concentration-response curve.
    (ii) The highest concentration should result in toxic effects but 
not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful 
evaluation.
    (iii) The lowest concentration should not produce any evidence of 
toxicity. Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure the 
lowest concentration should exceed this.
    (iv) Ideally, the intermediate concentration level(s) should produce 
minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate 
concentration level is used, the concentrations should be spaced to 
produce a gradation of toxic effects.
    (v) In the low and intermediate groups and in the controls the 
incidence of fatalities should be low, to permit a meaningful evaluation 
of the results.
    (vi) In the case of potentially explosive test substances, care 
should be taken to avoid generating explosive concentrations.
    (5) Exposure conditions. The animals should be exposed to the test 
substance, ideally for 6 hours per day on a 7-day per week basis, for a 
period of 90 days. However, based primarily on practical considerations, 
exposure on a 5-day-per-week basis for 6 hours per day is the minimum 
acceptable exposure period.
    (6) Observation period. (i) Duration of observation shall be for at 
least 90 days.
    (ii) Animals in a satellite group scheduled for followup 
observations should be kept for at least 28 days further without 
treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, toxic effects.
    (7) Inhalation exposure. (i) The animals shall be tested in 
inhalation equipment designed to sustain a minimum dynamic air flow of 
12 to 15 air changes per hour and ensure an adequate oxygen content of 
19 percent and an evenly distributed exposure atmosphere. Where a 
chamber is used, its design should minimize crowding of the test animals 
and maximize their exposure to the test substance. This is best 
accomplished by individual caging. To ensure stability of a chamber 
atmosphere, the total ``volume'' of the test animals shall not exceed 5 
percent of the volume of the test chamber. Oronasal or head-only 
exposure may be used if it is desirable to avoid concurrent exposure by 
the dermal or oral routes.
    (ii) A dynamic inhalation system with a suitable flow control system 
shall be used. The rate of air flow shall be adjusted to ensure that 
conditions throughout the exposure chamber are essentially the same. 
Maintenance of slight negative pressure inside the chamber will prevent 
leakage of the test substance into surrounding areas.
    (iii) The temperature at which the test is performed should be 
maintained at 22  deg.C (<plus-minus>2 deg.). Ideally, the relative 
humidity should be maintained between 40 to 60 percent, but in certain 
instances (e.g., tests of aerosols, use of water vehicle) this may not 
be practicable.
    (8) Physical measurements. Measurements or monitoring shall be made 
of the following:
    (i) The rate of air flow shall be monitored continuously and 
recorded at least every 30 minutes.
    (ii) The actual concentrations of the test substance shall be 
measured in the breathing zone. During the exposure period the actual 
concentrations of the test substance shall be held as constant as 
practicable, monitored continuously or intermittently depending on the 
method of analysis, and recorded at least at the beginning, at an 
intermediate time, and at the end of the exposure period.

[[Page 148]]

    (iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size 
analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of aerosol 
concentrations with respect to particle size. During exposure, analysis 
shall be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of 
particle size distribution.
    (iv) Temperature and humidity shall be monitored continuously but 
shall be recorded at least every 30 minutes.
    (9) Feed and water during exposure period. Feed shall be withheld 
during exposure. Water may also be withheld during exposure.
    (10) Observation of animals. (i) Each animal shall be observed daily 
and, if necessary, handled to appraise its physical condition.
    (ii) Additional observations should be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed 
including the time of onset, the degree, and duration.
    (iv) Cage-side observations should include, but not be limited to, 
changes in the skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, respiratory, 
circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity 
and behavior pattern.
    (v) Animals shall be weighed weekly. Feed consumption shall also be 
determined weekly if abnormal body weight changes are observed.
    (vi) At the end of the study period all survivors in the 
nonsatellite treatment groups shall be sacrificed. Moribund animals 
shall be removed and sacrificed when noticed.
    (11) Clinical examinations. (i) The following examinations shall be 
made on all animals of each sex in each group:
    (A) Certain hematology determinations shall be carried out at least 
two times during the test period on all groups of animals including 
concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just prior to terminal 
sacrifice at the end of the test period. Hematology determinations which 
are appropriate to all studies: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, 
erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure 
of clotting potential such as clotting time, prothrombin time, 
thromboplastin time, or platelet count.
    (B) Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be 
carried out at least two times during the test period on all groups of 
animals including concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just 
prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Clinical 
biochemistry test areas which are considered appropriate to all studies: 
Electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and liver and kidney 
function. The selection of specific tests will be influenced by 
observations on the mode of action of the substance. Suggested 
determinations: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, 
fasting glucose (with period of fasting appropriate to the species), 
serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, (now known as serum alanine 
aminotransferase), serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (now known as 
serum aspartate aminotransferase), ornithine decarboxylase, gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen, blood creatinine, total 
bilirubin, and total serum protein measurements. Other determinations 
which may be necessary for an adequate toxicological evaluation include: 
Analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base balance, methemoglobin, and 
cholinesterase activity. Additional clinical biochemistry may be 
employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation of observed 
effects.
    (ii) The following examinations shall be made on high dose and 
control groups. If changes in the eyes are detected, all animals shall 
be examined:
    (A) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or 
equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to exposure to the 
test substance and at the termination of the study.
    (B) Urinalysis is not recommended on a routine basis, but only when 
there is an indication based on expected and/or observed toxicity.
    (12) Gross pathology. (i) All animals shall be subjected to a full 
gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the 
body, all

[[Page 149]]

orifices and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their 
contents.
    (ii) At least the liver, kidneys, adrenals, brain, and gonads shall 
be weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying. In 
addition, for the rodent, the brain; for the non-rodent, the thyroid 
with parathyroids also shall be weighed wet.
    (iii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples 
thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: All gross lesions; lungs--which should be 
removed intact, weighed, and treated with a suitable fixative to ensure 
that lung structure is maintained (perfusion with the fixative is 
considered to be an effective procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues; 
brain--including sections of medulla/pons cerebellar cortex and cerebral 
cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart; sternum 
with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; adrenals; 
pancreas; gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs (epididymis, 
prostate, and, if present, seminal vesicles); aorta; (skin); gall 
bladder (if present); esophagus; stomach; duodenum; jejunum; ileum; 
cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative lymph node; 
(mammary gland); (thigh musculature); peripheral nerve; (eyes); (femur--
including articular surface); (spinal cord at three levels--cervical, 
midthoracic, and lumbar); and (zymbal and exorbital lachrymal glands).
    (13) Histopathology. The following histopathology shall be 
performed:
    (i) Full histopathology on the respiratory tract and other organs 
and tissues, listed above, of all animals in the control and high dose 
groups.
    (ii) All gross lesions in all animals.
    (iii) Target organs in all animals.
    (iv) The tissues mentioned in brackets (listed above) if indicated 
by signs of toxicity or target organ involvement.
    (v) Lungs of animals (rodents) in the low and intermediate dose 
groups shall also be subjected to histopathological examination, 
primarily for evidence of infection since this provides a convenient 
assessment of the state of health of the animals.
    (vi) When a satellite group is used, histopathology shall be 
performed on tissues and organs identified as showing effects in the 
treated groups.
    (e) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, 
the types of lesions, and the percentage of animals displaying each type 
of lesion.
    (ii) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, should be 
evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted 
statistical method may be used; the statistical methods should be 
selected during the design of the study.
    (2) Evaluation of results. The findings of the subchronic inhalation 
toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of 
preceding studies and considered in terms of the observed toxic effects 
and the necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will 
include the relationship between the concentration of the test substance 
and duration of exposure, and the presence or absence, the incidence and 
severity, of abnormalities, including behavioral and clinical 
abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target organs, body weight 
changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific toxic 
effects. A properly conducted subchronic test should provide a 
satisfactory estimation of a no-effect level.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under EPA Good Laboratory Practice Standards, 40 CFR part 792, 
subpart J, the following specific information shall be reported:
    (i) Test conditions. (A) Description of exposure apparatus,

Sec. 798.2650  Oral toxicity.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of a chemical, the determination of subchronic oral 
toxicity may be carried out after initial information on toxicity has 
been obtained by acute testing. The subchronic oral study has been 
designed to permit the determination of the no-observed-effect level and 
toxic effects associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test 
substance for a period of 90 days. The test is not capable of 
determining those effects that have a long latency period for 
development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life shortening). It provides 
information on health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure by 
the oral route over a limited period of time. It will provide 
information on target organs, the possibilities of accumulation, and can 
be of use in selecting dose levels for chronic studies and for 
establishing safety criteria for human exposure.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Subchronic oral toxicity is the adverse effects 
occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of experimental 
animals to a chemical by the oral route for a part (approximately 10 
percent) of a life span.
    (2) Dose is the amount of test substance administered. Dose is 
expressed as weight of test substance (g, mg) per unit weight of test 
animal (e.g., mg/kg), or as weight of test substance per unit weight of 
food or drinking water.
    (3) No-effect level/No-toxic-effect level/No-adverse-effect level/
No-observed-effect level is the maximum dose used in a test which 
produces no

[[Page 151]]

observed adverse effects. A no-observed-effect level is expressed in 
terms of the weight of a substance given daily per unit weight of test 
animal (mg/kg). When administered to animals in food or drinking water 
the no-observed-effect level is expressed as mg/kg of food or mg/ml of 
water.
    (4) Cumulative toxicity is the adverse effects of repeated doses 
occurring as a result of prolonged action on, or increased concentration 
of, the administered test substance or its metabolites in susceptible 
tissue.
    (c) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
orally in graduated daily doses to several groups of experimental 
animals, one dose level per group, for a period of 90 days. During the 
period of administration the animals are observed daily to detect signs 
of toxicity. Animals which die during the period of administration are 
necropsied. At the conclusion of the test all animals are necropsied and 
histo-pathological examinations carried out.
    (d) Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 1,000 mg/kg 
body weight (expected human exposure may indicate the need for a higher 
dose level), using the procedures described for this study, produces no 
observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based 
upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using 
three dose levels might not be necessary.
    (e) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. A 
mammalian species shall be used for testing. A variety of rodent species 
may be used, although the rat is the preferred species. Commonly used 
laboratory strains shall be employed. The commonly used nonrodent 
species is the dog, preferably of a defined breed; the beagle is 
frequently used. If other mammalian species are used, the tester shall 
provide justification/reasoning for his or her selection.
    (ii) Age--(A) General. Young adult animals shall be employed. At the 
commencement of the study the weight variation of animals used shall not 
exceed <plus-minus> 20 percent of the mean weight for each sex.
    (B) Rodents. Dosing shall begin as soon as possible after weaning, 
ideally before the rats are 6, and in any case, not more than 8 weeks 
old.
    (C) Non-rodent. In the case of the dog, dosing shall commence after 
acclimatization, preferably at 4 to 6 months and not later than 9 months 
of age.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex shall be used at 
each dose level.
    (B) The females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (iv) Numbers--(A) Rodents. At least 20 animals (10 females and 10 
males) shall be used at each dose level.
    (B) Non-rodents. At least eight animals (four females and four 
males) shall be used at each dose level.
    (C) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number shall be increased 
by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before the 
completion of the study.
    (2) Control groups. A concurrent control group is required. This 
group shall be an untreated or sham-treated control group or, if a 
vehicle is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control 
group. If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be 
made available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.
    (3) Satellite group. (Rodent) A satellite group of 20 animals (10 
animals per sex) may be treated with the high dose level for 90 days and 
observed for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic 
effects for a post-treatment period of appropriate length, normally not 
less than 28 days.
    (4) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) In subchronic toxicity 
tests, it is desirable to have a dose response relationship as well as a 
no-observed-toxic-effect level. Therefore, at least 3 dose levels with a 
control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control (corresponding to the 
concentration of vehicle at the highest exposure level) shall be used. 
Doses should be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range 
of toxic effects. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-
response curve.
    (ii) The highest dose level in rodents should result in toxic 
effects but not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a 
meaningful evaluation; for non-rodents there should be no fatalities.

[[Page 152]]

    (iii) The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of 
toxicity. Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure the 
lowest dose level should exceed this.
    (iv) Ideally, the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal 
observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used, 
the dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic 
effects.
    (v) For rodents, the incidence of fatalities in low and intermediate 
dose groups and in the controls should be low, to permit a meaningful 
evaluation of the results; for non-rodents, there should be no 
fatalities.
    (5) Exposure conditions. The animals are dosed with the test 
substance ideally on a 7-day per week basis over a period of 90 days. 
However, based primarily on practical considerations, dosing in gavage 
or capsule studies on a 5-day per week basis is considered to be 
acceptable.
    (6) Observation period. (i) Duration of observation shall be for at 
least 90 days.
    (ii) Animals in the satellite group scheduled for followup 
observations should be kept for at least 28 days further without 
treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, toxic effects.
    (7) Administration of the test substance. (i) The test substance may 
be administered in the diet or in capsules. In addition, for rodents it 
may also be administered by gavage or in the drinking water.
    (ii) All animals shall be dosed by the same method during the entire 
experimental period.
    (iii) Where necessary, the test substance is dissolved or suspended 
in a suitable vehicle. If a vehicle or diluent is needed, ideally it 
should not elicit important toxic effects itself nor substantially alter 
the chemical or toxicological properties of the test substance. It is 
recommended that wherever possible the usage of an aqueous solution be 
considered first, followed by consideration of a solution of oil and 
then by possible solution in other vehicles.
    (iv) For substances of low toxicity, it is important to ensure that 
when administered in the diet the quantities of the test substance 
involved do not interfere with normal nutrition. When the test substance 
is administered in the diet either a constant dietary concentration 
(ppm) or a constant dose level in terms of the animals' body weight 
shall be used; the alternative used shall be specified.
    (v) For a substance administered by gavage or capsule, the dose 
shall be given at approximately the same time each day, and adjusted at 
intervals (weekly or bi-weekly) to maintain a constant dose level in 
terms of animal body weight.
    (8) Observation of animals. (i) Each animal shall be observed daily 
and, if necessary, handled to appraise its physical condition.
    (ii) Additional observations shall be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed 
including the time of onset, degree and duration.
    (iv) Cage-side observations shall include, but not be limited to, 
changes in skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, respiratory, 
circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity 
and behavior pattern.
    (v) Measurements shall be made weekly of feed consumption or water 
consumption when the test substance is administered in the feed or 
drinking water, respectively.
    (vi) Animals shall be weighed weekly.
    (vii) At the end of the 90-day period all survivors in the 
nonsatellite treatment groups shall be sacrificed. Moribund animals 
shall be removed and sacrificed when noticed.
    (9) Clinical examinations. (i) The following examinations shall be 
made on all animals of each sex in each group for rodents and all 
animals when non-rodents are used as test animals.
    (A) Certain hematology determinations shall be carried out at least 
two times during the test period on all groups of animals including 
concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just prior to terminal 
sacrifice at the end of

[[Page 153]]

the test period. Hematology determinations which are appropriate to all 
studies: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, total 
and differential leukocyte count, and a measure of clotting potential 
such as clotting time, prothrombin time, thromboplastin time, or 
platelet count.
    (B) Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be 
carried out at least two times during the test period on all groups of 
animals including concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just 
prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Clinical 
biochemistry test areas which are considered appropriate to all studies: 
Electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and liver and kidney 
function. The selection of specific tests will be influenced by 
observations on the mode of action of the substance. Suggested 
determinations: Calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, 
fasting glucose (with period of fasting appropriate to the species), 
serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (now known as serum alanine 
aminotransferase), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (now known as 
serum aspartate aminotransferase), ornithine decarboxylase, gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen, blood creatinine, total 
bilirubin, and total serum protein measurements. Other determinations 
which may be necessary for an adequate toxicological evaluation include: 
Analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base balance, methemoglobin, and 
cholinesterase activity. Additional clinical biochemistry may be 
employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation of observed 
effects.
    (ii) The following examinations shall be made on high dose and 
control groups. If changes in the eyes are detected, all animals should 
be examined.
    (A) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or 
equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to the administration 
of the test substance and at the termination of the study.
    (B) Urinalysis is not recommended on a routine basis, but only when 
there is an indication based on expected and or observed toxicity.
    (10) Gross necropsy. (i) All animals shall be subjected to a full 
gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the 
body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic and abdominal cavities and 
their contents.
    (ii) At least the liver, kidneys, adrenals, and gonads shall be 
weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying. In 
addition, for the rodent, the brain; for the non-rodent, the thyroid 
with parathyroids also shall be weighed wet.
    (iii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples 
thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: All gross lesions; lungs--which should be 
removed intact, weighed, and treated with a suitable fixative to ensure 
that lung structure is maintained (perfusion with the fixative is 
considered to be an effective procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues; 
brain-- including sections of medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and 
cerebral cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart; 
sternum with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; 
adrenals; pancreas; gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs 
(epididymis, prostate, and, if present, seminal vesicles); aorta; 
(skin); gall bladder (if present); esophagus; stomach; duodenum; 
jejunum; ileum; cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative 
lymph node; (mammary gland); (thigh musculature); peripheral nerve; 
(eyes); (femur--including articular surface); (spinal cord at three 
levels--cervical, midthoracic, and lumbar); and (zymbal and exorbital 
lachrymal glands); and (rodent-zymbal glands).
    (11) Histopathology. The following histopathology shall be 
performed:
    (i) Full histopathology on the organs and tissues, listed above, of 
all rodents in the control and high dose groups, all non-rodents, and 
all rodents that died or were killed during the study.
    (ii) All gross lesions in all animals.
    (iii) Target organs in all animals.
    (iv) The tissues mentioned in brackets (listed above) if indicated 
by signs of toxicity of target organ involvement.
    (v) Lungs, liver and kidneys of all animals. Special attention to 
examination of the lungs of rodents shall be

[[Page 154]]

made for evidence of infection since this provides a convenient 
assessment of the state of health of the animals.
    (vi) When a satellite group is used (rodents), histopathology shall 
be performed on tissues and organs identified as showing effects in the 
treated groups.
    (f) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, 
the types of lesions and the percentage of animals displaying each type 
of lesion.
    (ii) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, should be 
evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted 
statistical methods may be used; the statistical methods should be 
selected during the design of the study.
    (2) Evaluation of the study results. (i) The findings of a 
subchronic oral toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with 
the findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of the toxic 
effects and the necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation 
will include the relationship between the dose of the test substance and 
the presence or absence, the incidence and severity, of abnormalities, 
including behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, 
identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and 
any other general or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted 
subchronic test should provide a satisfactory estimation of a no-effect 
level.
    (ii) In any study which demonstrates an absence of toxic effects, 
further investigation to establish absorption and bioavailability of the 
test substance should be considered.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under EPA Good Laboratory Practice Standards, 40 CFR part 792, 
subpart J, the following specific information shall be reported:
    (i) Group animal data. Tabulation of toxic response data by species, 
strain, sex and exposure level for:

                       Subpart D--Chronic Exposure


<R05>
Sec. 798.3260  Chronic toxicity.

    (a) Purpose. The objective of a chronic toxicity study is to 
determine the effects of a substance in a mammalian species following 
prolonged and repeated exposure. Under the conditions of the chronic 
toxicity test, effects which require a long latency period or which are 
cumulative should become manifest. The application of this guideline 
should generate data on which to identify the majority of chronic 
effects and shall serve to define long term dose-response relationships. 
The design and conduct of chronic toxicity tests should allow for the 
detection of general toxic effects, including neurological, 
physiological, biochemical, and hematological effects and exposure-
related morphological (pathology) effects.
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Testing should be performed with two mammalian species, one a rodent and 
another a non-rodent. The rat is the preferred rodent species and the 
dog is the preferred non-rodent species. Commonly used laboratory 
strains should be employed. If other mammalian species are used, the 
tester should provide justification/reasoning for their selection.
    (ii) Age. (A) Dosing of rats should begin as soon as possible after 
weaning, ideally before the rats are 6, but in no case more than 8 weeks 
old.
    (B) Dosing of dogs should begin between 4 and 6 months of age and in 
no case later than 9 months of age.
    (C) At commencement of the study the weight variation of animals 
used should not exceed <plus-minus>20 percent of the mean weight for 
each sex.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex should be used 
at each dose level.
    (B) The females should be nulliparous and non-pregnant.
    (iv) Numbers. (A) For rodents, at least 40 animals (20 females and 
20 males) and for non-rodents (dogs) at least 8 animals (4 females and 4 
males) should be used at each dose level.
    (B) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number should be 
increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed during the 
course of the study.
    (C) The number of animals at the termination of the study must be 
adequate for a meaningful and valid statistical evaluation of chronic 
effects.
    (2) Control groups. (i) A concurrent control group is suggested. 
This group should be an untreated or sham treated control group or, if a 
vehicle is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control 
group. If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be 
made available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are strongly 
suggested.
    (ii) In special circumstances such as in inhalation studies 
involving aerosols or the use of an emulsifier of uncharacterized 
biological activity in oral studies, a concurrent negative control group 
should be utilized. The negative control group should be treated in the 
same manner as all other test animals except that this control group 
should not be exposed to either the test substance or any vehicle.
    (3) Dose levels and dose selections. (i) In chronic toxicity tests, 
it is necessary to have a dose-response relationship as well as a no-
observed-toxic-effect level. Therefore, at least three dose levels 
should be used in addition to the concurrent control group. Dose levels 
should be spaced to produce a gradation of effects.
    (ii) The high dose level in rodents should elicit some signs of 
toxicity without causing excessive lethality; for non-rodents, there 
should be signs of toxicity but there should be no fatalities.
    (iii) The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of 
toxicity. Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure the 
lowest dose level should exceed this even though this dose level may 
result in some signs of toxicity.
    (iv) Ideally, the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal 
observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used, 
the dose level should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.
    (v) For rodents, the incidence of fatalities in low and intermediate 
dose groups and in the controls should be low to permit a meaningful 
evaluation of the results. For non-rodents, there should be no 
fatalities.

[[Page 156]]

    (4) Exposure conditions. The animals are dosed with the test 
substance ideally on a 7-day per week basis over a period of at least 12 
months. However, based primarily on practical considerations, dosing on 
a 5-day per week basis is considered to be acceptable.
    (5) Observation period. Duration of observation should be for at 
least 12 months, and may be concurrent with or subsequent to dosing. If 
there is a post-exposure observation period, an interim sacrifice should 
be performed on no fewer than half of the animals of each sex at each 
dose level immediately upon termination of exposure.
    (6) Administration of the test substance. The three main routes of 
administration are oral, dermal, and inhalation. The choice of the route 
of administration depends upon the physical and chemical characteristics 
of the test substance and the form typifying exposure in humans.
    (i) Oral studies. (A) The animals should receive the test substance 
in their diet, dissolved in drinking water, or given by gavage or 
capsule for a period of at least 12 months.
    (B) If the test substance is administered in the drinking water, or 
mixed in the diet, exposure is continuous.
    (C) For a diet mixture, the highest concentration should not exceed 
5 percent.
    (ii) Dermal studies. (A) The animals are treated by topical 
application with the test substance, ideally for at least 6 hours per 
day.
    (B) Fur should be clipped from the dorsal area of the trunk of the 
test animals. Care must be taken to avoid abrading the skin which could 
alter its permeability.
    (C) The test substance should be applied uniformly over a shaved 
area which is approximately 10 percent of the total body surface area. 
With highly toxic substances, the surface area covered may be less, but 
as much of the area should be covered with as thin and uniform a film as 
possible.
    (D) During the exposure period, the test substance may be held if 
necessary, in contact with the skin with a porous gauze dressing and 
non-irritating tape. The test site should be further covered in a 
suitable manner to retain the gauze dressing and test substance and 
ensure that the animals cannot ingest the test substance.
    (iii) Inhalation studies. (A) The animals should be tested with 
inhalation equipment designed to sustain a dynamic air flow of 12 to 15 
air changes per hour, ensure an adequate oxygen content of 19 percent 
and an evenly distributed exposure atmosphere. Where a chamber is used, 
its design should minimize crowding of the test animals and maximize 
their exposure to the test substance. This is best accomplished by 
individual caging. As a general rule to ensure stability of a chamber 
atmosphere, the total ``volume'' of the test animals should not exceed 5 
percent of the volume of the test chamber. Alternatively, oro-nasal, 
head-only or whole body individual chamber exposure may be used.
    (B) The temperature at which the test is performed should be 
maintained at 22 deg.C (<plus-minus>2 deg.). Ideally, the relative 
humidity should be maintained between 40 to 60 percent, but in certain 
instances (e.g., tests of aerosols, use of water vehicle) this may not 
be practicable.
    (C) Feed and water should be withheld during each daily 6 hour 
exposure period.
    (D) A dynamic inhalation system with a suitable analytical 
concentration control system should be used. The rate of air flow should 
be adjusted to ensure that conditions throughout the equipment are 
essentially the same. Maintenance of slight negative pressure inside the 
chamber will prevent leakage of the test substance into the surrounding 
areas.
    (7) Observation of animals. (i) Each animal should be handled and 
its physical condition appraised at least once each day.
    (ii) Additional observations should be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrific 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Clinical signs of toxicity including suspected tumors and 
mortality should be recorded as they are observed, including the time of 
onset, the degree and duration.

[[Page 157]]

    (iv) Cage-side observations should include, but not be limited to, 
changes in skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, respiratory, 
circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity 
and behavior pattern.
    (v) Body weights should be recorded individually for all animals 
once a week during the first 13 weeks of the test period and at least 
once every 4 weeks thereafter unless signs of clinical toxicity suggest 
more frequent weighings to facilitate monitoring of health status.
    (vi) When the test substance is administered in the feed or drinking 
water, measurements of feed or water consumption, respectively, should 
be determined weekly during the first 13 weeks of the study and then at 
approximately monthly intervals unless health status or body weight 
changes dictate otherwise.
    (vii) At the end of the study period all survivors should be 
sacrificed. Moribund animals should be removed and sacrificed when 
noticed.
    (8) Physical measurements. For inhalation studies, measurements or 
monitoring should be made of the following:
    (i) The rate of air flow should be monitored continuously, but 
should be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
    (ii) During each exposure period the actual concentrations of the 
test substance should be held as constant as practicable, monitored 
continuously and measured at least three times during the test period: 
at the beginning, at an intermediate time and at the end of the period.
    (iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size 
analysis should be performed to establish the stability of aerosol 
concentrations. During exposure, analysis should be conducted as often 
as necessary to determine the consistency of particle size distribution 
and homogeneity of the exposure stream.
    (iv) Temperature and humidity should be monitored continuously, but 
should be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
    (9) Clinical examinations. The following examinations should be made 
on at least 10 rats of each sex per dose and on all non-rodents.
    (i) Certain hematology determinations (e.g., hemoglobin content, 
packed cell volume, total red blood cells, total white blood cells, 
platelets, or other measures of clotting potential) should be performed 
at termination and should be performed at 3 months, 6 months and at 
approximately 6 month intervals thereafter (for studies extending beyond 
12 months) on blood samples collected from all non-rodents and from 10 
rats per sex of all groups. These collections should be from the same 
animals at each interval. If clinical observations suggest a 
deterioration in health of the animals during the study, a differential 
blood count of the affected animals should be performed. A differential 
blood count should be performed on samples from those animals in the 
highest dosage group and the controls. Differential blood counts should 
be performed for the next lower group(s) if there is a major discrepancy 
between the highest group and the controls. If hematological effects 
were noted in the subchronic test, hematological testing should be 
performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for a two year study and at 3, 
6, and 12 months for a 1-year study.
    (ii) Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be 
carried out at least three times during the test period: just prior to 
initiation of dosing (base line data), near the middle and at the end of 
the test period. Blood samples should be drawn for clinical chemistry 
measurements from all non-rodents and at least ten rodents per sex of 
all groups; if possible, from the same rodents at each time interval. 
Test areas which are considered appropriate to all studies: electrolyte 
balance, carbohydrate metabolism and liver and kidney function. The 
selection of specific tests will be influenced by observations on the 
mode of action of the substance and signs of clinical toxicity. 
Suggested chemical determinations: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, 
sodium, potassium, fasting glucose (with period of fasting appropriate 
to the species), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (now known as serum 
alanine aminotransferase), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (now 
known

[[Page 158]]

as serum aspartate aminotransferase), ornithine decarboxylase, gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, albumen, blood creatinine, 
creatinine phosphokinase, total cholesterol, total bilirubin and total 
serum protein measurements. Other determinations which may be necessary 
for an adequate toxicological evaluation include analyses of lipids, 
hormones, acid/base balance, methemoglobin and cholinesterase activity. 
Additional clinical biochemistry may be employed where necessary to 
extend the investigation of observed effects.
    (iii) Urine samples from rodents at the same intervals as the 
hematological examinations under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section 
should be collected for analysis. The following determinations should be 
made from either individual animals or on a pooled sample/sex/group for 
rodents: appearance (volume and specific gravity), protein, glucose, 
ketones, bilirubin, occult blood (semi-quantitatively); and microscopy 
of sediment (semi-quantitatively).
    (iv) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or 
equivalent suitable equipment, should be made prior to the 
administration of the test substance and at the termination of the 
study. If changes in eyes are detected all animals should be examined.
    (10) Gross necropsy. (i) A complete gross examination should be 
performed on all animals, including those which died during the 
experiment or were killed in moribund conditions.
    (ii) The liver, kidneys, adrenals, brain and gonads should be 
weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying. For 
these organs, at least 10 rodents per sex per group and all non-rodents 
should be weighed.
    (iii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples 
thereof, should be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: All gross lesions and tumors; brain--
including sections of medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and cerebral 
cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; lungs; trachea; heart; 
sternum and/or femur with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; 
kidneys; adrenals; esophagus; stomach; duodenum; jejunum; ileum; cecum; 
colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative lymph nodes; pancreas; 
gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs (epididymis, prostate, and, if 
present, seminal vesicles; female mammary gland; aorta; gall bladder (if 
present); skin; musculature; peripheral nerve; spinal cord at three 
levels--cervical, midthoracic, and lumbar; and eyes. In inhalation 
studies, the entire respiratory tract, including nose, pharynx, larynx, 
and paranasal sinuses should be examined and preserved. In dermal 
studies, skin from sites of skin painting should be examined and 
preserved.
    (iv) Inflation of lungs and urinary bladder with a fixative is the 
optimal method for preservation of these tissues. The proper inflation 
and fixation of the lungs in inhalation studies is considered essential 
for appropriate and valid histopathological examination.
    (v) If other clinical examinations are carried out, the information 
obtained from these procedures should be available before microscopic 
examination, since they may provide significant guidance to the 
pathologist.
    (11) Histopathology. (i) The following histopathology should be 
performed:
    (A) Full histopathology on the organs and tissues, listed above, of 
all non-rodents, of all rodents in the control and high dose groups and 
of all rodents that died or were killed during the study.
    (B) All gross lesions in all animals.
    (C) Target organs in all animals.
    (D) Lungs, liver and kidneys of all animals. Special attention to 
examination of the lungs of rodents should be made for evidence of 
infection since this provides an assessment of the state of health of 
the animals.
    (ii) If excessive early deaths or other problems occur in the high 
dose group compromising the significance of the data, the next dose 
level should be examined for complete histopathology.
    (iii) In case the results of an experiment give evidence of 
substantial alteration of the animals' normal longevity or the induction 
of effects that might affect a toxic response, the next lower dose level 
should be examined fully, as described under paragraph (b)(11)(i) of 
this section.

[[Page 159]]

    (iv) An attempt should be made to correlate gross observations with 
microscopic findings.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data should be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, 
the types of lesions and the percentage of animals displaying each type 
of lesion.
    (ii) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, should be 
evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted 
statistical methods may be used; the statistical methods should be 
selected during the design of the study.
    (2) Evaluation of study results. (i) The findings of a chronic 
toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of 
preceding studies and considered in terms of the toxic effects, the 
necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will include the 
relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence, 
incidence and severity of abnormalities (including behavioral and 
clinical abnormalities), gross lesions, identified target organs, body 
weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific 
toxic effects.
    (ii) In any study which demonstrates an absence of toxic effects, 
further investigation to establish absorption and bioavailability of the 
test substance should be considered.
    (3) Test report. (i) In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792 subpart J, the following specific 
information should be reported:
    (A) Group animal data. Tabulation of toxic response data by species, 
strain, sex and exposure level for:
    (1) Number of animals dying.
    (2) Number of animals showing signs of toxicity.
    (3) Number of animals exposed.
    (B) Individual animal data. (1) Time of death during the study or 
whether animals survived to termination.
    (2) Time of observation of each abnormal sign and its subsequent 
course.
    (3) Body weight data.
    (4) Feed and water consumption data, when collected.
    (5) Results of ophthalmological examination, when performed.
    (6) Hematological tests employed and all results.
    (7) Clinical biochemistry tests employed and all results.
    (8) Necropsy findings.
    (9) Detailed description of all histopathological findings.
    (10) Statistical treatment of results, where appropriate.
    (ii) In addition, for inhalation studies the following should be 
reported:
    (A) Test conditions. (1) Description of exposure apparatus including 
design, type, dimensions, source of air, system for generating 
particulates and aerosols, method of conditioning air, treatment of 
exhaust air and the method of housing the animals in a test chamber.
    (2) The equipment for measuring temperature, humidity, and 
particulate aerosol concentrations and size should be described.
    (B) Exposure data. These should be tabulated and presented with mean 
values and a measure of variability (e.g., standard deviation) and 
should include:
    (1) Airflow rates through the inhalation equipment.
    (2) Temperature and humidity of air.
    (3) Nominal concentration (total amount of test substance fed into 
the inhalation equipment divided by volume of air).
    (4) Actual concentration in test breathing zone.

Sec. 798.3300  Oncogenicity.

    (a) Purpose. The objective of a long-term oncogenicity study is to 
observe test animals for a major portion of their life span for the 
development of neoplastic lesions during or after exposure to various 
doses of a test substance by an appropriate route of administration.
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain.  
A compound of unknown activity shall be tested on two mammalian species. 
Rats and mice are the species of choice because of their relatively 
short life spans, the limited cost of their maintenance, their 
widespread use in pharmacological and toxicological studies, their 
susceptibility to tumor induction, and the availability of inbred or 
sufficiently characterized strains. Commonly used laboratory strains 
shall be employed. If other species are used, the tester shall provide 
justification/reasoning for their selection.
    (ii) Age. (A) Dosing of rodents shall begin as soon as possible 
after weaning, ideally before the animals are 6 weeks old, but in no 
case more than 8 weeks old.
    (B) At commencement of the study, the weight variation of animals 
used shall not exceed <plus-minus>20 percent of the mean weight for each 
sex.
    (C) Studies using prenatal or neonatal animals may be recommended 
under special conditions.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Animals of each sex shall be used at each dose level.
    (B) The females shall be nulliparous and non-pregnant.
    (iv) Numbers. (A) For rodents, at least 100 animals (50 females and 
50 males) shall be used at each dose level and concurrent control.
    (B) If interim sacrifices are planned the number shall be increased 
by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed during the course of 
the study.
    (C) The number of animals at the termination of the study should be 
adequate for a meaningful and valid statistical evaluation of long term 
exposure. For a valid interpretation of negative results, it is 
essential that survival in all groups does not fall below 50 percent at 
the time of termination.
    (2) Control groups. (i) A concurrent control group is required. This 
group

[[Page 161]]

shall be an untreated or sham treated control group or, if a vehicle is 
used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control group. If 
the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be made 
available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.
    (ii) In special circumstances such as in inhalation studies 
involving aerosols or the use of an emulsifier of uncharacterized 
biological activity in oral studies, a concurrent negative control group 
shall be utilized. The negative control group shall be treated in the 
same manner as all other test animals except that this control group 
shall not be exposed to either the test substance or any vehicle.
    (iii) The use of historical control data (i.e., the incidence of 
tumors and other suspect lesions normally occurring under the same 
laboratory conditions and in the same strain of animals employed in the 
test) is desirable for assessing the significance of changes observed in 
exposed animals.
    (3) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) For risk assessment 
purposes, at least 3 dose levels shall be used, in addition to the 
concurrent control group. Dose levels should be spaced to produce a 
gradation of chronic effects.
    (ii) The high dose level should elicit signs of minimal toxicity 
without substantially altering the normal life span.
    (iii) The lowest dose should not interfere with normal growth, 
development and longevity of the animal; and it should not otherwise 
cause any indication of toxicity. In general, this should not be lower 
than ten percent of the high dose.
    (iv) The intermediate dose(s) should be established in a mid-range 
between the high and low doses, depending upon the toxicokinetic 
properties of the chemical, if known.
    (v) The selection of these dose levels should be based on existing 
data, preferably on the results of subchronic studies.
    (4) Exposure conditions. The animals are dosed with the test 
substance ideally on a 7 day per week basis over a period of at least 24 
months for rats, and 18 months for mice. However, based primarily on 
practical considerations, dosing on a 5 day per week basis is considered 
to be acceptable.
    (5) Observations period. It is necessary that the duration of an 
oncogenicity test comprise the majority of the normal life span of the 
strain of animals to be used. This time period shall not be less than 24 
months for rats and 18 months for mice, and ordinarily not longer than 
30 months for rats and 24 months for mice. For longer time periods, and 
where any other species are used, consultation with the Agency in regard 
to the duration of the test is advised.
    (6) Administration of the test substance. The three main routes of 
administration are oral, dermal, and inhalation. The choice of the route 
of administration depends upon the physical and chemical characteristics 
of the test substance and the form typifying exposure in humans.
    (i) Oral studies. (A) The animals shall receive the test substance 
in their diet, dissolved in drinking water at levels that do not exceed 
the maximum solubility of the test chemical under testing condition.
    (B) If the test substance is administered in the drinking water, or 
mixed in the diet, exposure shall be continuous.
    (C) For a diet mixture, the highest concentration should not exceed 
5 percent.
    (ii) Dermal studies. (A) The animals are treated by topical 
application with the test substance, ideally for at least 6 hours per 
day.
    (B) Fur should be clipped from the dorsal area of the trunk of the 
test animals. Care should be taken to avoid abrading the skin which 
could alter its permeability.
    (C) The test substance shall be applied uniformly over a shaved area 
which is approximately 10 percent of the total body surface area. With 
highly toxic substances, the surface area covered may be less, but as 
much of the area shall be covered with as thin and uniform a film as 
possible.
    (D) During the exposure period, the test substance may be held, if 
necessary, in contact with the skin with a porous gauze dressing and 
non-irritating tape. The test site should be further covered in a 
suitable manner to

[[Page 162]]

retain the gauze dressing and test substance and ensure that the animals 
cannot ingest the test substance.
    (iii) Inhalation studies. (A) The animals shall be tested with 
inhalation equipment designed to sustain a minimum dynamic air flow of 
12 to 15 air changes per hour, ensure an adequate oxygen content of 19 
percent and an evenly distributed exposure atmosphere. Where a chamber 
is used, its design should minimize crowding of the test animals and 
maximize their exposure to the test substance. This is best accomplished 
by individual caging. To ensure stability of a chamber atmosphere, the 
total ``volume'' of the test animals shall not exceed 5 percent of the 
volume of the test chamber. Alternatively, oro-nasal, head-only, or 
whole-body individual chamber exposure may be used.
    (B) The temperature at which the test is performed should be 
maintained at 22  deg.C (<plus-minus>2 deg.). Ideally, the relative 
humidity should be maintained between 40 to 60 percent, but in certain 
instances (e.g. tests of aerosols, use of water vehicle) this may not be 
practicable.
    (C) Feed and water shall be withheld during each daily 6-hour 
exposure period.
    (D) A dynamic inhalation system with a suitable flow control system 
shall be used. The rate of air flow shall be adjusted to ensure that 
conditions throughout the equipment are essentially the same. 
Maintenance of slight negative pressure inside the chamber will prevent 
leakage of the test substance into the surrounding areas.
    (7) Observations of animals. (i) Each animal shall be observed daily 
and if necessary should be handled to appraise its physical condition.
    (ii) Additional observations shall be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Clinical signs and mortality shall be recorded for all 
animals. Special attention should be paid to tumor development. The day 
of onset, location, dimensions, appearance and progression of each 
grossly visible or palpable tumor shall be recorded.
    (iv) Body weights shall be recorded individually for all animals 
once a week during the first 13 weeks of the test period and at least 
once every 4 weeks thereafter unless signs of clinical toxicity suggest 
more frequent weighings to facilitate monitoring of health status.
    (v) When the test substance is administered in the feed or drinking 
water, measurements of feed or water consumption, respectively, shall be 
determined weekly during the first 13 weeks of the study and then at 
approximately monthly intervals unless health status or body weight 
changes dictate otherwise.
    (vi) At the end of the study period all survivors are sacrificed. 
Moribund animals shall be removed and sacrificed when noticed.
    (8) Physical measurements. For inhalation studies, measurements or 
monitoring should be made of the following:
    (i) The rate of air flow shall be monitored continuously and 
recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
    (ii) During each exposure period the actual concentrations of the 
test substance shall be held as constant as practicable, monitored 
continuously and recorded at least three times during the test period: 
at the beginning, at an intermediate time and at the end of the period.
    (iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size 
analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of aerosol 
concentrations with respect to particle size. During exposure, analyses 
shall be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of 
particle size, distribution, and homogeneity of the exposure stream.
    (iv) Temperature and humidity shall be monitored continuously, but 
shoud be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
    (9) Clinical examinations. At 12 months, 18 months, and at 
sacrifice, a blood smear shall be obtained from all animals. A 
differential blood count shall be performed on blood smears

[[Page 163]]

from those animals in the highest dosage group and the controls. If 
these data, or data from the pathological examination indicate a need, 
then the 12- and 18-month blood smears from other dose levels shall also 
be examined. Differential blood counts shall be performed for the next 
lower group(s) if there is a major discrepancy between the highest group 
and the controls. If clinical observations suggest a deterioration in 
health of the animals during the study, a differential blood count of 
the affected animals shall be performed.
    (10) Gross necropsy. (i) A complete gross examination shall be 
performed on all animals, including those which died during the 
experiment or were killed in moribund conditions.
    (ii) The following organs and tissues or representative samples 
thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: All gross lesions and tumors of all 
animals shall be preserved; brain--including sections of medulla/pons, 
cerebellar cortex and cerebral cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; 
thymus; lungs; trachea; heart; spinal cord at three levels--cervical, 
midthoracic and lumbar; sternum and/or femur with bone marrow; salivary 
glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; adrenals; esophagus; stomach; duodenum; 
jejunum; ileum; cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative 
lymph nodes; pancreas; gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs 
(epididymis, prostate, and, if present, seminal vesicles); mammary 
gland; skin; musculature; peripheral nerve; and eyes. In inhalation 
studies, the entire respiratory tract shall be preserved, including 
nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx and paranasal sinuses. In dermal studies, 
skin from sites of skin painting shall be examined and preserved.
    (iii) Inflation of lungs and urinary bladder with a fixative is the 
optimal method for preservation of these tissues. The proper inflation 
and fixation of the lungs in inhalation studies is required for 
appropriate and valid histopathological examination.
    (iv) If other clinical examinations are carried out, the information 
obtained from these procedures shall be available before microscopic 
examination, since they may provide significant guidance to the 
pathologist.
    (11) Histopathology. (i) The following histopathology shall be 
performed:
    (A) Full histopathology on organs and tissues listed above of all 
animals in the control and high dose groups and all animals that died or 
were killed during the study.
    (B) All gross lesions in all animals.
    (C) Target organs in all animals.
    (ii) If a significant difference is observed in hyperplastic, pre-
neoplastic or neoplastic lesions between the highest dose and control 
groups, microscopic examination shall be made on that particular organ 
or tissue of all animals in the study.
    (iii) If excessive early deaths or other problems occur in the high 
dose group, compromising the significance of the data, the next lower 
dose level shall be examined for complete histopathology.
    (iv) In case the results of an experiment give evidence of 
substantial alteration of the animals' normal longevity or the induction 
of effects that might affect a neoplastic response, the next lower dose 
level shall be examined fully as described in this section.
    (v) An attempt shall be made to correlate gross observations with 
microscopic findings.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, 
the types of lesions and the percentage of animals displaying each type 
of lesion.
    (ii) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, shall be 
evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted 
statistical method may be used; the statistical methods shall be 
selected during the design of the study.
    (2) Evaluation of study results. (i) The findings of an oncogenic 
toxicity study shall be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of 
preceding studies and considered in terms of the toxic effects, the 
necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation shall include 
the relationship between the dose of the test substance and the 
presence, incidence and severity of abnormalities

[[Page 164]]

(including behavioral and clinical abnormalities), gross lesions, 
identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and 
any other general or specific toxic effects.
    (ii) In any study which demonstrates an absence of toxic effects, 
further investigation to establish absorption and bioavailability of the 
test substance should be considered.
    (iii) In order for a negative test to be acceptable, it shall meet 
the following criteria: no more than 10 percent of any group is lost due 
to autolysis, cannibalism, or management problems; and survival in each 
group should be no less than 50 percent at 18 months for mice and 
hamsters and at 24 months for rats.
    (3) Test report. (i) In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (A) Group animal data. Tabulation of toxic response data by species, 
strain, sex and exposure level for:

design, type, dimensions, source of air, system for generating 
particulates and aerosols, method of conditioning air, treatment of 
exhaust air and the method of housing the animals in a test chamber.
    (2) The equipment for measuring temperature, humidity, and

Sec. 798.3320  Combined chronic toxicity/oncogenicity.

    (a) Purpose. The objective of a combined chronic toxicity/
oncogenicity study is to determine the effects of a substance in a 
mammalian species following prolonged and repeated exposure. The 
application of this guideline should generate data which identify the 
majority of chronic and oncogenic effects and determine dose-response 
relationships. The design and conduct should allow for the detection of 
neoplastic effects and a determination of oncogenic potential as well as 
general toxicity, including neurological, physiological, biochemical, 
and hematological effects and exposure-related morphological (pathology) 
effects.
    (b) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Preliminary studies providing data on acute, subchronic, and metabolic 
responses should have been carried out to permit an appropriate choice 
of animals (species and strain). As discussed in other guidelines, the 
mouse and rat have been most widely used for assessment of oncogenic 
potential, while the rat and dog have been most often studied for 
chronic toxicity. The rat is the species of choice for combined chronic 
toxicity and oncogenicity studies. The provisions of this guideline are 
designed primarily for use with the rat as the test species. If other 
species are used, the tester should provide justification/reasoning for 
their selection. The strain selected should be susceptible to the 
oncogenic or toxic effect of the class of substances being tested, if 
known, and provided it does not have a spontaneous background too high 
for meaningful assessment. Commonly used laboratory strains should be 
employed.
    (ii) Age. (A) Dosing of rats should begin as soon as possible after 
weaning, ideally before the rats are 6 weeks old, but in no case more 
than 8 weeks old.
    (B) At commencement of the study, the weight variation of animals 
used should not exceed <plus-minus>20 percent of the mean weight for 
each sex.
    (C) Studies using prenatal or neonatal animals may be recommended 
under special conditions.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex should be used 
at each dose level.
    (B) The females should be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (iv) Numbers. (A) At least 100 rodents (50 females and 50 males) 
should be used at each dose level and concurrent

[[Page 166]]

control for those groups not intended for early sacrifice. At least 40 
rodents (20 females and 20 males) should be used for satellite dose 
group(s) and the satellite control group. The purpose of the satellite 
group is to allow for the evaluation of pathology other than neoplasia.
    (B) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number of animals should 
be increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed during 
the course of the study.
    (C) The number of animals at the termination of each phase of the 
study should be adequate for a meaningful and valid statistical 
evaluation of long term exposure. For a valid interpretation of negative 
results, it is essential that survival in all groups not fall below 50 
percent at the time of termination.
    (2) Control groups. (i) A concurrent control group (50 females and 
50 males) and a satellite control group (20 females and 20 males) are 
recommended. These groups should be untreated or sham treated control 
groups or, if a vehicle is used in administering the test substance, 
vehicle control groups. If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not 
known or cannot be made available, both untreated and vehicle control 
groups are recommended. Animals in the satellite control group should be 
sacrificed at the same time the satellite test group is terminated.
    (ii) In special circumstances such as inhalation studies involving 
aerosols or the use of an emulsifier of uncharacterized biological 
activity in oral studies, a concurrent negative control group should be 
utilized. The negative control group should be treated in the same 
manner as all other test animals, except that this control group should 
not be exposed to the test substance or any vehicle.
    (iii) The use of historical control data (i.e., the incidence of 
tumors and other suspect lesions normally occuring under the same 
laboratory conditions and in the same strain of animals employed in the 
test) is desirable for assessing the significance of changes observed in 
exposed animals.
    (3) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) For risk assessment 
purposes, at least three dose levels should be used, in addition to the 
concurrent control group. Dose levels should be spaced to produce a 
gradation of effects.
    (ii) The highest dose level in rodents should elicit signs of 
toxicity without substantially altering the normal life span due to 
effects other than tumors.
    (iii) The lowest dose level should produce no evidence of toxicity. 
Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure, the lowest dose 
level should exceed this even though this dose level may result in some 
signs of toxicity.
    (iv) Ideally, the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal 
observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used the 
dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.
    (v) For rodents, the incidence of fatalities in low and intermediate 
dose groups and in the controls should be low to permit a meaningful 
evaluation of the results.
    (vi) For chronic toxicological assessment, a high dose treated 
satellite and a concurrent control satellite group should be included in 
the study design. The highest dose for satellite animals should be 
chosen so as to produce frank toxicity, but not excessive lethality, in 
order to elucidate a chronic toxicological profile of the test 
substance. If more than one dose level is selected for satellite dose 
groups, the doses should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic 
effects.
    (4) Exposure conditions. The animals are dosed with the test 
substance ideally on a 7-day per week basis over a period of at least 24 
months for rats, and 18 months for mice and hamsters, except for the 
animals in the satellite groups which should be dosed for 12 months.
    (5) Observation period. It is necessary that the duration of the 
oncogenicity test comprise the majority of the normal life span of the 
animals to be used. It has been suggested that the duration of the study 
should be for the entire lifetime of all animals. However, a few animals 
may greatly exceed the average lifetime and the duration of the study 
may be unnecessarily extended

[[Page 167]]

and complicate the conduct and evaluation of the study. Rather, a finite 
period covering the majority of the expected life span of the strain is 
preferred since the probability is high that, for the great majority of 
chemicals, induced tumors will occur within such an observation period. 
The following guidelines are recommended:
    (i) Generally, the termination of the study should be at 18 months 
for mice and hamsters and 24 months for rats; however, for certain 
strains of animals with greater longevity and/or low spontaneous tumor 
rate, termination should be at 24 months for mice and hamsters and at 30 
months for rats. For longer time periods, and where any other species 
are used, consultation with the Agency in regard to duration of the test 
is advised.
    (ii) However, termination of the study is acceptable when the number 
of survivors of the lower doses or of the control group reaches 25 
percent. In the case where only the high dose group dies prematurely for 
obvious reasons of toxicity, this should not trigger termination of the 
study.
    (iii) The satellite groups and the concurrent satellite control 
group should be retained in the study for at least 12 months. These 
groups should be scheduled for sacrifice for an estimation of test-
substance-related pathology uncomplicated by geriatric changes.
    (6) Administration of the test substance. The three main routes of 
administration are oral, dermal, and inhalation. The choice of the route 
of administration depends upon the physical and chemical characteristics 
of the test substance and the form typifying exposure in humans.
    (i) Oral studies. (A) The animals should receive the test substance 
in their diet, dissolved in drinking water, or given by gavage or 
capsule for a period of at least 24 months for rats and 18 months for 
mice and hamsters.
    (B) If the test substance is administered in the drinking water, or 
mixed in the diet, exposure is continuous.
    (C) For a diet mixture, the highest concentration should not exceed 
5 percent.
    (ii) Dermal studies. (A) The animals are treated by topical 
application with the test substance, ideally for at least 6 hours per 
day.
    (B) Fur should be clipped from the dorsal area of the trunk of the 
test animals. Care should be taken to avoid abrading the skin which 
could alter its permeability.
    (C) The test substance should be applied uniformly over a shaved 
area which is approximately 10 percent of the total body surface area. 
With highly toxic substances, the surface area covered may be less, but 
as much of the area as possible should be covered with as thin and 
uniform a film as possible.
    (D) During the exposure period, the test substance may be held, if 
necessary, in contact with the skin with a porous gauze dressing and 
nonirritating tape. The test site should be further covered in a 
suitable manner to retain the gauze dressing and test substance and 
ensure that the animals cannot ingest the test substance.
    (iii) Inhalation studies. (A) The animals should be tested with 
inhalation equipment designed to sustain a dynamic air flow of 12 to 15 
air changes per hour, to ensure an adequate oxygen content of 19 percent 
and an evenly distributed exposure atmosphere. Where a chamber is used, 
its design should minimize crowding of the test animals and maximize 
their exposure to the test substance. This is best accomplished by 
individual caging. As a general rule, to ensure stability of a chamber 
atmosphere, the total ``volume'' of the test animals should not exceed 5 
percent of the volume of the test chamber. Alternatively, oro-nasal, 
head only, or whole body individual chamber exposure may be used.
    (B) The temperature at which the test is performed should be 
maintained at 22 <SUP>+</SUP>C (<plus-minus>2<SUP>+</SUP>). Ideally, the 
relative humidity should be maintained between 40 to 60 percent, but in 
certain instances (e.g., tests of aerosols, use of water vehicle) this 
may not be practicable.
    (C) Feed and water should be withheld during each daily 6-hour 
exposure period.
    (D) A dynamic inhalation system with a suitable analytical 
concentration control system should be used. The rate of air flow should 
be adjusted to ensure that conditions throughout

[[Page 168]]

the equipment are essentially the same. Maintenance of slight negative 
pressure inside the chamber will prevent leakage of the test substance 
into the surrounding areas.
    (7) Observation of animals. (i) Each animal should be handled and 
its physical condition appraised at least once each day.
    (ii) Additional observations should be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Clinical signs and mortality should be recorded for all 
animals. Special attention should be paid to tumor development. The time 
of onset, location, dimensions, appearance and progression of each 
grossly visible or palpable tumor should be recorded.
    (iv) Body weights should be recorded individually for all animals 
once a week during the first 13 weeks of the test period and at least 
once every 4 weeks thereafter, unless signs of clinical toxicity suggest 
more frequent weighings to facilitate monitoring of health status.
    (v) When the test substance is administered in the feed or drinking 
water, measurements of feed or water consumption, respectively, should 
be determined weekly during the first 13 weeks of the study and then at 
approximately monthly intervals unless health status or body weight 
changes dictate otherwise.
    (vi) At the end of the study period, all survivors are sacrificed. 
Moribund animals should be removed and sacrificed when noticed.
    (8) Physical measurements. For inhalation studies, measurements or 
monitoring should be made of the following:
    (i) The rate of airflow should be monitored continuously, but should 
be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
    (ii) During each exposure period the actual concentrations of the 
test substance should be held as constant as practicable, monitored 
continuously and recorded at least three times during the test period: 
At the beginning, at an intermediate time and at the end of the period.
    (iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size 
analysis should be performed to establish the stability of aerosol 
concentrations. During exposure, analyses should be conducted as often 
as necessary to determine the consistency of particle size distribution 
and homogeneity of the exposure stream.
    (iv) Temperature and humidity should be monitored continuously, but 
should be recorded at intervals of at least once every 30 minutes.
    (9) Clinical examinations. (i) The following examinations should be 
made on at least 20 rodents of each sex per dose level:
    (A) Certain hematology determinations (e.g., hemoglobin content, 
packed cell volume, total red blood cells, total white blood cells, 
platelets, or other measures of clotting potential) should be performed 
at termination and should be performed at 3 months, 6 months and at 
approximately 6-month intervals thereafter (for those groups on test for 
longer than 12 months) on blood samples collected from 20 rodents per 
sex of all groups. These collections should be from the same animals at 
each interval. If clinical observations suggest a deterioration in 
health of the animals during the study, a differential blood count of 
the affected animals should be performed. A differential blood count 
should be performed on samples from animals in the highest dosage group 
and the controls. Differential blood counts should be performed for the 
next lower group(s) if there is a major discrepancy between the highest 
group and the controls. If hematological effects were noted in the 
subchronic test, hematological testing should be performed at 3, 6, 12, 
18 and 24 months for a year study.
    (B) Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be 
carried out at least three times during the test period: Just prior to 
initiation of dosing (baseline data), near the middle and at the end of 
the test period. Blood samples should be drawn for clinical measurements 
from at least ten rodents per sex of all groups; if possible, from the 
same rodents at each time interval. Test areas which are considered

[[Page 169]]

appropriate to all studies: electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism 
and liver and kidney function. The selection of specific tests will be 
influenced by observations on the mode of action of the substance and 
signs of clinical toxicity. Suggested chemical determinations: Calcium, 
phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, fasting glucose (with period of 
fasting appropriate to the species), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 
(now known as serum alanine aminotransferase), serum glutamic 
oxaloacetic transaminase (now known as serum aspartate 
aminotransferase), ornithine decarboxylase, gamma glutamyl 
transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, albumen, creatinine phosphokinase, 
total cholesterol, total bilirubin and total serum protein measurements. 
Other determinations which may be necessary for an adequate 
toxicological evaluation include analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base 
balance, methemoglobin and cholinesterase activity. Additional clinical 
biochemistry may be employed where necessary to extend the investigation 
of observed effects.
    (ii) The following should be performed on at least 10 rodents of 
each sex per dose level:
    (A) Urine samples from the same rodents at the same intervals as 
hematological examination above, should be collected for analysis. The 
following determinations should be made from either individual animals 
or on a pooled sample/sex/group for rodents: appearance (volume and 
specific gravity), protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood 
(semi-quantitatively) and microscopy of sediment (semi-quantitatively).
    (B) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or 
equivalent suitable equipment, should be made prior to the 
administration of the test substance and at the termination of the 
study. If changes in the eyes are detected, all animals should be 
examined.
    (10) Gross necropsy. (i) A complete gross examination should be 
performed on all animals, including those which died during the 
experiment or were killed in moribund conditions.
    (ii) The liver, kidneys, adrenals, brain and gonads should be 
weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying. For 
these organs, at least 10 rodents per sex per group should be weighed.
    (iii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples 
thereof, should be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: All gross lesions and tumors; brain-
including sections of medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and cerebral 
cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; lungs; trachea; heart; 
sternum and/or femur with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; 
kidneys; adrenals; esophagus; stomach; duodenum; jejunum; ileum; cecum; 
colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative lymph nodes; pancreas; 
gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs (epididymis, prostate, and, if 
present, seminal vesicles); female mammary gland; aorta; gall bladder 
(if present); skin; musculature; peripheral nerve; spinal cord at three 
levels--cervical, midthoracic, and lumbar; and eyes. In inhalation 
studies, the entire respiratory tract, including nose, pharynx, larynx 
and paranasal sinuses should be examined and preserved. In dermal 
studies, skin from sites of skin painting should be examined and 
preserved.
    (iv) Inflation of lungs and urinary bladder with a fixative is the 
optimal method for preservation of these tissues. The proper inflation 
and fixation of the lungs in inhalation studies is considered essential 
for appropriate and valid histopathological examination.
    (v) If other clinical examinations are carried out, the information 
obtained from these procedures should be available before microscopic 
examination, since they may provide significant guidance to the 
pathologist.
    (11) Histopathology. (i) The following histopathology should be 
performed:
    (A) Full histopathology on the organs and tissues, listed above, of 
all non-rodents, of all rodents in the control and high dose groups and 
of all rodents that died or were killed during the study.
    (B) All gross lesions in all animals.
    (C) Target organs in all animals.

[[Page 170]]

    (D) Lungs, liver and kidneys of all animals. Special attention to 
examination of the lungs of rodents should be made for evidence of 
infection since this provides an assessment of the state of health of 
the animals.
    (ii) If excessive early deaths or other problems occur in the high 
dose group compromising the significance of the data, the next dose 
level should be examined for complete histopathology.
    (iii) In case the results of the experiment give evidence of 
substantial alteration of the animals' normal longevity or the induction 
of effects that might affect a toxic response, the next lower dose level 
should be examined as described above.
    (iv) An attempt should be made to correlate gross observations with 
microscopic findings.
    (c) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data should be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, 
the types of lesions and the percentage of animals displaying each type 
of lesion.
    (ii) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, should be 
evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted 
statistical methods may be used; the statistical methods should be 
selected during the design of the study.
    (2) Evaluation of study results. (i) The findings of a combined 
chronic toxicity/oncogenicity study should be evaluated in conjunction 
with the findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of the 
toxic effects, the necropsy and histopathological findings. The 
evaluation will include the relationship between the dose of the test 
substance and the presence, incidence and severity of abnormalities 
(including behavioral and clinical abnormalities), gross lesions, 
identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and 
any other general or specific toxic effects.
    (ii) In any study which demonstrates an absence of toxic effects, 
further investigation to establish absorption and bioavailablity of the 
test substance should be considered.
    (iii) In order for a negative test to be acceptable, it should meet 
the following criteria: No more than 10 percent of any group is lost due 
to autolysis, cannibalism, or management problems; and survival in each 
group is no less than 50 percent at 18 months for mice and hamsters and 
at 24 months for rats.
    (3) Test report. (i) In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information should be reported:
    (A) Group animal data. Tabulation of toxic response data by species, 
strain, sex and exposure level for:
    (1) Number of animals dying.
    (2) Number of animals showing signs of toxicity.
    (3) Number of animals exposed.
    (B) Individual animal data. (1) Time of death during the study or 
whether animals survived to termination.
    (2) Time of observation of each abnormal sign and its subsequent 
course.
    (3) Body weight data.
    (4) Feed and water consumption data, when collected.
    (5) Results of ophthalmological examination, when performed.
    (6) Hematological tests employed and all results.
    (7) Clinical biochemistry tests employed and all results.
    (8) Necropsy findings.
    (9) Detailed description of all histopathological findings.
    (10) Statistical treatment of results where appropriate.
    (11) Historical control data, if taken into account.
    (ii) In addition, for inhalation studies the following should be 
reported:
    (A) Test Conditions. (1) Description of exposure apparatus including 
design, type, dimensions, source of air, system for generating 
particulates and aerosols, method of conditioning air, treatment of 
exhaust air and the method of housing the animals in a test chamber.
    (2) The equipment for measuring temperature, humidity, and 
particulate aerosol concentrations and size should be described.
    (B) Exposure data. These should be tabulated and presented with mean 
values and a measure of variability (e.g. standard deviation) and should 
include:
    (1) Airflow rates through the inhalation equipment.

[[Page 171]]

    (2) Temperature and humidity of air.
    (3) Nominal concentration (total amount of test substance fed into 
the inhalation equipment divided by volume of air).
    (4) Actual concentration in test breathing zone.

                Subpart E--Specific Organ/Tissue Toxicity


<R05>
Sec. 798.4100  Dermal sensitization.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of a substance, determination of its potential to 
provoke skin sensitization reactions is important. Information derived 
from tests for skin sensitization serves to identify the possible hazard 
to a population repeatedly exposed to a test substance. While the 
desirability of skin sensitization testing is recognized, there are some 
real differences of opinion about the best method to use. The test 
selected should be a reliable screening procedure which should not fail 
to identify substances with significant allergenic potential, while at 
the same time avoiding false negative results.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Skin sensitization (allergic contact 
dermatitis) is an immunologically mediated cutaneous reaction to a 
substance. In the human, the responses may be characterized by pruritis, 
erythema, edema, papules, vesicles, bullae, or a combination of these. 
In other species the reactions may differ and only erythema and edema 
may be seen.
    (2) Induction period is a period of at least 1 week following a 
sensitization exposure during which a hypersensitive state is developed.
    (3) Induction exposure is an experimental exposure of a subject to a 
test substance with the intention of inducing a hypersensitive state.
    (4) Challenge exposure is an experimental exposure of a previously 
treated subject to a test substance following an induction period, to 
determine whether the subject will react in a hypersensitive manner.
    (c) Principle of the test method. Following initial exposure(s) to a 
test substance, the animals are subsequently subjected, after a period 
of not less than 1 week, to a challenge exposure with the test substance 
to establish whether a hypersensitive state has been induced. 
Sensitization is determined by examining the reaction to the challenge 
exposure and comparing this reaction to that of the initial induction 
exposure.
    (d) Test procedures. (1) Any of the following seven test methods is 
considered to be acceptable. It is realized, however, that the methods 
differ in their probability and degree of reaction to sensitizing 
substances.
    (i) Freund's complete adjuvant test.
    (ii) Guinea-pig maximization test.
    (iii) Split adjuvant technique.
    (iv) Buehler test.
    (v) Open epicutaneous test.
    (vi) Mauer optimization test.
    (vii) Footpad technique in guinea pig.
    (2) Removal of hair is by clipping, shaving, or possibly by 
depilation, depending on the test method used.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. The young adult guinea 
pig is the preferred species. Commonly used laboratory strains should be 
employed. If other species are used, the tester should provide 
justification/reasoning for their selection.
    (ii) Number and sex. (A) The number and sex of animals used will 
depend on the method employed.
    (B) The females should be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (4) Control animals. (i) Periodic use of a positive control 
substance with an acceptable level of reliability for the test system 
selected is recommended;
    (ii) Animals may act as their own controls or groups of induced 
animals can be compared to groups which have received only a challenge 
exposure.
    (5) Dose levels. The dose level will depend upon the method 
selected.
    (6) Observation of animals. (i) Skin reactions should be graded and 
recorded after the challenge exposures at the time specified by the 
methodology selected. This is usually at 24, 48, and 72,

[[Page 173]]

hours. Additional notations should be made as necessary to fully 
describe unusual responses;
    (ii) Regardless of method selected, initial and terminal body 
weights should be recorded.
    (7) Procedures. The procedures to be used are those described by the 
methodology chosen.
    (e) Data and reporting. (1) Data should be summarized in tabular 
form, showing for each individual animal the skin reaction, results of 
the induction exposure(s) and the challenge exposure(s) at times 
indicated by the method chosen. As a minimum, the erythema and edema 
should be graded and any unusual finding should be recorded.
    (2) Evaluation of the results. The evaluation of results will 
provide information on the proportion of each group that became 
sensitized and the extent (slight, moderate, severe) of the 
sensitization reaction in each individual animal.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific 
information should be reported:
    (i) A description of the method used and the commonly accepted name.
    (ii) Information on the positive control study, including positive 
control used, method used, and time conducted.
    (iii) The number and sex of the test animals.
    (iv) Species and strain.
    (v) Individual weights of the animals at the start of the test and 
at the conclusion of the test.
    (vi) A brief description of the grading system.
    (vii) Each reading made on each individual animal.
    (f) References. For additional background information on this test 
guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 798.4350  Inhalation developmental toxicity study.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of an inhalable material such as a gas, volatile 
substance, or aerosol/particulate, determination of the potential 
developmental toxicity is important. The inhalation developmental 
toxicity study is designed to provide information on the potential 
hazard to the unborn which may arise from exposure of the mother during 
pregnancy.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Developmental toxicity is the property of a 
chemical that causes in utero death, structural or functional 
abnormalities or growth retardation during the period of development.
    (2) ``Aerodynamic diameter'' applies to the behavioral size of 
particles of aerosols. It is the diameter of a sphere 

[[Page 174]]

of unit density which behaves aerodynamically like the particles of the 
test substance. It is used to compare particles of different sizes, 
shapes, and densities and to predict where in the respiratory tract such 
particles may be deposited. This term is used in contrast to 
``optical,'' ``measured'' or `'geometric'' diameters which are 
representation of actual diameters which in themselves cannot be related 
to deposition within the respiratory tract.
    (3) ``Geometric mean diameter'' or ``median diameter'' is the 
calculated aerodynamic diameter which divides the particles of an 
aerosol in half based on the weight of the particles. Fifty percent of 
the particles by weight will be larger than the median diameter and 50 
percent of the particles will be smaller than the median diameter. The 
median diameter and its geometeric standard deviation are used to 
statistically describe the particle size distribution of any aerosol 
based on the weight and size of the particles.
    (4) ``Inhalable diameter'' refers to that aerodynamic diameter of a 
particle which is considered to be inhalable for the organism. It is 
used to refer to particles which are capable of being inhaled and may be 
deposited anywhere within the respiratory tract from the trachea to the 
deep lung (the alveoli). For man, the inhalable diameter is considered 
here as 15 micrometers or less.
    (5) ``Concentration'' refers to an exposure level. Exposure is 
expressed as weight or volume of test substance per volume of air (mg/
1), or as parts per million (ppm).
    (6) ``No-observed-effect level'' is the maximum concentration in a 
test which produces no observed adverse effects. A no-observed-effect 
level is expressed in terms of weight or volume of test substance given 
daily per unit volume of air.
    (c) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
in graduated concentrations, for at least that part of the pregnancy 
covering the major period of organogenesis, to several groups of 
pregnant experimental animals, one exposure level being used per group. 
Shortly before the expected date of delivery, the pregnant females are 
sacrificed, the uteri removed, and the contents examined for embryonic 
or fetal deaths, and live fetuses.
    (d) Limit test. If a test at an exposure of 5 mg/1 (actual 
concentration of respirable substances) or, where this is not possible 
due to physical or chemical properties of the test substance, the 
maximum attainable concentration, produces no observable developmental 
toxicity, then a full study using three exposure levels might not be 
necessary.
    (e) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Testing shall be performed in at least two mamalian species. Commonly 
used species include the rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster. If other 
mamalian species are used, the tester shall provide justification/
reasoning for their selection. Commonly used laboratory strains shall be 
employed. The strain shall not have low fecundity and shall preferably 
be characterized for its sensitivity to developmental toxins.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals (nulliparous females) shall be used.
    (iii) Sex. Pregnant female animals shall be used at each exposure 
level.
    (iv) Number of animals. At least 20 pregnant rats, mice, or hamsters 
or 12 pregnant rabbits are required at each exposure level. The 
objective is to ensure that sufficient pups are produced to permit 
meaningful evaluation of the potential developmental toxicity of the 
test substance.
    (2) Control group. A concurrent control group shall be used. This 
group shall be exposed to clean, filtered air under conditions identical 
to those used for the group exposed to the substance of interest. In 
addition, a vehicle-exposed group may be necessary when the substance 
under study requires a vehicle for delivery. It is recommended that 
during preliminary range finding studies, air vs. vehicle exposure be 
compared. If there is no substantial difference, air exposure itself 
would be an appropriate control. If vehicle and air exposure yield 
different results, both vehicle and air exposed control groups are 
recommended.
    (3) Concentration levels and concentration selection. (i) At least 
three concentration levels with a control and, where appropriate, a 
vehicle control, shall be used.

[[Page 175]]

    (ii) The vehicle shall neither be developmentally toxic nor have 
effects on reproduction.
    (iii) To select the appropriate concentration levels, a pilot or 
trial study may be advisable. Since pregnant animals have an increased 
minute ventilation as compared to non-pregnant animals, it is 
recommended that the trial study be conducted in pregnant animals. 
Similarly, since presumably the minute ventilation will vary with 
progression of pregnancy, the animals should be exposed during the same 
period of gestation as in the main study. In the trial study, the 
concentration producing embryonic or fetal lethalities or maternal 
toxicity should be determined.
    (iv) Unless limited by the physical/chemical nature or biological 
properties of the substance, the highest concentration level shall 
induce some overt maternal toxicity such as reduced body weight or body 
weight gain, but not more than 10 percent maternal deaths.
    (v) The lowest concentration level should not produce any grossly 
observable evidence of either maternal or developmental toxicity.
    (vi) Ideally, the intermediate concentration level(s) shall produce 
minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate 
concentration is used, the concentration levels shall be spaced to 
produce a gradation of toxic effects.
    (4) Exposure duration. The duration of exposure shall be at least 
six hours daily allowing appropriate additional time for chamber 
equilibrium.
    (5) Observation period. Day 0 in the test is the day on which a 
vaginal plug and/or sperm are observed. The exposure period shall cover 
the period of major organogenesis. This may be taken as days 6 to 15 for 
rat and mouse, 6 to 14 for hamster, or 6 to 18 for rabbit.
    (6) Inhalation exposure. (i)(A) The animals shall be tested in 
inhalation equipment designed to sustain a minimum dynamic air flow of 
12 to 15 air changes per hour and ensure an adequate oxygen content of 
19 percent and an evenly distributed exposure atmosphere. Where a 
chamber is used, its design should minimize crowding of the test animals 
and maximize their exposure to the test substance. This is best 
accomplished by individual caging. To ensure stability of a chamber 
atmosphere, the total ``volume'' of the test animals shall not exceed 5 
percent of the volume of the test chamber.
    (B) Pregnant animals shall not be subjected to beyond the minimum 
amount of stress. Since whole-body exposure appears to be the least 
stressful mode of exposure, it is the method preferred. In general oro-
nasal or head-only exposure, which is sometimes used to avoid concurrent 
exposure by the dermal or oral routes, is not recommended because of the 
associated stress accompanying the restraining of the animals. However, 
there may be specific instances where it may be more appropriate than 
whole-body exposure. The tester shall provide justification/reasoning 
for its selection.
    (ii) A dynamic inhalation system with a suitable flow control system 
shall be used. The rate of air flow shall be adjusted to ensure that 
conditions throughout the exposure chamber are essentially the same. 
Test material distribution should be established before animals are 
committed to dosing. Maintenance of slight negative pressure inside the 
chamber will prevent leakage of the test substance into the surrounding 
areas.
    (iii) The temperature at which the test is performed should be 
maintained at 22  deg.C (<plus-minus>2 deg.) for rodents or 20  deg.C 
(<plus-minus>3 deg.) for rabbits. Ideally, the relative humidity should 
be maintained between 40 to 60 percent, but in certain instances (e.g., 
tests of aerosols, use of water vehicle) this may not be practicable.
    (7) Physical measurements. Measurements or monitoring should be made 
of the following:
    (i) The rate of airflow shall be monitored continuously but shall be 
recorded at least every 30 minutes.
    (ii) The actual concentration of the test substance shall be 
measured in the breathing zone. During the exposure period the actual 
concentrations of the test substance shall be held as constant as 
practicable, monitored continously or intermittently depending on the 
method of analysis and measured at least at the beginning, at an 
intermediate time and at the end of the exposure period.

[[Page 176]]

    (iii) During the development of the generating system, particle size 
analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of aerosol 
concentrations with respect to particle size. During exposure, analysis 
shall be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of 
particle size distribution.
    (iv) Temperature and humidity shall be monitored continuously and be 
recorded at least every 30 minutes.
    (8) Food and water during exposure period. Food should be withheld 
during exposure. Water may or may not be withheld. If it is not withheld 
it should not come in direct contact with the test atmospheres.
    (9) Observation of animals. (i) A gross examination shall be made at 
least once each day.
    (ii) Additional observations should be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice of 
weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, 
including the time of onset, the degree and duration.
    (iv) Cage-side observations shall include, but not be limited to: 
Changes in skin and fur, eye and mucous membranes, as well as 
respiratory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity 
and behavioral pattern. Particular attention should be directed to 
observation of tremors, convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, lethargy, 
sleep, and coma.
    (v) Measurements should be made weekly of food consumption for all 
animals in the study.
    (vi) Animals shall be weighed at least weekly.
    (vii) Females showing signs of abortion or premature delivery shall 
be sacrificed and subjected to a thorough macroscopic examination.
    (10) Gross necropsy. (i) At the time of sacrifice or death during 
the study, the dam shall be examined macroscopically for any structural 
abnormalities or pathological changes which may have influenced the 
pregnancy.
    (ii) Immediately after sacrifice or death, the uterus shall be 
removed, weighed, and the contents examined for embryonic or fetal 
deaths and the number of viable fetuses. Gravid uterine weights should 
not be obtained from dead animals if autolysis or where decomposition 
has occurred. The degree of resorption shall be described in order to 
help estimate the relative time of death.
    (iii) The number of corpora lutea shall be determined for all 
species except mice.
    (iv) The sex of the fetuses shall be determined and they shall be 
weighed individually, the weights recorded, and the mean fetal weight 
derived.
    (v) Following removal, each fetus shall be examined externally.
    (vi) For rats, mice and hamsters, one-third to one-half of each 
litter shall be prepared and examined for skeletal anomalies, and the 
remaining part of each litter shall be prepared and examined for soft 
tissue anomalies using appropriate methods.
    (vii) For rabbits, each fetus shall be examined by careful 
dissection for visceral anomalies and then examined for skeletal 
anomalies.
    (f) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group: the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of pregnant animals, the 
number and percentages of live fetuses and the number of fetuses with 
any soft tissue or skeletal abnormalities.
    (2) Evaluation of results. The findings of a developmental toxicity 
study shall be evaluated in terms of the observed effects and the 
exposure levels producing effects. It is necessary to consider the 
historical developmental toxicity data on the species/strain tested. A 
properly conducted developmental toxicity study should provide a 
satisfactory estimation of a no-effect level.

specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Test conditions. (A) Description of exposure apparatus including 
design, type, dimensions, source of air, system for generating 
particulates and aerosols, methods of conditioning air, and the method 
of housing the animals in a

Sec. 798.4700  Reproduction and fertility effects.

    (a) Purpose. This guideline for two-generation reproduction testing 
is designed to provide general information concerning the effects of a 
test substance on gonadal function, conception, parturition, and the 
growth and development of the offspring. The study may also provide 
information about the effects of the test substance on neonatal 
morbidity, mortality, and preliminary data on teratogenesis and serve as 
a guide for subsequent tests.
    (b) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
to parental (P) animals prior to their mating, during the resultant 
pregnancies, and through the weaning of their F<INF>1</INF> offspring. 
The substance is then administered to selected F<INF>1</INF> offspring 
during their growth into adulthood, mating, and production of an 
F<INF>2</INF> generation, up until the F<INF>2</INF> generation is 
weaned.
    (c) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
The rat is the preferred species. If another mammalian species is used, 
the tester shall provide justification/reasoning for its selection. 
Strains with low fecundity shall not be used.
    (ii) Age. Parental (P) animals shall be about 5 to 8 weeks old at 
the start of dosing.
    (iii) Sex. (A) For an adequate assessment of fertility, both males 
and females shall be studied.
    (B) The females shall be nulliparous and non-pregnant.
    (iv) Number of animals. Each test and control group shall contain at 
least 20 males and a sufficient number of females to yield at least 20 
pregnant females at or near term.
    (2) Control groups. (i) A concurrent control group shall be used. 
This group shall be an untreated or sham treated control group or if a 
vehicle is used in

[[Page 178]]

administering the test substance, a vehicle control group.
    (ii) If a vehicle is used in administering the test substance, the 
control group shall receive the vehicle in the highest volume used.
    (iii) If a vehicle or other additive is used to facilitate dosing, 
it shall not interfere significantly with absorption of the test 
substance or produce toxic effects.
    (3) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) At least three dose levels 
and a concurrent control shall be used.
    (ii) The highest dose level should induce toxicity but not high 
levels of mortality in the parental (P) animals.
    (iii) The lowest dose level should not produce any grossly 
observable evidence of toxicity.
    (iv) Ideally the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal 
observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate dose is used, 
dose levels should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.
    (4) Exposure conditions. The animals should be dosed with the test 
substance, ideally, on a 7 days per week basis.
    (i) Dosing, mating, delivery, and sacrifice schedule.
    (A) Daily dosing of the parental (P) males and females shall begin 
when they are 5 to 8 weeks old. For both sexes, dosing shall be 
continued for at least 10 weeks before the mating period.
    (B) Dosing of P males shall continue through the 3 week mating 
period. At the end of the mating period, P males may be sacrificed and 
examined, or may be retained for possible production of a second litter. 
If these animals are retained for a second litter, dosing shall be 
continued. Dosing of the F<INF>1</INF> males saved for mating shall 
continue from the time they are weaned through the period they are mated 
with the F<INF>1</INF> females (11 weeks). F<INF>1</INF> males may be 
sacrificed after the F<INF>1</INF> mating period.
    (C) Daily dosing of the P females shall continue through the three 
week mating period, pregnancy, and to the weaning of the F<INF>1</INF> 
offspring. Dosing of the F<INF>1</INF> females saved for mating shall 
continue from the time they are weaned, through the period they are 
mated with the F<INF>1</INF> males (11 weeks from the time of weaning) 
pregnancy, and to the weaning of the F<INF>2</INF> offspring.
    (ii) All animals are sacrificed as scheduled.
    (A) All P males should be sacrificed at the end of the 3-week mating 
period, or may be retained for possible production of a second litter. 
If these animals are retained for a second litter, dosing shall be 
continued.
    (B) F<INF>1</INF> males selected for mating should be sacrificed at 
the end of the three week period of the F<INF>1</INF> mating.
    (C) F<INF>1</INF> males and females not selected for mating should 
be sacrified when weaned.
    (D) The P females should be sacrificed upon weaning of their 
F<INF>1</INF> offspring.
    (E) F<INF>1</INF> dams and their F<INF>2</INF> offspring are 
sacrificed when the offspring are weaned.
    (5) Administration of the test substance--(i) Oral studies. (A) It 
is recommended that the test substance be administered in the diet or 
drinking water.
    (B) If administered by gavage or capsule, the dosage administered to 
each animal prior to mating shall be based on the individual animal's 
body weight and adjusted weekly. During pregnancy the dosage shall be 
based on the body weight at day 0 and 6 of pregnancy.
    (ii) If another route of administration is used, the tester should 
provide justification and reasoning for its selection.
    (6) Mating procedure--(i) Parental. (A) For each mating, each female 
shall be placed with a single male from the same dose level until 
pregnancy occurs or 1 week has elapsed. If mating has not occurred after 
1 week, the female shall be placed with a different male. Paired matings 
should be clearly identified.
    (B) Those pairs that fail to mate should be evaluated to determine 
the cause of the apparent infertility. This may involve such procedures 
as additional opportunities to mate with proven fertile males or 
females, histological examination of the reproductive organs, and 
examination of the estrus or spermatogenic cycles.
    (C) Each day, the females shall be examined for presence of sperm or 
vaginal plugs. Day 0 of pregnancy is defined

[[Page 179]]

as the day vaginal plugs or sperm are found.
    (ii) F<INF>1</INF> cross. (A) For mating the F<INF>1</INF> 
offspring, one male and one female are randomly selected at weaning from 
each litter for cross mating with another pup of the same dose level but 
different litter, to produce the F<INF>2</INF> generation.
    (B) F<INF>1</INF> males and females not selected for mating are 
sacrificed upon weaning.
    (iii) Special housing. After evidence of copulation, pregnant 
animals shall be caged separately in delivery or maternity cages. 
Pregnant animals shall be provided with nesting materials when 
parturition is near.
    (iv) Standardization of litter sizes. (A) On day 4 after birth, the 
size of each litter should be adjusted by eliminating extra pups by 
random selection to yield, as nearly as possible, 4 males and 4 females 
per litter.
    (B) Whenever the number of male or female pups prevents having 4 of 
each sex per litter, partial adjustment (for example, 5 males and 3 
females) is permitted. Adjustments are not appropriate for litters of 
less than 8 pups.
    (C) Elimination of runts only is not appropriate.
    (D) Adjustments of the F<INF>2</INF> litters is conducted in the 
same manner.
    (7) Observation of animals. (i) A gross examination shall be made at 
least once each day. Pertinent behavioral changes, signs of difficult or 
prolonged parturition, and all signs of toxicity, including mortality, 
shall be recorded. These observations shall be reported for each 
individual animal. Food consumption for all animals shall be monitored 
weekly except during the mating period.
    (ii) The duration of gestation shall be calculated from day 0 of 
pregnancy.
    (iii) Each litter should be examined as soon as possible after 
delivery for the number of pups, stillbirths, live births, sex, and the 
presence of gross anomalies. Live pups should be counted and litters 
weighed at birth or soon thereafter, and on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 after 
parturition.
    (iv) Physical or behavioral abnormalities observed in the dams of 
offspring shall be recorded.
    (v) P males and females shall be weighed on the first day of dosing 
and weekly thereafter. F<INF>1</INF> litters shall be weighed at birth, 
or soon thereafter, and on days 4, 7, 14, and 21. In all cases, litter 
weights shall be calculated from the weights of the individual pups.
    (8) Gross necropsy. (i) A complete gross examination shall be 
performed on all adult animals, including those which died during the 
experiment or were killed in moribund conditions.
    (ii) Special attention shall be directed to the organs of the 
reproductive system.
    (iii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples 
thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future 
histopathological examination: Vagina; uterus; ovaries; testes; 
epididymides; seminal vesicles; prostate, pituitary gland; and, target 
organ(s) when previously identified of all P and F<INF>1</INF> animals 
selected for mating.
    (9) Histopathology. Except if carried out in other studies of 
comparable duration and dose levels the following histopathology shall 
be performed:
    (i) Full histopathology on the organs listed above for all high 
dose, and control P<INF>1</INF> and F<INF>1</INF> animals selected for 
mating.
    (ii) Organs demonstrating pathology in these animals shall then be 
examined in animals from the other dose groups.
    (iii) Microscopic examination shall be made of all tissues showing 
gross pathological changes.
    (d) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of animals pregnant, the 
types of change and the percentage of animals displaying each type of 
change.
    (2) Evaluation of study results. (i) An evaluation of test results, 
including the statistical analysis, based on the clinical findings, the 
gross necropsy findings, and the microscopic results shall be made and 
supplied. This should include an evaluation of the relationship, or lack 
thereof, between the animals' exposure to the test substance and the 
incidence and severity of all abnormalities.

[[Page 180]]

    (ii) In any study which demonstrates an absence of toxic effects, 
further investigation to establish absorption and bioavailability of the 
test substance should be considered.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Toxic response data by sex and dose, including fertility, 
gestation, viability and lactation indices, and length of gestation.
    (ii) Species and strain.
    (iii) Date of death during the study or whether animals survived to 
termination.
    (iv) Toxic or other effects on reproduction, offspring, or postnatal 
growth.
    (v) Date of observation of each abnormal sign and its subsequent 
course.
    (vi) Body weight data for P, F<INF>1</INF>, and F<INF>2</INF> 
animals.
    (vii) Necropsy findings.
    (viii) Detailed description of all histopathological findings.
    (ix) Statistical treatment of results where appropriate.

Sec. 798.4900  Developmental toxicity study.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of a chemical, determination of the potential 
developmental toxicity is important. The developmental toxicity study is 
designed to provide information on the potential hazard to the unborn 
which may arise from exposure of the mother during pregnancy.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Developmental toxicity is the property of a 
chemical that causes in utero death, structural or functional 
abnormalities or growth retardation during the period of development.
    (2) Dose is the amount of test substance administered. Dose is 
expressed as weight of test substance (g, mg) per unit weight of a test 
animal (e.g., mg/kg).
    (3) No-observed-effect level is the maximum concentration in a test 
which produces no observed adverse effects. A no-observed-effect level 
is expressed in terms of weight of test substance given daily per unit 
weight of test animal (mg/kg)
    (c) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
in graduated doses for at least part of the pregnancy covering the major 
period of organogenesis, to several groups of pregnant experimental 
animals, one dose level being used per group. Shortly before the 
expected date of delivery, the pregnant females are sacrificed, the 
uteri removed, and the contents examined for embryonic or fetal deaths, 
and live fetuses.
    (d) Limit test. If a test at an exposure of at least 1000 mg/kg body 
weight, using the procedures described for this study, produces no 
observable developmental toxicity, then a full study using three dose 
levels might not be necessary.
    (e) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Testing shall be performed in at least 2 mammalian species. Commonly 
used species include the rat, mouse, rabbit, and hamster. If other 
mammalian species are used, the tester shall provide justification/
reasoning for their selection. Commonly used laboratory strains shall be 
employed. The strain shall not have low fecundity and shall preferably

[[Page 181]]

be characterized for its sensitivity to developmental toxins.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals (nulliparous females) shall be used.
    (iii) Sex. Pregnant female animals shall be used at each dose level.
    (iv) Number of animals. At least 20 pregnant rats, mice or hamsters 
or 12 pregnant rabbits are required at each dose level. The objective is 
to ensure that sufficient pups are produced to permit meaningful 
evaluation of the potential developmental toxicity of the test 
substance.
    (2) Control group. A concurrent control group shall be used. This 
group shall be an untreated or sham treated control group, or, if a 
vehicle is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control 
group. Except for treatment with the test substance, animals in the 
control group(s) shall be handled in an identical manner to test group 
animals.
    (3) Dose levels and dose selection. (i) At least 3 dose levels with 
a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle control, shall be used.
    (ii) The vehicle shall neither be developmentally toxic nor have 
effects on reproduction.
    (iii) To select the appropriate dose levels, a pilot or trial study 
may be advisable. It is not always necessary to carry out a trial study 
in pregnant animals. Comparison of the results from a trial study in 
non-pregnant, and the main study in pregnant animals will demonstrate if 
the test substance is more toxic in pregnant animals. If a trial study 
is carried out in pregnant animals, the dose producing embryonic or 
fetal lethalities or maternal toxicity shall be determined.
    (iv) Unless limited by the physical/chemical nature or biological 
properties of the substance, the highest dose level shall induce some 
overt maternal toxicity such as reduced body weight or body weight gain, 
but not more than 10 percent maternal deaths.
    (v) The lowest dose level should not produce any grossly observable 
evidence of either maternal or developmental toxicity.
    (vi) Ideally, the intermediate dose level(s) should produce minimal 
observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate concentration is 
used, the concentration levels should be spaced to produce a gradation 
of toxic effects.
    (4) Observation period. Day 0 in the test is the day on which a 
vaginal plug and/or sperm are observed. The dose period shall cover the 
period of major organogenesis. This may be taken as days 6 to 15 for rat 
and mouse, 6 to 14 for hamster, or 6 to 18 for rabbit.
    (5) Administration of test substance. The test substance or vehicle 
is usually administered orally, by oral intubation unless the chemical 
or physical characteristics of the test substance or pattern of human 
exposure suggest a more appropriate route of administration. The test 
substance shall be administered approximately the same time each day.
    (6) Exposure conditions. The female test animals are treated with 
the test substance daily throughout the appropriate treatment period. 
When given by gavage, the dose may be based on the weight of the females 
at the start of substance administration, or, alternatively, in view of 
the rapid weight gain which takes place during pregnancy, the animals 
may be weighed periodically and the dosage based on the most recent 
weight determination.
    (7) Observation of animals. (i) A gross examination shall be made at 
least once each day.
    (ii) Additional observations shall be made daily with appropriate 
actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy 
or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice 
of weak or moribund animals).
    (iii) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, 
including the time of onset, the degree and duration.
    (iv) Cage-side observations shall include, but not be limited to: 
changes in skin and fur, eye and mucous membranes, as well as 
respiratory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity 
and behavioral pattern.
    (v) Measurements should be made weekly of food consumption for all 
animals in the study.
    (vi) Animals shall be weighed at least weekly.

[[Page 182]]

    (vii) Females showing signs of abortion or premature delivery shall 
be sacrificed and subjected to a thorough macroscopic examination.
    (8) Gross necropsy. (i) At the time of sacrifice or death during the 
study, the dam shall be examined macroscopically for any structural 
abnormalities or pathological changes which may have influenced the 
pregnancy.
    (ii) Immediately after sacrifice or as soon as possible after death, 
the uterus shall be removed and the contents examined for embryonic or 
fetal deaths and the number of viable fetuses. The degree of resorption 
shall be described in order to help estimate the relative time of death 
of the conceptus. The weight of the gravid uterus should be recorded for 
dams that are sacrificed. Gravid uterine weights should not be obtained 
from dead animals if autolysis or decomposition has occurred.
    (iii) The number of corpora lutea shall be determined for all 
species except mice.
    (iv) The sex of the fetuses shall be determined and they shall be 
weighed individually, the weights recorded, and the mean fetal weight 
derived.
    (v) Following removal, each fetus shall be examined externally.
    (vi) For rats, mice and hamsters, one-third to one-half of each 
litter shall be prepared and examined for skeletal anomalies, and the 
remaining part of each litter shall be prepared and examined for soft 
tissue anomalies using appropriate methods.
    (vii) For rabbits, each fetus shall be examined by careful 
dissection for visceral anomalies and then examined for skeletal 
anomalies.
    (f) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
summarized in tablular form, showing for each test group: the number of 
animals at the start of the test, the number of pregnant animals, the 
number and percentages of live fetuses and the number of fetuses with 
any soft tissue or skeletal abnormalities.
    (2) Evaluation of results. The findings of a developmental toxicity 
study shall be evaluated in terms of the observed effects and the 
exposure levels producing effects. It is necessary to consider the 
historical developmental toxicity data on the species/strain tested. A 
properly conducted developmental toxicity study should provide a 
satisfactory estimation of a no-effect level.
    (3) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Toxic response data by concentration.
    (ii) Species and strain.
    (iii) Date of death during the study or whether animals survived to 
termination.
    (iv) Date of onset and duration of each abnormal sign and its 
subsequent course.
    (v) Food, body weight and uterine weight data.
    (vi) Pregnancy and litter data.
    (vii) Fetal data (live/dead, sex, soft tissue and skeletal defects, 
resorptions).
    (g) References. For additional background information on this test 
guideline the following references should be consulted:

<R05>
Sec. 798.5195  Mouse biochemical specific locus test.

    (a) Purpose. The mouse biochemical specific locus test (MBSL) may be 
used to detect and quantitate mutations

[[Page 183]]

originating in the germ line of a mammalian species.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A biochemical specific locus mutation is a 
genetic change resulting from a DNA lesion causing alterations in 
proteins that can be detected by electrophoretic methods.
    (2) The germ line is comprised of the cells in the gonads of higher 
eukaryotes, which are the carriers of the genetic information for the 
species.
    (c) Reference substances. Not applicable.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. The principle of the MBSL is that 
heritable damage to the genome can be detected by electrophoretic 
analysis of proteins in the tissues of the progeny of mice treated with 
germ cell mutagens.
    (2) Description. For technical reasons, males rather than females 
are generally treated with the test chemical. Treated males are then 
mated to untreated females to produce F1 progeny. Both blood and kidney 
samples are taken from progeny for electrophoretic analysis. Up to 33 
loci can be examined by starch-gel electrophoresis and broad-range 
isoelectric focussing. Mutants are identified by variations from the 
normal electrophoretic pattern. Presumed mutants are bred to confirm the 
genetic nature of the change.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. Mice shall be used as 
the test species. Although the biochemical specific locus test could be 
performed in a number of in bred strains, in the most frequently used 
cross, C57BL/6 females are mated to DBA/2 males to produce (C57BL/6 x 
DBA/2) F1 progeny for screening.
    (ii) Age. Healthy, sexually-mature (at least 8 weeks old) animals 
shall be used for treatment and breeding.
    (iii) Number. A decision on the minimum number of treated animals 
should take into account possible effects of the test chemical on the 
fertility of the treated animals. Other considerations should include:
    (A) The production of concurrent spontaneous controls.
    (B) The use of positive controls.
    (C) The power of the test.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. An appropriate number 
of concurrent control loci shall be analyzed in each experiment. These 
should be partly derived from matings of untreated animals (from 5 to 20 
percent ofthe treated matings), although some data on control loci can 
be taken from the study of the alleles transmitted from the untreated 
parent in the experimental cross. However, any laboratory which has had 
no prior experience with the test shall produce a spontaneous control 
sample of about 5,000 progeny animals and a positive control (using 100 
mg/kg ethylnitrosourea) sample of at least 1,200 offspring.
    (ii) Historical controls. Long-term, accumulated spontaneous control 
data (currently, 1 mutation in 1,200,000 control loci screened) are 
available for comparative purposes.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When possible, test chemicals shall 
be dissolved or suspended in distilled water or buffered isotonic 
saline. Water-insoluble chemicals shall be dissolved or suspended in 
appropriate vehicles. The vehicle used shall neither interfere with the 
test chemical nor produce major toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the 
test chemical should be employed.
    (ii) Dose levels. Usually, only one dose need be tested. This should 
be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the highest dose tolerated without 
toxic effects. Any temporary sterility induced due to elimination of 
spermatogonia at this dose must be of only moderate duration, as 
determined by are turn of males to fertility within 80 days after 
treatment. For evaluation of dose-response, it is recommended that at 
least two dose levels be tested.
    (iii) Route of administration. Acceptable routes of administration 
include, but are not limited to, gavage, inhalation, and mixture with 
food or water, and intraperitoneal or intravenous injections.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Treatment and mating. Male DBA/2 mice 
shall be treated with the test chemical and mated to virgin C57BL/6 
females immediately after cessation of treatment. Each treated male 
shall be mated to new virgin C57BL/6 females each week. Each pairing 
will continue for a week until the next week's mating is to begin. This 
mating schedule permits sampling of all post-spermatogonial

[[Page 184]]

stages of germ-cell development during the first 7 weeks after exposure. 
Spermatogonial stem cells are studied thereafter. Repeated mating cycles 
should be conducted until sufficient offspring have been obtained to 
meet the power criterion of the assay for spermatogonial stem cells.
    (2) Examination of offspring--(i) Birth and weaning. Offspring shall 
be examined at birth and at weaning for externally detectable changes in 
morphology and behavior; these could be due to dominant mutations. Such 
characteristics may include, but are not limited to, variations in coat 
color, appearance of eyes, size (in which case weighing of variant 
animals and littermates should be carried out), fur texture, etc. Gross 
changes in external form and behavior shall also be sought. Scrutiny of 
such visible characteristics of all animals shall be made during all 
subsequent manipulations of the animals.
    (ii) Tissue sampling. Blood (about 0.1 mL) and one kidney shall be 
removed from progeny mice under anesthesia. Both tissues are then 
prepared for analysis by electrophoresis.
    (iii) Electrophoresis. The gene products of 6 loci shall be analyzed 
in the blood sample by broad-range isoelectric focussing and of 27 loci 
in the kidney sample by starch-gel electrophoresis and enzyme-specific 
staining. Details on these procedures are included in paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (g)(3) of this section.
    (iv) Mutant identification. Presumptive electrophoretic mutants 
shall be identified by variation from the normal electrophoretic banding 
patterns. Reruns of all variant samples shall be performed to confirm 
the presence of altered banding patterns. Samples from parents of 
progeny exhibiting banding pattern variations shall be assayed to 
determine whether the variant was induced by the experimental treatment 
or was pre-existing. All treatment-induced variants are bred to 
determine the genetic nature of the change.
    (f) Data and reports--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
presented in tabular form and shall permit independent analysis of cell 
stage-specific effects, and dose-dependent phenomena. The data shall be 
recorded and analyzed in such a way that clusters of identical mutations 
are clearly identified. The individual mutants detected shall be 
thoroughly described. In addition, concurrent positive control data (if 
employed) and spontaneous control data shall also be tabulated. These 
concurrent controls shall be added to, as well as compared with, the 
historical control data.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive response, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the frequency of electrophoretic 
mutations. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a 
reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at 
least one of these test points.
    (ii) A test chemical which does not produce a statistically 
significant increase in the frequency of electrophoretic mutations over 
the spontaneous frequency, or a statistically significant and 
reproducible positive response for at least one of the test points, is 
considered nonmutagenic in this system, provided that the sample size is 
sufficient to exclude a biologically significant increase in mutation 
frequency.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the MBSL indicate that, 
under the test conditions, the test chemical induces heritable gene 
mutations in a mammalian species.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that, under the test conditions, the 
test chemical does not induce heritable genemutations in a mammalian 
species.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, and paragraph (h) of this 
section, the following specific information shall be reported:
    (i) Strain, age and weight of animals used; numbers of animals of 
each sex in experimental and control groups.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, doses used, rationale for dose 
selection, and toxicity data, if available.
    (iii) Route and duration of exposure.
    (iv) Mating schedule.

Sec. 798.5200  Mouse visible specific locus test.

    (a) Purpose. The mouse visible specific locus test (MSLT) may be 
used to detect and quantitate mutations in the germ line of a mammalian 
species.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A visible specific locus mutation is a genetic 
change that alters factors responsible for coat color and other visible 
characteristics of certain mouse strains.
    (2) The germ line is the cells in the gonads of higher eukaryotes 
which are the carriers of the genetic information for the species.
    (c) Reference substances. Not applicable.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. (i) The principle of the MSLT is to 
cross individuals who differ with respect to the genes present at 
certain specific loci, so that a genetic alteration involving the 
standard gene at any one of these loci will produce an offspring 
detectably different from the standard heterozygote. The genetic change 
may be detectable by various means, depending on the loci chosen to be 
marked.
    (ii) Three variations of the method currently exist for detecting 
newly arising point mutations in mouse germ cells:
    (A) The visible specific locus test using either 5 or 7 loci.
    (B) The biochemical specific locus test using up to 20 enzymes.
    (C) The test for mutations at histocompatibility loci.
    (iii) Of the three tests, the visible specific locus test has been 
most widely used in assessing genetic hazard due to environmental 
agents. It is the method described in this guideline.
    (2) Description. For technical reasons, males rather than females 
are generally treated with the test agent. Treated males are then mated 
to females which are genetically homozygous for certain specific visible 
marker loci. Offspring are examined in the next generation for evidence 
that a new mutation has arisen.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. Mice shall be used as 
the test species. Male mice shall be either 
(C<INF>3</INF>H x 101)F<INF>1</INF> or 
(101 x C<INF>3</INF>H)F<INF>1</INF> hybrids. Females shall be T stock 
virgins.

[[Page 186]]

    (ii) Age. Healthy sexually mature animals shall be used.
    (iii) Number. A decision on the minimum number of treated animals 
should take into account the spontaneous variation of the biological 
characterization being evaluated. Other considerations should include:
    (A) The use of either historical or concurrent controls.
    (B) The power of the test.
    (C) The minimal rate of induction required.
    (D) The use of positive controls.
    (E) The level of significance desired.
    (iv) Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned 
to treatment and control groups.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. The use of positive or 
spontaneous controls is left to the discretion of the investigator. 
However, any laboratory which has had no prior experience with the test 
shall, at its first attempt, produce a negative control sample of 20,000 
and a positive control, using 100 mg/kg 1-ethyl-nitrosourea, in a sample 
of 5,000 offspring.
    (ii) Historical controls. Long term, accumulated spontaneous control 
data of 43/801,406 are available for comparative purposes.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When possible, test chemicals 
should be dissolved or suspended in distilled water or isotonic saline 
buffered appropriately, if needed, for stability. Water-insoluble 
chemicals shall be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The 
vehicle used shall neither interfere with the test compound nor produce 
major toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test chemical should be 
employed.
    (ii) Dose levels. Usually, only one dose level need be tested. This 
should be the highest dose tolerated without toxic effects, provided 
that any temporary sterility induced due to elimination of spermatagonia 
is of only moderate duration, as determined by a return of males to 
fertility within 80 days after treatment. For evaluation of dose-
response, it is recommended that at least two dose levels be tested.
    (iii) Route of administration. Acceptable routes of administration 
include gavage, inhalation, admixture with food or water, and IP or IV 
injections.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Treatment and mating. Hybrid F<INF>1</INF> 
(C<INF>3</INF>H x 101 or 101 x C<INF>3</INF>H) male mice shall be 
treated with the test substance and immediately mated to virgin T stock 
females. Each treated male shall be mated to a fresh group of 2 to 4 
virgin females each week for 7 weeks, after which he shall be returned 
to the first group of females and rotated through the seven sets of 
females repeatedly. This mating schedule generally permits sampling of 
all postspermatagonial stages of germ cell development during the first 
7 weeks and rapid accumulation of data for exposed spermatagonial stem 
cells thereafter. Repeated mating cycles should be conducted until the 
entire spermatogonial cycle has been evaluated and enough offspring have 
been obtained to meet the power criterion of the assay.
    (2) Examination of offspring. (i) Offspring may be examined at (or 
soon after) birth but must be examined at about 3 weeks of age at which 
time the numbers of mutant and nonmutant offspring in each litter shall 
be recorded.
    (ii) Nonmutant progeny should be discarded. Mutant progeny shall be 
subjected to genetic tests for verification.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
presented in tabular form and shall permit independent analysis of cell 
stage specific effects and dose dependent phenomena. The data shall be 
recorded and analyzed in such a way that clusters of identical mutations 
are clearly identified. The individual mutants detected shall be 
thoroughly described. In addition, concurrent positive and negative 
control data, if they are available, shall be tabulated so that it is 
possible to differentiate between concurrent (when available) and long-
term accumulated mutation frequencies.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of specific locus 
mutations. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a 
reproducible and statistically significant positive

[[Page 187]]

response for at least one of the test points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of specific locus 
mutations or a statistically significant and reproducible positive 
response at any one of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in 
this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the MSLT indicate that 
under the test conditions the test substance induces heritable gene 
mutations in the test species.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance does not induce heritable gene mutations in the test 
species.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting requirements as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, and paragraph (h) of this 
section, the following specific information shall be reported:
    (i) Strain, age and weight of animals used, number of animals of 
each sex in experimental and control groups.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, doses used and rationale for dose 
selection, toxicity data.
    (iii) Route and duration of exposure.
    (iv) Mating schedule.
    (v) Time of examination for mutant progeny.
    (vi) Criteria for scoring mutants.
    (vii) Use of concurrent or negative controls.
    (viii) Dose response relationship, if applicable.
    (g) References. For additional background information on this test 
guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 798.5265  The salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay.

    (a) Purpose. The Salmonella typhimurium histidine (his) reversion 
system is a microbial assay which measures his<SUP>- </SUP><r-arrow> 
his<SUP>+</SUP> reversion induced by chemicals which cause base changes 
or frameshift mutations in the genome of this organism.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A reverse mutation assay in Salmonella 
typhimurium detects mutation in a gene of a histidine requiring strain 
to produce a histidine independent strain of this organism.
    (2) Base pair mutagens are agents which cause a base change in the 
DNA. In a reversion assay, this change may occur at the site of the 
original mutation or at a second site in the chromosome.
    (3) Frameshift mutagens are agents which cause the addition or 
deletion of single or multiple base pairs in the DNA molecule.
    (c) Reference substances. These may include, but need not be limited 
to, sodium azide, 2-nitrofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, 2-aminoanthracene, 
congo red, benzopurpurin 4B, trypan blue or direct blue 1.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. Bacteria are exposed to test 
chemical with and without a metabolic activation system and plated onto 
minimal medium. After a suitable period of incubation, revertant 
colonies are counted and compared to the number of spontaneous 
revertants in an untreated and/or vehicle control culture.
    (2) Description. Several methods for performing the test have been 
described. Among those used are:
    (i) The direct plate incorporation method.
    (ii) The preincubation method.
    (iii) The azo-reduction method.


[[Page 188]]


The procedures described here are for the direct plate incorporation 
method and the azo-reduction method.
    (3) Strain selection--(i) Designation. At the present time four 
strains, TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98 and TA 100 should be used. The use of 
other strains in addition to these four is left to the discretion of the 
investigator.
    (ii) Preparation and storage. Recognized methods of stock culture 
preparation and storage should be used. The requirement of histidine for 
growth should be demonstrated for each strain. Other phenotypic 
characteristics should be checked using such methods as crystal violet 
sensitivity and resistance to ampicillin. Spontaneous reversion 
frequency should be in the range expected either as reported in the 
literature or as established in the laboratory by historical control 
values.
    (iii) Bacterial growth. Fresh cultures of bacteria should be grown 
up to the late exponential or early stationary phase of growth 
(approximately 10<SUP>8</SUP>-10<SUP>9</SUP> cells per ml).
    (4) Metabolic activation. Bacteria should be exposed to the test 
substance both in the presence and absence of an appropriate metabolic 
activation system. For the direct plate incorporation method, the most 
commonly used system is a cofactor supplemented postmitochondrial 
fraction prepared from the livers of rodents treated with enzyme 
inducing agents such as Aroclor 1254. For the azo-reduction method, a 
cofactor supplemented postmitochondrial fraction prepared from the 
livers of untreated hamsters is preferred. For this method, the cofactor 
supplement should contain flavin mononucleotide, exogenous glucose 6-
phosphate dehydrogenase, NADH and excess of glucose-6-phosphate.
    (5) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. Concurrent positive and 
negative (untreated and/or vehicle) controls shall be included in each 
experiment. Positive controls shall ensure both strain responsiveness 
and efficacy of the metabolic activation system.
    (ii) Strain specific positive controls. Strain specific positive 
controls shall be included in the assay. Examples of strain specific 
positive controls are as follows:
    (A) Strain TA 1535, TA 100, sodium azide.
    (B) TA 98, 2-nitrofluorene.
    (C) TA 1537, 9-aminoacridine.
    (iii) Positive controls to ensure the efficacy of the activation 
system. The positive control reference substance for tests including a 
metabolic activation system should be selected on the basis of the type 
of activation system used in the test. 2-Aminoanthracene is an example 
of a positive control compound in plate-incorporation tests using 
postmitochondrial fractions from the livers of rodents treated with 
enzyme inducing agents such as Aroclor-1254. Congo red is an example of 
a positive control compound in the azo-reduction method. Other positive 
control reference substances may be used.
    (iv) Class-specific positive controls. The azo-reduction method 
should include positive controls from the same class of compounds as the 
test agent wherever possible.
    (6) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. Test chemicals and positive control 
reference substances should be dissolved or suspended in an appropriate 
vehicle and then further diluted in vehicle for use in the assay.
    (ii) Exposure concentrations. (A) The test should initially be 
performed over a broad range of concentrations. Among the criteria to be 
taken into consideration for determining the upper limits of test 
chemical concentration are cytotoxicity and solubility. Cytotoxicity of 
the test chemical may be altered in the presence of metabolic activation 
systems. Toxicity may be evidenced by a reduction in the number of 
spontaneous revertants, a clearing of the background lawn or by the 
degree of survival of treated cultures. Relatively insoluble compounds 
should be tested up to the limits of solubility. For freely soluble 
nontoxic chemicals, the upper test chemical concentration should be 
determined on a case by case basis.
    (B) Generally, a maximum of 5 mg/plate for pure substances is 
considered acceptable. At least 5 different amounts of test substance 
shall be tested with adequate intervals between test points.
    (C) When appropriate, a single positive response shall be confirmed 
by

[[Page 189]]

testing over a narrow range of concentrations.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Direct plate incorporation method. For 
this test without metabolic activation, test chemica1 and 0.1 m1 of a 
fresh bacterial culture should be added to 2.0 ml of overlay agar. For 
tests with metabolic activation, 0.5 ml of activation mixture containing 
an adequate amount of postmitochondrial fraction should be added to the 
agar overlay after the addition of test chemical and bacteria. Contents 
of each tube shall be mixed and poured over the surface of a selective 
agar plate. Overlay agar shall be allowed to solidify before incubation. 
At the end of the incubation period, revertant colonies per plate shall 
be counted.
    (2) Azo-reduction method. (i) For this test with metabolic 
activation, 0.5 ml of S-9 mix containing 150 ul of S-9 and 0.1 ml of 
bacterial culture should be added to a test tube kept on ice. One-tenth 
milliliter of chemical should be added, and the tubes should be 
incubated with shaking at 30 deg. C for 30 min. At the end of the 
incubation period, 2.0 ml of agar should be added to each tube, the 
contents mixed and poured over the surface of a selective agar plate. 
Overlay agar shall be allowed to solidify before incubation. At the end 
of the incubation period, revertant colonies per plate shall be counted.
    (ii) For tests without metabolic activation, 0.5 ml of buffer should 
be used in place of the 0.5 ml of S-9 mix. All other procedures shall be 
the same as those used for the test with metabolic activation.
    (3) Other methods. Other methods may also be appropriate.
    (4) Media. An appropriate selective medium with an adequate overlay 
agar shall be used.
    (5) Incubation conditions. All plates within a given experiment 
shall be incubated for the same time period. This incubation period 
shall be for 48-72 hours at 37  deg.C.
    (6) Number of cultures. All plating should be done at least in 
triplicate.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
presented as number of revertant colonies per plate for each replicate 
and dose. The numbers of revertant colonies on both negative (untreated 
and/or vehicle) and positive control plates shall also be presented. 
Individual plate counts, the mean number of revertant colonies per plate 
and standard deviation shall be presented for test chemical and positive 
and negative (untreated and/or vehicle) controls.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of revertants. Another 
criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and 
statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test 
substance concentrations.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of revertants or a 
statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one 
of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results from the S. typhimurium 
reverse mutation assay indicate that, under the test conditions, the 
test substance induces point mutations by base changes or frameshifts in 
the genome of this organism.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance is not mutagenic in S. typhimurium.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Bacterial strain used.
    (ii) Metabolic activation system used (source, amount and cofactor); 
details of preparations of S-9 mix.
    (iii) Dose levels and rationale for selection of dose.
    (iv) Positive and negative controls.
    (v) Individual plate counts, mean number of revertant colonies per 
plate, standard deviation.

Sec. 798.5275  Sex-linked recessive lethal test in drosophila melanogaster.

    (a) Purpose. The sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) test using 
Drosophila melanogaster detects the occurrence of mutations, both point 
mutations and small deletions, in the germ line of the insect. This test 
is a forward mutation assay capable of screening for mutations at about 
800 loci on the X-chromosome. This represents about 80 percent of all X-
chromosome loci. The X-chromosome represents approximately one-fifth of 
the entire haploid genome.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Lethal mutation is a change in the genome 
which, when expressed, causes death to the carrier.
    (2) Recessive mutation is a change in the genome which is expressed 
in the homozygous or hemizygous condition.
    (3) Sex-Linked genes are present on the sex (X or Y) chromosomes. 
Sex-linked genes in the context of this guideline refer only to those 
located on the X-chromosome.
    (c) Reference substances. These may include, but need not be limited 
to, ethyl methanesulfonate or N-nitroso-dimethylamine.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. Mutations in the X-chromosome of D. 
melanogaster are phenotypically expressed in males carrying the mutant 
gene. When the mutation is lethal in the hemizygous condition, its 
presence is inferred from the absence of one class of male offspring out 
of the two that are normally produced by a heterozygous female. The SLRL 
test takes advantage of these facts by means of specially marked and 
arranged chromosomes.
    (2) Description. Wild-type males are treated and mated to 
appropriate females. Female offspring are mated individually to their 
brothers, and in the next generation the progeny from each separate dose 
are scored for phenotypically wild-type males. Absence of these males 
indicates that a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation has occurred in a 
germ cell of the P<INF>1</INF> male.
    (3) Drosophila stocks. Males of a well-defined wild type stock and 
females of the Muller-5 stock may be used. Other appropriately marked 
female stocks with multiple inverted X-chromosomes may also be used.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. Concurrent positive and 
negative (vehicle) controls shall be included in each experiment.
    (ii) Positive controls. Examples of positive controls include ethyl 
methanesulfonate and N-nitroso-dimethylamine.
    (iii) Other positive controls. Other positive control reference 
substances may be used.
    (iv) Negative controls. Negative (vehicle) controls shall be 
included. The size of the negative (vehicle) control group shall be 
determined by the availability of appropriate laboratory historical 
control data.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. Test chemicals should be dissolved 
in water. Compounds which are insoluble in water may be dissolved or 
suspended in appropriate vehicles (e.g., a mixture of ethanol and Tween-
60 or 80) and then diluted in water or saline prior to administration. 
Dimethylsulfoxide should br avoided as a vehicle.
    (ii) Dose levels. For the initial assessment of mutagenicity, it is 
sufficient

[[Page 191]]

to test a single dose of the test substance for screening purposes. This 
dose should be the maximum tolerated dose, or that which produces some 
indication of toxicity, or shall be the highest dose attainable. For 
dose-response purposes, at least three additional dose levels should be 
used.
    (iii) Route of administration. Exposure may be oral, by injection or 
by exposure to gases or vapors. Feeding of the test compound may be done 
in sugar solution. When necessary, substances may be dissolved in 0.7 
percent NaCl solution and injected into the thorax or abdomen.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Treatment and mating. Wild-type males (3 
to 5 days old) shall be treated with the test substance and mated 
individually to an appropriate number of virgin females from the Muller-
5 stock or females from another appropriately marked (with multiply-
inverted X-chromosomes) stock. The females shall be replaced with fresh 
virgins every 2 to 3 days to cover the entire germ cell cycle. The 
offspring of these females are scored for lethal effects corresponding 
to the effects on mature sperm, mid or late stage spermatids, early 
spermatids, spermatocytes and spermatogonia at the time of treatment.
    (2) F1 matings. Heterozygous F<INF>1</INF> females from the above 
crosses shall be allowed to mate individually (i.e., one female per 
vial) with their brothers. In the F<INF>2</INF> generation, each culture 
shall be scored for the absence of wild-type males. If a culture appears 
to have arisen from an F<INF>1</INF> female carrying a lethal in the 
parental X-chromosome (i.e., no males with the treated chromosome are 
observed), daughters of that female with the same genotype shall be 
tested to ascertain if the lethality is repeated in the next generation.
    (3) Number of matings. (i) The test should be designed with a 
predetermined sensitivity and power. The number of flies in each group 
should reflect these defined parameters. The spontaneous mutant 
frequency observed in the appropriate control group will strongly 
influence the number of treated chromosomes that must be analysed to 
detect substances which show mutation rates close to those of the 
controls.
    (ii) Test results should be confirmed in a separate experiment.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
tabulated to show the number of chromosomes tested, the number of 
nonfertile males and the number of lethal chromosomes at each exposure 
concentration and for each mating period for each male treated. Numbers 
of clusters of different size per male shall be reported.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical techniques.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of sex-lined recessive 
lethals. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible 
and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the 
test points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of sex-linked recessive 
lethals or a statistically significant and reproducible positive 
response at any one of the test points is considered non-mutagenic in 
this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the SLRL test in D. 
melanogaster indicate that under the test conditions the test agent 
causes mutations in germ cells of this insect.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance is not mutagenic in D. melanogaster.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported.
    (i) Drosophila stock used in the assay, age of insects, number of 
males treated, number of sterile males, number of F<INF>2</INF> cultures 
established, number of F<INF>2</INF> cultures without progeny.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, treatment and sampling schedule, 
exposure levels,

[[Page 192]]

toxicity data, negative (vehicle) and positive controls, if appropriate.
    (iii) Criteria for scoring lethals.
    (iv) Number of chromosomes tested, number of chromosomes scored, 
number of chromosomes carrying a lethal mutation.
    (v) Historical control data, if available.
    (vi) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

Sec. 798.5300  Detection of gene mutations in somatic cells in culture.

    (a) Purpose. Mammalian cell culture systems may be used to detect 
mutations induced by chemical substances. Widely used cell lines include 
L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and the CHO and V-79 lines of Chinese 
hamster cells. In these cell lines the most commonly used systems 
measure mutation at the thymidine kinase (TK), hypoxanthine-guanine-
phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and Na<SUP>+</SUP>/K<SUP>+</SUP> 
ATPase loci. The TK and HPRT mutational systems detect base pair 
mutations, frameshift mutations, and small deletions; the 
Na<SUP>+</SUP>/K<SUP>+</SUP> ATPase system detects base pair mutations 
only.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A forward mutation assay detects a gene 
mutation from the parental type to the mutant form which gives rise to a 
change in an enzymatic or functional protein.
    (2) Base pair mutagens are agents which cause a base change in the 
DNA.
    (3) Frameshift mutagens are agents which cause the addition or 
deletion of single or multiple base pairs in the DNA molecule.
    (4) Phenotypic expression time is a period during which unaltered 
gene products are depleted from newly mutated cells.
    (c) Reference substances. These may include, but need not be limited 
to, ethyl methanesulfonate, N-nitroso-dimethylamine, 2-
acetylaminofluorene, 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene or hycanthone.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. Cells are exposed to test substance, 
both with and without metabolic activation, for a suitable period of 
time and subcultured to determine cytotoxicity and to allow phenotypic 
expression prior to mutant selection. Cells deficient in thymidine 
kinase (TK) due to the forward mutation 
TK<SUP>+</SUP><r-arrow>TK<SUP>-</SUP> are resistant to the cytotoxic 
effects of pyrimidine analogues such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), 
fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU) or trifluorothymidine (TFT). The deficiency of 
the ``salvage'' enzyme thymidine kinase means that these antimetabolites 
are not incorporated into cellular nucleotides and the nucleotides 
needed for cellular metabolism are obtained solely from de novo 
synthesis. However, in the presence of thymidine kinase, BrdU, FdU or 
TFT are incorporated into the nucleotides, resulting in inhibition of 
cellular metabolism and cytotoxicity. Thus mutant cells are able to 
proliferate in the presence of BrdU, FdU or TFT whereas normal cells, 
which contain thymidine kinase, are not. Similarly cells deficient in 
HPRT are selected by resistance to 8-azaguanine (AG) or 6-thioguanine 
(TG) and cells with altered Na<SUP>+</SUP>/K<SUP>+</SUP> ATPase are 
selected by resistance to ouabain.
    (2) Description. Cells in suspension or monolayer culture are 
exposed to the test substance, both with and without metabolic 
activation, for a defined period of time. Cytotoxicity is determined by 
measuring the colony forming ability or growth rate of the cultures 
after the treatment period. The treated cultures are maintained in 
growth medium for a sufficient period of time--characteristic of each 
selected locus--to allow near-optimal phenotypic expression of induced

[[Page 193]]

mutations. Mutant frequency is determined by seeding known numbers of 
cells in medium containing the selective agent to detect mutant cells, 
and in medium without selective agent to determine the cloning 
efficiency. After a suitable incubation time, cell colonies are counted. 
The number of mutant colonies in selective medium is adjusted by the 
number of colonies in nonselective medium to derive the mutant 
frequency.
    (3) Cells--(i) Type of cells used in the assay. A variety of cell 
lines are available for use in this assay including subclones of L5178Y, 
CHO cells or V-79 cells. Cell types used in this assay should have a 
demonstrated sensitivity to chemical mutagens, a high cloning efficiency 
and a low spontaneous mutation frequency. Cells should be checked for 
Mycoplasma contamination and may be periodically checked for karyotype 
stability.
    (ii) Cell growth and maintenance. Appropriate culture media and 
incubation conditions (culture vessels, CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations, 
temperature and humidity) shall be used.
    (4) Metabolic activation. Cells shall be exposed to test substance 
both in the presence and absence of an appropriate metabolic activation 
system.
    (5) Control groups. Positive and negative (untreated and/or vehicle) 
controls shall be included in each experiment. When metabolic activation 
is used, the positive control substance shall be known to require such 
activation.
    (6) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. Test substances may be prepared in 
culture media or dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles prior to 
treatment of the cells. The final concentration of the vehicle shall not 
interfere with cell viability or growth rate. Treatment vessels should 
be chosen to ensure that there is no visible interaction, such as 
etching, between the solvent, the test chemical, and the vessel.
    (ii) Exposure concentrations. (A) The test should be designed to 
have a predetermined sensitivity and power. The number of cells, 
cultures, and concentrations of test substance used should reflect these 
defined parameters. The number of cells per culture is based on the 
expected background mutant frequency; a general guide is to use a number 
which is 10 times the inverse of this frequency.
    (B) Several concentrations (usually at least 4) of the test 
substance shall be used. Generally, these shall yield a concentration-
related toxic effect. The highest concentration shall produce a low 
level of survival (approximately 10 percent), and the survival in the 
lowest concentration shall approximate the negative control. 
Cytotoxicity shall be determined after treatment with the test substance 
both in the presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic 
activation system. Relatively insoluble substances should be tested up 
to their limit of solubility under culture conditions. For freely-
soluble nontoxic substances the highest concentration used should be 
determined on a case-by-case basis.
    (e) Test performance. (1) Cells shall be exposed to the test 
substance both with and without exogenous metabolic activation. Exposure 
shall be for a suitable period of time, in most cases 1 to 5 hours is 
effective; exposure time may be extended over one or more cell cycles.
    (2) At the end of the exposure period, cells shall be washed and 
cultured to determine viability and to allow for expression of the 
mutant phenotype.
    (3) At the end of the expression period, which shall be sufficient 
to allow near optimal phenotypic expression of induced mutants, cells 
should be grown in medium with and without selective agent(s) for 
determination of number of mutants and cloning efficiency, respectively.
    (4) Results shall be confirmed in an independent experiment. When 
appropriate, a single positive response should be confirmed by testing 
over a narrow range of concentrations.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
presented in tabular form. Individual colony counts for the treated and 
control groups shall be presented for both mutation induction and 
survival. Survival and cloning efficiencies shall be given as a 
percentage of the controls. Mutant frequency shall be expressed as 
number of mutants per number of surviving cells.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.

[[Page 194]]

    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant concentration-related increase in the mutant frequency. 
Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and 
statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test 
substance concentrations.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant concentration-related increase in the mutant frequency or a 
statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one 
of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results for an in vitro mammalian 
cell gene mutation test indicate that, under the test conditions, a 
substance induces gene mutations in the cultured mammalian cells used.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that, under the test conditions, the 
test substance does not induce gene mutations in the cultured mammalian 
cells used.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Cell type used, number of cell cultures, methods used for 
maintenance of cell cultures.
    (ii) Rationale for selection of concentrations and number of 
cultures.
    (iii) Test conditions: composition of media, CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration, concentration of test substance, vehicle, incubation 
temperature, incubation time, duration of treatment, cell density during 
treatment, type of metabolic activation system, positive and negative 
controls, length of expression period (including number of cells seeded 
and subculture and feeding schedules, if appropriate), selective 
agent(s).
    (iv) Methods used to enumerate numbers of viable and mutant cells.
    (v) Dose-response relationship, where possible.

Sec. 798.5375  In vitro mammalian cytogenetics.

    (a) Purpose. The in vitro cytogenetics test is a mutagenicity test 
system for the detection of chromosomal aberrations in cultured 
mammalian cells. Chromosomal aberrations may be either structural or 
numerical. However, because cytogenetic assays are usually designed to 
analyse cells at their first post-treatment mitosis and numerical 
aberrations require at least one cell division to be visualized, this 
type of aberration is generally not observed in a

[[Page 195]]

routine cytogenetics assay. Structural aberrations may be of two types, 
chromosome or chromatid.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Chromosome-type aberrations are changes which 
result from damage expressed in both sister chromatids at the same time.
    (2) Chromatid-type aberrations are damage expressed as breakage of 
single chromatids or breakage and/or reunion between chromatids.
    (c) Reference substances. Not applicable.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. In vitro cytogenetics assays may 
employ cultures of established cell lines, cell strains or primary cell 
cultures. Cell cultures are exposed to the test substance both with and 
without metabolic activation. Following exposure of cell cultures to 
test substances, they are treated with a spindle inhibitor (e.g., 
colchicine or Colcemid<Register>) to arrest cells in a metaphase-like 
stage of mitosis (c-metaphase). Cells are then harvested and chromosome 
preparations made. Preparations are stained and metaphase cells are 
analyzed for chromosomal aberrations.
    (2) Description. Cell cultures are exposed to test compounds and 
harvested at various intervals after treatment. Prior to harvesting, 
cells are treated with a spindle inhibitor (e.g., colchicine or 
Colcemid<Register>) to accumulate cells in c-metaphase. Chromosome 
preparations from cells are made, stained and scored for chromosomal 
aberrations.
    (3) Cells--(i) Type of cells used in the assay. There are a variety 
of cell lines or primary cell cultures, including human cells, which may 
be used in the assay. Established cell lines and strains should be 
checked for Mycoplasma contamination and may be periodically checked for 
karyotype stability.
    (ii) Cell growth and maintenance. Appropriate culture media, and 
incubation conditions (culture vessels CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations, 
temperature and humidity) shall be used.
    (4) Metabolic activation. Cells shall be exposed to test substance 
both in the presence and absence of an appropriate metabolic activation 
system.
    (5) Control groups. Positive and negative (untreated and/or vehicle) 
controls both with and without metabolic activation shall be included in 
each experiment. When metabolic activation is used, the positive control 
substance shall be known to require such activation.
    (6) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. Test substances may be prepared in 
culture media or dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles prior to 
treatment of the cells. Final concentration of the vehicle shall not 
interfere with cell viability or growth rate. Treatment vessels should 
be chosen to ensure that there is no visible interaction, such as 
etching, between the solvent, the test chemical, and the vessel.
    (ii) Exposure concentrations. Multiple concentrations of the test 
substance over a range adequate to define the response should be tested. 
Generally the highest test substance concentrations tested with and 
without metabolic activation should show evidence of cytotoxicity or 
reduced mitotic activity. Relatively insoluble substances should be 
tested up to the limit of solubility. For freely soluble nontoxic 
chemicals, the upper test chemical concentration should be determined on 
a case by case basis.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Established cell lines and strains. Prior 
to use in the assay, cells should be generated from stock cultures, 
seeded in culture vessels at the appropriate density and incubated at 37 
 deg.C.
    (2) Human lymphocyte cultures. Heparinized or acid-citrate-dextrose 
whole blood should be added to culture medium containing a mitogen, 
e.g., phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and incubated at 37  deg.C. White cells 
sedimented by gravity (buffy coat) or lymphocytes which have been 
purified on a density gradient may also be utilized.
    (3) Treatment with test substance. For established cell lines and 
strains, cells in the exponential phase of growth shall be treated with 
test substances in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic 
activation system. Mitogen-stimulated human lymphocyte cultures may be 
treated with the test substance in a similar manner.
    (4) Number of cultures. At least two independent cultures shall be 
used for each experimental point.

[[Page 196]]

    (5) Culture harvest time. (i) For established cell lines and 
strains, multiple harvest times are recommended. However, for screening 
purposes, a single harvest time may be appropriate. If the test chemical 
changes the cell cycle length, the fixation intervals should be changed 
accordingly. If a single harvest time is selected, supporting data for 
the harvest time should be presented in such a study.
    (ii) For human lymphocyte cultures, the substance to be tested may 
be added to the cultures at various times after mitogen stimulation so 
that there is a single harvest time after the initiation of the cell 
culture. Alternatively, a single treatment may be followed by multiple 
harvest times. Harvest time should be extended for those chemicals which 
induce an apparent cell cycle delay. Because the population of human 
lymphocytes is only partially synchronized, a single treatment, at, or 
close to, the time when metaphase stages first appear in the culture 
will include cells in all phases of the division cycle. Therefore, a 
single harvest at the time of second mitosis may be carried out for 
screening purposes.
    (iii) Cell cultures shall be treated with a spindle inhibitor, 
(e.g., colchicine or Colcemid<SUP></SUP>), 1 or 2 hours prior to 
harvesting. Each culture shall be harvested and processed separately for 
the preparation of chromosomes.
    (6) Chromosome preparation. Chromosome preparation involves 
hypotonic treatment of the cells, fixation and staining.
    (7) Analysis. Slides shall be coded before analysis. In human 
lymphocytes, only cells containing 46 centromeres shall be analyzed. In 
established cell lines and strains, only metaphases containing 
<plus-minus>2 centromeres of the modal number shall be analyzed. Uniform 
criteria for scoring aberrations shall be used.
    (8) Confirmatory tests. When appropriate, a single positive response 
shall be confirmed by testing over a narrow range of concentrations.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
presented in a tabular form. Different types of structural chromosomal 
aberrations shall be listed with their numbers and frequencies for 
experimental and control groups. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods. Gaps or achromatic lesions are recorded separately 
and not included in the total aberration frequency.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of structural 
chromosomal aberrations. Another criterion may be based upon detection 
of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at 
least one of the test substance concentrations.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of structural 
chromosomal aberrations or a statistically significant and reproducible 
positive response at any one of the test points is considered 
nonmutagenic in this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the in vitro 
cytogenetics assay indicate that under the test conditions the test 
substance induces chromosomal aberrations in cultured mammalian somatic 
cells.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance does not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured 
mammalian somatic cells.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Cells used, density and passage number at time of treatment, 
number of cell cultures.
    (ii) Methods used for maintenance of cell cultures including medium, 
temperature and CO<INF>2</INF> concentration.
    (iii) Test chemical vehicle, concentration and rationale for the 
selection of the concentrations used in the assay, duration of 
treatment.

Sec. 798.5385  In vivo mammalian bone marrow cytogenetics tests: Chromosomal analysis.

    (a) Purpose. The in vivo bone marrow cytogenetic test is a 
mutagenicity test for the detection of structural chromosomal 
aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are generally evaluated in first 
post-treatment mitoses. With the majority of chemical mutagens, induced 
aberrations are of the chromatid type but chromosome type aberrations 
also occur.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Chromosome-type aberrations are changes which 
result from damage expressed in both sister chromatids at the same time.
    (2) Chromatid-type aberrations are damage expressed as breakage of 
single chromatids or breakage and/or reunion between chromatids.
    (c) Reference substances. Not applicable.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. Animals are exposed to test 
chemicals by appropriate routes and are sacrificed at sequential 
intervals. Chromosome preparations are made from bone marrow cells. The 
stained preparations are examined and metaphase cells are scored for 
chromosomal aberrations.
    (2) Description. The method employs bone marrow of laboratory 
rodents which have been exposed to test chemicals. Prior to sacrifice, 
animals are further treated with a spindle inhibitor, (e.g., colchicine 
or Colcemid <Register>) to arrest the cells in c-metaphase. Chromosome 
preparations from the cells are stained and scored for chromosomal 
aberrations.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. Any appropriate 
mammalian species may be used. Examples of commonly used rodent species 
are rats, mice, and hamsters.
    (ii) Age. Healthy young adult animals shall be used.
    (iii) Number and sex. At least five female and five male animals per 
experimental and control group shall be used. Thus, 10 animals would be 
sacrificed per time per group treated with the test compound if several 
test times

[[Page 198]]

after treatment are included in the experimental schedule. The use of a 
single sex or smaller number of animals should be justified.
    (iv) Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned 
to treatment and control groups.
    (4) Control groups--(1) Concurrent controls. (i) Concurrent positive 
and negative (vehicle) controls shall be included in the assay.
    (ii) Positive controls. A single dose positive control showing a 
significant response at any one time point is adequate. A compound known 
to produce chromosomal aberrations in vivo shall be employed as the 
positive control.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When possible, test chemicals shall 
be dissolved in isotonic saline or distilled water. Water insoluble 
chemicals may be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The 
vehicles used shall neither interfere with the test chemical nor produce 
toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test compound should be 
employed.
    (ii) Dose levels. For an initial assessment, one dose of the test 
substance may be used, the dose being the maximum tolerated dose (to a 
maximum of 5,000 mg/kg) or that producing some indication of 
cytotoxicity (e.g., partial inhibition of mitosis) or shall be the 
highest dose attainable (to a maximum of 5,000 mg/kg). Additional dose 
levels may be used. For determination of dose-response, at least three 
dose levels should be used.
    (iii) Route of administration. The usual routes are oral or by 
intraperitoneal injection. Other routes may be appropriate.
    (iv) Treatment schedule. In general, test substances should be 
administered once only. However, based on toxicological information a 
repeated treatment schedule may be employed.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Generally the test may be performed in two 
assays. (i) Animals should be treated with the test substance once at 
the selected dose(s). Samples should be taken at three times after 
treatment. For rodents, the central sampling interval is 24 hours. Since 
cell cycle kinetics can be influenced by the test substance, one earlier 
and one later sampling interval adequately spaced within the range of 6 
to 48 hours shall be applied. Where the additional dose levels are 
tested in a subsequent experiment, samples shall be taken at the 
predetermined most sensitive interval or, if this is not established, at 
the central sampling time. If the most sensitive interval is known and 
documented with data, only this one time point shall be sampled.
    (ii) If a repeated treatment schedule is used at the selected 
dose(s), samples shall be taken 6 and 24 hours after the last treatment; 
other sampling times may be used if justified. Where the additional dose 
levels are tested in a subsequent experiment, samples shall be taken at 
the predetermined most sensitive interval or, if this is not 
established, at 6 hours after the last treatment.
    (2) Administration of spindle inhibitor. Prior to sacrifice, animals 
shall be injected IP with an appropriate dose of a spindle inhibitor 
(e.g., colchicine or Colcemid<SUP></SUP>) to arrest cells in c-
metaphase.
    (3) Preparation of slides. Immediately after sacrifice, the bone 
marrow shall be obtained, exposed to hypotonic solution, and fixed. The 
cells shall then be spread on slides and stained. Chromosome 
preparations shall be made following standard procedures.
    (4) Analysis. The number of cells to be analyzed per animal should 
be based upon the number of animals used, the negative control 
frequency, the predetermined sensitivity, and the power chosen for the 
test. Slides shall be coded before microscopic analysis.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data should be 
presented in tabular form for both cells and animals. Different types of 
structural chromosomal aberrations should be listed with their numbers 
and a mean frequency per cell for each animal in all treated and control 
groups. Gaps (achromatic lesions) should be recorded separately and not 
included in the total abberration frequency. Differences among animals 
within each group should be considered before making comparisons between 
treated and control groups.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.

[[Page 199]]

    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of structual chromosomal 
aberrations or abnormal metaphase figures. Another criterion may be 
based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant 
positive response for a least one of the test points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of chromosomal 
aberrations or abnormal metaphase figures or a statistically significant 
and reproducible positive response at any one of the test points is 
considered nonmutagenic in this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the in vivo bone marrow 
cytogenetics assay indicate that under the test conditions the test 
substance induces chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow of the test 
species.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions, the 
test substance does not induce chromosomal aberrations in the bone 
marrow of the test species.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Species, strain, age, weight, number and sex of animals in each 
treatment and control group.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, dose levels used, rationale for dose 
selection.
    (iii) Route of administration, treatment and sampling schedules, 
toxicity data, negative and positive controls.
    (iv) Identity of spindle-inhibitor, its concentration and duration 
of treatment.
    (v) Details of the protocol used for chromosome preparation, number 
of cells scored per animal, type and number of aberrations given 
separately for each treated and control animal.
    (vi) Mitotic index, where applicable.
    (vii) Criteria for scoring aberrations.
    (viii) Number and frequency of aberrant cells per animal in each 
treatment and control groups.
    (ix) Total number of aberrations per group.
    (x) Number of cells with aberrations per group.
    (xi) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

Sec. 798.5395  In vivo mammalian bone marrow cytogenetics tests: Micronucleus assay.

    (a) Purpose. The micronucleus test is a mammalian in vivo test which 
detects damage of the chromosomes or mitotic apparatus by chemicals. 
Polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of rodents are used in 
this assay. When the erythroblast develops into an erythrocyte the main 
nucleus is extruded and may leave a micronucleus in the cytoplasm. The 
visualization of micronuclei is facilitated in these cells because they 
lack a nucleus.

[[Page 200]]

Micronuclei form under normal conditions. The assay is based on an 
increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes 
in bone marrow of treated animals.
    (b) Definition. Micronuclei are small particles consisting of 
acentric fragments of chromosomes or entire chromosomes, which lag 
behind at anaphase of cell division. After telophase, these fragments 
may not be included in the nuclei of daughter cells and form single or 
multiple micronuclei in the cytoplasm.
    (c) Reference substances. Not applicable.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. (i) Animals are exposed to test 
substance by an appropriate route. They are sacrificed, the bone marrow 
extracted and smear preparations made and stained. Polychromatic 
erythrocytes are scored for micronuclei under the microscope.
    (ii) Micronuclei may also be detected in other test systems:
    (A) Tissue culture.
    (B) Plants.
    (C) Blood smears.
    (D) Fetal tissues.
    (E) Meiotic cells.
    (F) Hepatic cells.
    (iii) The present guideline is based on the mammalian bone marrow 
assay.
    (2) Description. The method employs bone marrow of laboratory 
mammals which are exposed to test substances.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. Mice are recommended. 
However, any appropriate mammalian species may be used.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals shall be used.
    (iii) Number and sex. At least five female and five male animals per 
experimental and control group shall be used. Thus, 10 animals would be 
sacrificed per time per group if several test times after treatment were 
included in the experimental schedule. The use of a single sex or a 
smaller number of animals should be justified.
    (iv) Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned 
to treatment and control groups.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. Concurrent positive and 
negative (vehicle) controls shall be included in each assay.
    (ii) Positive controls. A compound known to produce micronuclei in 
vivo shall be employed as the positive control.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When appropriate for the route of 
administration, solid and liquid test substances should be dissolved or 
suspended in distilled water or isotonic saline. Water insoluble 
chemicals may be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The 
vehicle used shall neither interfere with the test compound nor produce 
toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test compound should be 
employed.
    (ii) Dose levels. For an initial assessment, one dose of the test 
substance may be used, the dose being the maximum tolerated dose (to a 
maximum of 5,000 mg/kg) or that producing some indication of 
cytotoxicity, e.g., a change in the ratio of polychromatic to 
normochromatic erythrocytes. Additional dose levels may be used. For 
determination of dose response, at least three dose levels shall be 
used.
    (iii) Route of administration. The usual routes of administration 
are IP or oral. Other routes may be appropriate.
    (iv) Treatment schedule. Test substances should generally be 
administered only once. However, based upon toxicological information a 
repeated treatment schedule may be employed.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Treatment and sampling times. (i) Animals 
shall be treated with the test substance once at the highest tolerated 
dose. Sampling times should coincide with the maximum responses of the 
assay which varies with the test substance. Therefore, using the highest 
dose, bone marrow samples should be taken at least three times, starting 
not earlier than 12 hours after treatment, with appropriate intervals 
following the first sample but not extending beyond 72 hours. When other 
doses are used sampling shall be at the maximum sensitive period, or, if 
that is not known, approximately 24 hours after treatment. Other 
appropriate sampling times may be used in addition. If the most 
sensitive interval is known and documented with data, only this one time 
point need be sampled.
    (ii) If a repeated treatment schedule is used, samples shall be 
taken at least

[[Page 201]]

three times, starting not earlier than 12 hours after the last treatment 
and at appropriate intervals following the first sample, but not 
extending beyond 72 hours.
    (iii) Bone marrow shall be obtained immediately after sacrifice. 
Cells shall be prepared, put on slides, spread as a smear and stained.
    (2) Analysis. Slides shall be coded before microscopic analysis. At 
least 1,000 polychromatic erythrocytes per animal shall be scored for 
the incidence of micronuclei. The ratio of polychromatic to 
normochromatic erythrocytes should be determined for each animal by 
counting a total of 200 erythrocytes. To ensure consistency with OECD 
and other guidelines, 1,000 polychromatic erythrocytes are recommended. 
Additional information may be obtained by scoring normochromatic 
erythrocytes for micronuclei.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Criteria for scoring 
micronuclei shall be given. Individual data shall be presented in a 
tabular form including positive and negative (vehicle) controls and 
experimental groups. The number of polychromatic erythrocytes scored, 
the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes, the percentage 
of micronucleated cells, the number of micronucleated normochromatic 
erythrocytes, and, if applicable, the percentage of micronucleated 
erythrocytes and the ratio of normochromatic to polychromatic 
erythrocytes shall be listed separately for each experimental and 
control animal. Absolute numbers shall be included if percentages are 
reported.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive response, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes. Another criterion may be based upon 
detection of a reproducible and statistically significant positive 
response for at least one of the test substance concentrations.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes or a statistically significant and 
reproducible positive response at any one of the test points is 
considered nonmutagenic in this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) The results of the micronucleus test 
provide information on the ability of a chemical to induce micronuclei 
in polychromatic erythrocytes of the test species under the conditions 
of the test. This damage may have been the result of chromosomal damage 
or damage to the mitotic apparatus.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance does not produce micronuclei in the bone marrow of the 
test species.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Species, strain, age, weight, number and sex of animals in each 
treatment and control group.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, dose levels used, rationale for dose 
selection.
    (iii) Rationale for and description of treatment and sampling 
schedules, toxicity data, negative and positive controls.
    (iv) Details of the protocol used for slide preparation.
    (v) Criteria for identifying micronucleated erythrocytes.
    (vi) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

Sec. 798.5450  Rodent dominant lethal assay.

    (a) Purpose. Dominant lethal (DL) effects cause embryonic or fetal 
death. Induction of a dominant lethal event after exposure to a chemical 
substance indicates that the substance has affected germinal tissue of 
the test species. Dominant lethals are generally accepted to be the 
result of chromosomal damage (structural and numerical anomalies) but 
gene mutations and toxic effects cannot be excluded.
    (b) Definition. A dominant lethal mutation is one occurring in a 
germ cell which does not cause dysfunction of the gamete, but which is 
lethal to the fertilized egg or developing embryo.
    (c) Reference substances. These may include, but need not be limited 
to, triethylenemelamine, cyclophosphamide or ethyl methanesulfonate.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. Generally, male animals are exposed 
to the test substance and mated to untreated virgin females. The various 
germ cell stages can be tested separately by the use of sequential 
mating intervals. The females are sacrificed after an appropriate period 
of time and the contents of the uteri are examined to determine the 
numbers of implants and live and dead embryos. The calculation of the 
dominant lethal effect is based on comparison of the live implants per 
female in the treated group to the live implants per female in the 
control group. The increase of dead implants per female in the treated 
group over the dead implants per female in the control group reflects 
the post-implantation loss. The post-implantation loss is calculated by 
determining the ratio of dead to total implants from the treated group 
compared to the ratio of dead to total implants from the control group. 
Pre-implantation loss can be estimated on the basis of corpora lutea 
counts or by comparing the total implants per female in treated and 
control groups.
    (2) Description. (i) Several treatment schedules are available. The 
most widely used requires single administration of the test substance. 
Other treatment schedules, such as treatment on five consecutive days, 
may be used if justified by the investigator.
    (ii) Individual males are mated sequentially to virgin females at 
appropriate intervals. The number of matings following treatment is 
governed by the treatment schedule and should ensure that germ cell 
maturation is adequately covered. Females are sacrificed in the second 
half of pregnancy and the uterine contents examined to determine the 
total number of implants and the number of live and dead embryos.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species. Rats or mice are generally used 
as the test species. Strains with low background dominant lethality, 
high pregnancy frequency and high implant numbers are recommended.
    (ii) Age. Healthy, sexually mature animals shall be used.
    (iii) Number. An adequate number of animals shall be used taking 
into account the spontaneous variation of the biological characteristics 
being evaluated. The number chosen should be based on the predetermined 
sensitivity of detection and power of significance. For example, in a 
typical experiment, the number of males in each group shall be 
sufficient to provide between 30 and 50 pregnant females per mating 
interval.

[[Page 203]]

    (iv) Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned 
to treatment and control groups.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. Generally concurrent 
positive and negative (vehicle) controls shall be included in each 
experiment. When acceptable positive control results are available from 
experiments conducted recently (within the last 12 months) in the same 
laboratory these results can be used instead of a concurrent positive 
control.
    (ii) Positive controls. Positive control substances shall be used at 
a dose which demonstrates the test sensitivity.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When possible, test substances 
shall be dissolved or suspended in isotonic saline or distilled water. 
Water-insoluble chemicals may be dissolved or suspended in appropriate 
vehicles. The vehicle used shall neither interfere with the test 
chemical nor produce toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test 
chemical should be employed.
    (ii) Dose levels. Normally, three dose levels shall be used. The 
highest dose shall produce signs of toxicity (e.g., slightly reduced 
fertility and slightly reduced body weight). However, in an initial 
assessment of dominant lethality a single high dose may be sufficient. 
Nontoxic substances shall be tested at 5g/kg or, if this is not 
practicable, then as the highest dose attainable.
    (iii) Route of administration. The usual routes of administration 
are oral or by IP injection. Other routes may be appropriate.
    (e) Test performance. (1) Individual males are mated sequentially at 
appropriate predetermined intervals to one or two virgin females. 
Females should be left with the males for at least the duration of one 
estrus cycle or alternatively until mating has occurred as determined by 
the presence of sperm in the vagina or by the presence of a vaginal 
plug.
    (2) The number of matings following treatment should be governed by 
the treatment schedule and should ensure that germ cell maturation is 
adequately covered.
    (3) Females should be sacrificed in the second half of pregnancy and 
uterine contents examined to determine the number of implants and live 
and dead embryos. The ovaries may be examined to determine the number of 
corpora lutea.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data shall be 
tabulated to show the number of males, the number of pregnant females, 
and the number of nonpregnant females. Results of each mating, including 
the identity of each male and female, shall be reported individually. 
For each female, the dose level and week of mating and the frequencies 
of live implants and of dead implants shall be enumerated. If the data 
are recorded as early and late deaths, the tables shall make that clear. 
If preimplantation loss is estimated, it shall be reported. 
Preimplantation loss can be calculated as the difference between the 
number of corpora lutea and the number of implants or as a reduction in 
the average number of implants per female in comparison with control 
matings.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods. Differences among animals within the control and 
treatment groups shall be considered before making comparisons between 
treated and control groups.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of dominant lethals. 
Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and 
statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test 
points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of dominant lethals or a 
statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one 
of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) A positive DL assay suggests that under the 
test conditions the test substance may be genotoxic in the germ cells of 
the treated sex of the test species.

[[Page 204]]

    (ii) A negative result suggests that under the conditions of the 
test the test substance may not be genotoxic in the germ cells of the 
treated sex of the test species.
    (5) Test Report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Species, strain, age and weights of animals used, number of 
animals of each sex in experimental and control groups.
    (ii) Test substance, vehicle used, dose levels and rationale for 
dosage selection, negative (vehicle) and positive controls, experimental 
observations, including signs of toxicity.
    (iii) Route and duration of exposure.
    (iv) Mating schedule.
    (v) Methods used to determine that mating has occurred (where 
applicable).
    (vi) Criteria for scoring dominant lethals including the number of 
early and late embryonic deaths.
    (vii) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 798.5460  Rodent heritable translocation assays.

    (a) Purpose. This test detects transmitted chromosomal damage which 
manifests as balanced reciprocal translocations in progeny descended 
from parental males treated with chemical mutagens.
    (b) Definitions. (1) A heritable translocation is one in which 
distal segments of nonhomologous chromosomes are involved in a 
reciprocal exchange.
    (2) Diakinesis and metaphase I are stages of meiotic prophase scored 
cytologically for the presence of multivalent chromosome association 
characteristic of translocation carriers.
    (c) Reference substances. Not applicable.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. When a balanced reciprocal 
translocation is induced in a parental male germ cell, the resulting 
progeny is translocation heterozygote.
    (i) Basis for fertility screening. Male translocation heterozygotes 
may be completely sterile. This class consists of two types of 
translocations:
    (A) Translocations between non-homologous chromosomes in which at 
least one of the breaks occurs close to one end of a chromosome.
    (B) Those that carry multiple translocations. The majority of male 
translocation heterozygotes are semisterile--they carry one or (rarely) 
two translocations. The degree of semisterility is dependent upon the 
proportions of balanced and unbalanced (duplication-deficiency) gametes 
produced in the ejaculate as a function of meiotic segregation. Balanced 
and unbalanced sperm are equally capable of fertilizing an egg. Balanced 
sperm lead to viable progeny. Unbalanced sperm result in early embryonic 
lethality.
    (ii) Basis for cytological screening. The great majority of male 
translocation heterozygotes can be identified cytologically through 
analysis of diakinesis metaphase I spermatocytes. Translocation 
heterozygotes are characterized by the presence of multivalent 
chromosome association such as a ring or chain of four chromosomes held 
together by chiasmata in paired homologous regions. Some translocation 
carriers can be identified by the presence of extra long and/or extra 
short chromosomes in spermatogonial and somatic cell metaphase 
preparations.

[[Page 205]]

    (2) Description. Essentially, two methods have been used to screen 
for translocation heterozygosity; one method uses a mating sequence to 
identify sterile and semisterile males followed by cytological 
examination of suspect male individuals; the other method deletes the 
mating sequence altogether and all F<INF>1</INF> male progeny are 
examined cytologically for presence of translocation. In the former 
approach, the mating sequence serves as a screen which eliminates most 
fully fertile animals for cytological confirmation as translocation 
heterozygotes.
    (3) Animal selection--(i) Species. The mouse is the species 
generally used, and is recommended.
    (ii) Age. Healthy sexually mature animals shall be used.
    (iii) Number. (A) The number of male animals necessary is determined 
by the following factors:
    (1) The use of either historical or concurrent controls.
    (2) The power of the test.
    (3) The minimal rate of induction required.
    (4) Whether positive controls are used.
    (5) The level of significance desired.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iv) Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned 
to treatment and control groups.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. No concurrent positive 
or negative (vehicle) controls are recommended as routine parts of the 
heritable translocation assay. However, investigators not experienced in 
performing translocation testing shall include a substance known to 
produce translocations in the assay as a positive control reference 
chemical.
    (ii) Historical controls. At the present time, historical control 
data must be used in tests for significance. When statistically reliable 
historical controls are not available, negative (vehicle) controls shall 
be used.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When appropriate for the route of 
administration, solid and liquid test substances should be dissolved or 
suspended in distilled water or isotonic saline. Water-insoluble 
chemicals may be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The 
vehicle used shall neither interfere with the test chemical nor produce 
toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test chemical should be 
employed.
    (ii) Dose levels. At least two dose levels shall be used. The 
highest dose level shall result in toxic effects (which shall not 
produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful 
evaluation) or shall be the highest dose attainable or 5g/kg body 
weight.
    (iii) Route of administration. Acceptable routes of administration 
include oral, inhalation, admixture with food or water, and IP or IV 
injection.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Treatment and mating. The animals shall be 
dosed with the test substances 7 days per week over a period of 35 days. 
After treatment, each male shall be caged with 2 untreated females for a 
period of 1 week. At the end of 1 week, females shall be separated from 
males and caged individually. When females give birth, the day of birth, 
litter size, and sex of progeny shall be recorded. All male progeny 
should be weaned, and all female progeny should be discarded.
    (2) Testing for translocation heterozygosity. When males are 
sexually mature, testing for translocation heterozygosity shall begin. 
One of two methods shall be used; the first method involves mating, 
determining those F<INF>1</INF> progeny which are sterile or semisterile 
and subsequent cytological analysis of suspect progeny; the other method 
does not involve mating and determining sterility or semisterility; all 
progeny are examined cytologically.
    (i) Determination of sterility or semisterility--(A) Conventional 
method. Females are mated, usually three females for each male, and each 
female is killed at midpregnancy. Living and dead implantations are 
counted. Criteria for determining normal and semisterile males are 
usually established for each new strain because the number of dead 
implantations varies considerably among strains.
    (B) Sequential method. Males to be tested are caged individually 
with females and the majority of the presumably normal males are 
identified on the basis of a predetermined size of 1 or 2 litters. 
Breeding pens are examined daily on weekdays beginning 18 days

[[Page 206]]

after pairing. Young are discarded immediately after they are scored. 
Males that sire a litter whose size is the same as or greater than the 
minimum set for a translocation-free condition are discarded with their 
litter. If the litter size is smaller than the predetermined number, a 
second litter is produced with the same rule applying. Males that cannot 
be classified as normal after production of a second litter are tested 
further by the conventional method or by cytological confirmation of 
translocation.
    (ii) Cytological analysis. For cytological analysis of suspected 
semisteriles, the air-drying technique is used. Observation of at least 
2 diakinesis-metaphase 1 cells with mutivalent association constitutes 
the required evidence for the presence of a translocation. Sterile males 
are examined by one of two methods, those with testes of normal size and 
sperm in the epididymis are examined by the same techniques used for 
semisteriles. Animals with small testes are examined by squash 
preparations or, alternatively, by examination of mitotic metaphase 
preparations. If squash preparations do not yield diakinesis-metaphase 1 
cells, analysis of spermatogonia or bone marrow for the presence of 
unusually long or short chromosomes should be performed.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. (i) Data shall be 
presented in tabular form and shall include the number of animals at 
risk, the germ cell stage treated, the number of partial steriles and 
semisteriles (if the fertility test is used), the number of 
cytogenetically confirmed translocation heterozygotes (if the fertility 
test is used, report the number of confirmed steriles and confirmed 
partial steriles), the translocation rate, and either the standard error 
of the rate or the upper 95 percent confidence limit on the rate.
    (ii) These data shall be presented for both treated and control 
groups. Historical or concurrent controls shall be specified, as well as 
the randomization procedure used for concurrent controls.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of heritable 
translocations. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a 
reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at 
least one of the test points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of heritable 
translocations or a statistically significant and reproducible positive 
response at any one of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in 
this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the heritable 
translocation assay indicate that under the test conditions the test 
substance causes heritable chromosomal damage in the test species.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance does not cause heritable chromosomal damage in the test 
species.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific 
information shall be reported:
    (i) Species, strain, age, weight and number of animals of each sex 
in each group.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, route and schedule of administration, 
toxicity data.
    (iii) Dosing regimen, doses tested and rationale for dosage 
selection.
    (iv) Mating schedule, number of females mated to each male.
    (v) The use of historical or concurrent controls.
    (vi) Screening procedure including the decision criteria used and 
the method by which they were determined.
    (vii) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

Sec. 798.5500  Differential growth inhibition of repair proficient and repair deficient bacteria: ``Bacterial DNA damage or repair tests.''

    (a) Purpose. Bacterial DNA damage or repair tests measure DNA damage 
which is expressed as differential cell killing or growth inhibition of 
repair deficient bacteria in a set of repair proficient and deficient 
strains. These tests do not measure mutagenic events per se. They are 
used as an indication of the interaction of a chemical with genetic 
material implying the potential for genotoxicity.
    (b) Definition. Test for differential growth inhibition of repair 
proficient and repair deficient bacteria measure differences in 
chemically induced cell killing between wild-type strains with full 
repair capacity and mutant strains deficient in one or more of the 
enzymes which govern repair of damaged DNA.
    (c) Reference substances. These may include, but need not be limited 
to, chloramphenicol or methyl methanesulfonate.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. The tests detect agents that 
interact with cellular DNA to produce growth inhibition or killing. This 
interaction is recognized by specific cellular repair systems. The 
assays are based upon the use of paired bacterial strains that differ by 
the presence of absence of specific DNA repair genes. The response is 
expressed in the preferential inhibition of growth or the preferential 
killing of the DNA repair deficient strain since it is incapable of 
removing certain chemical lesions from its DNA.
    (2) Description. Several methods for performing the test have been 
described. Those described here are:
    (i) Tests performed on solid medium (diffusion tests).
    (ii) Tests performed in liquid culture (suspension tests).
    (3) Strain selection--(i) Designation. At the present time, 
Escherichia coli polA (W3110/p3478) or Bacillus subtilis rec (H17/M45) 
pairs are recommended. Other pairs may be utilized when appropriate.
    (ii) Preparation and storage. Stock culture preparation and storage, 
growth requirements, method of strain identification and demonstration 
of appropriate phenotypic requirements should be performed using good 
microbiological techniques and should be documented.
    (4) Bacterial growth. Good microbiological techniques should be used 
to grow fresh cultures of bacteria. The phase of growth and cell density 
should be documented and should be adequate for the experimental design.
    (5) Metabolic activation. Bacteria should be exposed to the test 
substance both in the presence and absence of an appropriate metabolic 
activation system. The most commonly used system is a cofactor 
supplemented postmitochondrial fraction prepared from the livers of 
rodents treated with enzyme inducing agents. The use of other species, 
tissues or techniques may also be appropriate.
    (6) Control groups--(i) Concurrent controls. Concurrent positive, 
negative, and vehicle controls should be included in each assay.
    (ii) Negative controls. The negative control should show 
nonpreferential growth inhibition (i.e., should affect both strains 
equally). Chloramphenicol is an example of a negative control.
    (iii) Genotype specific controls. Examples of genotype specific 
positive controls are methyl methanesulfonate for polA strains and 
mitomycin C for rec strains.
    (iv) Positive controls to ensure the efficacy of the activation 
system. The positive control reference substance for tests including a 
metabolic activation system should be selected on the basis of the type 
of activation system used in the test.
    (v) Other positive controls. Other positive control reference 
substances may be used.
    (7) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. Test chemicals and positive and 
negative control reference substances should be dissolved in an 
appropriate vehicle and then further diluted in vehicle for use in the 
assay.
    (ii) Exposure concentrations. The test should initially be performed 
over a broad range of concentrations. Among

[[Page 208]]

the criteria to be taken into consideration for determining the upper 
limits of test chemical concentration are cytotoxicity and solubility. 
Cytotoxicity of the test chemical may be altered in the presence of 
metabolic activation systems. For freely soluble nontoxic chemicals, the 
upper test chemical concentration should be determined on a case by case 
basis. Because results are expressed as diameters of zones of growth 
inhibition in the diffusion test, it is most important that the amounts 
of chemical on the disc (or in the wells) are exact replicates. When 
appropriate, a positive response should be confirmed by testing over a 
narrow range of concentrations.
    (e) Test performance--(1) Diffusion assay--(i) Disc diffusion 
assays. Disc diffusion assays. may be performed in two ways:
    (A) A single strain of bacteria may be added to an agar overlay or 
spread on the surface of the agar and the test chemical placed on a 
filter disc on the surface of the agar or;
    (B) DNA repair proficient and DNA repair deficient bacteria may be 
streaked in a line on the surface of the agar of the same plate and a 
disc saturated with test chemical placed on the surface of the agar in 
contact with the streaks.
    (ii) Well diffusion assays. In well diffusion assays, bacteria may 
be either added to the agar overlay or spread onto the surface of the 
agar. A solution of the test chemical is then placed into a well in the 
agar.
    (2) Suspension assays. (i) A bacterial suspension may be exposed to 
the test chemical and the number of surviving bacteria determined (as 
colony-forming units) either as a function of time of treatment or as a 
function of the concentration of test agent.
    (ii) Nonturbid suspensions of bacteria may be exposed to serial 
dilutions of the test agent and a minimal inhibitory concentration for 
each strain determined, as evidenced by the presence or absence of 
visible growth after a period of incubation.
    (iii) Paired bacterial suspensions (usually with some initial 
turbidity) may be treated with a single dose of the chemical. Positive 
results are indicated by a differential inhibition in the rate of 
increase of turbidity of the paired cultures.
    (3) Number of cultures. When using a plate diffusion procedure, at 
least two independent plates should be used at each dilution. In liquid 
suspension assays, at least two independent specimens for determination 
of the number of viable cells should be plated.
    (4) Incubation conditions. All plates in a given test should be 
incubated for the same time period. This incubation period should be for 
18 to 24 hrs at 37  deg.C.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results--(i) Diffusion assays. 
Results should be expressed in diameters of zones of growth inhibition 
in millimeters or as areas derived therefrom as mm<SUP>2</SUP>. Dose-
response data, if available, should be presented using the same units.
    (ii) Liquid suspension assays. (A) Survival data can be presented as 
dose responses, preferably as percentage of survivors or fractional 
survival of each strain or as a relative survival (ratio) of the two 
strains.
    (B) Results can also be expressed as the concentrations required to 
effect a predetermined survival rate (e.g., D<INF>37</INF>, the dose 
permitting 37 percent survival). These data are derived from the 
survival curve. The concentration should be expressed as weight per 
volume, as moles, or as molarity.
    (C) Similarly, results can be expressed as minimal inhibitory 
concentration or as minimal lethal dose. The former is determined by the 
absence of visible growth in liquid medium and the latter is determined 
by plating dilutions onto semisolid media.
    (iii) In all tests, concentrations must be given as the final 
concentrations during the treatment. Raw data, prior to transformation, 
should be provided. These should include actual quantities measured, 
e.g., neat numbers. For measurement of diffusion, the diameters of the 
discs and/or well should be indicated and the measurements should 
indicate whether the diameter of the discs and/or well was subtracted. 
Moreover, mention should be made as to whether the test chemical gave a 
sharp, diffuse, or double-zone of growth

[[Page 209]]

inhibition. If it is the latter, the investigator should indicate 
whether the inner or the outer zone was measured.
    (iv) Viability data should be given as the actual plate counts with 
an indication of the dilution used and the volume plated or as derived 
titers (cells per ml). Transformed data alone in the absence of 
experimental data are not acceptable (i.e, ratios, differences, survival 
fraction).
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related preferential inhibition or killing of the 
repair deficient strain. Another criterion may be based upon detection 
of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at 
least one of the test points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related preferential inhibition or killing of the 
repair deficient strain or a statistically significant and reproducible 
positive response at any one of the test points is considered not to 
interact with the genetic material of the organisms used in assay.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. DNA damage tests in bacteria do not measure DNA 
repair per se nor do they measure mutations. They measure DNA damage 
which is expressed as cell killing or growth inhibition. A positive 
result in a DNA damage test in the absence of a positive result in 
another system is difficult to evaluate in the absence of a better data 
base.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the following specific 
information should be reported:
    (i) Bacterial strains used.
    (ii) Phase of bacterial cell growth at time of use in the assay.
    (iii) Media composition.
    (iv) Details of both the protocol used to prepare the metabolic 
activation system and its use in the assay.
    (v) Treatment protocol, including doses used and rationale for dose 
selection, positive and negative controls.
    (vi) Method used for determination of degree of cell kill.
    (vii) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

Sec. 798.5955  Heritable translocation test in drosophila melanogaster.

    (a) Purpose. The heritable translocation test in Drosophila measures 
the induction of chromosomal translocations in germ cells of insects. 
Stocks carrying genetic markers on two or more chromosomes are used to 
follow the assortment of chromosomes in meiosis. The F<INF>1</INF> male 
progeny of treated parents are individually mated to females and the 
F<INF>2 </INF>progeny phenotypes are scored. The observed spectrum of 
phenotypes is used to determine the presence or absence of a 
translocation. This is usually indicated by a lack of independent 
assortment of genes on different chromosomes.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Chromosome mutations are chromosomal changes 
resulting from breakage and reunion of chromosomes. Chromosomal 
mutations

[[Page 210]]

are also produced through nondisjunction of chromosomes during cell 
division.
    (2) Reciprocal translocations are chromosomal translocations 
resulting from reciprocal exchanges between two or more chromosomes.
    (3) Heritable translocations are reciprocal translocations 
transmitted from parent to the succeeding progeny.
    (c) Reference substances. These may include, but need not be limited 
to, ethyl methanesulfonate or N-dimethyl-nitrosamine.
    (d) Test method--(1) Principle. The method is based on the principle 
that balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations can be induced by 
chemicals in the germ cells of treated flies and that these 
translocations are detected in the F<INF>2</INF> progeny using genetic 
markers (mutations). Different mutations may be used as genetic markers 
and two or more of the four chromosomes may be genetically marked for 
inclusion in this test.
    (2) Description. Wild-type males are treated with chemical and bred 
with females of known genetic markers. The F<INF>1</INF> males are 
collected and individually bred with virgin females of the female 
parental stock. The resulting F<INF>2</INF> progeny are scored. Putative 
translocation carriers are confirmed with an F<INF>3</INF> cross.
    (i) Illustrative example. The following example serves to illustrate 
the method. Males carrying genes for red eye color on chromosomes II and 
III are bred with females of white eye color carrying alleles for brown 
(bw) on the second chromosome and scarlet (st) and pink (pp) on the 
third chromosome. The F<INF>1</INF> male progeny are bred with virgin 
females of the female parental stock and the resulting F<INF>2</INF> 
progeny are examined for eye color phenotypes. If there is no 
translocation in the F<INF>1</INF> male, then the resulting 
F<INF>2</INF> progeny will have four eye color phenotypes: red, white, 
orange, and brown. If the F<INF>1</INF> male carries a translocation 
between chromosomes II and III, only red and white eye phenotypes are 
obtained in the F<INF>2</INF> generation. This happens because the 
F<INF>1</INF> translocation heterozygote produces two balanced (carrying 
either the parental or the translocated configuration of markers) and 
two unbalanced gametes. The unbalanced gametes (carrying one normal and 
one translocated chromosome) are unable to develop into normal 
individuals in the F<INF>2</INF> generation.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Drosophila stocks. Wild-type males and females of the genotype 
bw:st:pp (white eyes) may be used in the heritable translocation test. 
Other appropriately marked Drosophila stocks may also be used.
    (4) Control groups. (i) Concurrent positive and negative (vehicle) 
controls should be included in each experiment.
    (ii) Negative (vehicle) controls should be included. The size of the 
negative (vehicle) control group should be determined by the 
availability of appropriate laboratory historical control data.
    (iii) If the historical control data are of sufficient numbers, 
concurrent controls may not be necessary.
    (5) Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. Test chemicals should be dissolved 
in water. Compounds which are insoluble in water may be dissolved or 
suspended in appropriate vehicles (e.g., a mixture of ethanol and Tween-
60 or 80), and then diluted in water or saline prior to administration. 
Dimethylsulfoxide should be avoided as a vehicle.
    (ii) Dose levels. For the initial assessment of mutagenicity, it may 
be sufficient to test a single dose of the test substance. This dose 
should be the maximum tolerated dose or that which produces some 
indication of toxicity. If the test is being used to verify mutagenic 
activity, at least two additional exposure levels should be used.
    (iii) Route of administration. Exposure may be oral, by injection or 
by exposure to gases or vapours. Feeding of the test compound may be 
done in sugar solution. When necessary, substances may be dissolved in 
0.7 percent NaCl solution and injected into the thorax or abdomen.
    (e) Test performance--(1) P1 mating. (i) In the primary screen of a 
chemical, it is enough to sample one germ cell stage, either mature 
sperm or spermatids (for indirect acting mutagens). Other stages may be 
sampled if needed, i.e., when mature germ cells give a positive result 
and data from earlier germ cells are needed for the purpose of risk 
assessment. Thus,

[[Page 211]]

the treated males may be mated only once for a period of 3 days to 
sample sperm or transferred every 2 to 3 days to cover the entire germ 
cell cycle.
    (ii) Mass matings may be performed because the control rate for 
translocations in the available literature is very low (near 0) and 
clustered events are extremely rare. Mated females may be aged for 2 
weeks in order to recover an enhanced incidence of translocation due to 
the storage effect. The females are then allowed to lay eggs and 
F<INF>1</INF> males are collected for test mating.
    (2) F<INF>1</INF> mating. F<INF>1</INF> males should be bred with 
virgin females of the parental female stock. Since each F<INF>1</INF> 
male represents one treated gamete of the male parent, the F<INF>1</INF> 
males have to be mated individually to virgin females. Each 
F<INF>1</INF> male should be mated to three females to ensure sufficient 
progeny.
    (3) Scoring the F<INF>2</INF> generation. F<INF>2</INF> cultures 
(each representing 1 F<INF>1</INF> male tested) should be scored for the 
presence or absence of phenotype variations (linkage of markers) from 
the expected types. The test should be designed with a predetermined 
sensitivity and power. The number of flies in each group should reflect 
these defined parameters. The spontaneous mutant frequency observed in 
the appropriate control group will strongly influence the number of 
treated chromosomes that must be analyzed to detect substances which 
show mutation rates close to those of the controls. A positive test 
should be confirmed by F<INF>3</INF> mating trials.
    (4) Number of replicate experiments. Replicate experiments are 
usually performed for each dose of the compound tested. If a chemical is 
a potent inducer of translocations, one experiment may be sufficient. 
Otherwise two or three replicate experiments should be done.
    (f) Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data should be 
tabulated to show the number of translocations and the number of fertile 
F<INF>1</INF> males at each exposure for each germ cell stage sampled.
    (2) Statistical evaluation. Data should be evaluated by appropriate 
statistical methods.
    (3) Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for 
determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of heritable 
translocations. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a 
reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at 
least one of the test points.
    (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically 
significant dose-related increase in the number of heritable 
translocations or a statistically significant and reproducible positive 
response at any one of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in 
this system.
    (iii) Both biological and statistical significance should be 
considered together in the evaluation.
    (4) Test evaluation. (i) Positive results in the heritable 
translocation test in Drosophila indicate that under the test conditions 
the test substance causes chromosome damage in germ cells of this 
insect.
    (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the 
test substance does not cause chromosomal damage in D. melanogaster.
    (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as 
specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific 
information should be reported:
    (i) Drosophila stock used in the assay, age of insects, number of 
males treated, number of F<INF>2</INF> cultures established, number of 
replicate experiments.
    (ii) Test chemical vehicle, treatment and mating schedule, exposure 
levels, toxicity data, dose and route of exposure.
    (iii) Positive and negative (vehicle) controls.
    (iv) Historical control data, if available.
    (v) Number of chromosomes scored.
    (vi) Criteria for scoring mutant chromosomes.
    (vii) Dose-response relationship, if applicable.

                        Subpart G--Neurotoxicity


<R05>
Sec. 798.6050  Functional observational battery.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the potential human 
health effects of substances, it may be necessary to test for neurotoxic 
effects. Substances that have been observed to cause neurotoxic signs 
(e.g., convulsions, tremors, ataxia) in other toxicity tests, as well as 
those having a structural similarity to known neurotoxicants, should be 
evaluated for neurotoxicity. The functional observational battery is a 
noninvasive procedure designed to detect gross functional deficits in 
young adults resulting from exposure to chemicals and to better quantify 
neurotoxic effects detected in other studies. This battery of tests is 
not intended to provide a detailed evaluation of neurotoxicity. It is 
designed to be used in conjunction with neuropathologic evaluation and/
or general toxicity testing. Additional functional tests may be 
necessary to assess completely the neurotoxic potential of a chemical.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Neurotoxicity is any adverse effect on the 
structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system 
related to exposure to a chemical substance.
    (2) A toxic effect is an adverse change in the structure or function 
of an experimental animal as a result of exposure to a chemical 
substance.
    (c) Principle of the test method. The material is administered by an 
appropriate route to laboratory rodents. The animals are observed under 
carefully standardized conditions with sufficient frequency to ensure 
the detection of behavioral and/or neurologic abnormalities, if present. 
Various functions that could be affected by neurotoxicants are assessed 
during each observation period.
    (d) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
The laboratory rat or mouse is recommended. Although information will 
generally be lacking, whenever possible the choice of species should 
take into consideration such factors as the comparative metabolism of 
the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects of the test 
substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies. The potential 
for combined studies should also be considered. Standard strains should 
be used.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals (at least 42 days old for the rat or 
mouse) shall be used.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex are required for 
each dose level.
    (B) The females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (2) Number of animals. At least eight animals of each sex should be 
used at each dose level and should be designated for behavioral testing. 
If interim sacrifices are planned, the number should be increased by the 
number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before the end of the 
study. Animals shall be randomly assigned to treatment and control 
groups.
    (3) Control groups. (i) A concurrent (``sham'' exposure or vehicle) 
control group is required. Subjects shall be treated in the same way as 
for an exposure group except that administration of the test substance 
is omitted.
    (ii) Concurrent or historic data from the laboratory performing the 
testing shall provide evidence of the ability of the procedures used to 
detect major neurotoxic endpoints such as limb weakness or paralysis 
(e.g., acrylamide), CNS stimulation (e.g., <greek-b>, <greek-b> '-
iminodiproprionitrile) autonomatic signs (e.g., physostigmine).
    (iii) A satellite group may be treated with the high dose level for 
the duration of exposure and observed for reversibility, persistence, or 
delayed occurrence of toxic effects for a post-treatment period of 
appropriate duration, normally not less than 28 days.
    (4) Dose levels and dose selection. At least 3 doses, equally spaced 
on a log scale (e.g., \1/2\ log units) over a range of

[[Page 213]]

at least 1 log unit shall be used in addition to a zero dose or vehicle 
administration. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-effect 
curve.
    (i) The highest dose shall produce (A) clear behavioral effects or 
(B) life-threatening toxicity.
    (ii) The data from the lower doses must show either (A) graded dose-
dependent effects at 2 dose levels or (B) no effects at 2 dose levels, 
respectively.
    (5) Duration and frequency of exposure. The duration and frequency 
of exposure will be specified in the test rule.
    (6) Route of exposure. The test substance shall be administered by 
the route specified in the test rule. This route will usually be the one 
most closely approximating the expected route of human exposure. The 
exposure potocol shall conform to that outlined in the appropriate acute 
or subchronic toxicity study guideline under subpart B or subpart C of 
this part.
    (7) Combined protocol. Subjects used for other toxicity studies may 
be used if none of the requirements of either study are violated by the 
combination.
    (8) Study conduct. (i) All animals in a given study should be 
observed carefully by trained technicians who are blind with respect to 
the animals' treatments. Standard procedures to minimize observer 
variability shall be followed. Where possible, it is advisable that the 
same observer be used to evaluate the animals in a given study. If this 
is not possible, some demonstration of inter-observer reliability is 
required. All animals should be observed prior to initiation of 
exposure. Subsequent observations should be made with sufficent 
frequency to ensure the detection of behavioral and/or neurologic 
abnormalities, if present. At minimum, observations at 1 hour, 6 hours, 
24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days and monthly thereafter are recommended. In 
a subchronic study, subsequent to the first exposure all observations 
should be made before the daily exposure. The animals should be removed 
from the home cage to a standard arena for observation. Effort should be 
made to ensure that variations in the test conditions are minimal and 
are not systematically related to treatment. Among the variables that 
can affect behavior are sound level, temperature, humidity, lighting, 
odors, time of day, and environmental distractions. Explicit, 
operationally defined scales for each function should be used. The 
development of objective quantitative measures of the observational 
endpoints specified is encouraged.
    (ii) The following is a minimal list of observations that shall be 
noted:
    (A) Any unusual responses with respect to body position, activity 
level, coordination of movement, and gait.
    (B) Any unusual or bizarre behavior including, but not limited to, 
headflicking, head searching, compulsive biting or licking, self-
mutilation, circling, and walking backwards.
    (C) The presence of:
    (1) Convulsions.
    (2) Tremors.
    (3) Increased levels of lacrimation and/or red-colored tears.
    (4) Increased levels of salivation.
    (5) Piloerection.
    (6) Pupillary dilation or constriction.
    (7) Unusual respiration (shallow, labored, dyspneic, gasping, and 
retching) and/or mouth breathing.
    (8) Diarrhea.
    (9) Excessive or diminished urination.
    (10) Vocalization.
    (D) Forelimb/hindlimb grip strength. The procedure described by 
Meyer et al. (1979), under paragraph (f)(9) of this section is 
recommended.
    (E) Sensory function. A simple assessment of sensory function 
(vision, audition, pain perception) shall be made. Marshall et al. 
(1971) under paragraph (f)(8) of this section have described a 
neurologic exam for this purpose; these procedures are also discussed by 
Deuel (1977), under paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Irwin (1968) under 
paragraph (f)(7) of this section described a number of reflex tests 
intended to detect gross sensory deficits, including the visual placing 
response, Preyer reflex, and tail pinch. Many procedures have been 
developed for assessing pain perception (e.g., Ankier, 1974 under 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section; D'Amour and Smith 1941 under paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section; Evans 1971 under paragraph (f)(6) of this 
section).
    (e) Data reporting and evaluation. In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified under 40 CFR part 792 subpart

[[Page 214]]

J the final test report must include the following information.
    (1) Description of system and test methods. (i) A detailed 
description of the procedures used to standardize observation, including 
the arena and operational definitions for scoring observations.
    (ii) Positive control data from the laboratory performing the test 
that demonstrate the sensitivity of the procedures being used. Historic 
data may be used if all aspects of the experimental protocol are the 
same, including personnel.
    (2) Results. The following information must be arranged by test 
group dose level.
    (i) In tabular form, data for each animal must be provided showing:
    (A) Its identification number.
    (B) Its body weight and score on each sign at each observation time, 
the time and cause of death (if appropriate).
    (ii) Summary data for each group must include:
    (A) The number of animals at the start of the test.
    (B) The number of animals showing each observation score at each 
observation time.
    (C) The percentage of animals showing each abnormal sign at each 
observation time.
    (D) The mean and standard deviation for each continuous endpoint at 
each observation time.
    (3) Evaluation of data. The findings of a functional observational 
battery should be evaluated in the context of preceding and/or 
concurrent toxicity studies and any correlative histopathological 
findings. The evaluation shall include the relationship between the 
doses of the test substance and the presence or absence, incidence and 
severity, of any neurotoxic effects. The evaluation should include 
appropriate statistical analyses. Choice of analyses should consider 
tests appropriate to the experimental design and needed adjustments for 
multiple comparisons.

Sec. 798.6200  Motor activity.

    (a) Purpose--(1) General. In the assessment and evaluation of the 
toxic characteristics of a substance, determination of the effects of 
administration of the substance on motor activity is useful when 
neurotoxicity is suspected.
    (2) Acute Motor Activity Test. The purpose of the acute motor 
activity test is to examine changes in motor activity occurring over a 
range of acute exposure levels. These changes may then be evaluated in 
the context of changes occurring in other organ systems. This test is an 
initial step in determining

[[Page 215]]

the potential of a substance to produce acute neurotoxicity and may be 
used to screen members of a class of substances for known neurotoxicity, 
and/or to establish a dosage regimen prior to the initiation of 
subchronic neurotoxicity testing.
    (3) Subchronic Motor Activity Test. The purpose of the subchronic 
motor activity test is to determine whether the repeated administration 
of a suspected neurotoxicant results in changes in motor activity. These 
changes may be evaluated in the context of changes occurring in other 
organ systems. This test is an initial step in determining the potential 
of a substance to produce subchronic neurotoxicity.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Neurotoxicity is the adverse effect on the 
structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system 
related to exposure to a chemical substance.
    (2) Motor activity is any movement of the experimental animal.
    (3) A toxic effect is an adverse change in the structure or function 
of an experimental animal as a result of exposure to a chemical 
substance.
    (c) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
to several groups of experimental animals, one dose being used per 
group. Measurements of motor activity are made. The exposure levels at 
which significant changes in motor activity are produced are compared to 
those levels which produce toxic effects not originating in the central 
and/or peripheral nervous system.
    (d) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Testing shall be performed in a laboratory rat or mouse. The choice of 
species should take into consideration such factors as the comparative 
metabolism of the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects 
of the test substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies, the 
potential for combined studies, and the availability of other toxicity 
data for the species.
    (ii) Age. Young adult animals (at least 42 days old for rat or 
mouse) should be used.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Equal numbers of animals of each sex are required for 
each dose level for the motor activity test.
    (B) The females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.
    (2) Number of animals. Animals shall be randomly assigned to test 
and control groups. Each test or control group must be designed to 
contain a sufficient number of animals at the completion of the study to 
detect a 40 percent change in activity of the test groups relative to 
the control group with 90 percent power at the 5 percent level. For most 
designs, calculations can be made according to Dixon and Massey (1957) 
under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, Neter and Wasserman (1974) under 
paragraph (f)(5) of this section, Sokal and Rohlf (1969) under paragraph 
(f)(9) of this section, or Jensen (1972) under paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Control groups. (i) A concurrent control group is required. This 
group must be an untreated group, or, if a vehicle is used in 
administering the test substance, a vehicle control group. If the toxic 
properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be made available, 
both untreated and vehicle control group are required.
    (ii) Positive control data are required to demonstrate the 
sensitivity and reliability of the activity measuring device and testing 
procedure. These data should demonstrate the ability to detect increases 
or decreases in activity and to generate a dose-effect curve or its 
equivalent using three values of the dose or equivalent independent 
variable. A single administration of the dose (or equivalent) is 
sufficient. It is recommended that chemical exposure be used to collect 
positive control data. Positive control data shall be collected at the 
time of the test study unless the laboratory can demonstrate the 
adequacy of historical data for this purpose.
    (iii) A satellite group may be treated with the high dose level for 
90 days and observed for reversibility, persistence or delayed 
occurrence of toxic effects for a post-treatment period of appropriate 
length, normally not less than 28 days.
    (4) Dose levels and dose selection. At least 3 doses, equally spaced 
on a log scale (e.g., \1/2\ log units) over a range of

[[Page 216]]

at least 1 log unit shall be used in addition to a zero dose or vehicle 
administration. The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-effect 
curve.
    (i) The highest dose shall produce (A) clear effects on motor 
activity or (B) life-threatening toxicity.
    (ii) The data from the lower doses must show either (A) graded dose-
dependent effects at 2 dose levels or (B) no effects at 2 dose levels, 
respectively.
    (5) Duration of testing. The duration of exposure will be specified 
in the test rule.
    (6) Route of administration. The test substance shall be 
administered by the method specified in the test rule. This will usually 
be the route most closely approximating the route of human exposure. The 
exposure protocol shall conform to that outlined in the appropriate 
acute or subchronic toxicity study guideline.
    (7) Combined protocol. The tests described herein may be combined 
with any other toxicity study, as long as none of the requirements of 
either are violated by the combination.
    (8) Study conduct--(i) General. Motor activity must be monitored by 
an automated activity recording apparatus. The device used must be 
capable of detecting both increases and decreases in activity, i.e. 
baseline activity as measured by the device must not be so low as to 
preclude decreases nor so high as to preclude increases. Each device 
shall be tested by standard procedure to ensure, to the extent possible, 
reliability of operation across devices and across days for any one 
device. In addition, treatment groups must be balanced across devices. 
Each animal shall be tested individually. The test session shall be long 
enough for motor activity to approach asymptotic levels by the last 20 
percent of the session for most treatments and animals. All sessions 
should have the same duration. Treatment groups shall be counter-
balanced across test times. Effort should be made to ensure that 
variations in the test conditions are minimal and are not systematically 
related to treatment. Among the variables which can affect motor 
activity are sound level, size and shape of the test cage, temperature, 
relative humidity, lighting conditions, odors, use of home cage or novel 
test cage and environmental distractions. Tests shall be executed by an 
appropriately trained individual.
    (ii) Acute. Testing shall be timed to include the time of peak 
signs.
    (iii) Subchronic. All animals shall be tested prior to initiation of 
exposure and at 30 <plus-minus>2, 60 <plus-minus>2 and 90 <plus-minus>2 
days during the exposure period. Testing shall occur prior to the daily 
exposure. Animals shall be weighed on each test day and at least once 
weekly during the exposure period.
    (e) Data reporting and evaluation. In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the final test 
report must include the following information:
    (1) Description of system and test methods. (i) Positive control 
data from the laboratory performing the test which demonstrate the 
sensitivity of the procedure being used.
    (ii) Procedures for calibrating and assuring the equivalence of 
devices and balancing treatment groups.
    (2) Results. The following information must be arranged by test 
group (dose level).
    (i) In tabular form, data must be provided showing for each animal:
    (A) Its identification number.
    (B) Body weight, total session activity counts, and intrasession 
subtotals for each date measured.
    (ii) Group summary data should also be reported.
    (3) Evaluation of data. An evaluation of the test results (including 
statistical analysis comparing total activity counts at the end of 
exposure of treatment vs control animals must be made and supplied. This 
submission must include dose-effect curves for motor activity expressed 
as activity counts.
    (f) References. For additional background information on this test 
guideline the following references should be consulted:

<R05>
Sec. 798.6400  Neuropathology.

    (a) Purpose. The techniques in this guideline are designed to 
develop data on morphologic changes in the nervous system for chemical 
substances and mixtures subject to such testing under the Toxic 
Substances Control Act. The data will detect and characterize 
morphologic changes, if and when they occur, and determine a no-effect 
level for such changes. Neuropathological evaluation should be 
complemented by other neurotoxicity studies, e.g. behavioral and 
neurophysiological studies. Neuropathological evaluation may be done 
following acute, subchronic or chronic exposure.
    (b) Definition. Neurotoxicity or a neurotoxic effect is an adverse 
change in the structure or function of the nervous system following 
exposure to a chemical agent.
    (c) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
to several groups of experimental animals, one dose being used per 
group. The animals are sacrificed and tissues in the nervous system are 
examined grossly and prepared for microscopic examination. Starting with 
the highest dosage level, tissues are examined under the light 
microscope for morphologic changes, until a no effect level is 
determined. In cases where light microscopy has revealed neuropathology, 
the no effect level may be confirmed by electron microscopy.
    (d) Test procedure--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. 
Testing shall be performed in the species being used in other tests for 
neurotoxicity. This will generally be the laboratory rat. The choice of 
species shall take into consideration such factors as the comparative 
metabolism of the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects 
of the test substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies, the 
potential for combined studies, and the availability of other toxicity 
data for the species.
    (ii) Age. Animals shall be young adults (150-200 gm for rats) at the 
start of exposure.
    (iii) Sex. Both sexes shall be used unless it is demonstrated that 
one sex is refractory to the effects.
    (2) Number of Animals. A minimum of six animals per group shall be 
used. The tissues from each animal shall be examined separately. It is 
recomse (iv)mended that ten animals per group be used.
    (3) Control Groups. (i) A concurrent control group(s) is (are) 
required. This group must be an untreated control group or, if a vehicle 
is used in administering the test substance, a vehicle control group. If 
the vehicle used has a known or potential toxic property, both untreated 
and vehicle control groups are required.
    (ii) A satellite group of animals may be treated with the high level 
for 90 days and observed for reversibility, persistence, or delayed 
occurrence of toxic effects for a post-treatment period of appropriate 
length; normally not less than 28 days.
    (4) Dose Levels and Dose Selection. At least 3 doses, equally spaced 
on a log scale (e.g., \1/2\ log units) over a range of at least 1 log 
unit shall be used in addition to a zero dose or vehicle administration. 
The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-effect curve.

[[Page 218]]

    (i) The highest dose shall produce (A) clear behavioral effects or 
(B) life-threatening toxicity.
    (ii) The data from the lower doses must show either (A) graded dose-
dependent effects at two dose levels or (B) no effects at two dose 
levels, respectively.
    (5) Duration of testing. The exposure duration will be specified in 
the test rule. This will generally be 90 days exposure.
    (6) Route of administration. The test substance shall be 
administered by a route specified in the test rule. This will generally 
be the route most closely approximating the route of human exposure. The 
exposure protocol shall conform to that outlined in the appropriate 
acute or subchronic toxicity guideline.
    (7) Combined protocol. The tests described herein may be combined 
with any other toxicity study, as long as none of the requirements of 
either are violated by the combination.
    (8) Study conduct--(i) Observation of animals. All toxicological 
(e.g., weight loss) and neurological signs (e.g., motor disturbance) 
shall be recorded frequently enough to observe any abnormality, and not 
less than weekly.
    (ii) Sacrifice of animals--(A) General. The goal of the techniques 
outlined for sacrifice of animals and preparation of tissues is 
preservation of tissues morphology to simulate the living state of the 
cell.
    (B) Perfusion technique. Animals shall be perfused in situ  by a 
generally recognized technique. For fixation suitable for light or 
electronic microscopy, saline solution followed by buffered 2.5 percent 
glutaraldehyde or buffered 4.0 percent paraformaldehyde, is recommended. 
While some minor modifications or variations in procedures are used in 
different laboratories, a detailed and standard procedure for vascular 
perfusion may be found in the text by Zeman and Innes (1963) under 
paragraph (f)(7) of this section, Hayat (1970) under paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section, and by Spencer and Schaumburg (1980) under paragraph 
(f)(6) of this section. A more sophisticated technique is described by 
Palay and Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (C) Removal of brain and cord. After perfusion, the bonystructure 
(cranium and vertebral column) shall be exposed. Animals shall then be 
stored in fixative-filled bags at 4<SUP>+</SUP>C for 8-12 hours. The 
cranium and vertebral column shall be removed carefully by trained 
technicians without physical damage of the brain and cord. Detailed 
dissection procedures may be found in the text by Palay and Chan-Palay 
(1974) under paragraph (f)(4) of this section. After removal, simple 
measurement of the size (length and width) and weight of the whole brain 
(cerebrum, cerebellum, pons-medulla) shall be made. Any abnormal 
coloration or discoloration of the brain and cord shall also be noted 
and recorded.
    (D) Sampling. Unless a given test rule specifies otherwise, cross-
sections of the following areas shall be examined: The forebrain, the 
center of the cerebrum, the midbrain, the cerebellum and pons, and the 
medulla oblongata; the spinal cord at cervical and lumbar swelling 
(C<INF>3</INF>-C<INF>6</INF> and L<INF>1</INF>-L<INF>4</INF>); Gasserian 
ganglia, dorsal root ganglia (C<INF>3</INF>-C<INF>6</INF>, 
L<INF>1</INF>-L<INF>4</INF>), dorsal and ventral root fibers 
(C<INF>3</INF>-C<INF>6</INF>, L<SUP></SUP><SUP>1</SUP>-L<INF>4</INF>), 
proximal sciatic nerve (mid-thigh and sciatic notch), sural nerve (at 
knee), and tibial nerve (at knee). Other sites and tissue elements 
(e.g.. gastrocnemius muscle) should be examined if deemed necessary. Any 
observable gross changes shall be recorded.
    (iii) Specimen storage. Tissue samples from both the central and 
peripheral nervous system shall be further immersion fixed and stored in 
appropriate fixative (e.g., 10 percent buffered formalin for light 
microscopy; 2.5 percent buffered gluteraldehyde or 4.0 percent buffered 
paraformaldehyde for electron microscopy) for future examination. The 
volume of fixative versus the volume of tissues in a specimen jar shall 
be no less than 25:1. All stored tissues shall be washed with buffer for 
at least 2 hours prior to further tissue processing.
    (iv) Histopathology examination. (A) Fixation. Tissue specimens 
stored in 10 percent buffered formalin may be used for this purpose. All 
tissues must be immersion fixed in fixative for at least 48 hours prior 
to further tissue processing.

[[Page 219]]

    (B) Dehydration. All tissue specimens shall be washed for at least 1 
hour with water or buffer, prior to dehydration. (A longer washing time 
is needed if the specimens have been stored in fixative for a prolonged 
period of time.) Dehydration can be performed with increasing 
concentration of graded ethanols up to absolute alcohol.
    (C) Clearing and embedding. After dehydration, tissue specimens 
shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast. 
Multiple tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, ganglia) may be embedded 
together in one single block for sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be 
labelled showing at least the experiment number, animal number, and 
specimens embedded.
    (D) Sectioning. Tissue sections, 5 to 6 microns in thickness, shall 
be prepared from the tissue blocks and mounted on standard glass slides. 
It is recommended that several additional sections be made from each 
block at this time for possible future needs for special stainings. All 
tissue blocks and slides shall be filed and stored in properly labeled 
files or boxes.
    (E) Histopathological techniques. Although the information available 
for a given chemical substance may dictate test-rule specific changes, 
the following general testing sequence is proposed for gathering 
histopathological data:
    (1) General staining. A general staining procedure shall be 
performed on all tissue specimens in the highest treatment group. 
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) shall be used for this purpose. The staining 
shall be differentiated properly to achieve bluish nuclei with pinkish 
background.
    (2) Special stains. Based on the results of the general staining, 
selected sites and cellular components shall be further evaluated by the 
use of specific techniques. If H&E screening does not provide such 
information, a battery of stains shall be used to assess the following 
components in all appropriate required samples: neuronal body (e.g.. 
Einarson's gallocyanin), axon (e.g., Bodian), myelin sheath (e.g.. 
Kluver's Luxol Fast Blue) and neurofibrils (e.g.. Bielchosky). In 
addition, peripheral nerve fiber teasing shall be used. Detailed 
staining methodology is available in standard histotechnological manuals 
such as AFIP (1968) under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, Ralis et al. 
(1973) under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, and Chang (1979) under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The nerve fiber teasing technique is 
discussed in Spencer and Schaumberg (1980) under paragraph (f)(6) of 
this section. A section of normal tissue shall be included in each 
staining to assure that adequate staining has occurred. Any changes 
shall be noted and representative photographs shall be taken. If a 
lesion(s) is observed, the special techniques shall be repeated in the 
next lower treatment group until no further lesion is detectable.
    (3) Alternative technique. If the anatomical locus of expected 
neuro-pathology is well-defined, epoxy-embedded sections stained with 
toluidine blue may be used for small sized tissue samples. This 
technique obviates the need for special stains for cellular components. 
Detailed methodology is available in Spencer and Schaumberg (1980) under 
paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
    (4) Electron microscopy. Based on the results of light microscopic 
evaluation, specific tissue sites which reveal a lesion(s) shall be 
further evaluated by electron microscopy in the highest treatment group 
which does not reveal any light microscopic lesion. If a lesion is 
observed, the next lower treatment group shall be evaluated until no 
significant lesion is found. Detailed methodology is available in Hayat 
(1970) under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (F) Examination--(1) General. All stained microscopic slides shall 
be examined with a standard research microscope. Examples of cellular 
alterations (e.g., neuronal vacuolation, degeneration, and necrosis) and 
tissue changes (e.g., gliosis, leukocytic infiltration, and cystic 
formation) shall be recorded and photographed.
    (2) Electron microscopy. Since the size of the tissue samples that 
can be examined is very small, at least 3 to 4 tissue blocks from each 
sampling site must be examined. Tissue sections must be examined with a 
transmission electron microscope. Three main categories of structural 
changes must be considered:
    (i) Neuronal body. The shape and position of the nucleus and 
nucleolus as

[[Page 220]]

well as any change in the chromatin patterns shall be noted. Within the 
neuronal cytoplasm, cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, 
lysosomes, neurotubules, neurofilaments, microfilaments, endoplasmic 
reticulum and polyribosomes (Nissl substance), Golgi complex, and 
secretory granules shall be examined.
    (ii) Neuronal processes. The structural integrity or alterations of 
dendrites, axons (myelinated and unmyelinated), myelin sheaths, and 
synapses shall be noted.
    (iii) Supporting cells. Attention must also be paid to the number 
and structural integrity of the neuroglial elements (oligodendrocytes, 
astrocytes, and microglia) of the central nervous system, and the 
Schwann cells, satellite cells, and capsule cells of the peripheral 
nervous system. Any changes in the endothelial cells and ependymal 
lining cells shall also be noted whenever possible. The nature, 
severity, and frequency of each type of lesion in each specimen must be 
recorded. Representative lesions must be photographed and labeled 
appropriately.
    (e) Data collection, reporting, and evaluation. In addition to 
information meeting the requirements stated under 40 CFR part 792 
subpart J, the following specific information shall be reported:
    (1) Description of test system and test methods. A description of 
the general design of the experiment shall be provided. This shall 
include a short justification explaining any decisions where 
professional judgment is involved such as fixation technique and choice 
of stains.
    (2) Results. All observations shall be recorded and arranged by test 
groups. This data may be presented in the following recommended format:
    (i) Description of signs and lesions for each animal. For each 
animal, data must be submitted showing its identification (animal 
number, treatment, dose, duration), neurologic signs, location(s) nature 
of, frequency, and severity of lesion(s). A commonly-used scale such as 
1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ for degree of severity ranging from very slight to 
extensive may be used. Any diagnoses derived from neurologic signs and 
lesions including naturally occurring diseases or conditions, should 
also be recorded.
    (ii) Counts and incidence of lesions, by test group. Data shall be 
tabulated to show:
    (A) The number of animals used in each group, the number of animals 
displaying specific neurologic signs, and the number of animals in which 
any lesion was found;
    (B) The number of animals affected by each different type of lesion, 
the average grade of each type of lesion, and the frequency of each 
different type and/or location of lesion.
    (iii) Evaluation of data. (A) An evaluation of the data based on 
gross necropsy findings and microscopic pathology observations shall be 
made and supplied. The evaluation shall include the relationship, if 
any, between the animal's exposure to the test substance and the 
frequency and severity of the lesions observed.
    (B) The evaluation of dose-response, if existent, for various groups 
shall be given, and a description of statistical method must be 
presented. The evaluation of neuropathology data should include, where 
applicable, an assessment in conjunction with other neurotoxicity 
studies performed (eg. electrophysiological, behavioral, neurochemical).

Sec. 798.6500  Schedule-controlled operant behavior.

    (a) Purpose. (1) In the assessment and evaluation of the potential 
human health effects of substances, it may be necessary to test for 
functional neurotoxic effects. Substances that have been observed to 
produce neurotoxic signs in other toxicity studies (e.g. CNS depression 
or stimulation), as well as substances with a structural similarity to 
known neurotoxicants should be evaluated for these effects.
    (2) This guideline defines procedures for conducting studies of 
schedule-controlled operant behavior, one way of evaluating functional 
neurotoxic effects (Dews, 1972 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section; 
NAS 1975, 1977, 1982 under paragraphs (f)(4), (5) and (6) of this 
section). Our purpose is to evaluate the effects of acute and repeated 
exposures on the rate and pattern of responding under schedules of 
reinforcement. Operant behavior tests may be used to evaluate many other 
aspects of behavior (Laties, 1978 under paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section). Additional tests may be necessary to completely assess the 
behavioral effects of any substance. Behavioral evaluation should be 
used in conjunction with neuropathologic evaluation and the evaluation 
of other toxic effects.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity or a neurotoxic 
effect is an adverse change in the structure or function of the nervous 
system following exposure to a chemical agent. Behavioral toxicity is an 
adverse change in the functioning of the organism with respect to its 
environment following exposure to a chemical agent.
    (2) Operant, operant behavior, operant conditioning. An operant is a 
class of behavioral responses which change or operates on the 
environment in the same way. Operant behavior is further distinguished 
as behavior which is modified by its consequences. Operant conditioning 
is the experimental procedure used to modify some class of behavior by 
reinforcement or punishment.
    (3) Schedule of reinforcement. A schedule of reinforcement specifies 
the relation between behavioral responses and the delivery of 
reinforcers, such as food or water (Ferster and Skinner, 1957 under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section). For example, a fixed ratio (FR) 
schedule requires a fixed number of responses to produce a reinforcer 
(e.g. FR 30). On a fixed interval (FI) schedule, the first response 
after a fixed period of time is reinforced (e.g. FI 5 minutes).
    (c) Principle of the test method. Experimental animals are trained 
to perform under a schedule of reinforcement and measurements of their 
operant behavior are made. Several doses of the test substance are then 
administered according to the experimental design (between groups or 
within subjects) and the duration of exposure (acute or repeated). 
Measurements of the operant behavior are repeated. A descriptive and 
statistical evaluation of the data is made to evaluate the nature and 
extent of any changes in behavior in relation to exposures to the test 
substance. Comparisons are made between any exposures that influence the 
behavior and exposures that have neuropathological effects or effects on 
other targets of the chemical.
    (d) Test procedures--(1) Experimental design. These test procedures 
may be used to evaluate the behavior of experimental animals receiving 
either acute or repeated exposures. For acute exposure studies, either 
within-subject or between groups, experimental designs may be used. For 
repeated exposure studies, between groups designs should be used, but 
within subject comparisons (pre-exposure and post-exposure) are 
recommended and encouraged.
    (2) Animal selection--(i) Species. (A) For most studies, the 
laboratory mouse or rat is recommended. Standard strains should be used.
    (B) Under some circumstances other species may be recommended.
    (ii) Age. Experimental animals should be young adults. Rats or mice 
should be at least 14 and 6 weeks old, respectively, prior to exposure.
    (iii) Sex. (A) Approximately equal numbers of male and female 
animals

[[Page 222]]

are required for each dose level and control group.
    (B) Virgin females should be used.
    (iv) Experimental history. Animals should be experimentally and 
chemically naive.
    (3) Number of animals. Six to twelve animals should be exposed to 
each level of the test substance and/or control procedure. If post 
exposure effects are examined, a separate group, 6 to 12 additional 
animals not sacrificed for pathology, will required in subchronic 
studies.
    (4) Control groups--(i) Untreated controls. A concurrent ``sham'' 
exposure or vehicle control group or session (according to the design of 
the study) is required. The subjects should be treated similarly except 
that administration of the test substance is omitted.
    (ii) Positive controls. Positive control data is required to 
demonstrate that the experimental procedures, under the specific 
conditions in the testing laboratory, are sensitive to substances known 
to affect operant behavior. Both increases and decreases in response 
rate should be demonstrated. Data based on acute exposures will be 
adequate. Data should be collected according to the same experimental 
design as that proposed for the test substance. Historical data on the 
procedure collected in the same species and under the same conditions in 
the testing laboratory may be acceptable, but the presentation of 
concurrent control data is strongly encouraged since it provides 
evidence that the test has remained sensitive.
    (5) Dose levels and dose selection. At least 3 doses, equally spaced 
over a log scale (e.g., 10, 30, 100), over a range of at least 1 log 
unit shall be used in addition to a zero dose or vehicle administration. 
The data should be sufficient to produce a dose-effect curve.
    (i) The highest dose shall produce: (A) Clear behavioral effects; or 
(B) life-threatening toxicity.
    (ii) The data from the lower doses must show either: (A) Graded 
dose-dependent effects at 2 dose levels; or (B) no effects at 2 dose 
levels, respectively.
    (6) Duration of exposure. The duration and frequency of exposure 
will be specified in the test rule.
    (7) Route of Administration. The route of administration will also 
be specified in the test rule and will usually be identical to one of 
the anticipated or actual routes of human exposure. For some chemicals, 
another route (e.g. parenteral) may be justified. The exposure protocol 
should conform to that outlined in the appropriate acute or subchronic 
toxicity study guideline under subpart B or subpart C of this part.
    (8) Study conduct--(i) Apparatus. Behavioral responses and the 
delivery of reinforcers shall be controlled and monitored by automated 
equipment located so that its operation does not provide unintended cues 
or otherwise interfere with the ongoing behavior. Individual chambers 
should be sound attenuated to prevent disruptions of behavior by 
external noise. The response manipulanda, feeders, and any stimulus 
devices should be tested before each session; these devices should 
periodically be calibrated.
    (ii) Chamber assignment. Concurrent treatment groups should be 
balanced across chambers. Each subject should be tested in the chamber 
to which it is initially assigned.
    (iii) Deprivation and training. (A) If a nonpreferred positive 
reinforcer is used, all subjects should be deprived of food until they 
reach a fixed percentage (e.g. 80 to 90 percent, commonly) of their ad 
libitum body weight or for a fixed period (e.g., 18 hours) prior to 
training. Deprivation should be kept constant throughout the study.
    (B) Subjects must be trained until they display demonstrable 
stability in performance across days prior to exposure. One simple and 
useful criterion is a minimum number of sessions on the schedule and no 
systematic trend during the 5 days before exposure.
    (C) Cumulative records of cumulative responding over time for each 
animal should be presented to demonstrate that the pattern of responding 
is representative of that generated by the schedule of reinforcement.
    (iv) Time, frequency, and duration of testing--(A) Time of testing. 
All experimental animals should be tested at the same time of day and 
with respect to the time of exposure. For acute studies, testing should 
be performed when

[[Page 223]]

effects are estimated to peak, usually shortly after exposure. For 
subchronic studies, subjects should be tested prior to daily exposure in 
order to assess cumulative effects.
    (B) Frequency of testing. The maintenance of stable operant behavior 
normally will require regular and frequent (e.g., 5 days a week) testing 
sessions. Animals should be weighed on each test day.
    (C) Duration of testing. (1) Experimental sessions should be long 
enough to reasonably see the effects of exposure, but brief enough to be 
practical. Under most circumstances, a session length of 30-40 minutes 
should be adequate.
    (2) If the nature or duration of effects following cessation of 
repeated exposure are a concern, animals from the high dose group should 
be tested following exposure for a suitable period of time.
    (v) Schedule selection. The schedule of reinforcement chosen should 
generate response rates that may increase or decrease as a function of 
exposure. Many schedules of reinforcement can do this: a single schedule 
maintaining a moderate response rate; fixed-interval schedules, which 
engender a variety of response rates in each interval; or multiple 
schedules, where different components may maintain high and low response 
rates.
    (e) Data reporting and evaluation. In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J the final test 
report should contain the following information:
    (1) Description of system, test methods, experimental design, and 
control data. (i) A description of the experimental chamber, programming 
equipment, data collection devices, and environmental conditions.
    (ii) A description of the experimental design including 
counterbalancing procedures, and the stability criterion.
    (iii) A description and statistical evaluation of positive control 
and other control data, including standard measures of central tendency, 
variability, coefficient of variation of response rates, and the slope 
of the dose-effect curve.
    (2) Results. (i) Data for each animal should be arranged by test 
group in tabular form including the animal identification number, body 
weight, pre-exposure rate of responding, changes in response rate 
produced by the chemical, and group data for the same variables, 
including standard measures of central tendency, variability and 
coefficient of variation.
    (ii) A description and statistical evaluation of the test results: 
With particular reference to the overall statistical procedures (e.g., 
parametric or nonparametric) dose-effect curve, and calculation of 
slope. Presentation of calculations is encouraged.
    (f) References. For additional background information on this test 
guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 798.6560  Subchronic delayed neuro-toxicity of organophosphorus substances.

    (a) Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic 
characteristics of organophosphorus substances the determination of 
subchronic delayed neurotoxicity may be carried out, usually after 
initial information on delayed neurotoxicity has been obtained by acute 
testing or by the demonstration of inhibition and aging of neurotoxic 
esterase in hen neural tissue. The

[[Page 224]]

subchronic delayed neurotoxicity test provides information on possible 
health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposures over a limited 
period of time. It will provide information on dose response and can 
provide an estimate of a non-effect level which can be of use for 
establishing safety criteria for exposure.
    (b) Definitions. Subchronic delayed neurotoxicity is a prolonged, 
delayed-onset locomoter ataxia resulting from repeated daily 
administration of the test substance.
    (c) Principle of the test method. Multiple dose levels of the test 
substance are administered orally to domestic hens (Gallus gallus 
domesticus) for 90 days. The animals are observed at least daily for 
behavioral abnormalities, locomotor ataxia and paralysis. 
Histopathological examination of selected neural tissues is undertaken 
at the termination of the test period.
    (d) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection. The adult domestic laying 
hen, aged 8 to 14 months, is recommended. Standard size breeds and 
strains should be employed.
    (2) Number of animals. Ten hens should be used for each treatment 
and control group.
    (3) Control group--(i) General. A concurrent control group should be 
used. This group should be treated in a manner identical to the treated 
group, except that administration of the test substance is omitted.
    (ii) Reference substances. If a positive control is used, a 
substance which is known to produce delayed neurotoxicity should be 
employed. Examples of such substances are triorthocresyl phosphate 
(TOCP) and leptophos.
    (4) Housing and feeding conditions. Cages or enclosures which are 
large enough to permit free mobility of the hens and easy observation of 
gait should be used. Where the lighting is artificial, the sequence 
should be 12 hours light, 12 hours dark. Appropriate diets should be 
administered as well as an unlimited supply of drinking water.
    (5) Dose levels. At least three dose levels should be used in 
addition to the control group(s). The highest dose level should result 
in toxic effects, preferably delayed neurotoxicity, but not produce an 
incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful evaluation. The 
lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxicity.
    (6) Route of administration. Oral dosing each day for at least 5 
days per week should be carried out, preferably by gavage or 
administration of gelatine capsules.
    (7) Study conduct--(i) General. Healthy young adult hens free from 
interfering viral diseases and medication and without abnormalities of 
gait should be acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for at least 5 
days prior to randomization and assignment to treatment and control 
groups. The test or control substance should be administered and 
observations begun. All hens should be carefully observed at least once 
daily throughout the test period. Signs of toxicity should be recorded, 
including the time of onset, degree and duration. Observations should 
include, but not be limited to, behavioral abnormality, locomotor ataxia 
and paralysis. At least once a week the hens should be taken outside the 
cages and subjected to a period of forced motor activity, such as ladder 
climbing, in order to enhance the observation of minimal responses. The 
hens should be weighed weekly. Any moribund hens should be removed and 
sacrificed.
    (ii) Pathology--(A) Gross necropsy. In the presence of clinical 
signs of delayed neurotoxicity useful information may be provided by 
gross necropsy.
    (B) Histopathology. Tissues from all animals should be fixed in 
situ, using perfusion techniques. Sections should include medulla 
oblongata, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The spinal cord sections 
should be taken from the upper cervical bulb, the mid-thoracic and 
lumbosacral regions. Sections of the proximal region of the tibial nerve 
and its branches and of the sciatic nerve should be taken. Sections 
should be stained with appropriate myelin and axon-specific stains. 
Microscopic examination should be carried out on all hens in the control 
and high-dose groups. Microscopic examination should also be carried out 
on hens in the low and intermediate dose groups when there is evidence 
of effects in the high-dose group.

[[Page 225]]

    (e) Data reporting and evaluation--(1) Test report. In addition to 
the reporting requirements specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J 
the final test report must include the following information:
    (i) Toxic response data by group with a description of clinical 
manifestations of nervous system damage; where a grading system is used 
the criteria should be defined.
    (ii) For each animal, time of death during the study or whether it 
survived to termination.
    (iii) The day of observation of each abnormal sign and its 
subsequent course.
    (iv) Body weight data.
    (v) Necropsy findings for each animal, when performed.
    (vi) A detailed description of all histopathological findings.
    (vii) Statistical treatment of results, where appropriate.
    (2) Treatment of results. (i) Data may be summarized in tabular 
form, showing for each test group the number of animals at the start of 
the test, the number of animals showing lesions or effects, the types of 
lesions or effects and the percentage of animals displaying each type of 
lesion or effect.
    (ii) All observed results should be evaluated by an appropriate 
statistical method. Any generally accepted statistical method may be 
used; the statistical methods should be selected during the design of 
the study.
    (3) Evaluation of results. The findings of a subchronic delayed 
neurotoxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings 
of preceding studies and considered in terms of the incidence and 
severity of observed neurotoxic effects and any other observed effects 
and histopathological findings in the treated and control groups. A 
properly conducted subchronic test should provide a satisfactory 
estimation of a no-effect level based on lack of clinical signs and 
histopathological changes.

guideline the following references should be consulted:

Sec. 799.18  Chemicals subject of test rules or consent orders for which the testing reimbursement period has passed.

    The following table lists substances and mixtures that have been the 
subjects of section 4 testing actions and for which the testing 
reimbursement period has terminated (sunset). The Federal Register 
citation in the table is for the final rule/consent order that includes 
the particular substance for which the sunset date listed in the table 
below applies. Section 12(b) export notification is no longer required 
for these substances and mixtures. Substances that are the subjects of 
two or more section 4 testing actions may have section 4 reimbursement 
or section 12(b) export notification requirements that have not sunset; 
see subparts B, C, and D of this part to determine if certain other 
section 4 testing requirements apply. Additionally, section 12(b) export 
notification may also be triggered by proposed or final action under

groups.
    (ii) The integrity of the various cell stages of spermatogenesis 
shall be determined, with particular attention directed toward achieving 
optimal quality in the fixation and embedding; preparations of 
testicular and associated reproductive organ samples for histology 
should follow the recommendations of Lamb and Chapin (1985) under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or an equivalent procedure. 
Histological analyses shall include evaluations of the spermatogenic 
cycle, i.e., the presence and integrity of the 14 cell stages. These 
evaluations should follow the guidance provided by Clermont and Perey 
(1957) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Information shall also be 
provided regarding the nature and level of lesions observed in control 
animals for comparative purposes.
    (iii) Data on female cyclicity shall be obtained by performing

provisions in paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(4)(ii), (5), and (8)(ii)(E) of 
Sec. 798.6050.
    (2) For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (i) Definition. Neurotoxicity is any adverse acute and/or lasting 
effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral 
nervous system related to exposure to a chemical substance.
    (ii) Lower doses. The data from the lower doses shall show either 
graded dose-dependent effects in at least two of all the doses tested 
including the highest dose, or no neurotoxic (behavioral) effects at any 
dose tested.
    (iii) Duration and frequency of exposure. Animals shall be exposed 
for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period.
    (iv) Sensory function. A simple assessment of sensory function 
(vision, audition, pain perception) shall be made. Marshall et al. 
(1971) in Sec. 798.6050(f)(8) of this chapter have described a 
neurologic exam for this purpose; these procedures are also discussed by 
Deuel (1977), under Sec. 798.6050(f)(4) of this chapter. Irwin (1968) 
under Sec. 798.6050(f)(7) of this chapter described a number of reflex 
tests intended to detect gross sensory deficits. Many procedures have 
been developed for assessing pain perception (e.g., Ankier (1974) under 
Sec. 798.6050(f)(1); D'Amour and Smith (1941) under Sec. 798.6050(f)(3); 
and Evans (1971) under Sec. 798.6050(f)(6) of this chapter.
    (B)(1) Motor activity. A motor activity test shall be conducted in 
the rat by dermal application of DGBE for a period of 90 days according 
to Sec. 798.6200 of this chapter except for the provisions in paragraphs 
(c), (d)(3)(ii), (4)(ii), (5), (8)(i), and (iii) of Sec. 798.6200.
    (2) For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:

[[Page 233]]

    (i) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
to several groups of experimental animals, one dose being used per 
group. Measurements of motor activity are made. Where possible, the 
exposure levels at which significant changes in motor activity are 
produced are compared to those levels which produce toxic effects not 
originating in the central and/or peripheral nervous system.
    (ii) Positive control data. Positive control data are required to 
document the sensitivity of the activity measuring device and testing 
procedure. These data should demonstrate the ability to detect increases 
or decreases in activity and to generate a dose-effect curve or its 
equivalent using three values of the dose or equivalent independent 
variable. A single administration of the dose (or equivalent) is 
sufficient. It is recommended that chemical exposure be used to collect 
positive control data. Positive control data shall be collected at the 
time of the test study unless the laboratory can demonstrate the 
adequacy of historical data for this purpose.
    (iii) Lower doses. The data from the lower doses shall show either 
graded dose-dependent effects in at least two of all the doses tested 
including the highest dose, or no neurotoxic (behavioral) effects at any 
dose tested.
    (iv) Duration and frequency of exposure. Animals shall be exposed 
for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period.
    (v) General. Motor activity shall be monitored by an automated 
activity recording apparatus. The device used shall be capable of 
detecting both increases and decreases in activity, i.e. baseline 
activity as measured by the device shall not be so low as to preclude 
decreases nor so high as to preclude increases. Each device shall be 
tested by a standard procedure to ensure, to the extent possible, 
reliability of operation across devices and across days for any one 
device. In addition, treatment groups shall be balanced across devices. 
Each animal shall be tested individually. The test session shall be long 
enough for motor activity to approach asymptotic levels by the last 20 
percent of the session for most treatments and for the session control 
animals. All sessions should be of the same duration. Treatment groups 
shall be counter-balanced across test times. Effort should be made to 
ensure that variations in the test conditions are minimal and are not 
systematically related to treatment. Among the variables which can 
affect motor activity are sound level, size and shape of the test cage, 
temperature, relative humidity, lighting conditions, odors, use of home 
cage or novel test cage, and environmental distractions. Tests shall be 
executed by an appropriately trained individual.
    (vi) Subchronic. All animals shall be tested prior to initiation of 
exposure and at 30<plus-minus>4, 60<plus-minus>4, and 90<plus-minus>4 
days during the exposure period. Testing shall occur prior to the daily 
exposure. Animals shall be weighed on each test day and at least once 
weekly during the exposure period.
    (C)(1) Neuropathology. A neuropathology test shall be conducted in 
the rat by dermal application of DGBE for a period of 90 days according 
to Sec. 798.6400 of this chapter except for the provisions in paragraphs 
(d)(4)(ii), (5), (8)(iv)(C), and (E)(2) of Sec. 798.6400.
    (2) For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (i) Lower doses. The data from the lower doses shall show either 
graded dose-dependent effects in at least two of all the doses tested 
including the highest dose, or no neurotoxic (behavioral) effects at any 
dose tested.
    (ii) Duration and frequency of exposure. Animals shall be exposed 
for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period.
    (iii) Clearing and embedding. After dehydration, tissue specimens 
shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast 
except for the sural nerve which should be embedded in plastic. Multiple 
tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, ganglia) may be embedded together in 
one single block for sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be labeled to 
provide unequivocal identification. A method for plastic embedding is 
described by Spencer et al. in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
    (iv) Special stains. Based on the results of the general staining, 
selected sites and cellular components shall be further evaluated by the 
use of specific techniques. If hematoxylin and eosin

[[Page 234]]

screening does not provide such information, a battery of stains shall 
be used to assess the following components in all appropriate required 
samples: Neuronal body (e.g., Einarson's gallocyanin), axon (e.g., 
Bodian), myelin sheath (e.g., Kluver's Luxol Fast Blue), and 
neurofibrils (e.g., Bielchosky). In addition, peripheral nerve fiber 
teasing may be used. Detailed staining methodology is available in 
standard histotechnological manuals such as Armed Forces Institute of 
Pathology (AFIP) (1968) under Sec. 798.6400(f)(1), Ralis et al. (1973) 
under Sec. 798.6400(f)(5), and Chang (1979) under Sec. 798.6400(f)(2) of 
this chapter. The nerve fiber teasing technique is discussed in Spencer 
and Schaumberg (1980) under Sec. 798.6400(f)(6) of this chapter. A 
section of normal tissue shall be included in each staining to assure 
that adequate staining has occurred. Any changes shall be noted and 
representative photographs shall be taken. If a lesion(s) is observed, 
the special techniques shall be repeated in the next lower treatment 
group until no further lesion is detectable.
    (ii) Reporting requirements. (A) The neurotoxicity/behavioral tests 
required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be completed and 
the final reports submitted to EPA within 17 months of the effective 
date of the final rule.
    (B) Interim progress reports shall be submitted to EPA at 6-month 
intervals, beginning 6 months from the effective date of the final rule 
until submission of the applicable final report to EPA.
    (3) Developmental neurotoxicity--(i) Required testing. A 
developmental neurotoxicity test of DGBE shall be conducted after a 
public program review of the Tier I data from the functional 
observational battery, motor activity, and neuropathology tests in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the reproductive tests in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and if EPA issues a Federal Register 
notice or sends a certified letter to the test sponsor specifying that 
the testing shall be initiated. The test shall be performed in rats in 
accordance with Sec. 795.250 of this chapter.
    (ii) Reporting requirements. (A) The developmental neurotoxicity 
test shall be completed and the final report submitted to EPA within 15 
months of EPA's notification of the test sponsor by certified letter or 
Federal Register notice under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section that 
the testing shall be initiated.
    (B) Progress reports shall be submitted to EPA every 6 months, 
beginning 6 months after the date of notification that the testing shall 
be initiated, until submission of the final report to EPA.
    (4) Pharmacokinetics--(i) Required testing. (A) Pharmacokinetics 
testing of DGBE and DGBA will be conducted in rats by the dermal route 
of administration in accordance with Sec. 795.225 of this chapter, 
except for the provisions in paragraphs (b) (1)(ii) and (3)(i) of 
Sec. 795.225.
    (B) For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (1) Animals. Adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats shall be 
used. The rats shall be 7 to 8 weeks old and weigh 180 to 220 grams. 
Prior to testing, the animals shall be selected at random for each 
group. Animals showing signs of ill health shall not be used.
    (2) Observation of animals--Urinary and fecal excretion. The 
quantities of \14\C excreted in urine and feces by rats dosed as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of Sec. 795.225 shall be determined at 
8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing, and if necessary, daily 
thereafter until at least 90 percent of the dose has been excreted or 
until 7 days after dosing (whichever occurs first). Four animals per sex 
per dose group shall be used for this purpose.
    (ii) Reporting requirements. (A) The pharmacokinetics tests shall be 
completed and the final reports submitted to EPA within 8 months of the 
effective date of the final amendment.

Sec. 799.1700  Fluoroalkenes.

    (a) Identification of test substances. (1) Vinyl fluoride (VF; CAS 
No. 75-02-5), vinylidene fluoride (VDF; CAS No. 75-38-7), 
tetrafluoroethene (TFE; CAS No. 116-14-3), and hexafluoropropene (HFP; 
CAS No. 116-15-4) shall be tested in accordance with this section.
    (2) VF, VDF, TFE, and HFP of at least 99 percent purity shall be 
used as the test substances.
    (b) Persons required to submit study plans, conduct tests and submit 
data. All persons who manufacture VF, VDF, TFE, or HFP, other than as an 
impurity, from July 22, 1987 to the end of the reimbursement period 
shall submit letters of intent to conduct testing or exemption 
applications, submit study plans, conduct tests in accordance with the 
TSCA Good Laboratory Practice Standards (40 CFR part 792), and submit 
data as specified in this section, subpart A of this part, and part 790 
of this chapter for single-phase rulemaking, for the substances they 
manufacture.
    (c) Health effects testing--(1) Mutagenic effects--Gene mutation--
(i) Required testing. (A) (1) A detection of gene mutations in somatic 
cells in culture assay shall be conducted with TFE and HFP in accordance 
with Sec. 798.5300 of this chapter except for the provisions in 
paragraphs (c), (d)(3)(i), (4), (5) and (6) and (e).
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (i) Reference substances. No reference substance is required.
    (ii) Test method--Type of cells used in the assay. Mutation 
induction at the HPRT locus shall be measured in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells. Cells shall be checked for Mycoplasma contamination and may 
also be checked for karyotype stability.
    (iii) Test method--Metabolic activation. Cells shall be exposed to 
the test substance only in the presence of a metabolic activation system 
for TFE, and in both the presence and absence of a metabolic activation 
system for HFP. The metabolic activation system shall be derived from 
the post-mitochondrial fraction (S-9) of livers from rats pretreated 
with Aroclor 1254.
    (iv) Test method--Control groups. Positive and negative controls 
shall be included in each experiment. In assays with metabolic 
activation, the positive control substance shall be known to require 
such activation. Nitrogen shall serve as the negative control and 
diluting gas.
    (v) Test method--Test chemicals. The test should be designed to have 
a predetermined sensitivity and power. The number of cells, cultures, 
and concentrations of test substance used should reflect these defined 
parameters. The number of cells per culture is based on the expected 
background mutant frequency; a general guide is to use a number which is 
10 times the inverse of this frequency. Several concentrations (usually 
at least four) of the test substance shall be used. These shall yield a 
concentration-related toxic effect. The highest concentration shall 
produce a low level of survival (approximately 10 percent), and the 
survival in the lowest concentration shall approximate that of the 
negative control. Cytotoxicity shall be determined after treatment with 
the test substance both in the presence and in the absence of the 
metabolic activation system.

[[Page 239]]

    (vi) Test performance. Cells in treatment medium with and without 
metabolic activation shall be exposed to varying concentrations of test 
gas-air mixtures by flushing treatment flasks (or chambers) with 10 
volumes of test gas-air mixture at a rate of 500 mL/min or that rate 
which will allow complete flushing within 1 minute. In the case of a 
test chamber volume of 1.67 L, a flow rate of 10 L/min is appropriate. 
Each flask shall be closed with a cap with a rubber septum. Headspace 
samples shall be taken at the beginning and end of the exposure period 
and analyzed to determine the amount of test gas in each flask. Flasks 
shall be incubated on a rocker panel at 37  deg.C for 5 hours for tests 
with metabolic activation. For the non-activated portion of the test, 
the incubation time shall be 18 to 19 hours at 37  deg.C. At the end of 
the exposure period, cells treated with metabolic activation shall be 
washed and incubated in culture medium for 21 to 26 hours prior to 
subculturing the viability and expression of mutant phenotype. Cells 
treated without metabolic activation shall be washed and subcultured 
immediately to determine viability and to allow for expression of mutant 
phenotype. Appropriate subculture schedules (generally twice during the 
expression period) shall be used. At the end of the expression period, 
which shall be sufficient to allow near optimal phenotypic expression of 
induced mutants (generally 7 days for this cell system), cells shall be 
grown in medium with and without selective agent for determination of 
numbers of mutants and cloning efficiency, respectively. This last 
growth period is generally 7 days at 37  deg.C. Results of this test 
shall be confirmed in an independent experiment.
    (B)(1) A sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila melanogaster 
shall be conducted with VDF and VF in accordance with Sec. 798.5275 of

assay conducted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section 
produces a positive result.
    (2) For the purposes of this section the following provisions also 
apply:
    (i) Test chemicals. It is sufficient to test a single dose of the 
test substance. This dose shall be the maximum tolerated dose or that 
which produces some indication of toxicity. Exposure shall be by 
inhalation.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (C)(1) A mouse visible specific locus assay (MVSL) shall be 
conducted with VF, VDF, TFE, and HFP in accordance with Sec. 798.5200 of

Sec. 798.5200, or a mouse biochemical-specific locus assay (MBSL) shall 
be conducted with VF, VDF, TFE, and HFP in accordance with Sec. 798.5195 
of this chapter, except for the provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of 
Sec. 798.5195, for whichever of these substances produces a positive 
test result in the sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila 
melanogaster conducted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this 
section if, after a public program review, EPA issues a Federal Register 
notice or sends a certified letter to the test sponsor specifying that 
the testing shall be initiated.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (i) Test chemicals. A minimum of two dose levels shall be tested. 
The highest dose tested shall be the highest dose tolerated without 
toxic effects, provided that any temporary sterility induced due to 
elimination of spermatagonia is of only moderate duration, as determined 
by a return of males to fertility within 80 days after treatment, or 
shall be the highest dose attainable. Animals shall be exposed to the 
test substance by inhalation. Exposure shall be for 6 hours a day. 
Duration of exposure shall be dependent upon accumulated total dose 
desired for each group.

used. The highest dose shall produce signs of toxicity (e.g., slightly 
reduced fertility) or shall be the highest attainable.
    (iv) Test performance. Individual males shall be mated sequentially 
to 1 or 2 virgin females. Females shall be left with the males for at 
least the duration of one estrus cycle or alternatively until mating has 
occurred as determined by the presence of sperm in the vagina or by the 
presence of a vaginal plug. In any event, females shall be left with the 
males for no longer than 7 days. The number of matings following 
treatment shall ensure that germ cell maturation is adequately covered.

    (a) Identification of test substance. (1) 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane 
(CAS No. 79-34-5), and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (CAS No. 108-67-8) shall 
be tested as appropriate in accordance with this section.
    (2) A test substance of at least 99 percent purity shall be used for 
Chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. A test 
substance of at least 98 percent purity shall be used for 1,1,2,2-
tetrachloroethane.
    (b) Persons required to submit study plans, conduct tests, and 
submit data. All persons who manufacture (including import and by-
product manufacture) or process, or who intend to manufacture or 
process, the substances listed in paragraph (a) of this section after 
the effective date of this section to the end of the reimbursement 
period shall submit letters of intent to test, submit study plans, 
conduct tests, and submit data, or submit exemption applications as 
specified in this section, subpart A of this part, and parts 790 and 792 
of this chapter for single-phase rulemaking, for the substances they 
manufacture subject to exclusions contained in Sec. 790.42(a)(2), (a)(4) 
and (a)(5). These sections provide that processors, persons who 
manufacture less than 500 kg (1,100 lbs) annually, or persons who 
manufacture small quantities of the chemical solely for research and 
development as defined in Sec. 790.42(a)(5) shall not be required to 
submit study plans, conduct tests and submit data, or submit exemption 
applications as specified in this section unless directed to do so in a 
subsequent notice as set forth in Sec. 790.48(b).
    (c) Health effects testing--(1) Subacute toxicity--(i) Required 
testing. (A) An oral 14-day repeated dose toxicity test shall be 
conducted with 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in 
accordance with Sec. 798.2650 of this chapter except for the provisions 
in Sec. 798.2650 (a), (b)(1), (c), (e)(3), (e)(4)(i), (e)(5), (e)(6), 
(e)(7)(i), (e)(7)(iv), (e)(7)(v), (e)(8)(vii), (e)(9)(i)(A), 
(e)(9)(i)(B), (e)(11)(v), and (f)(2)(i). Each substance shall be tested 
in one mammalian species, preferably a rodent, but a non-rodent may be 
used. The species and strain of animals used in this test should be the 
same as those used in the 90-day subchronic test required in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section. The tests shall be performed using drinking 
water. However, if, due to poor stability or palatability, a drinking 
water test is not feasible for a

[[Page 271]]

given substance, that substance shall be administered either by oral 
gavage, in the diet, or in capsules.
    (B) For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (1) Purpose. To assess and evaluate the toxic characteristics of a 
substance, the determination of subacute toxicity should be carried out 
after initial information on toxicity has been obtained by acute 
testing. The 14-day repeated dose oral study provides information on the 
health hazard likely to arise from repeated short-term exposure by the 
oral route over a very limited period of time. It has been designed to 
permit the determination of the no-observed-adverse-effect level and 
toxic effects associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test 
substance for 14 days and to evaluate reversibility, persistence, and 
delayed occurrence of toxic effects during a 14-day follow-up recovery 
period. The test is not capable of determining those effects that have a 
long latency period for development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life 
shortening). It will provide information on target organs and the 
possibility of accumulation, and can be used in selecting dose levels 
for subchronic studies and for establishing safety criteria for short-
term human exposure.
    (2)  Definitions.  Subacute oral toxicity is the manifestation of 
adverse effect(s) occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure 
of experimental animals to a substance by the oral route for 14 days.
    (3) Principle of the test method. The test substance is administered 
orally in graduated daily doses to several groups of experimental 
animals, one dose level per group, for a period of 14 days. During the 
period of administration the animals are observed daily to detect signs 
of toxicity. Animals which die during the period of administration are 
necropsied. At the conclusion of the test, all animals, except the 
satellite group, are necropsied and histopathological examinations are 
carried out. The satellite group is necropsied after the 14-day recovery 
period.
    (4) Satellite group (Rodent only). A satellite group of 20 animals 
(10 animals per sex) shall be treated with the high dose level for 14 
days and observed for reversibility, persistence, and delayed occurrence 
of toxic effects for a post-treatment recovery period of at least 14 
days.
    (5) Dose levels and dose selection. In subacute toxicity tests, it 
is desirable to have a dose response relationship as well as a NOAEL. 
Therefore, at least 3 dose levels with a control and, where appropriate, 
a vehicle control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the 
highest exposure level) shall be used. Doses shall be spaced 
appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The 
data should be sufficient to produce a dose-response curve.
    (6) Exposure conditions. The animals are dosed with the test 
substance every day for 14 days.
    (7) Observation period. All animals shall be observed daily during 
the 14-day exposure period.
    (8) Observation period of satellite group. Animals in the satellite 
group scheduled for follow-up observations shall be kept for at least 14 
days further without treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence 
of, and delayed onset of toxic effects and shall be observed daily.
    (9) Administration of test substance. For substances of low 
toxicity, it is important to ensure that when administered in the 
drinking water, by gavage, in the diet, or in capsules, the quantities 
of the test substance involved do not interfere with normal nutrition. 
When the test substance is administered in the diet, either a constant 
dietary concentration (ppm) or a constant dose level in terms of the 
animals' body weight shall be used; the alternative used shall be 
specified in the final test report.
    (10) Time of administration of test substance. For a substance 
administered by gavage or capsule, the dose shall be given at 
approximately the same time each day, and adjusted on day 7 to maintain 
a constant dose level in terms of animal body weight.
    (11) Observation of animals. At the end of the 14-day exposure 
period, all survivors, except those in the satellite group, shall be 
necropsied. All survivors in the satellite group shall be

[[Page 272]]

necropsied after a recovery period of at least 14 days.
    (12) Hematology determinations. Certain hematology determinations 
shall be carried out at least two times during the test period: Just 
prior to initiation of dosing if adequate historical baseline data are 
not available (baseline data) and just prior to terminal sacrifice at 
the end of the test period. Hematology determinations which are 
appropriate to all studies are: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, 
erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure 
of clotting potential such as clotting time, prothrombin time, 
thromboplastin time, or platelet count.
    (13) Clinical biochemical determinations. Certain clinical 
biochemistry determinations on blood should be carried out at least two 
times: Just prior to initiation of dosing (if adequate historical 
baseline data are not available) and just prior to terminal sacrifice at 
the end of the test period. Test areas which are considered appropriate 
to all studies are: Electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and 
liver and kidney function. The selection of specific tests will be 
influenced by observations on the mode of action of the substance. 
Suggested determinations are: Calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, 
potassium, fasting glucose (with the period of fasting appropriate to 
the species), serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate 
aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumin, 
blood creatinine, and total serum protein measurements. Other 
determinations which may be necessary for an adequate toxicological 
evaluation include: analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base balance, 
methemoglobin, and cholinesterase activity. Additional clinical 
biochemistry may be employed, where necessary, to extend the 
investigation of observed effects.
    (14) Histopathology. Histopathology of the lungs of all animals 
shall be performed. Special attention to examination of the lungs of 
rodents shall be made for evidence of infection since this provides a 
convenient assessment of the state of health of the animals.
    (15) Evaluation of the study results. The findings of a subacute 
oral toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings 
of preceding studies and considered in terms of the toxic effects and 
the necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will include 
the relationship between the dose of the test substance and the presence 
or absence, the incidence and severity, of abnormalities, including 
behavioral and clinical abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target 
organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general 
or specific toxic effects. A properly conducted subacute test should 
provide a satisfactory estimation of a NOAEL.
    (ii) Reporting requirements. (A) Each subacute test shall be 
completed and the final report submitted to EPA within 12 months of the 
date specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except for 1,1,2,2-
tetrachloroethane. The subacute testing for 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. 
The subacute testing for 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane shall be completed 
and the final report submitted to EPA by February 15, 1996.
    (B) Except for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, a progress report shall be 
submitted to EPA for each test beginning 6 months after the date 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and at 6-month intervals 
thereafter until the final report is submitted to EPA . The progress 
report for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene shall be submitted to EPA by April 10, 
1995.
    (2) Subchronic toxicity--(i) Required testing. (A) An oral 90-day 
subchronic toxicity test shall be conducted with 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene 
in accordance with Sec. 798.2650 of this chapter except for the 
provisions in Sec. 798.2650 (e)(3), (e)(7)(i), and (e)(11)(v). The tests 
shall be performed using drinking water. However, if, due to poor 
stability or palatability, a drinking water test is not feasible for a 
given substance, that substance shall be administered either by oral 
gavage, in the diet, or in capsules.
    (B) For the purpose of this section, the following provisions also 
apply:
    (1) Satellite group (Rodent only). A satellite group of 20 animals 
(10 animals per sex) shall be treated with the high dose level for 90 
days and observed for reversibility, persistence, and delayed occurrence 
of toxic effects for a post-

[[Page 273]]

treatment period of appropriate length, normally not less than 28 days.
    (2) Histopathology. Histopathology of the lungs of all animals shall 
be performed. Special attention to examination of the lungs of rodents 
shall be made for evidence of infection since this provides a convenient 
assessment of the state of health of the animals.
    (ii) Reporting requirements. (A) The subchronic testing for 
chloroethane shall be completed and the final report submitted to EPA by 
June 27, 1995. The subchronic testing for 1,1-dichloroethane and 
1,1,2,2-tetrachlorethane shall be completed and the final report 
submitted to EPA by August 27, 1995. The subchronic testing for 1,3,5-
trimethylbenzene shall be completed and the final report submitted to 
EPA by April 10, 1995.
    (B) For each test, a progress report shall be submitted to EPA 
beginning 9 months after the date specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section and at 6-month intervals thereafter until the final report is 
submitted to EPA.
    (d) Effective date. (1) This section is effective on December 27, 
1993, except for paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(1)(ii)(A), 
(c)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(2)(i)(A), and (c)(2)(ii)(A). The effective date for 
paragraphs (a)(2), (c)(1)(ii)(B), and (c)(2)(ii)(A) is September 29, 
1995. The effective date for paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(1)(i)(A), and

1500.3  Mandate.
1500.4  Reducing paperwork.
1500.5  Reducing delay.

     Authority: NEPA, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 et seq.), sec. 309 of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 7609) and E.O. 11514, Mar. 5, 1970, as amended by 
E.O. 11991, May 24, 1977).

    Source: 43 FR 55990, Nov. 28, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1500.1  Purpose.

    (a) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is our basic 
national charter for protection of the environment. It establishes 
policy, sets goals (section 101), and provides means (section 102) for 
carrying out the policy. Section 102(2) contains ``action-forcing'' 
provisions to make sure that federal agencies act according to the 
letter and spirit of the Act. The regulations that follow implement 
section 102(2). Their purpose is to tell federal agencies what they must 
do to comply with the procedures and achieve the goals of the Act. The 
President, the federal agencies, and the courts share responsibility for 
enforcing the Act so as to achieve the substantive requirements of 
section 101.
    (b) NEPA procedures must insure that environmental information is 
available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and 
before actions are taken. The information must be of high quality. 
Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public 
scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA. Most important, NEPA 
documents must concentrate on the issues that are truly significant to 
the action in question, rather than amassing needless detail.
    (c) Ultimately, of course, it is not better documents but better 
decisions that count. NEPA's purpose is not to generate paperwork--even 
excellent paperwork--but to foster excellent action. The NEPA process is 
intended to help public officials make decisions that are based on 
understanding of environmental consequences, and take actions that 
protect, restore, and enhance the environment. These regulations provide 
the direction to achieve this purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 1500.2  Policy.

    Federal agencies shall to the fullest extent possible:
    (a) Interpret and administer the policies, regulations, and public 
laws of the United States in accordance with the policies set forth in 
the Act and in these regulations.
    (b) Implement procedures to make the NEPA process more useful to 
decisionmakers and the public; to reduce paperwork and the accumulation 
of extraneous background data; and to emphasize real environmental 
issues and alternatives. Environmental impact statements shall be 
concise, clear, and to the point, and shall be supported by evidence 
that agencies have made the necessary environmental analyses.
    (c) Integrate the requirements of NEPA with other planning and 
environmental review procedures required by law or by agency practice so 
that all such procedures run concurrently rather than consecutively.
    (d) Encourage and facilitate public involvement in decisions which 
affect the quality of the human environment.
    (e) Use the NEPA process to identify and assess the reasonable 
alternatives to proposed actions that will avoid or minimize adverse 
effects of these actions upon the quality of the human environment.
    (f) Use all practicable means, consistent with the requirements of 
the Act and other essential considerations of national policy, to 
restore and enhance the quality of the human environment and avoid or 
minimize any possible adverse effects of their actions upon the quality 
of the human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 1500.3  Mandate.

    Parts 1500 through 1508 of this title provide regulations applicable 
to and binding on all Federal agencies for implementing the procedural 
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended 
(Pub. L. 91-190, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) (NEPA or the Act)

[[Page 277]]

except where compliance would be inconsistent with other statutory 
requirements. These regulations are issued pursuant to NEPA, the 
Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
4371 et seq.) section 309 of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
7609) and Executive Order 11514, Protection and Enhancement of 
Environmental Quality (March 5, 1970, as amended by Executive Order 
11991, May 24, 1977). These regulations, unlike the predecessor 
guidelines, are not confined to sec. 102(2)(C) (environmental impact 
statements). The regulations apply to the whole of section 102(2). The 
provisions of the Act and of these regulations must be read together as 
a whole in order to comply with the spirit and letter of the law. It is 
the Council's intention that judicial review of agency compliance with 
these regulations not occur before an agency has filed the final 
environmental impact statement, or has made a final finding of no 
significant impact (when such a finding will result in action affecting 
the environment), or takes action that will result in irreparable 
injury. Furthermore, it is the Council's intention that any trivial 
violation of these regulations not give rise to any independent cause of 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 1500.4  Reducing paperwork.

    Agencies shall reduce excessive paperwork by:
    (a) Reducing the length of environmental impact statements 
(Sec. 1502.2(c)), by means such as setting appropriate page limits 
(Secs. 1501.7(b)(1) and 1502.7).
    (b) Preparing analytic rather than encyclopedic environmental impact 
statements (Sec. 1502.2(a)).
    (c) Discussing only briefly issues other than significant ones 
(Sec. 1502.2(b)).
    (d) Writing environmental impact statements in plain language 
(Sec. 1502.8).
    (e) Following a clear format for environmental impact statements 
(Sec. 1502.10).
    (f) Emphasizing the portions of the environmental impact statement 
that are useful to decisionmakers and the public (Secs. 1502.14 and 
1502.15) and reducing emphasis on background material (Sec. 1502.16).
    (g) Using the scoping process, not only to identify significant 
environmental issues deserving of study, but also to deemphasize 
insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental impact 
statement process accordingly (Sec. 1501.7).
    (h) Summarizing the environmental impact statement (Sec. 1502.12) 
and circulating the summary instead of the entire environmental impact 
statement if the latter is unusually long (Sec. 1502.19).
    (i) Using program, policy, or plan environmental impact statements 
and tiering from statements of broad scope to those of narrower scope, 
to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues (Secs. 1502.4 and 
1502.20).
    (j) Incorporating by reference (Sec. 1502.21).
    (k) Integrating NEPA requirements with other environmental review 
and consultation requirements (Sec. 1502.25).
    (l) Requiring comments to be as specific as possible (Sec. 1503.3).
    (m) Attaching and circulating only changes to the draft 
environmental impact statement, rather than rewriting and circulating 
the entire statement when changes are minor (Sec. 1503.4(c)).
    (n) Eliminating duplication with State and local procedures, by 
providing for joint preparation (Sec. 1506.2), and with other Federal 
procedures, by providing that an agency may adopt appropriate 
environmental documents prepared by another agency (Sec. 1506.3).
    (o) Combining environmental documents with other documents 
(Sec. 1506.4).
    (p) Using categorical exclusions to define categories of actions 
which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on 
the human environment and which are therefore exempt from requirements 
to prepare an environmental impact statement (Sec. 1508.4).
    (q) Using a finding of no significant impact when an action not 
otherwise excluded will not have a significant effect on the human 
environment and is therefore exempt from requirements to prepare an 
environmental impact statement (Sec. 1508.13).

<R05>
Sec. 1500.5  Reducing delay.

    Agencies shall reduce delay by:
    (a) Integrating the NEPA process into early planning (Sec. 1501.2).
    (b) Emphasizing interagency cooperation before the environmental 
impact statement is prepared, rather than submission of adversary 
comments on a completed document (Sec. 1501.6).
    (c) Insuring the swift and fair resolution of lead agency disputes 
(Sec. 1501.5).
    (d) Using the scoping process for an early identification of what 
are and what are not the real issues (Sec. 1501.7).
    (e) Establishing appropriate time limits for the environmental 
impact statement process (Secs. 1501.7(b)(2) and 1501.8).
    (f) Preparing environmental impact statements early in the process 
(Sec. 1502.5).
    (g) Integrating NEPA requirements with other environmental review 
and consultation requirements (Sec. 1502.25).
    (h) Eliminating duplication with State and local procedures by 
providing for joint preparation (Sec. 1506.2) and with other Federal 
procedures by providing that an agency may adopt appropriate 
environmental documents prepared by another agency (Sec. 1506.3).
    (i) Combining environmental documents with other documents 
(Sec. 1506.4).
    (j) Using accelerated procedures for proposals for legislation 
(Sec. 1506.8).
    (k) Using categorical exclusions to define categories of actions 
which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on 
the human environment (Sec. 1508.4) and which are therefore exempt from 
requirements to prepare an environmental impact statement.
    (l) Using a finding of no significant impact when an action not 
otherwise excluded will not have a significant effect on the human 
environment (Sec. 1508.13) and is therefore exempt from requirements to 
prepare an environmental impact statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1500.6  Agency authority.

    Each agency shall interpret the provisions of the Act as a 
supplement to its existing authority and as a mandate to view 
traditional policies and missions in the light of the Act's national 
environmental objectives. Agencies shall review their policies, 
procedures, and regulations accordingly and revise them as necessary to 
insure full compliance with the purposes and provisions of the Act. The 
phrase ``to the fullest extent possible'' in section 102 means that each 
agency of the Federal Government shall comply with that section unless 
existing law applicable to the agency's operations expressly prohibits 
or makes compliance impossible.

    The purposes of this part include:
    (a) Integrating the NEPA process into early planning to insure 
appropriate consideration of NEPA's policies and to eliminate delay.
    (b) Emphasizing cooperative consultation among agencies before the 
environmental impact statement is prepared rather than submission of

[[Page 279]]


<R05>
Sec. 1501.2  Apply NEPA early in the process.

    Agencies shall integrate the NEPA process with other planning at the 
earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect 
environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to head 
off potential conflicts. Each agency shall:
    (a) Comply with the mandate of section 102(2)(A) to ``utilize a 
systematic, interdisciplinary approach which will insure the integrated 
use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts 
in planning and in decisionmaking which may have an impact on man's 
environment,'' as specified by Sec. 1507.2.
    (b) Identify environmental effects and values in adequate detail so 
they can be compared to economic and technical analyses. Environmental 
documents and appropriate analyses shall be circulated and reviewed at 
the same time as other planning documents.
    (c) Study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to 
recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved 
conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources as provided 
by section 102(2)(E) of the Act.
    (d) Provide for cases where actions are planned by private 
applicants or other non-Federal entities before Federal involvement so 
that:
    (1) Policies or designated staff are available to advise potential 
applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for 
later Federal action.
    (2) The Federal agency consults early with appropriate State and 
local agencies and Indian tribes and with interested private persons and 
organizations when its own involvement is reasonably foreseeable.
    (3) The Federal agency commences its NEPA process at the earliest 
possible time.


<R05>
Sec. 1501.3  When to prepare an environmental assessment.

    (a) Agencies shall prepare an environmental assessment (Sec. 1508.9) 
when necessary under the procedures adopted by individual agencies to 
supplement these regulations as described in Sec. 1507.3. An assessment 
is not necessary if the agency has decided to prepare an environmental 
impact statement.
    (b) Agencies may prepare an environmental assessment on any action 
at any time in order to assist agency planning and decisionmaking.


<R05>
Sec. 1501.4  Whether to prepare an environmental impact statement.

    In determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement 
the Federal agency shall:
    (a) Determine under its procedures supplementing these regulations 
(described in Sec. 1507.3) whether the proposal is one which:
    (1) Normally requires an environmental impact statement, or
    (2) Normally does not require either an environmental impact 
statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).
    (b) If the proposed action is not covered by paragraph (a) of this 
section, prepare an environmental assessment (Sec. 1508.9). The agency 
shall involve environmental agencies, applicants, and the public, to the 
extent practicable, in preparing assessments required by 
Sec. 1508.9(a)(1).
    (c) Based on the environmental assessment make its determination 
whether to prepare an environmental impact statement.
    (d) Commence the scoping process (Sec. 1501.7), if the agency will 
prepare an environmental impact statement.
    (e) Prepare a finding of no significant impact (Sec. 1508.13), if 
the agency determines on the basis of the environmental assessment not 
to prepare a statement.
    (1) The agency shall make the finding of no significant impact 
available to the affected public as specified in Sec. 1506.6.
    (2) In certain limited circumstances, which the agency may cover in 
its procedures under Sec. 1507.3, the agency shall make the finding of 
no significant impact available for public review (including State and 
areawide clearinghouses) for 30 days before the agency makes its final 
determination whether to prepare an environmental impact statement and 
before the action may begin. The circumstances are:

[[Page 280]]

    (i) The proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one which 
normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement 
under the procedures adopted by the agency pursuant to Sec. 1507.3, or
    (ii) The nature of the proposed action is one without precedent.


<R05>
Sec. 1501.5  Lead agencies.

    (a) A lead agency shall supervise the preparation of an 
environmental impact statement if more than one Federal agency either:
    (1) Proposes or is involved in the same action; or
    (2) Is involved in a group of actions directly related to each other 
because of their functional interdependence or geographical proximity.
    (b) Federal, State, or local agencies, including at least one 
Federal agency, may act as joint lead agencies to prepare an 
environmental impact statement (Sec. 1506.2).
    (c) If an action falls within the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section the potential lead agencies shall determine by letter or 
memorandum which agency shall be the lead agency and which shall be 
cooperating agencies. The agencies shall resolve the lead agency 
question so as not to cause delay. If there is disagreement among the 
agencies, the following factors (which are listed in order of descending 
importance) shall determine lead agency designation:
    (1) Magnitude of agency's involvement.
    (2) Project approval/disapproval authority.
    (3) Expertise concerning the action's environmental effects.
    (4) Duration of agency's involvement.
    (5) Sequence of agency's involvement.
    (d) Any Federal agency, or any State or local agency or private 
person substantially affected by the absence of lead agency designation, 
may make a written request to the potential lead agencies that a lead 
agency be designated.
    (e) If Federal agencies are unable to agree on which agency will be 
the lead agency or if the procedure described in paragraph (c) of this 
section has not resulted within 45 days in a lead agency designation, 
any of the agencies or persons concerned may file a request with the 
Council asking it to determine which Federal agency shall be the lead 
agency.

A copy of the request shall be transmitted to each potential lead 
agency. The request shall consist of:
    (1) A precise description of the nature and extent of the proposed 
action.
    (2) A detailed statement of why each potential lead agency should or 
should not be the lead agency under the criteria specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (f) A response may be filed by any potential lead agency concerned 
within 20 days after a request is filed with the Council. The Council 
shall determine as soon as possible but not later than 20 days after 
receiving the request and all responses to it which Federal agency shall 
be the lead agency and which other Federal agencies shall be cooperating 
agencies.

Sec. 1501.6  Cooperating agencies.

    The purpose of this section is to emphasize agency cooperation early 
in the NEPA process. Upon request of the lead agency, any other Federal 
agency which has jurisdiction by law shall be a cooperating agency. In 
addition any other Federal agency which has special expertise with 
respect to any environmental issue, which should be addressed in the 
statement may be a cooperating agency upon request of the lead agency. 
An agency may request the lead agency to designate it a cooperating 
agency.
    (a) The lead agency shall:
    (1) Request the participation of each cooperating agency in the NEPA 
process at the earliest possible time.
    (2) Use the environmental analysis and proposals of cooperating 
agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise, to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with its responsibility as lead agency.
    (3) Meet with a cooperating agency at the latter's request.
    (b) Each cooperating agency shall:
    (1) Participate in the NEPA process at the earliest possible time.

[[Page 281]]

    (2) Participate in the scoping process (described below in 
Sec. 1501.7).
    (3) Assume on request of the lead agency responsibility for 
developing information and preparing environmental analyses including 
portions of the environmental impact statement concerning which the 
cooperating agency has special expertise.
    (4) Make available staff support at the lead agency's request to 
enhance the latter's interdisciplinary capability.
    (5) Normally use its own funds. The lead agency shall, to the extent 
available funds permit, fund those major activities or analyses it 
requests from cooperating agencies. Potential lead agencies shall 
include such funding requirements in their budget requests.
    (c) A cooperating agency may in response to a lead agency's request 
for assistance in preparing the environmental impact statement 
(described in paragraph (b)(3), (4), or (5) of this section) reply that 
other program commitments preclude any involvement or the degree of 
involvement requested in the action that is the subject of the 
environmental impact statement. A copy of this reply shall be submitted 
to the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 1501.7  Scoping.

    There shall be an early and open process for determining the scope 
of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues 
related to a proposed action. This process shall be termed scoping. As 
soon as practicable after its decision to prepare an environmental 
impact statement and before the scoping process the lead agency shall 
publish a notice of intent (Sec. 1508.22) in the Federal Register except 
as provided in Sec. 1507.3(e).
    (a) As part of the scoping process the lead agency shall:
    (1) Invite the participation of affected Federal, State, and local 
agencies, any affected Indian tribe, the proponent of the action, and 
other interested persons (including those who might not be in accord 
with the action on environmental grounds), unless there is a limited 
exception under Sec. 1507.3(c). An agency may give notice in accordance 
with Sec. 1506.6.
    (2) Determine the scope (Sec. 1508.25) and the significant issues to 
be analyzed in depth in the environmental impact statement.
    (3) Identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are 
not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review 
(Sec. 1506.3), narrowing the discussion of these issues in the statement 
to a brief presentation of why they will not have a significant effect 
on the human environment or providing a reference to their coverage 
elsewhere.
    (4) Allocate assignments for preparation of the environmental impact 
statement among the lead and cooperating agencies, with the lead agency 
retaining responsibility for the statement.
    (5) Indicate any public environmental assessments and other 
environmental impact statements which are being or will be prepared that 
are related to but are not part of the scope of the impact statement 
under consideration.
    (6) Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements so the lead and cooperating agencies may prepare other 
required analyses and studies concurrently with, and integrated with, 
the environmental impact statement as provided in Sec. 1502.25.
    (7) Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of environmental analyses and the agency's tentative planning and 
decisionmaking schedule.
    (b) As part of the scoping process the lead agency may:
    (1) Set page limits on environmental documents (Sec. 1502.7).
    (2) Set time limits (Sec. 1501.8).
    (3) Adopt procedures under Sec. 1507.3 to combine its environmental 
assessment process with its scoping process.
    (4) Hold an early scoping meeting or meetings which may be 
integrated with any other early planning meeting the agency has. Such a 
scoping meeting will often be appropriate when the impacts of a 
particular action are confined to specific sites.
    (c) An agency shall revise the determinations made under paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section if substantial changes are made later in the 
proposed

[[Page 282]]

action, or if significant new circumstances or information arise which 
bear on the proposal or its impacts.


<R05>
Sec. 1501.8  Time limits.

    Although the Council has decided that prescribed universal time 
limits for the entire NEPA process are too inflexible, Federal agencies 
are encouraged to set time limits appropriate to individual actions 
(consistent with the time intervals required by Sec. 1506.10). When 
multiple agencies are involved the reference to agency below means lead 
agency.
    (a) The agency shall set time limits if an applicant for the 
proposed action requests them: Provided, That the limits are consistent 
with the purposes of NEPA and other essential considerations of national 
policy.
    (b) The agency may:
    (1) Consider the following factors in determining time limits:
    (i) Potential for environmental harm.
    (ii) Size of the proposed action.
    (iii) State of the art of analytic techniques.
    (iv) Degree of public need for the proposed action, including the 
consequences of delay.
    (v) Number of persons and agencies affected.
    (vi) Degree to which relevant information is known and if not known 
the time required for obtaining it.
    (vii) Degree to which the action is controversial.
    (viii) Other time limits imposed on the agency by law, regulations, 
or executive order.
    (2) Set overall time limits or limits for each constituent part of 
the NEPA process, which may include:
    (i) Decision on whether to prepare an environmental impact statement 
(if not already decided).
    (ii) Determination of the scope of the environmental impact 
statement.
    (iii) Preparation of the draft environmental impact statement.
    (iv) Review of any comments on the draft environmental impact 
statement from the public and agencies.
    (v) Preparation of the final environmental impact statement.
    (vi) Review of any comments on the final environmental impact 
statement.
    (vii) Decision on the action based in part on the environmental 
impact statement.
    (3) Designate a person (such as the project manager or a person in 
the agency's office with NEPA responsibilities) to expedite the NEPA 
process.
    (c) State or local agencies or members of the public may request a 
Federal Agency to set time limits.

<R05>
Sec. 1502.1  Purpose.

    The primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to serve 
as an action-forcing device to insure that the policies and goals 
defined in the

[[Page 283]]

Act are infused into the ongoing programs and actions of the Federal 
Government. It shall provide full and fair discussion of significant 
environmental impacts and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of 
the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment. Agencies shall 
focus on significant environmental issues and alternatives and shall 
reduce paperwork and the accumulation of extraneous background data. 
Statements shall be concise, clear, and to the point, and shall be 
supported by evidence that the agency has made the necessary 
environmental analyses. An environmental impact statement is more than a 
disclosure document. It shall be used by Federal officials in 
conjunction with other relevant material to plan actions and make 
decisions.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.2  Implementation.

    To achieve the purposes set forth in Sec. 1502.1 agencies shall 
prepare environmental impact statements in the following manner:
    (a) Environmental impact statements shall be analytic rather than 
encyclopedic.
    (b) Impacts shall be discussed in proportion to their significance. 
There shall be only brief discussion of other than significant issues. 
As in a finding of no significant impact, there should be only enough 
discussion to show why more study is not warranted.
    (c) Environmental impact statements shall be kept concise and shall 
be no longer than absolutely necessary to comply with NEPA and with 
these regulations. Length should vary first with potential environmental 
problems and then with project size.
    (d) Environmental impact statements shall state how alternatives 
considered in it and decisions based on it will or will not achieve the 
requirements of sections 101 and 102(1) of the Act and other 
environmental laws and policies.
    (e) The range of alternatives discussed in environmental impact 
statements shall encompass those to be considered by the ultimate agency 
decisionmaker.
    (f) Agencies shall not commit resources prejudicing selection of 
alternatives before making a final decision (Sec. 1506.1).
    (g) Environmental impact statements shall serve as the means of 
assessing the environmental impact of proposed agency actions, rather 
than justifying decisions already made.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.3  Statutory requirements for statements.

    As required by sec. 102(2)(C) of NEPA environmental impact 
statements (Sec. 1508.11) are to be included in every recommendation or 
report.
    On proposals (Sec. 1508.23).
    For legislation and (Sec. 1508.17).
    Other major Federal actions (Sec. 1508.18).
    Significantly (Sec. 1508.27).
    Affecting (Secs. 1508.3, 1508.8).
    The quality of the human environment (Sec. 1508.14).


<R05>
Sec. 1502.4  Major Federal actions requiring the preparation of environmental impact statements.

    (a) Agencies shall make sure the proposal which is the subject of an 
environmental impact statement is properly defined. Agencies shall use 
the criteria for scope (Sec. 1508.25) to determine which proposal(s) 
shall be the subject of a particular statement. Proposals or parts of 
proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be, in 
effect, a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact 
statement.
    (b) Environmental impact statements may be prepared, and are 
sometimes required, for broad Federal actions such as the adoption of 
new agency programs or regulations (Sec. 1508.18). Agencies shall 
prepare statements on broad actions so that they are relevant to policy 
and are timed to coincide with meaningful points in agency planning and 
decisionmaking.
    (c) When preparing statements on broad actions (including proposals 
by more than one agency), agencies may find it useful to evaluate the 
proposal(s) in one of the following ways:
    (1) Geographically, including actions occurring in the same general 
location, such as body of water, region, or metropolitan area.

[[Page 284]]

    (2) Generically, including actions which have relevant similarities, 
such as common timing, impacts, alternatives, methods of implementation, 
media, or subject matter.
    (3) By stage of technological development including federal or 
federally assisted research, development or demonstration programs for 
new technologies which, if applied, could significantly affect the 
quality of the human environment. Statements shall be prepared on such 
programs and shall be available before the program has reached a stage 
of investment or commitment to implementation likely to determine 
subsequent development or restrict later alternatives.
    (d) Agencies shall as appropriate employ scoping (Sec. 1501.7), 
tiering (Sec. 1502.20), and other methods listed in Secs. 1500.4 and 
1500.5 to relate broad and narrow actions and to avoid duplication and 
delay.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.5  Timing.

    An agency shall commence preparation of an environmental impact 
statement as close as possible to the time the agency is developing or 
is presented with a proposal (Sec. 1508.23) so that preparation can be 
completed in time for the final statement to be included in any 
recommendation or report on the proposal. The statement shall be 
prepared early enough so that it can serve practically as an important 
contribution to the decisionmaking process and will not be used to 
rationalize or justify decisions already made (Secs. 1500.2(c), 1501.2, 
and 1502.2). For instance:
    (a) For projects directly undertaken by Federal agencies the 
environmental impact statement shall be prepared at the feasibility 
analysis (go-no go) stage and may be supplemented at a later stage if 
necessary.
    (b) For applications to the agency appropriate environmental 
assessments or statements shall be commenced no later than immediately 
after the application is received. Federal agencies are encouraged to 
begin preparation of such assessments or statements earlier, preferably 
jointly with applicable State or local agencies.
    (c) For adjudication, the final environmental impact statement shall 
normally precede the final staff recommendation and that portion of the 
public hearing related to the impact study. In appropriate circumstances 
the statement may follow preliminary hearings designed to gather 
information for use in the statements.
    (d) For informal rulemaking the draft environmental impact statement 
shall normally accompany the proposed rule.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.6  Interdisciplinary preparation.

    Environmental impact statements shall be prepared using an inter-
disciplinary approach which will insure the integrated use of the 
natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts (section 
102(2)(A) of the Act). The disciplines of the preparers shall be 
appropriate to the scope and issues identified in the scoping process 
(Sec. 1501.7).


<R05>
Sec. 1502.7  Page limits.

    The text of final environmental impact statements (e.g., paragraphs 
(d) through (g) of Sec. 1502.10) shall normally be less than 150 pages 
and for proposals of unusual scope or complexity shall normally be less 
than 300 pages.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.8  Writing.

    Environmental impact statements shall be written in plain language 
and may use appropriate graphics so that decisionmakers and the public 
can readily understand them. Agencies should employ writers of clear 
prose or editors to write, review, or edit statements, which will be 
based upon the analysis and supporting data from the natural and social 
sciences and the environmental design arts.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.9  Draft, final, and supplemental statements.

    Except for proposals for legislation as provided in Sec. 1506.8 
environmental impact statements shall be prepared in two stages and may 
be supplemented.
    (a) Draft environmental impact statements shall be prepared in 
accordance with the scope decided upon in the scoping process. The lead 
agency shall work with the cooperating agencies and shall obtain 
comments as required in part 1503 of this chapter. The draft statement 
must fulfill and satisfy to

[[Page 285]]

the fullest extent possible the requirements established for final 
statements in section 102(2)(C) of the Act. If a draft statement is so 
inadequate as to preclude meaningful analysis, the agency shall prepare 
and circulate a revised draft of the appropriate portion. The agency 
shall make every effort to disclose and discuss at appropriate points in 
the draft statement all major points of view on the environmental 
impacts of the alternatives including the proposed action.
    (b) Final environmental impact statements shall respond to comments 
as required in part 1503 of this chapter. The agency shall discuss at 
appropriate points in the final statement any responsible opposing view 
which was not adequately discussed in the draft statement and shall 
indicate the agency's response to the issues raised.
    (c) Agencies:
    (1) Shall prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental 
impact statements if:
    (i) The agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that 
are relevant to environmental concerns; or
    (ii) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant 
to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its 
impacts.
    (2) May also prepare supplements when the agency determines that the 
purposes of the Act will be furthered by doing so.
    (3) Shall adopt procedures for introducing a supplement into its 
formal administrative record, if such a record exists.
    (4) Shall prepare, circulate, and file a supplement to a statement 
in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and final 
statement unless alternative procedures are approved by the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.10  Recommended format.

    Agencies shall use a format for environmental impact statements 
which will encourage good analysis and clear presentation of the 
alternatives including the proposed action. The following standard 
format for environmental impact statements should be followed unless the 
agency determines that there is a compelling reason to do otherwise:
    (a) Cover sheet.
    (b) Summary.
    (c) Table of contents.
    (d) Purpose of and need for action.
    (e) Alternatives including proposed action (sections 102(2)(C)(iii) 
and 102(2)(E) of the Act).
    (f) Affected environment.
    (g) Environmental consequences (especially sections 102(2)(C)(i), 
(ii), (iv), and (v) of the Act).
    (h) List of preparers.
    (i) List of Agencies, Organizations, and persons to whom copies of 
the statement are sent.
    (j) Index.
    (k) Appendices (if any).

If a different format is used, it shall include paragraphs (a), (b), 
(c), (h), (i), and (j), of this section and shall include the substance 
of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), and (k) of this section, as further 
described in Secs. 1502.11 through 1502.18, in any appropriate format.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.11  Cover sheet.

    The cover sheet shall not exceed one page. It shall include:
    (a) A list of the responsible agencies including the lead agency and 
any cooperating agencies.
    (b) The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the 
statement (and if appropriate the titles of related cooperating agency 
actions), together with the State(s) and county(ies) (or other 
jurisdiction if applicable) where the action is located.
    (c) The name, address, and telephone number of the person at the 
agency who can supply further information.
    (d) A designation of the statement as a draft, final, or draft or 
final supplement.
    (e) A one paragraph abstract of the statement.
    (f) The date by which comments must be received (computed in 
cooperation with EPA under Sec. 1506.10).

The information required by this section may be entered on Standard Form 
424 (in items 4, 6, 7, 10, and 18).


<R05>
Sec. 1502.12  Summary.

    Each environmental impact statement shall contain a summary which 
adequately and accurately summarizes the statement. The summary shall 
stress the major conclusions, areas of

[[Page 286]]

controversy (including issues raised by agencies and the public), and 
the issues to be resolved (including the choice among alternatives). The 
summary will normally not exceed 15 pages.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.13  Purpose and need.

    The statement shall briefly specify the underlying purpose and need 
to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives 
including the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.14  Alternatives including the proposed action.

    This section is the heart of the environmental impact statement. 
Based on the information and analysis presented in the sections on the 
Affected Environment (Sec. 1502.15) and the Environmental Consequences 
(Sec. 1502.16), it should present the environmental impacts of the 
proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus sharply defining 
the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the 
decisionmaker and the public. In this section agencies shall:
    (a) Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable 
alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed 
study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.
    (b) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in 
detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate 
their comparative merits.
    (c) Include reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of 
the lead agency.
    (d) Include the alternative of no action.
    (e) Identify the agency's preferred alternative or alternatives, if 
one or more exists, in the draft statement and identify such alternative 
in the final statement unless another law prohibits the expression of 
such a preference.
    (f) Include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in 
the proposed action or alternatives.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.15  Affected environment.

    The environmental impact statement shall succinctly describe the 
environment of the area(s) to be affected or created by the alternatives 
under consideration. The descriptions shall be no longer than is 
necessary to understand the effects of the alternatives. Data and 
analyses in a statement shall be commensurate with the importance of the 
impact, with less important material summarized, consolidated, or simply 
referenced. Agencies shall avoid useless bulk in statements and shall 
concentrate effort and attention on important issues. Verbose 
descriptions of the affected environment are themselves no measure of 
the adequacy of an environmental impact statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.16  Environmental consequences.

    This section forms the scientific and analytic basis for the 
comparisons under Sec. 1502.14. It shall consolidate the discussions of 
those elements required by sections 102(2)(C)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of 
NEPA which are within the scope of the statement and as much of section 
102(2)(C)(iii) as is necessary to support the comparisons. The 
discussion will include the environmental impacts of the alternatives 
including the proposed action, any adverse environmental effects which 
cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, the relationship 
between short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and 
enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible or 
irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the 
proposal should it be implemented. This section should not duplicate 
discussions in Sec. 1502.14. It shall include discussions of:
    (a) Direct effects and their significance (Sec. 1508.8).
    (b) Indirect effects and their significance (Sec. 1508.8).
    (c) Possible conflicts between the proposed action and the 
objectives of Federal, regional, State, and local (and in the case of a 
reservation, Indian tribe) land use plans, policies and controls for the 
area concerned. (See Sec. 1506.2(d).)
    (d) The environmental effects of alternatives including the proposed 
action. The comparisons under Sec. 1502.14 will be based on this 
discussion.
    (e) Energy requirements and conservation potential of various 
alternatives and mitigation measures.

[[Page 287]]

    (f) Natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation 
potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.
    (g) Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design 
of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential 
of various alternatives and mitigation measures.
    (h) Means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts (if not fully 
covered under Sec. 1502.14(f)).

<R05>
Sec. 1502.17  List of preparers.

    The environmental impact statement shall list the names, together 
with their qualifications (expertise, experience, professional 
disciplines), of the persons who were primarily responsible for 
preparing the environmental impact statement or significant background 
papers, including basic components of the statement (Secs. 1502.6 and 
1502.8). Where possible the persons who are responsible for a particular 
analysis, including analyses in background papers, shall be identified. 
Normally the list will not exceed two pages.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.18  Appendix.

    If an agency prepares an appendix to an environmental impact 
statement the appendix shall:
    (a) Consist of material prepared in connection with an environmental 
impact statement (as distinct from material which is not so prepared and 
which is incorporated by reference (Sec. 1502.21)).
    (b) Normally consist of material which substantiates any analysis 
fundamental to the impact statement.
    (c) Normally be analytic and relevant to the decision to be made.
    (d) Be circulated with the environmental impact statement or be 
readily available on request.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.19  Circulation of the environmental impact statement.

    Agencies shall circulate the entire draft and final environmental 
impact statements except for certain appendices as provided in 
Sec. 1502.18(d) and unchanged statements as provided in Sec. 1503.4(c). 
However, if the statement is unusually long, the agency may circulate 
the summary instead, except that the entire statement shall be furnished 
to:
    (a) Any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved and any 
appropriate Federal, State or local agency authorized to develop and 
enforce environmental standards.
    (b) The applicant, if any.
    (c) Any person, organization, or agency requesting the entire 
environmental impact statement.
    (d) In the case of a final environmental impact statement any 
person, organization, or agency which submitted substantive comments on 
the draft.

If the agency circulates the summary and thereafter receives a timely 
request for the entire statement and for additional time to comment, the 
time for that requestor only shall be extended by at least 15 days 
beyond the minimum period.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.20  Tiering.

    Agencies are encouraged to tier their environmental impact 
statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to 
focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of 
environmental review (Sec. 1508.28). Whenever a broad environmental 
impact statement has been prepared (such as a program or policy 
statement) and a subsequent statement or environmental assessment is 
then prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy 
(such as a site specific action) the subsequent statement or 
environmental assessment need only summarize the issues discussed in the 
broader statement and incorporate discussions from the broader statement 
by reference and shall concentrate on the issues specific to the 
subsequent action. The subsequent document shall state where the earlier 
document is available. Tiering may also be appropriate for different 
stages of actions. (Section 1508.28).


<R05>
Sec. 1502.21  Incorporation by reference.

    Agencies shall incorporate material into an environmental impact 
statement by reference when the effect will be to cut down on bulk 
without impeding agency and public review of the action. The 
incorporated material shall

[[Page 288]]

be cited in the statement and its content briefly described. No material 
may be incorporated by reference unless it is reasonably available for 
inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for 
comment. Material based on proprietary data which is itself not 
available for review and comment shall not be incorporated by reference.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.22  Incomplete or unavailable information.

    When an agency is evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant 
adverse effects on the human environment in an environmental impact 
statement and there is incomplete or unavailable information, the agency 
shall always make clear that such information is lacking.
    (a) If the incomplete information relevant to reasonably foreseeable 
significant adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among 
alternatives and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, 
the agency shall include the information in the environmental impact 
statement.
    (b) If the information relevant to reasonably foreseeable 
significant adverse impacts cannot be obtained because the overall costs 
of obtaining it are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known, 
the agency shall include within the environmental impact statement:
    (1) A statement that such information is incomplete or unavailable; 
(2) a statement of the relevance of the incomplete or unavailable 
information to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse 
impacts on the human environment; (3) a summary of existing credible 
scientific evidence which is relevant to evaluating the reasonably 
foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment, and 
(4) the agency's evaluation of such impacts based upon theoretical 
approaches or research methods generally accepted in the scientific 
community. For the purposes of this section, ``reasonably foreseeable'' 
includes impacts which have catastrophic consequences, even if their 
probability of occurrence is low, provided that the analysis of the 
impacts is supported by credible scientific evidence, is not based on 
pure conjecture, and is within the rule of reason.
    (c) The amended regulation will be applicable to all environmental 
impact statements for which a Notice of Intent (40 CFR 1508.22) is 
published in the Federal Register on or after May 27, 1986. For 
environmental impact statements in progress, agencies may choose to 
comply with the requirements of either the original or amended 
regulation.

[51 FR 15625, Apr. 25, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1502.23  Cost-benefit analysis.

    If a cost-benefit analysis relevant to the choice among 
environmentally different alternatives is being considered for the 
proposed action, it shall be incorporated by reference or appended to 
the statement as an aid in evaluating the environmental consequences. To 
assess the adequacy of compliance with section 102(2)(B) of the Act the 
statement shall, when a cost-benefit analysis is prepared, discuss the 
relationship between that analysis and any analyses of unquantified 
environmental impacts, values, and amenities. For purposes of complying 
with the Act, the weighing of the merits and drawbacks of the various 
alternatives need not be displayed in a monetary cost-benefit analysis 
and should not be when there are important qualitative considerations. 
In any event, an environmental impact statement should at least indicate 
those considerations, including factors not related to environmental 
quality, which are likely to be relevant and important to a decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1502.24  Methodology and scientific accuracy.

    Agencies shall insure the professional integrity, including 
scientific integrity, of the discussions and analyses in environmental 
impact statements. They shall identify any methodologies used and shall 
make explicit reference by footnote to the scientific and other sources 
relied upon for conclusions in the statement. An agency may place 
discussion of methodology in an appendix.

[[Page 289]]


<R05>
Sec. 1502.25  Environmental review and consultation requirements.

    (a) To the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft 
environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with 
environmental impact analyses and related surveys and studies required 
by the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), the 
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and other 
environmental review laws and executive orders.
    (b) The draft environmental impact statement shall list all Federal 
permits, licenses, and other entitlements which must be obtained in 
implementing the proposal. If it is uncertain whether a Federal permit, 
license, or other entitlement is necessary, the draft environmental 
impact statement shall so indicate.

amended (42 U.S.C. 7609), and E.O. 11514 (Mar. 5, 1970, as amended by 
E.O. 11991, May 24, 1977).

    Source: 43 FR 55997, Nov. 29, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.1  Inviting comments.

    (a) After preparing a draft environmental impact statement and 
before preparing a final environmental impact statement the agency 
shall:
    (1) Obtain the comments of any Federal agency which has jurisdiction 
by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact 
involved or which is authorized to develop and enforce environmental 
standards.
    (2) Request the comments of:
    (i) Appropriate State and local agencies which are authorized to 
develop and enforce environmental standards;
    (ii) Indian tribes, when the effects may be on a reservation; and
    (iii) Any agency which has requested that it receive statements on 
actions of the kind proposed.

Office of Management and Budget Circular A-95 (Revised), through its 
system of clearinghouses, provides a means of securing the views of 
State and local environmental agencies. The clearinghouses may be used, 
by mutual agreement of the lead agency and the clearinghouse, for 
securing State and local reviews of the draft environmental impact 
statements.
    (3) Request comments from the applicant, if any.
    (4) Request comments from the public, affirmatively soliciting 
comments from those persons or organizations who may be interested or 
affected.
    (b) An agency may request comments on a final environmental impact 
statement before the decision is finally made. In any case other 
agencies or persons may make comments before the final decision unless a 
different time is provided under Sec. 1506.10.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.2  Duty to comment.

    Federal agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise with 
respect to any environmental impact involved and agencies which are 
authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards shall comment 
on statements within their jurisdiction, expertise, or authority. 
Agencies shall comment within the time period specified for comment in 
Sec. 1506.10. A Federal agency may reply that it has no comment. If a 
cooperating agency is satisfied that its views are adequately reflected 
in the environmental impact statement, it should reply that it has no 
comment.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.3  Specificity of comments.

    (a) Comments on an environmental impact statement or on a proposed 
action shall be as specific as possible and may address either the 
adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed or 
both.
    (b) When a commenting agency criticizes a lead agency's predictive 
methodology, the commenting agency should describe the alternative 
methodology which it prefers and why.

[[Page 290]]

    (c) A cooperating agency shall specify in its comments whether it 
needs additional information to fulfill other applicable environmental 
reviews or consultation requirements and what information it needs. In 
particular, it shall specify any additional information it needs to 
comment adequately on the draft statement's analysis of significant 
site-specific effects associated with the granting or approving by that 
cooperating agency of necessary Federal permits, licenses, or 
entitlements.
    (d) When a cooperating agency with jurisdiction by law objects to or 
expresses reservations about the proposal on grounds of environmental 
impacts, the agency expressing the objection or reservation shall 
specify the mitigation measures it considers necessary to allow the 
agency to grant or approve applicable permit, license, or related 
requirements or concurrences.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.4  Response to comments.

    (a) An agency preparing a final environmental impact statement shall 
assess and consider comments both individually and collectively, and 
shall respond by one or more of the means listed below, stating its 
response in the final statement. Possible responses are to:
    (1) Modify alternatives including the proposed action.
    (2) Develop and evaluate alternatives not previously given serious 
consideration by the agency.
    (3) Supplement, improve, or modify its analyses.
    (4) Make factual corrections.
    (5) Explain why the comments do not warrant further agency response, 
citing the sources, authorities, or reasons which support the agency's 
position and, if appropriate, indicate those circumstances which would 
trigger agency reappraisal or further response.
    (b) All substantive comments received on the draft statement (or 
summaries thereof where the response has been exceptionally voluminous), 
should be attached to the final statement whether or not the comment is 
thought to merit individual discussion by the agency in the text of the 
statement.
    (c) If changes in response to comments are minor and are confined to 
the responses described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, 
agencies may write them on errata sheets and attach them to the 
statement instead of rewriting the draft statement. In such cases only 
the comments, the responses, and the changes and not the final statement 
need be circulated (Sec. 1502.19). The entire document with a new cover 
sheet shall be filed as the final statement (Sec. 1506.9).

<R05>


Sec.
1504.1  Purpose.
1504.2  Criteria for referral.
1504.3  Procedure for referrals and response.

    Authority: NEPA, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 et seq.), sec. 309 of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 7609), and E.O. 11514 (Mar. 5, 1970, as amended by 
E.O. 11991, May 24, 1977).


<R05>
Sec. 1504.1  Purpose.

    (a) This part establishes procedures for referring to the Council 
Federal interagency disagreements concerning proposed major Federal 
actions that might cause unsatisfactory environmental effects. It 
provides means for early resolution of such disagreements.
    (b) Under section 309 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7609), the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is directed to 
review and comment publicly on the environmental impacts of Federal 
activities, including actions for which environmental impact statements 
are prepared. If after this review the Administrator determines that the 
matter is ``unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health or 
welfare or environmental quality,'' section 309 directs that the matter 
be referred to the Council (hereafter ``environmental referrals'').
    (c) Under section 102(2)(C) of the Act other Federal agencies may 
make similar reviews of environmental impact statements, including 
judgments on the acceptability of anticipated environmental impacts. 
These reviews

[[Page 291]]

must be made available to the President, the Council and the public.

[43 FR 55998, Nov. 29, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 1504.2  Criteria for referral.

    Environmental referrals should be made to the Council only after 
concerted, timely (as early as possible in the process), but 
unsuccessful attempts to resolve differences with the lead agency. In 
determining what environmental objections to the matter are appropriate 
to refer to the Council, an agency should weigh potential adverse 
environmental impacts, considering:
    (a) Possible violation of national environmental standards or 
policies.
    (b) Severity.
    (c) Geographical scope.
    (d) Duration.
    (e) Importance as precedents.
    (f) Availability of environmentally preferable alternatives.

[43 FR 55998, Nov. 29, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 1504.3  Procedure for referrals and response.

    (a) A Federal agency making the referral to the Council shall:
    (1) Advise the lead agency at the earliest possible time that it 
intends to refer a matter to the Council unless a satisfactory agreement 
is reached.
    (2) Include such advice in the referring agency's comments on the 
draft environmental impact statement, except when the statement does not 
contain adequate information to permit an assessment of the matter's 
environmental acceptability.
    (3) Identify any essential information that is lacking and request 
that it be made available at the earliest possible time.
    (4) Send copies of such advice to the Council.
    (b) The referring agency shall deliver its referral to the Council 
not later than twenty-five (25) days after the final environmental 
impact statement has been made available to the Environmental Protection 
Agency, commenting agencies, and the public. Except when an extension of 
this period has been granted by the lead agency, the Council will not 
accept a referral after that date.
    (c) The referral shall consist of:
    (1) A copy of the letter signed by the head of the referring agency 
and delivered to the lead agency informing the lead agency of the 
referral and the reasons for it, and requesting that no action be taken 
to implement the matter until the Council acts upon the referral. The 
letter shall include a copy of the statement referred to in (c)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) A statement supported by factual evidence leading to the 
conclusion that the matter is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of 
public health or welfare or environmental quality. The statement shall:
    (i) Identify any material facts in controversy and incorporate (by 
reference if appropriate) agreed upon facts,
    (ii) Identify any existing environmental requirements or policies 
which would be violated by the matter,
    (iii) Present the reasons why the referring agency believes the 
matter is environmentally unsatisfactory,
    (iv) Contain a finding by the agency whether the issue raised is of 
national importance because of the threat to national environmental 
resources or policies or for some other reason,
    (v) Review the steps taken by the referring agency to bring its 
concerns to the attention of the lead agency at the earliest possible 
time, and
    (vi) Give the referring agency's recommendations as to what 
mitigation alternative, further study, or other course of action 
(including abandonment of the matter) are necessary to remedy the 
situation.
    (d) Not later than twenty-five (25) days after the referral to the 
Council the lead agency may deliver a response to the Council, and the 
referring agency. If the lead agency requests more time and gives 
assurance that the matter will not go forward in the interim, the 
Council may grant an extension. The response shall:
    (1) Address fully the issues raised in the referral.
    (2) Be supported by evidence.
    (3) Give the lead agency's response to the referring agency's 
recommendations.
    (e) Interested persons (including the applicant) may deliver their 
views in writing to the Council. Views in support of the referral should 
be delivered

[[Page 292]]

not later than the referral. Views in support of the response shall be 
delivered not later than the response.
    (f) Not later than twenty-five (25) days after receipt of both the 
referral and any response or upon being informed that there will be no 
response (unless the lead agency agrees to a longer time), the Council 
may take one or more of the following actions:
    (1) Conclude that the process of referral and response has 
successfully resolved the problem.
    (2) Initiate discussions with the agencies with the objective of 
mediation with referring and lead agencies.
    (3) Hold public meetings or hearings to obtain additional views and 
information.
    (4) Determine that the issue is not one of national importance and 
request the referring and lead agencies to pursue their decision 
process.
    (5) Determine that the issue should be further negotiated by the 
referring and lead agencies and is not appropriate for Council 
consideration until one or more heads of agencies report to the Council 
that the agencies' disagreements are irreconcilable.
    (6) Publish its findings and recommendations (including where 
appropriate a finding that the submitted evidence does not support the 
position of an agency).
    (7) When appropriate, submit the referral and the response together 
with the Council's recommendation to the President for action.
    (g) The Council shall take no longer than 60 days to complete the 
actions specified in paragraph (f)(2), (3), or (5) of this section.
    (h) When the referral involves an action required by statute to be 
determined on the record after opportunity for agency hearing, the 
referral shall be conducted in a manner consistent with 5 U.S.C. 557(d) 
(Administrative Procedure Act).

<R05>
Sec. 1505.1  Agency decisionmaking procedures.

    Agencies shall adopt procedures (Sec. 1507.3) to ensure that 
decisions are made in accordance with the policies and purposes of the 
Act. Such procedures shall include but not be limited to:
    (a) Implementing procedures under section 102(2) to achieve the 
requirements of sections 101 and 102(1).
    (b) Designating the major decision points for the agency's principal 
programs likely to have a significant effect on the human environment 
and assuring that the NEPA process corresponds with them.
    (c) Requiring that relevant environmental documents, comments, and 
responses be part of the record in formal rulemaking or adjudicatory 
proceedings.
    (d) Requiring that relevant environmental documents, comments, and 
responses accompany the proposal through existing agency review 
processes so that agency officials use the statement in making 
decisions.
    (e) Requiring that the alternatives considered by the decisionmaker 
are encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant 
environmental documents and that the decisionmaker consider the 
alternatives described in the environmental impact statement. If another 
decision document accompanies the relevant environmental documents to 
the decisionmaker, agencies are encouraged to make available to the 
public before the decision is made any part of that document that 
relates to the comparison of alternatives.

<R05>
Sec. 1505.2  Record of decision in cases requiring environmental impact statements.

    At the time of its decision (Sec. 1506.10) or, if appropriate, its 
recommendation to Congress, each agency shall prepare a concise public 
record of decision. The record, which may be integrated into any other 
record prepared by the agency, including that required by OMB Circular 
A-95 (Revised), part I, sections 6(c) and (d), and part II, section 
5(b)(4), shall:
    (a) State what the decision was.
    (b) Identify all alternatives considered by the agency in reaching 
its decision, specifying the alternative or alternatives which were 
considered to be environmentally preferable. An agency may discuss 
preferences among alternatives based on relevant factors including 
economic and technical considerations and agency statutory missions. An 
agency shall identify and discuss all such factors including any 
essential considerations of national policy which were balanced by the 
agency in making its decision and state how those considerations entered 
into its decision.
    (c) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize 
environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and 
if not, why they were not. A monitoring and enforcement program shall be 
adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.


<R05>
Sec. 1505.3  Implementing the decision.

    Agencies may provide for monitoring to assure that their decisions 
are carried out and should do so in important cases. Mitigation 
(Sec. 1505.2(c)) and other conditions established in the environmental 
impact statement or during its review and committed as part of the 
decision shall be implemented by the lead agency or other appropriate 
consenting agency. The lead agency shall:
    (a) Include appropriate conditions in grants, permits or other 
approvals.
    (b) Condition funding of actions on mitigation.
    (c) Upon request, inform cooperating or commenting agencies on 
progress in carrying out mitigation measures which they have proposed 
and which were adopted by the agency making the decision.
    (d) Upon request, make available to the public the results of 
relevant monitoring.

    Source: 43 FR 56000, Nov. 29, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.1  Limitations on actions during NEPA process.

    (a) Until an agency issues a record of decision as provided in 
Sec. 1505.2 (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), no 
action concerning the proposal shall be taken which would:
    (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or
    (2) Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.
    (b) If any agency is considering an application from a non-Federal 
entity, and is aware that the applicant is about to take an action 
within the agency's jurisdiction that would meet either of the criteria 
in paragraph (a) of this section, then the agency shall promptly notify 
the applicant that the agency will take appropriate action to insure 
that the objectives and procedures of NEPA are achieved.
    (c) While work on a required program environmental impact statement 
is in progress and the action is not covered by an existing program 
statement,

[[Page 294]]

agencies shall not undertake in the interim any major Federal action 
covered by the program which may significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment unless such action:
    (1) Is justified independently of the program;
    (2) Is itself accompanied by an adequate environmental impact 
statement; and
    (3) Will not prejudice the ultimate decision on the program. Interim 
action prejudices the ultimate decision on the program when it tends to 
determine subsequent development or limit alternatives.
    (d) This section does not preclude development by applicants of 
plans or designs or performance of other work necessary to support an 
application for Federal, State or local permits or assistance. Nothing 
in this section shall preclude Rural Electrification Administration 
approval of minimal expenditures not affecting the environment (e.g. 
long leadtime equipment and purchase options) made by non-governmental 
entities seeking loan guarantees from the Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.2  Elimination of duplication with State and local procedures.

    (a) Agencies authorized by law to cooperate with State agencies of 
statewide jurisdiction pursuant to section 102(2)(D) of the Act may do 
so.
    (b) Agencies shall cooperate with State and local agencies to the 
fullest extent possible to reduce duplication between NEPA and State and 
local requirements, unless the agencies are specifically barred from 
doing so by some other law. Except for cases covered by paragraph (a) of 
this section, such cooperation shall to the fullest extent possible 
include:
    (1) Joint planning processes.
    (2) Joint environmental research and studies.
    (3) Joint public hearings (except where otherwise provided by 
statute).
    (4) Joint environmental assessments.
    (c) Agencies shall cooperate with State and local agencies to the 
fullest extent possible to reduce duplication between NEPA and 
comparable State and local requirements, unless the agencies are 
specifically barred from doing so by some other law. Except for cases 
covered by paragraph (a) of this section, such cooperation shall to the 
fullest extent possible include joint environmental impact statements. 
In such cases one or more Federal agencies and one or more State or 
local agencies shall be joint lead agencies. Where State laws or local 
ordinances have environmental impact statement requirements in addition 
to but not in conflict with those in NEPA, Federal agencies shall 
cooperate in fulfilling these requirements as well as those of Federal 
laws so that one document will comply with all applicable laws.
    (d) To better integrate environmental impact statements into State 
or local planning processes, statements shall discuss any inconsistency 
of a proposed action with any approved State or local plan and laws 
(whether or not federally sanctioned). Where an inconsistency exists, 
the statement should describe the extent to which the agency would 
reconcile its proposed action with the plan or law.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.3  Adoption.

    (a) An agency may adopt a Federal draft or final environmental 
impact statement or portion thereof provided that the statement or 
portion thereof meets the standards for an adequate statement under 
these regulations.
    (b) If the actions covered by the original environmental impact 
statement and the proposed action are substantially the same, the agency 
adopting another agency's statement is not required to recirculate it 
except as a final statement. Otherwise the adopting agency shall treat 
the statement as a draft and recirculate it (except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section).
    (c) A cooperating agency may adopt without recirculating the 
environmental impact statement of a lead agency when, after an 
independent review of the statement, the cooperating agency concludes 
that its comments and suggestions have been satisfied.
    (d) When an agency adopts a statement which is not final within the 
agency that prepared it, or when the action it assesses is the subject 
of a referral under part 1504, or when the statement's adequacy is the 
subject of

[[Page 295]]

a judicial action which is not final, the agency shall so specify.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.4  Combining documents.

    Any environmental document in compliance with NEPA may be combined 
with any other agency document to reduce duplication and paperwork.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.5  Agency responsibility.

    (a) Information. If an agency requires an applicant to submit 
environmental information for possible use by the agency in preparing an 
environmental impact statement, then the agency should assist the 
applicant by outlining the types of information required. The agency 
shall independently evaluate the information submitted and shall be 
responsible for its accuracy. If the agency chooses to use the 
information submitted by the applicant in the environmental impact 
statement, either directly or by reference, then the names of the 
persons responsible for the independent evaluation shall be included in 
the list of preparers (Sec. 1502.17). It is the intent of this paragraph 
that acceptable work not be redone, but that it be verified by the 
agency.
    (b) Environmental assessments. If an agency permits an applicant to 
prepare an environmental assessment, the agency, besides fulfilling the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, shall make its own 
evaluation of the environmental issues and take responsibility for the 
scope and content of the environmental assessment.
    (c) Environmental impact statements. Except as provided in 
Secs. 1506.2 and 1506.3 any environmental impact statement prepared 
pursuant to the requirements of NEPA shall be prepared directly by or by 
a contractor selected by the lead agency or where appropriate under 
Sec. 1501.6(b), a cooperating agency. It is the intent of these 
regulations that the contractor be chosen solely by the lead agency, or 
by the lead agency in cooperation with cooperating agencies, or where 
appropriate by a cooperating agency to avoid any conflict of interest. 
Contractors shall execute a disclosure statement prepared by the lead 
agency, or where appropriate the cooperating agency, specifying that 
they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project. 
If the document is prepared by contract, the responsible Federal 
official shall furnish guidance and participate in the preparation and 
shall independently evaluate the statement prior to its approval and 
take responsibility for its scope and contents. Nothing in this section 
is intended to prohibit any agency from requesting any person to submit 
information to it or to prohibit any person from submitting information 
to any agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.6  Public involvement.

    Agencies shall:
    (a) Make diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and 
implementing their NEPA procedures.
    (b) Provide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, 
and the availability of environmental documents so as to inform those 
persons and agencies who may be interested or affected.
    (1) In all cases the agency shall mail notice to those who have 
requested it on an individual action.
    (2) In the case of an action with effects of national concern notice 
shall include publication in the Federal Register and notice by mail to 
national organizations reasonably expected to be interested in the 
matter and may include listing in the 102 Monitor. An agency engaged in 
rulemaking may provide notice by mail to national organizations who have 
requested that notice regularly be provided. Agencies shall maintain a 
list of such organizations.
    (3) In the case of an action with effects primarily of local concern 
the notice may include:
    (i) Notice to State and areawide clearinghouses pursuant to OMB 
Circular A-95 (Revised).
    (ii) Notice to Indian tribes when effects may occur on reservations.
    (iii) Following the affected State's public notice procedures for 
comparable actions.
    (iv) Publication in local newspapers (in papers of general 
circulation rather than legal papers).
    (v) Notice through other local media.
    (vi) Notice to potentially interested community organizations 
including small business associations.

[[Page 296]]

    (vii) Publication in newsletters that may be expected to reach 
potentially interested persons.
    (viii) Direct mailing to owners and occupants of nearby or affected 
property.
    (ix) Posting of notice on and off site in the area where the action 
is to be located.
    (c) Hold or sponsor public hearings or public meetings whenever 
appropriate or in accordance with statutory requirements applicable to 
the agency. Criteria shall include whether there is:
    (1) Substantial environmental controversy concerning the proposed 
action or substantial interest in holding the hearing.
    (2) A request for a hearing by another agency with jurisdiction over 
the action supported by reasons why a hearing will be helpful. If a 
draft environmental impact statement is to be considered at a public 
hearing, the agency should make the statement available to the public at 
least 15 days in advance (unless the purpose of the hearing is to 
provide information for the draft environmental impact statement).
    (d) Solicit appropriate information from the public.
    (e) Explain in its procedures where interested persons can get 
information or status reports on environmental impact statements and 
other elements of the NEPA process.
    (f) Make environmental impact statements, the comments received, and 
any underlying documents available to the public pursuant to the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), without 
regard to the exclusion for interagency memoranda where such memoranda 
transmit comments of Federal agencies on the environmental impact of the 
proposed action. Materials to be made available to the public shall be 
provided to the public without charge to the extent practicable, or at a 
fee which is not more than the actual costs of reproducing copies 
required to be sent to other Federal agencies, including the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.7  Further guidance.

    The Council may provide further guidance concerning NEPA and its 
procedures including:
    (a) A handbook which the Council may supplement from time to time, 
which shall in plain language provide guidance and instructions 
concerning the application of NEPA and these regulations.
    (b) Publication of the Council's Memoranda to Heads of Agencies.
    (c) In conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
publication of the 102 Monitor, notice of:
    (1) Research activities;
    (2) Meetings and conferences related to NEPA; and
    (3) Successful and innovative procedures used by agencies to 
implement NEPA.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.8  Proposals for legislation.

    (a) The NEPA process for proposals for legislation (Sec. 1508.17) 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment shall be 
integrated with the legislative process of the Congress. A legislative 
environmental impact statement is the detailed statement required by law 
to be included in a recommendation or report on a legislative proposal 
to Congress. A legislative environmental impact statement shall be 
considered part of the formal transmittal of a legislative proposal to 
Congress; however, it may be transmitted to Congress up to 30 days later 
in order to allow time for completion of an accurate statement which can 
serve as the basis for public and Congressional debate. The statement 
must be available in time for Congressional hearings and deliberations.
    (b) Preparation of a legislative environmental impact statement 
shall conform to the requirements of these regulations except as 
follows:
    (1) There need not be a scoping process.
    (2) The legislative statement shall be prepared in the same manner 
as a draft statement, but shall be considered the ``detailed statement'' 
required by statute; Provided, That when any of the following conditions 
exist both the draft and final environmental impact statement on the 
legislative proposal shall be prepared and circulated as provided by 
Secs. 1503.1 and 1506.10.
    (i) A Congressional Committee with jurisdiction over the proposal 
has a

[[Page 297]]

rule requiring both draft and final environmental impact statements.
    (ii) The proposal results from a study process required by statute 
(such as those required by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 
1271 et seq.) and the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.)).
    (iii) Legislative approval is sought for Federal or federally 
assisted construction or other projects which the agency recommends be 
located at specific geographic locations. For proposals requiring an 
environmental impact statement for the acquisition of space by the 
General Services Administration, a draft statement shall accompany the 
Prospectus or the 11(b) Report of Building Project Surveys to the 
Congress, and a final statement shall be completed before site 
acquisition.
    (iv) The agency decides to prepare draft and final statements.
    (c) Comments on the legislative statement shall be given to the lead 
agency which shall forward them along with its own responses to the 
Congressional committees with jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.9  Filing requirements.

    Environmental impact statements together with comments and responses 
shall be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency, attention 
Office of Federal Activities (A-104), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 
20460. Statements shall be filed with EPA no earlier than they are also 
transmitted to commenting agencies and made available to the public. EPA 
shall deliver one copy of each statement to the Council, which shall 
satisfy the requirement of availability to the President. EPA may issue 
guidelines to agencies to implement its responsibilities under this 
section and Sec. 1506.10.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.10  Timing of agency action.

    (a) The Environmental Protection Agency shall publish a notice in 
the Federal Register each week of the environmental impact statements 
filed during the preceding week. The minimum time periods set forth in 
this section shall be calculated from the date of publication of this 
notice.
    (b) No decision on the proposed action shall be made or recorded 
under Sec. 1505.2 by a Federal agency until the later of the following 
dates:
    (1) Ninety (90) days after publication of the notice described above 
in paragraph (a) of this section for a draft environmental impact 
statement.
    (2) Thirty (30) days after publication of the notice described above 
in paragraph (a) of this section for a final environmental impact 
statement.

An exception to the rules on timing may be made in the case of an agency 
decision which is subject to a formal internal appeal. Some agencies 
have a formally established appeal process which allows other agencies 
or the public to take appeals on a decision and make their views known, 
after publication of the final environmental impact statement. In such 
cases, where a real opportunity exists to alter the decision, the 
decision may be made and recorded at the same time the environmental 
impact statement is published. This means that the period for appeal of 
the decision and the 30-day period prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section may run concurrently. In such cases the environmental 
impact statement shall explain the timing and the public's right of 
appeal. An agency engaged in rulemaking under the Administrative 
Procedure Act or other statute for the purpose of protecting the public 
health or safety, may waive the time period in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section and publish a decision on the final rule simultaneously with 
publication of the notice of the availability of the final environmental 
impact statement as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) If the final environmental impact statement is filed within 
ninety (90) days after a draft environmental impact statement is filed 
with the Environmental Protection Agency, the minimum thirty (30) day 
period and the minimum ninety (90) day period may run concurrently. 
However, subject to paragraph (d) of this section agencies shall allow 
not less than 45 days for comments on draft statements.
    (d) The lead agency may extend prescribed periods. The Environmental 
Protection Agency may upon a showing by the lead agency of compelling 
reasons of national policy reduce the prescribed periods and may upon a

[[Page 298]]

showing by any other Federal agency of compelling reasons of national 
policy also extend prescribed periods, but only after consultation with 
the lead agency. (Also see Sec. 1507.3(d).) Failure to file timely 
comments shall not be a sufficient reason for extending a period. If the 
lead agency does not concur with the extension of time, EPA may not 
extend it for more than 30 days. When the Environmental Protection 
Agency reduces or extends any period of time it shall notify the 
Council.

[43 FR 56000, Nov. 29, 1978; 44 FR 874, Jan. 3, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 1506.11  Emergencies.

    Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action 
with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions 
of these regulations, the Federal agency taking the action should 
consult with the Council about alternative arrangements. Agencies and 
the Council will limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control 
the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other actions remain subject to 
NEPA review.


<R05>
Sec. 1506.12  Effective date.

    The effective date of these regulations is July 30, 1979, except 
that for agencies that administer programs that qualify under section 
102(2)(D) of the Act or under section 104(h) of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1974 an additional four months shall be 
allowed for the State or local agencies to adopt their implementing 
procedures.
    (a) These regulations shall apply to the fullest extent practicable 
to ongoing activities and environmental documents begun before the 
effective date. These regulations do not apply to an environmental 
impact statement or supplement if the draft statement was filed before 
the effective date of these regulations. No completed environmental 
documents need be redone by reasons of these regulations. Until these 
regulations are applicable, the Council's guidelines published in the 
Federal Register of August 1, 1973, shall continue to be applicable. In 
cases where these regulations are applicable the guidelines are 
superseded. However, nothing shall prevent an agency from proceeding 
under these regulations at an earlier time.
    (b) NEPA shall continue to be applicable to actions begun before 
January 1, 1970, to the fullest extent possible.

Sec.
1507.1  Compliance.
1507.2  Agency capability to comply.
1507.3  Agency procedures.

    Authority: NEPA, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 et seq.), sec. 309 of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 7609), and E.O. 11514 (Mar. 5, 1970, as amended by 
E.O. 11991, May 24, 1977).

    Source: 43 FR 56002, Nov. 29, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1507.1  Compliance.

    All agencies of the Federal Government shall comply with these 
regulations. It is the intent of these regulations to allow each agency 
flexibility in adapting its implementing procedures authorized by 
Sec. 1507.3 to the requirements of other applicable laws.


<R05>
Sec. 1507.2  Agency capability to comply.

    Each agency shall be capable (in terms of personnel and other 
resources) of complying with the requirements enumerated below. Such 
compliance may include use of other's resources, but the using agency 
shall itself have sufficient capability to evaluate what others do for 
it. Agencies shall:
    (a) Fulfill the requirements of section 102(2)(A) of the Act to 
utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach which will insure the 
integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental 
design arts in planning and in decisionmaking which may have an impact 
on the human environment. Agencies shall designate a person to be 
responsible for overall review of agency NEPA compliance.
    (b) Identify methods and procedures required by section 102(2)(B) to 
insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values 
may be given appropriate consideration.
    (c) Prepare adequate environmental impact statements pursuant to 
section 102(2)(C) and comment on statements

[[Page 299]]

in the areas where the agency has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise or is authorized to develop and enforce environmental 
standards.
    (d) Study, develop, and describe alternatives to recommended courses 
of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning 
alternative uses of available resources. This requirement of section 
102(2)(E) extends to all such proposals, not just the more limited scope 
of section 102(2)(C)(iii) where the discussion of alternatives is 
confined to impact statements.
    (e) Comply with the requirements of section 102(2)(H) that the 
agency initiate and utilize ecological information in the planning and 
development of resource-oriented projects.
    (f) Fulfill the requirements of sections 102(2)(F), 102(2)(G), and 
102(2)(I), of the Act and of Executive Order 11514, Protection and 
Enhancement of Environmental Quality, Sec. 2.


<R05>
Sec. 1507.3  Agency procedures.

    (a) Not later than eight months after publication of these 
regulations as finally adopted in the Federal Register, or five months 
after the establishment of an agency, whichever shall come later, each 
agency shall as necessary adopt procedures to supplement these 
regulations. When the agency is a department, major subunits are 
encouraged (with the consent of the department) to adopt their own 
procedures. Such procedures shall not paraphrase these regulations. They 
shall confine themselves to implementing procedures. Each agency shall 
consult with the Council while developing its procedures and before 
publishing them in the Federal Register for comment. Agencies with 
similar programs should consult with each other and the Council to 
coordinate their procedures, especially for programs requesting similar 
information from applicants. The procedures shall be adopted only after 
an opportunity for public review and after review by the Council for 
conformity with the Act and these regulations. The Council shall 
complete its review within 30 days. Once in effect they shall be filed 
with the Council and made readily available to the public. Agencies are 
encouraged to publish explanatory guidance for these regulations and 
their own procedures. Agencies shall continue to review their policies 
and procedures and in consultation with the Council to revise them as 
necessary to ensure full compliance with the purposes and provisions of 
the Act.
    (b) Agency procedures shall comply with these regulations except 
where compliance would be inconsistent with statutory requirements and 
shall include:
    (1) Those procedures required by Secs. 1501.2(d), 1502.9(c)(3), 
1505.1, 1506.6(e), and 1508.4.
    (2) Specific criteria for and identification of those typical 
classes of action:
    (i) Which normally do require environmental impact statements.
    (ii) Which normally do not require either an environmental impact 
statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusions 
(Sec. 1508.4)).
    (iii) Which normally require environmental assessments but not 
necessarily environmental impact statements.
    (c) Agency procedures may include specific criteria for providing 
limited exceptions to the provisions of these regulations for classified 
proposals. They are proposed actions which are specifically authorized 
under criteria established by an Executive Order or statute to be kept 
secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in 
fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order or statute. 
Environmental assessments and environmental impact statements which 
address classified proposals may be safeguarded and restricted from 
public dissemination in accordance with agencies' own regulations 
applicable to classified information. These documents may be organized 
so that classified portions can be included as annexes, in order that 
the unclassified portions can be made available to the public.
    (d) Agency procedures may provide for periods of time other than 
those presented in Sec. 1506.10 when necessary to comply with other 
specific statutory requirements.
    (e) Agency procedures may provide that where there is a lengthy 
period between the agency's decision to prepare an environmental impact 
statement

[[Page 300]]

and the time of actual preparation, the notice of intent required by 
Sec. 1501.7 may be published at a reasonable time in advance of 
preparation of the draft statement.

    Source: 43 FR 56003, Nov. 29, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.1  Terminology.

    The terminology of this part shall be uniform throughout the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.2  Act.

    Act means the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) which is also referred to as ``NEPA.''


<R05>
Sec. 1508.3  Affecting.

    Affecting means will or may have an effect on.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.4  Categorical exclusion.

    Categorical exclusion means a category of actions which do not 
individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human 
environment and which have been found to have no such effect in 
procedures adopted by a Federal agency in implementation of these 
regulations (Sec. 1507.3) and for which, therefore, neither an 
environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is 
required. An agency may decide in its procedures or otherwise, to 
prepare environmental assessments for the reasons stated in Sec. 1508.9 
even though it is not required to do so. Any procedures under this 
section shall provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a 
normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.5  Cooperating agency.

    Cooperating agency means any Federal agency other than a lead agency 
which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any 
environmental impact involved in a proposal (or a reasonable 
alternative) for legislation or other major Federal action significantly 
affecting the quality of the human environment. The selection and 
responsibilities of a cooperating agency are described in Sec. 1501.6. A 
State or local agency of similar qualifications or, when the effects are 
on a reservation, an Indian Tribe, may by agreement with the lead agency 
become a cooperating agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.6  Council.

    Council means the Council on Environmental Quality established by 
title II of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.7  Cumulative impact.

    Cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results 
from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, 
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. 
Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively 
significant actions taking place over a period of time.

[[Page 301]]


<R05>
Sec. 1508.8  Effects.

    Effects include:
    (a) Direct effects, which are caused by the action and occur at the 
same time and place.
    (b) Indirect effects, which are caused by the action and are later 
in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably 
foreseeable. Indirect effects may include growth inducing effects and 
other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use, 
population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water 
and other natural systems, including ecosystems.

Effects and impacts as used in these regulations are synonymous. Effects 
includes ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the 
components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), 
aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether 
direct, indirect, or cumulative. Effects may also include those 
resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental 
effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effect will be 
beneficial.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.9  Environmental assessment.

    Environmental assessment:
    (a) Means a concise public document for which a Federal agency is 
responsible that serves to:
    (1) Briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining 
whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no 
significant impact.
    (2) Aid an agency's compliance with the Act when no environmental 
impact statement is necessary.
    (3) Facilitate preparation of a statement when one is necessary.
    (b) Shall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of 
alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E), of the environmental 
impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of 
agencies and persons consulted.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.10  Environmental document.

    Environmental document includes the documents specified in 
Sec. 1508.9 (environmental assessment), Sec. 1508.11 (environmental 
impact statement), Sec. 1508.13 (finding of no significant impact), and 
Sec. 1508.22 (notice of intent).


<R05>
Sec. 1508.11  Environmental impact statement.

    Environmental impact statement means a detailed written statement as 
required by section 102(2)(C) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.12  Federal agency.

    Federal agency means all agencies of the Federal Government. It does 
not mean the Congress, the Judiciary, or the President, including the 
performance of staff functions for the President in his Executive 
Office. It also includes for purposes of these regulations States and 
units of general local government and Indian tribes assuming NEPA 
responsibilities under section 104(h) of the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1974.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.13  Finding of no significant impact.

    Finding of no significant impact means a document by a Federal 
agency briefly presenting the reasons why an action, not otherwise 
excluded (Sec. 1508.4), will not have a significant effect on the human 
environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore 
will not be prepared. It shall include the environmental assessment or a 
summary of it and shall note any other environmental documents related 
to it (Sec. 1501.7(a)(5)). If the assessment is included, the finding 
need not repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may 
incorporate it by reference.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.14  Human environment.

    Human environment shall be interpreted comprehensively to include 
the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with 
that environment. (See the definition of ``effects'' (Sec. 1508.8).) 
This means that economic or social effects are not intended by 
themselves to require preparation of an environmental impact statement. 
When an environmental impact statement is prepared and economic or 
social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated, 
then the environmental impact statement

[[Page 302]]

will discuss all of these effects on the human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.15  Jurisdiction by law.

    Jurisdiction by law means agency authority to approve, veto, or 
finance all or part of the proposal.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.16  Lead agency.

    Lead agency means the agency or agencies preparing or having taken 
primary responsibility for preparing the environmental impact statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.17  Legislation.

    Legislation includes a bill or legislative proposal to Congress 
developed by or with the significant cooperation and support of a 
Federal agency, but does not include requests for appropriations. The 
test for significant cooperation is whether the proposal is in fact 
predominantly that of the agency rather than another source. Drafting 
does not by itself constitute significant cooperation. Proposals for 
legislation include requests for ratification of treaties. Only the 
agency which has primary responsibility for the subject matter involved 
will prepare a legislative environmental impact statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.18  Major Federal action.

    Major Federal action includes actions with effects that may be major 
and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility. 
Major reinforces but does not have a meaning independent of 
significantly (Sec. 1508.27). Actions include the circumstance where the 
responsible officials fail to act and that failure to act is reviewable 
by courts or administrative tribunals under the Administrative Procedure 
Act or other applicable law as agency action.
    (a) Actions include new and continuing activities, including 
projects and programs entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, 
regulated, or approved by federal agencies; new or revised agency rules, 
regulations, plans, policies, or procedures; and legislative proposals 
(Secs. 1506.8, 1508.17). Actions do not include funding assistance 
solely in the form of general revenue sharing funds, distributed under 
the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, 31 U.S.C. 1221 et 
seq., with no Federal agency control over the subsequent use of such 
funds. Actions do not include bringing judicial or administrative civil 
or criminal enforcement actions.
    (b) Federal actions tend to fall within one of the following 
categories:
    (1) Adoption of official policy, such as rules, regulations, and 
interpretations adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 
U.S.C. 551 et seq.; treaties and international conventions or 
agreements; formal documents establishing an agency's policies which 
will result in or substantially alter agency programs.
    (2) Adoption of formal plans, such as official documents prepared or 
approved by federal agencies which guide or prescribe alternative uses 
of Federal resources, upon which future agency actions will be based.
    (3) Adoption of programs, such as a group of concerted actions to 
implement a specific policy or plan; systematic and connected agency 
decisions allocating agency resources to implement a specific statutory 
program or executive directive.
    (4) Approval of specific projects, such as construction or 
management activities located in a defined geographic area. Projects 
include actions approved by permit or other regulatory decision as well 
as federal and federally assisted activities.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.19  Matter.

    Matter includes for purposes of part 1504:
    (a) With respect to the Environmental Protection Agency, any 
proposed legislation, project, action or regulation as those terms are 
used in section 309(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7609).
    (b) With respect to all other agencies, any proposed major federal 
action to which section 102(2)(C) of NEPA applies.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.20  Mitigation.

    Mitigation includes:
    (a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or 
parts of an action.
    (b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the 
action and its implementation.

[[Page 303]]

    (c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring 
the affected environment.
    (d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and 
maintenance operations during the life of the action.
    (e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute 
resources or environments.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.21  NEPA process.

    NEPA process means all measures necessary for compliance with the 
requirements of section 2 and title I of NEPA.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.22  Notice of intent.

    Notice of intent means a notice that an environmental impact 
statement will be prepared and considered. The notice shall briefly:
    (a) Describe the proposed action and possible alternatives.
    (b) Describe the agency's proposed scoping process including 
whether, when, and where any scoping meeting will be held.
    (c) State the name and address of a person within the agency who can 
answer questions about the proposed action and the environmental impact 
statement.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.23  Proposal.

    Proposal exists at that stage in the development of an action when 
an agency subject to the Act has a goal and is actively preparing to 
make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that 
goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated. Preparation of an 
environmental impact statement on a proposal should be timed 
(Sec. 1502.5) so that the final statement may be completed in time for 
the statement to be included in any recommendation or report on the 
proposal. A proposal may exist in fact as well as by agency declaration 
that one exists.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.24  Referring agency.

    Referring agency means the federal agency which has referred any 
matter to the Council after a determination that the matter is 
unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health or welfare or 
environmental quality.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.25  Scope.

    Scope consists of the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to 
be considered in an environmental impact statement. The scope of an 
individual statement may depend on its relationships to other statements 
(Secs. 1502.20 and 1508.28). To determine the scope of environmental 
impact statements, agencies shall consider 3 types of actions, 3 types 
of alternatives, and 3 types of impacts. They include:
    (a) Actions (other than unconnected single actions) which may be:
    (1) Connected actions, which means that they are closely related and 
therefore should be discussed in the same impact statement. Actions are 
connected if they:
    (i) Automatically trigger other actions which may require 
environmental impact statements.
    (ii) Cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken 
previously or simultaneously.
    (iii) Are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the 
larger action for their justification.
    (2) Cumulative actions, which when viewed with other proposed 
actions have cumulatively significant impacts and should therefore be 
discussed in the same impact statement.
    (3) Similar actions, which when viewed with other reasonably 
foreseeable or proposed agency actions, have similarities that provide a 
basis for evaluating their environmental consequencies together, such as 
common timing or geography. An agency may wish to analyze these actions 
in the same impact statement. It should do so when the best way to 
assess adequately the combined impacts of similar actions or reasonable 
alternatives to such actions is to treat them in a single impact 
statement.
    (b) Alternatives, which include: (1) No action alternative.
    (2) Other reasonable courses of actions.
    (3) Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action).
    (c) Impacts, which may be: (1) Direct; (2) indirect; (3) cumulative.

[[Page 304]]


<R05>
Sec. 1508.26  Special expertise.

    Special expertise means statutory responsibility, agency mission, or 
related program experience.


<R05>
Sec. 1508.27  Significantly.

    Significantly as used in NEPA requires considerations of both 
context and intensity:
    (a) Context. This means that the significance of an action must be 
analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human, 
national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the 
locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. 
For instance, in the case of a site-specific action, significance would 
usually depend upon the effects in the locale rather than in the world 
as a whole. Both short- and long-term effects are relevant.
    (b) Intensity. This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible 
officials must bear in mind that more than one agency may make decisions 
about partial aspects of a major action. The following should be 
considered in evaluating intensity:
    (1) Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant 
effect may exist even if the Federal agency believes that on balance the 
effect will be beneficial.
    (2) The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or 
safety.
    (3) Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity 
to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, 
wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas.
    (4) The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human 
environment are likely to be highly controversial.
    (5) The degree to which the possible effects on the human 
environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.
    (6) The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for 
future actions with significant effects or represents a decision in 
principle about a future consideration.
    (7) Whether the action is related to other actions with individually 
insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts. Significance exists 
if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on 
the environment. Significance cannot be avoided by terming an action 
temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.
    (8) The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, 
sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause loss or 
destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical 
resources.
    (9) The degree to which the action may adversely affect an 
endangered or threatened species or its habitat that has been determined 
to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
    (10) Whether the action threatens a violation of Federal, State, or 
local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.

<R05>
Sec. 1508.28  Tiering.

    Tiering refers to the coverage of general matters in broader 
environmental impact statements (such as national program or policy 
statements) with subsequent narrower statements or environmental 
analyses (such as regional or basinwide program statements or ultimately 
site-specific statements) incorporating by reference the general 
discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the 
statement subsequently prepared. Tiering is appropriate when the 
sequence of statements or analyses is:
    (a) From a program, plan, or policy environmental impact statement 
to a program, plan, or policy statement or analysis of lesser scope or 
to a site-specific statement or analysis.
    (b) From an environmental impact statement on a specific action at 
an early stage (such as need and site selection) to a supplement (which 
is preferred) or a subsequent statement or analysis at a later stage 
(such as environmental mitigation). Tiering in such cases is appropriate 
when it helps the lead agency to focus on the issues which are ripe for 
decision and exclude from consideration issues already decided or not 
yet ripe.

                                 Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 1515.1  What are these procedures?

    The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, commonly known as 
FOIA) is a law which creates a procedure for any person to request 
official documents and other records from United States Government 
agencies. The law requires every Federal agency to make available to the 
public the material requested, unless the material falls under one of 
the limited exceptions stated in section 552(b)(5) of the Act, and the 
agency has good reason to refuse the request. These procedures explain 
how the Council on Environmental Quality--one of several offices in the 
Executive Office of the President--will carry out the Freedom of 
Information Act. They are written from the standpoint of a member of the 
public requesting material from the Council.

                           Organization of CEQ


<R05>
Sec. 1515.2  What is the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)?

    (a) The Council on Environmental Quality (``CEQ'' or ``the 
Council'') was created by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 through 4347). The Council's authority is 
derived from that Act, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 
1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371-4374), Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 
1977 (July 15, 1977), and Executive Order 11514, Protection and 
Enhancement of Environmental Quality, March 5, 1970, as amended by 
Executive Order 11991, May 24, 1977.
    (b) The Council's primary responsibilities include the following:
    (1) To review and evaluate the programs and activities of the 
Federal Government to determine how they are contributing to the 
attainment of the national environmental policy;
    (2) To assist Federal agencies and departments in appraising the 
effectiveness of their existing and proposed facilities, programs, 
policies, and activities affecting environmental quality;
    (3) To develop and recommend to the President policies to improve 
environmental quality to meet the conservation, social, economic, 
health, and other requirements and goals of the Nation;
    (4) To advise and assist the President in achieving international 
cooperation for dealing with environmental problems;
    (5) To assist in coordinating among Federal agencies and departments 
those programs which affect, protect, and improve environmental quality, 
including Federal compliance with the environmental impact statement 
process, and to seek resolution of significant environmental issues;
    (6) To foster research relating to environmental quality and the 
impacts of new or changing technologies; and
    (7) To analyze long and short term environmental problems and trends 
and assist in preparing an annual Environmental Quality Report to the 
President and the Congress.
    (c) The Council maintains a ``Quarterly Index'' which lists its 
current policies and procedures, as required by section 552(a)(2) of the 
Freedom of Information Act. This index is updated and published in the 
Federal Register quarterly, starting in 1976. The Quarterly Index--and 
the specific items listed in the index--are available on request from 
the Freedom of Information Officer. You may also inspect or copy

[[Page 306]]

any of these materials at the Council's office during the hours stated 
below in Sec. 1515.3(f).


<R05>
Sec. 1515.3  How is CEQ organized?

    (a) The Council is made up of three members appointed by the 
President and subject to approval by the Senate. One member is 
designated as chairman by the President. All three serve in a full-time 
capacity.
    (b) The National Environmental Policy Act and the Environmental 
Quality Improvement Act give the Council the authority to hire any 
officers and staff that may be necessary to carry out responsibilities 
and functions specified in these two Acts. Also, the use of consultants 
and experts is permitted.
    (c) In addition to the three members, the Council has program and 
legal staff.
    (d) The Council has no field or regional offices.
    (e) The Council has a public affairs office which is responsible for 
providing information to the general public, the Congress, and the 
press. If you are interested in general information about the Council or 
have questions about the Council's recent activities or policy 
positions, you should call this office at (202) 633-7005 or write to the 
``Public Affairs Office'' of the Council at the address given in the 
next paragraph.

    Note: The CEQ public affairs office can respond fully and promptly 
to most questions you may have; the Council suggests that the Freedom of 
Information Act procedures be used when you are seeking a specific 
document and have had difficulty obtaining it.

    (f) The Council is located at 722 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC 
20006. Office hours are 9-5:30, Monday through Friday, except legal 
holidays. If you wish to meet with any of the staff, please write or 
phone ahead for an appointment. The main number is 202-633-7027.

                    Procedures for Requesting Records


<R05>
Sec. 1515.5  How to make a Freedom of Information Act request.

    (a) The Chairman has appointed a Freedom of Information Officer who 
will be responsible for overseeing the Council's administration of the 
Freedom of Information Act and for receiving, routing, and overseeing 
the processing of all Freedom of Information requests. The Chairman has 
also appointed an Appeals Officer who is responsible for processing any 
appeals.
    (b) Requesting information from the Council. (1) When you make a 
Freedom of Information Act request to the Council, the Freedom of 
Information Officer shall decide how to respond to--or ``make an initial 
determination on''--your request within 10 working days from the date 
the Officer receives the request. The Freedom of Information Officer 
will then provide you with written notification of the determination.
    (2) You can make a Freedom of Information Act request by writing a 
letter which states that you are making a Freedom of Information Act 
request. Address your letter to:

    Freedom of Information Officer, Council on Environmental Quality, 
Executive Office of the President, 722 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC 
20006.

    (3) In your request you should identify the desired record or 
reasonably describe it. The request should be as specific as possible so 
that the item can be readily found. You should not make blanket 
requests, such as requests for ``the entire file of'' or ``all materials 
relating to'' a specified subject.
    (4) The Council will make a reasonable effort to assist you in 
defining the request to eliminate extraneous and unwanted materials and 
to keep search and copying fees to a minimum. If you have budgetary 
constraints and anticipate that your request might be costly you may 
wish to indicate the maximum fee you are prepared to pay for acquiring 
the information. (See Sec. 1515.15(c) also.)
    (5) The 10 day period for making a determination on a request will 
begin when the records reqested are specified or reasonably 
identifiable.
    (6) Despite its name, the Freedom of Information Act does not 
require a government agency to create or research information that you 
would like or that you may think the agency should have. The Act only 
requres that existing records be made available to the public.

[[Page 307]]

    (c) Council's response to a request. (1) Upon receipt of any request 
under the Act, the Freedom of Information Officer shall direct the 
request to the appropriate staff member at the Council, who will review 
the request and advise the Freedom of Information Officer as soon as 
possible.
    (2) If it is appropriate to grant the request, the staff member will 
immediately collect the requested materials in order to accompany, 
wherever possible, the Freedom of Information Officer's letter notifying 
you of the decision.
    (3) If your request is denied, in part or in full, the letter 
notifying you of the decision will be signed by the Freedom of 
Information Officer, and will include the names of any other individuals 
who participated in the decision. The letter will include the reasons 
for any denial and the procedure for filing an appeal.
    (d) Appeals. (1) If you are not satisfied with the response you have 
received from the Freedom of Information Officer, you may ask the 
Council to reconsider the decision. You should explain what material you 
still wish to receive, and why you believe the Council should disclose 
this to you. This is called an ``appeal.'' You must make you appeal 
within 45 days of the date on the letter which denied your request.
    (2) You can make an appeal by writing a letter to:

FOIA Appeals Officer, Council on Environmental Quality, Executive Office 
of the President, 722 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC 20006.

    (3) Your letter should specify the records being requested and ask 
the Appeals Officer to review the determination made by the Freedom of 
Information Officer. The letter should explain the basis for the appeal.
    (4) The Appeals Officer shall decide the appeal--or ``make a final 
determination''--within 20 working days from the date the Officer 
receives the appeal. The Appeals Officer (or designee) will send you a 
letter informing you of the decision as soon as it is made. If the 
Appeals Officer denies your request, in part or in whole, the letter 
will also notify you of the provisions for judicial review and the names 
of any persons who participated in the final determination of the 
appeal.
    (e) Extending the Council's time to respond. In unusual 
circumstances, the time limits for response to your request (paragraphs 
(b) and (d) of this section) may be extended by the Council for not more 
than 10 working days. Extensions may be granted by the Freedom of 
Information Officer in the case of initial requests and by the Appeals 
Officer in the case of any appeals. The extension period may be split 
between the initial request and the appeal but may not exceed 10 working 
days overall. Any extension will be made or confirmed to you in writing 
and will set forth the reasons for the extension and the date that the 
final determination is expected. The term ``unusual circumstances'' 
means:

    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from * 
* * establishments that are separate from the office processing the 
request;
    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

(5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B))

                       Availability of Information


<R05>
Sec. 1515.10  What information is available, and how can it be obtained?

    (a) When a request for information has been approved, in whole or in 
part, you may make an appointment to inspect or copy the materials 
requested during regular business hours by writing or telephoning the 
Freedom of Information Officer at the address or phone number given in 
Sec. 1515.3(f). You may be charged reasonable fees for copying 
materials, as explained by Sec. 1515.15. The Council on Environmental 
Quality will permit copying of any available material but will reserve 
the right to limit the number of copies made with the Council's copying 
facilities.
    (b) In general, all records of the Council are available to the 
public, as

[[Page 308]]

required by the Freedom of Information Act. The Council claims the 
right, where it is applicable, to withhold material under the provisions 
specified in the Freedom of Information Act as amended (5 U.S.C. 
552(b)).
    (c) The legislative history of the establishment of the Council 
states that the Congress intended the Council to be a confidential 
advisor to the President on matters of environmental policy. Therefore, 
members of the public should presume that communications between the 
Council and the President (and their staffs) are confidential and 
ordinarily will not be released; they will usually fall, at a minimum, 
within Exemption 5 of the Act. The Freedom of Information Officer shall 
review each request, however, to determine whether the record is 
exclusively factual or may have factual portions which may be reasonably 
segregated and made available to the requester. Furthermore, on the 
recommendation of the FOIA Officer or Appeals Officer, the Council will 
consider the release of an entire record, even if it comes within an 
exemption or contains policy advice, if its disclosure would not impair 
Executive policymaking processes or the Council's participation in 
decisionmaking.

                                  Costs


<R05>
Sec. 1515.15  What fees may be charged, and how should they be paid?

    (a) Following is the schedule of fees you may be charged for the 
search and reproduction of information available under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.
    (1) Search for records. Five dollars per hour when the search is 
conducted by a clerical employee. Eight dollars per hour when the search 
is conducted by a professional employee. There will be no charge for 
searches of less than one hour.
    (2) Duplication of records. Records will be duplicated at a rate of 
$0.10 per page for copying of 10 pages or more. There will be no charge 
for duplicating 9 pages or less.
    (3) Other. When no specific fee has been established for a service, 
or the request for a service does not fall under categories (1) and (2), 
the Administrative Officer is authorized to establish an appropriate fee 
based on ``direct costs'' as provided in the Freedom of Information Act. 
Examples of services covered by this provision include searches 
involving computer time or special travel, transportation, or 
communication costs.
    (b) If the Council anticipates that the fees chargeable under this 
section will amount to more than $25, or the maximum amount specified in 
your request, you shall be promptly notified of the amount of the 
anticipated fee or the closest estimate of the amount. In such instances 
you will be advised of your option to consult with Council personnel in 
order to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fees, 
yet still meet your needs. A reformulated request shall be considered a 
new request, thus beginning a new 10 working day period for processing.
    (c) Fees must be paid in full prior to issuance of the requested 
copies. In the event you owe money for previous request, copies of 
records will not be provided for any subsequent request until the debt 
has been paid in full.
    (d) Search costs are due and payable even if the record which was 
requested cannot be located after all reasonable efforts have been made, 
or if the FOI Officer determines that a record which has been requested 
is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act as amended and is to be 
withheld.
    (e) Payment shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank 
draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. 
Checks shall be made payable to General Services Administration. You 
should mail or deliver any payment for services to the Administrative 
Office, Council on Environmental Quality, 722 Jackson Place NW., 
Washington, DC 20006.
    (f) A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request. Refunds of 
fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.
    (g) The Council may waive all or part of any fee provided for in 
this section when the Freedom of Information Officer (or designee) deems 
it to be in either the Council's interest or in the general public's 
interest.

Sec. 1517.1  Policy and scope.

    Consistent with the policy that the public is entitled to the 
fullest information regarding the decisionmaking processes of the 
Federal Government, it is the purpose of this part to open

[[Page 311]]

the meetings of the Council on Environmental Quality to public 
observation while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability 
of the Council to carry out its primary responsibility of providing 
advice to the President. Actions taken by the Chairman acting as 
Director of the Office of Environmental Quality and Council actions 
involving advice to the President when such advice is not formulated 
collegially during a meeting are outside the scope of this part. In 
addition to conducting the meetings required by this part, it is the 
Council's policy to conduct, open to public observation, periodic 
meetings involving Council discussions of Council business, including 
where appropriate, matters outside the scope of this part. This part 
does not affect the procedures set forth in part 1515 pursuant to which 
records of the Council are made available to the public for inspection 
and copying, except that the exemptions set forth in Sec. 1517.4(a) 
shall govern in the case of any request made to copy or inspect the 
transcripts, recording or minutes described in Sec. 1517.7.

[47 FR 6277, Feb. 11, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1517.2  Definitions.

established under title II of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 through 4347).
    (b) The term meeting means the deliberations of at least two Council 
members where such deliberations determine or result in the joint 
conduct or disposition of official collegial Council business, but does 
not include deliberations to take actions to open or close a meeting 
under Secs. 1517.4 and 1517.5 or to release or withhold information 
under Secs. 1517.4 and 1517.7. ``Meeting'' shall not be construed to 
prevent Council members from considering individually Council business 
that is circulated to them sequentially in writing.
    (c) Director means the Chairman of the Council on Environmental 
Quality acting as the head of the Office of Environmental Quality 
pursuant to the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, Pub. L.

[44 FR 34946, June 18, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 6277, Feb. 11, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1517.3  Open meeting requirement.

    (a) Every portion of every meeting of the Council is open to public 
observation subject to the exemptions provided in Sec. 1517.4. Members 
of the Council may not jointly conduct or dispose of the business of the 
Council other than in accordance with this part.
    (b) The Council will conduct open to public observation periodic 
meetings involving Council discussions of Council business including 
where appropriate matters outside the scope of this part. Such meetings 
will be noticed pursuant to Sec. 1517.6.
    (c) Members of the public may attend open meetings of the Council 
for the sole purpose of observation and may not participate in or 
photograph any meeting without prior permission of the Council. Members 
of the public who desire to participate in or photograph an open meeting 
of the Council may request permission to do so from the General Counsel 
of the Council before such meeting. Members of the public may record 
open meetings of the Council by means of any mechanical or electronic 
device unless the Council determines such recording would disrupt the 
orderly conduct of such meeting.

[44 FR 34946, June 18, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 6277, Feb. 11, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1517.4   Exceptions.

    (a) A meeting or portion thereof may be closed to public 
observation, and information pertaining to such meeting or portion 
thereof may be withheld from the public, if the Council determines that 
such meeting or portion thereof or disclosure of such information is 
likely to:
    (1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under 
criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the 
interest of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) in fact properly 
classified pursuant to that Executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Council;

[[Page 312]]

    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552), 
provided that the statute: (i) Requires that the matters be withheld 
from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, 
or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Disclose the trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature if disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of those records or 
information would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source,
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or,
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed action of 
the Council. This exception shall not apply in any instance where the 
Council has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of the 
proposed action, or where the Council is required by law to make such 
disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final action on the 
proposal; or
    (10) Specifically concern the issuance of a subpoena by the Council, 
or the participation of the Council in a civil action or proceeding, an 
action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, 
or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Council of a 
particular case of formal adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 
U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after 
opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Before a meeting is closed to public observation the Council 
shall determine whether or not the public interest requires that the 
meeting be open. The Council may open a meeting to public observation 
which could be closed under paragraph (a) of this section, if the 
Council finds it to be in the public interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 1517.5   Procedure for closing meetings.

    (a) A majority of the entire membership of the Council may vote to 
close to public observation a meeting or a portion or portions thereof, 
or to withhold information pertaining to such meeting. A separate vote 
of the members of the Council shall be taken with respect to each 
meeting of the Council, a portion or portions of which are proposed to 
be closed to the observation of the public or with respect to any 
information concerning such meetings or portion thereof. A single vote 
may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions 
of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to 
information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting 
in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to 
be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such 
series. The vote of each member of the Council participating in a vote 
shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.
    (b) Whenever any person whose interest may be directly affected by a 
portion of a meeting requests that the

[[Page 313]]

Council close that portion to public observation for any of the reasons 
referred to in Sec. 1517.4(a) the Council, upon request of any of the 
members of the Council, shall decide by recorded vote whether to close 
that portion of the meeting.
    (c) For every meeting or portion thereof closed under this part, the 
General Counsel of the Council before such meeting is closed shall 
publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may properly 
be closed to the public stating each relevant exemptive provision. The 
Council shall retain a copy of the General Counsel's certification, 
together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting 
setting forth the time and place of the meeting and listing the persons 
present.
    (d) Within one day of any vote taken on a proposal to close a 
meeting, the Council shall make publicly available a record reflecting 
the vote of each member on the question. In addition, within one day of 
any vote which closes a portion or portions of a meeting to the public, 
the Council shall make publicly available a full written explanation of 
its closure action together with a list naming all persons expected to 
attend and identifying their affiliation, unless such disclosure would 
reveal the information that the meeting itself was closed to protect.
    (e) Following any announcement that the Council intends to close a 
meeting or portion thereof, any person may make a request that the 
meeting or portion thereof be opened. Such request shall be made of the 
Chairman of the Council who shall ensure that the request is circulated 
to all members of the Council on the same business day on which it is 
received. The request shall set forth the reasons why the requestor 
believes the meeting should be open. The Council upon the request of any 
member or its General Counsel, shall vote on the request.


<R05>
Sec. 1517.6   Notice of meetings.

    (2) Whether the meeting is to be open or closed; and
    (3) Name and telephone number of the official who will respond to 
requests for information about the meeting.
    (b) A majority of the members of the Council may determine by 
recorded vote that the business of the Council requires a meeting to be 
called with less than one week's notice. At the earliest practicable 
time, the Council shall publicly announce the time, place and subject 
matter of the meeting, and whether or not it is to be open or closed to 
the public.
    (c) If announcement of the subject matter of a closed meeting would 
reveal the information that the meeting itself was closed to protect, 
the subject matter shall not be announced.
    (d) Following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section:
    (1) A majority of the members of the Council may change the time or 
place of a meeting. At the earliest practicable time, the Council shall 
publicly announce the change.
    (2) A majority of the entire membership of the Council may change 
the subject matter of a meeting, or the determination to open or close a 
meeting to the public, if it determines by a recorded vote that the 
change is required by the business of the Council and that no earlier 
announcement of the change was possible. At the earliest practicable 
time, the Council shall publicly announce the change, and the vote of 
each member upon the change.
    (e) Individuals or organizations having a special interest in 
activities of the Council may request the Council to place them on a 
mailing list for receipt of information available under this section.
    (f) Following public announcement of a meeting, the time or place of 
a meeting may be changed only if the change is announced publicly at the 
earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting or the 
determination to open or close a meeting may be changed following public 
announcement of a meeting only if both of the following conditions are 
met:

[[Page 314]]

    (1) There must be a recorded vote of a majority of the Council that 
the business of the Council requires the change and that no earlier 
announcement of such change was possible; and
    (2) There must be a public announcement of the change and of the 
individual Council members' votes at the earliest practicable time.
    (g) Immediately following each public announcement required by this 
section, the following information, as applicable, shall be submitted 
for publication in the Federal Register.
    (1) Notice of the time, place, and subject matter of a meeting;
    (2) Whether the meeting is open or closed;
    (3) Any change in one of the preceding; and
    (4) The name and telephone number of the official who will respond 
to requests for information about the meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 1517.7   Records of closed meetings.

    (a) A record of each meeting or portion thereof which is closed to 
the public shall be made and retained for two years or for one year 
after the conclusion of any Council proceeding involved in the meeting 
whichever occurs later. The record of any portion of a meeting closed to 
the public shall be a verbatim transcript or electronic recording. In 
lieu of a transcript or recording, a comprehensive set of minutes may be 
produced if the closure decision was made pursuant to Sec. 1517.4(a) (8) 
or (10).
    (b) If minutes are produced, such minutes shall fully and clearly 
describe all matters discussed, provide a full and accurate summary of 
any actions taken and the reasons expressed therefor, and include a 
description of each of the views expressed on any item. The minutes 
shall also reflect the vote of each member of the Council on any roll 
call vote taken during the proceedings and identify all documents 
produced at the meeting.
    (c) The following documents shall be retained by the Council as part 
of the transcript, recording, or minutes of the meeting:
    (1) Certification by the General Counsel that the meeting may 
properly be closed; and
    (2) Statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting

offices at 722 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC the transcript, 
electronic recording, or minutes maintained as a record of a closed 
meeting, except for such information as may be withheld under one of the 
provisions of Sec. 1517.5. Copies of such transcript, minutes, or 
transcription of an electronic recording, disclosing the identity of 
each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of 
duplication or transcription.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Requests to review or obtain copies of records other than 
transcripts, electronic recordings or minutes of a meeting will be 
processed under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or, where 
applicable, the Privacy Act of 1974. (5 U.S.C. 552a). Nothing in these 
regulations authorizes the Council to withhold from any individual any 
record, including the transcripts or electronic recordings described in 
Sec. 1517.8, to which the individual may have access under the Privacy 
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).
