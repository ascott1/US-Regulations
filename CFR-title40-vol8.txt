                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

[50 FR 46290, Nov. 7, 1985, as amended at 51 FR 7715 and 7719, Mar. 5, 
1986; 51 FR 11022, Apr. 1, 1986; 52 FR 37617, Oct. 8, 1987; 59 FR 12429, 
Mar. 16, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 61.02  Definitions.

    The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this 
section as follows:
    Act means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency or his authorized representative.
    Alternative method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an 
air pollutant which is not a reference method but which has been 
demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to produce results 
adequate for the Administrator's determination of compliance.
    Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the 
Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or 
a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V 
of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
    Capital expenditure means an expenditure for a physical or 
operational change to a stationary source which exceeds the product of 
the applicable ``annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage'' 
specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Publication 534 and the stationary source's basis, as defined by section 
1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a 
physical or operational change to a stationary source must not be 
reduced by any ``excluded additions'' as defined for stationary sources 
constructed after December 31, 1981, in IRS Publication 534, as would be 
done for tax purposes. In addition, ``annual asset guideline repair 
allowance'' may be used even though it is excluded for tax purposes in 
IRS Publication 534.
    Commenced means, with respect to the definition of ``new source'' in 
section 111(a)(2) of the Act, that an owner or operator has undertaken a 
continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or 
operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and 
complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction 
or modification.
    Compliance schedule means the date or dates by which a source or 
category of sources is required to comply with the standards of this 
part and with any steps toward such compliance which are set forth in a 
waiver of compliance under Sec. 61.11.
    Construction means fabrication, erection, or installation of an 
affected facility.
    Effective date is the date of promulgation in the Federal Register 
of an applicable standard or other regulation under this part.
    Existing source means any stationary source which is not a new 
source.
    Force majeure means, for purposes of Sec. 61.13, an event that will 
be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the 
affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying 
with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the 
specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to 
fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts 
of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the 
control of the affected facility.
    Issuance of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the 
permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of 
this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the 
EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a title V permit occurs 
immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit.
    Monitoring system means any system, required under the monitoring 
sections in applicable subparts, used to sample and condition (if 
applicable), to analyze, and to provide a record of emissions or process 
parameters.
    New source means any stationary source, the construction or 
modification of which is commenced after the publication in the Federal 
Register

[[Page 10]]

of proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 
which will be applicable to such source.
    Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, 
controls, or supervises a stationary source.
    Part 70 permit means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant 
to part 70 of this chapter.
    Permit program means a comprehensive State operating permit system 
established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and 
regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State 
regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system 
established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in 
this chapter.
    Permitting authority means:
    (1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other 
State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry 
out a permit program under part 70 of this chapter; or
    (2) The Administrator, in the case of EPA-implemented permit 
programs under title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
    Reference method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an 
air pollutant, as described in appendix B to this part.
    Run means the net period of time during which an emission sample is 
collected. Unless otherwise specified, a run may be either intermittent 
or continuous within the limits of good engineering practice.
    Standard means a national emission standard including a design, 
equipment, work practice or operational standard for a hazardous air 
pollutant proposed or promulgated under this part.
    Startup means the setting in operation of a stationary source for 
any purpose.
    State means all non-Federal authorities, including local agencies, 
interstate associations, and State-wide programs, that have delegated 
authority to implement:
    (1) The provisions of this part; and/or
    (2) The permit program established under part 70 of this chapter. 
The term State shall have its conventional meaning where clear from the 
context.
    Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or 
installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant which has been 
designated as hazardous by the Administrator.
    Title V permit means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant 
to Federal or State regulations established to implement title V of the 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7661). A title V permit issued by a State permitting 
authority is called a part 70 permit in this part.

    (c) Any change in the information provided under paragraph (a) of 
this section or Sec. 61.07(b) shall be provided to the Administrator 
within 30 days after the change. However, if any change will result from 
modification of the source, Sec. Sec. 61.07(c) and 61.08 apply.
    (d) A possible format for reporting under this section is included 
as appendix A of this part. Advice on reporting the status of compliance 
may be obtained from the Administrator.
    (e) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days 
shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word ``calendar'' is 
absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
    (f) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline 
is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a 
notification, application, report, or other written communication to the 
Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or 
before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For 
example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular 
event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked 
on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification 
must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the 
notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days following the end 
of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that 
provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be 
submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the 
U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery agreed to by the 
permitting authority, is acceptable.
    (g) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in 
this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an 
owner or operator, or the review of such information by the 
Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. 
Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (h) If an owner or operator of a stationary source in a State with 
delegated authority is required to submit reports under this part to the 
State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission 
of reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) 
specified for such source under this part, the owner or operator may 
change the dates by which reports under this part shall be submitted 
(without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the 
State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and 
the State. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State 
beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with 
the applicable subpart in this part. Procedures governing the 
implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this 
section.
    (i) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary 
sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set 
under part 60, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may 
arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the 
Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common 
schedule on which reports required by each applicable standard shall be 
submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence 
applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to 
be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part, or 1 year 
after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable 
part 60 or part 63 standard,

[[Page 33]]

whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this 
provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (j)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline 
has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (j)(2) and 
(j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source 
remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
    (ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for 
in paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section each time he or she 
wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline 
specified in this part.
    (2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in 
this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an 
owner or operator, or the review of such information by the 
Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner 
or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark 
deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in 
writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required 
to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request 
whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the 
Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
    (3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's 
request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark 
deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. 
The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of 
approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 
calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the 
request.
    (4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he 
or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and 
inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.

<R05>
Sec. 61.11  Waiver of compliance.

    (a) Based on the information provided in any request under Sec. 
61.10, or other information, the Administrator may grant a waiver of 
compliance with a standard for a period not exceeding 2 years after the 
effective date of the standard.
    (b) The waiver will be in writing and will--
    (1) Identify the stationary source covered;
    (2) Specify the termination date of the waiver;
    (3) Specify dates by which steps toward compliance are to be taken; 
and
    (4) Specify any additional conditions which the Administrator 
determines necessary to assure installation of the necessary controls 
within the waiver period and to assure protection of the health of 
persons during the waiver period.
    (c) The Administrator may terminate the waiver at an earlier date 
than specified if any specification under paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) 
of this section are not met.
    (d) Before denying any request for a waiver, the Administrator will 
notify the owner or operator making the request of the Administrator's 
intention to issue the denial, together with--
    (1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended 
denial is based; and
    (2) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, 
within the time limit the Administrator specifies, additional 
information or arguments to the Administrator before final action on the 
request.
    (e) A final determination to deny any request for a waiver will be 
in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial 
is based. The final determination will be made within 60 days after 
presentation of additional information or argument; or within 60 days 
after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation 
is made.
    (f) The granting of a waiver under this section shall not abrogate 
the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.

Sec. 61.12  Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.

    (a) Compliance with numerical emission limits shall be determined in 
accordance with emission tests established in Sec. 61.13 or as 
otherwise specified in an individual subpart.
    (b) Compliance with design, equipment, work practice or operational 
standards shall be determined as specified in an individual subpart.
    (c) The owner or operator of each stationary source shall maintain 
and operate the source, including associated equipment for air pollution 
control, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice 
for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating 
and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information 
available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, 
monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and 
inspection of the source.
    (d)(1) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of a pollutant 
from a source at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of that 
pollutant from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work 
practice or operational standard, the Administrator will publish in the 
Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means 
for purposes of compliance with the standard. The notice will restrict 
the permission to the source(s) or category(ies) of sources on which the 
alternative means will achieve equivalent emission reductions. The 
notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation 
and maintenance of the alternative means.
    (2) Any notice under paragraph (d)(1) shall be published only after 
notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (3) Any person seeking permission under this subsection shall, 
unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, submit a proposed 
test plan or the results of testing and monitoring, a description of the 
procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of 
pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.
    (e) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications or 
establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of 
any standard in this part, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, 
including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, 
relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with 
applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance 
test had been performed.

Sec. 61.13  Emission tests and waiver of emission tests.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and 
(a)(6) of this section, if required to do emission testing by an 
applicable subpart and unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained 
under this section, the owner or operator shall test emissions from the 
source:
    (1) Within 90 days after the effective date, for an existing source 
or a new source which has an initial startup date before the effective 
date.
    (2) Within 90 days after initial startup, for a new source which has 
an initial startup date after the effective date.
    (3) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred 
for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of 
force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in 
writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator 
first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event 
may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or beyond a 
deadline established pursuant to the requirements under paragraph (b) of 
this section, but the notification must occur before the performance 
test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force 
majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification 
shall occur as soon as practicable.
    (4) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a 
written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for 
attributing the

[[Page 35]]

delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; 
describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and 
identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the 
performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as 
practicable after the force majeure occurs.
    (5) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the 
performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the 
Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in 
writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as 
soon as practicable.
    (6) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been 
approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and 
(a)(5) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility 
remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
    (b) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to test 
emissions from the source at any other time when the action is 
authorized by section 114 of the Act.
    (c) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the 
emission test at least 30 days before the emission test to allow the 
Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the 
test.
    (d) If required to do emission testing, the owner or operator of 
each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or 
operator of each existing source shall provide emission testing 
facilities as follows:
    (1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to each 
source.
    (2) Safe sampling platform(s).
    (3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
    (4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
    (5) Any other facilities that the Administrator needs to safely and 
properly test a source.
    (e) Each emission test shall be conducted under such conditions as 
the Administrator shall specify based on design and operational 
characteristics of the source.
    (f) Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart, samples 
shall be analyzed and emissions determined within 30 days after each 
emission test has been completed. The owner or operator shall report the 
determinations of the emission test to the Administrator by a registered 
letter sent before the close of business on the 31st day following the 
completion of the emission test.
    (g) The owner or operator shall retain at the source and make 
available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a 
minimum of 2 years, records of emission test results and other data 
needed to determine emissions.
    (h)(1) Emission tests shall be conducted as set forth in this 
section, the applicable subpart and appendix B unless the 
Administrator--
    (i) Specifies or approves the use of a reference method with minor 
changes in methodology; or
    (ii) Approves the use of an alternative method; or
    (iii) Waives the requirement for emission testing because the owner 
or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the source is in compliance with the 
standard.
    (2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the 
results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a 
reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative 
methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method 
prevail.
    (3) The owner or operator may request approval for the use of an 
alternative method at any time, except--
    (i) For an existing source or a new source that had an initial 
startup before the effective date, any request for use of an alternative 
method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the 
Administrator within 30 days after the effective date, or with the 
request for a waiver of compliance if one is submitted under Sec. 
60.10(b); or
    (ii) For a new source that has an initial startup after the 
effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the 
initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator no later 
than with the notification of anticipated startup required under Sec. 
60.09.

[[Page 36]]

    (i)(1) Emission tests may be waived upon written application to the 
Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting 
the standard, or the source is being operated under a waiver or 
compliance, or the owner or operator has requested a waiver of 
compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
    (2) If application for waiver of the emission test is made, the 
application shall accompany the information required by Sec. 61.10 or 
the notification of startup required by Sec. 61.09, whichever is 
applicable. A possible format is contained in appendix A to this part.
    (3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not 
abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way 
prohibit the Administrator from later cancelling the waiver. The 
cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or 
operator of the source.

Sec. 61.14  Monitoring requirements.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified, this section applies to each 
monitoring system required under each subpart which requires monitoring.
    (b) Each owner or operator shall maintain and operate each 
monitoring system as specified in the applicable subpart and in a manner 
consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing 
emissions. Any unavoidable breakdown or malfunction of the monitoring 
system should be repaired or adjusted as soon as practicable after its 
occurrence. The Administrator's determination of whether acceptable 
operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on 
information which may include, but not be limited to, review of 
operating and maintenance procedures, manufacturer recommendations and 
specifications, and inspection of the monitoring system.
    (c) When required by the applicable subpart, and at any other time 
the Administrator may require, the owner or operator of a source being 
monitored shall conduct a performance evaluation of the monitoring 
system and furnish the Administrator with a copy of a written report of 
the results within 60 days of the evaluation. Such a performance 
evaluation shall be conducted according to the applicable specifications 
and procedures described in the applicable subpart. The owner or 
operator of the source shall furnish the Administrator with written 
notification of the date of the performance evaluation at least 30 days 
before the evaluation is to begin.
    (d) When the effluents from a single source, or from two or more 
sources subject to the same emission standards, are combined before 
being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall install a 
monitoring system on each effluent or on the combined effluent. If two 
or more sources are not subject to the same emission standards, the 
owner or operator shall install a separate monitoring system on each 
effluent, unless otherwise specified. If the applicable standard is a 
mass emission standard and the effluent from one source is released to 
the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator shall 
install a monitoring system at each emission point unless the 
installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator.
    (e) The owner or operator of each monitoring system shall reduce the 
monitoring data as specified in each applicable subpart. Monitoring data 
recorded during periods of unavoidable monitoring system breakdowns, 
repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments shall not be 
included in any data average.
    (f) The owner or operator shall maintain records of monitoring data, 
monitoring system calibration checks, and the occurrence and duration of 
any period during which the monitoring system is malfunctioning or 
inoperative. These records shall be maintained at the source for a 
minimum of 2 years and made available, upon request, for inspection by 
the Administrator.
    (g)(1) Monitoring shall be conducted as set forth in this section 
and the applicable subpart unless the Administrator--
    (i) Specifies or approves the use of the specified monitoring 
requirements and procedures with minor changes in methodology; or

[[Page 37]]

    (ii) Approves the use of alternatives to any monitoring requirements 
or procedures.
    (2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the 
results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator 
may require the monitoring requirements and procedures specified in this 
part.

Sec. 61.15  Modification.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, any 
physical or operational change to a stationary source which results in 
an increase in the rate of emission to the atmosphere of a hazardous 
pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a 
modification.
    (b) Upon modification, an existing source shall become a new source 
for each hazardous pollutant for which the rate of emission to the 
atmosphere increases and to which a standard applies.
    (c) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any hazardous 
pollutant discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is 
applicable. The Administrator shall use the following to determine the 
emission rate:
    (1) Emission factors as specified in the background information 
document (BID) for the applicable standard, or in the latest issue of 
``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,'' EPA Publication No. 
AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be 
superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where use of emission 
factors demonstrates that the emission rate will clearly increase or 
clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change.
    (2) Material balances, monitoring data, or manual emission tests in 
cases where use of emission factors, as referenced in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, does not demonstrate to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not 
increase as a result of the physical or operational change, or where an 
interested person demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
there are reasonable grounds to dispute the result obtained by the 
Administrator using emission factors. When the emission rate is based on 
results from manual emission tests or monitoring data, the procedures 
specified in appendix C of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine 
whether an increase in emission rate has occurred. Tests shall be 
conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to 
the owner or operator. At least three test runs must be conducted before 
and at least three after the physical or operational change. If the 
Administrator approves, the results of the emission tests required in 
Sec. 61.13(a) may be used for the test runs to be conducted before the 
physical or operational change. All operating parameters which may 
affect emissions must be held constant to the maximum degree feasible 
for all test runs.
    (d) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered 
modifications under this part:
    (1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator 
determines to be routine for a source category.
    (2) An increase in production rate of a stationary source, if that 
increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on the 
stationary source.
    (3) An increase in the hours of operation.
    (4) Any conversion to coal that meets the requirements specified in 
section 111(a)(8) of the Act.
    (5) The relocation or change in ownership of a stationary source. 
However, such activities must be reported in accordance with Sec. 
61.10(c).

the Administrator demonstrates that the future ambient concentrations of 
beryllium in the vicinity of the stationary source will not exceed 0.01 
[micro]g/m \3\ (4.37x10<SUP>-6</SUP> gr/ft \3\), averaged over a 30-day 
period. Such 3-year period shall be the 3 years ending 30 days before 
the effective date of this standard.
    (ii) The owner or operator requests such approval in writing within 
30 days after the effective date of this standard.
    (iii) The owner or operator submits a report to the Administrator 
within 45 days after the effective date of this standard which report

Sec. 61.33  Stack sampling.

    (a) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under Sec. 
61.13, each owner or operator required to comply with Sec. 61.32(a) 
shall test emissions from the source according to Method 104 of appendix 
B to this part. Method 103 of appendix B to this part is approved by the 
Administrator as an alternative method for sources subject to Sec. 
61.32(a). The emission test shall be performed--
    (1) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing 
source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the 
effective date; or

not have an initial startup date preceding the effective date.
    (b) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an 
emission test so that he may at his option observe the test.
    (c) Samples shall be taken over such a period or periods as are 
necessary to accurately determine the maximum emissions which will occur 
in any 24-hour period. Where emissions depend upon the relative 
frequency of operation of different types of processes, operating hours, 
operating capacities, or other factors, the calculation of maximum 24-
hour-period emissions will be based on that combination of factors which 
is likely to occur during the subject period and which result in the 
maximum emissions. No changes in the operation shall be made, which 
would potentially increase emissions above that determined by the most 
recent source test, until a new emission level has been estimated by 
calculation and the results reported to the Administrator.
    (d) All samples shall be analyzed and beryllium emissions shall be 
determined within 30 days after the source test. All determinations 
shall be reported to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched 
before the close of the next business day following such determination.
    (e) Records of emission test results and other data needed to 
determine total emissions shall be retained at the source and made 
available, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 
years.

    (ii) When the maximum hourly value of the temperature measured in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section is below the 
reference temperature recorded according to paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section for three consecutive regeneration cycles, the Administrator is 
to be notified within the next 10 days.
    (7) Semiannual reports shall be submitted to the Administrator 
indicating the time and date on which the hourly value of each parameter 
monitored according to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) of this 
section fell outside the value of that same parameter determined under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and corrective action taken, and the 
time and date of the corrective action. Parameter excursions will be 
considered unacceptable operation and maintenance of the emission 
control system. In addition, while compliance with the emission limits 
is determined primarily by conducting a performance test according to 
the procedures in Sec. 61.53(b), reports of parameter excursions may be 
used as evidence in judging the duration of a violation that is 
determined by a performance test.
    (8) Semiannual reports required in paragraph (b)(7) of this section 
shall be submitted to the Administrator on September 15 and March 15 of 
each year. The first semiannual report is to be submitted following the 
first full 6 month reporting period. The semiannual report due on 
September 15 (March 15) shall include all excursions monitored through 
August 31 (February 28) of the same calendar year.
    (c) As an alternative to the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) through (8) of this section, 
an owner or operator may develop and submit for the Administrator's 
review and approval a plant-specific monitoring plan. To be approved, 
such a plan must ensure not only compliance with the emission limits of 
Sec. 61.52(a) but also proper operation and maintenance of emissions 
control systems. Any site-specific monitoring plan submitted must, at a 
minimum, include the following:
    (1) Identification of the critical parameter or parameters for the 
hydrogen stream and for the end-box ventilation stream that are to be 
monitored and an explanation of why the critical parameter(s) selected 
is the best indicator of proper control system performance and of 
mercury emission rates.
    (2) Identification of the maximum or minimum value of each parameter 
(e.g., degrees temperature, concentration of mercury) that is not to be 
exceeded. The level(s) is to be directly correlated to the results of a 
performance test, conducted no more than 180 days prior to submittal of 
the plan, when the facility was in compliance with the emission limits 
of Sec. 61.52(a).
    (3) Designation of the frequency for recording the parameter 
measurements, with justification if the frequency is less than hourly. A 
longer recording frequency must be justified on the basis of the amount 
of time that could elapse during periods of process or control system 
upsets before the emission limits would be exceeded, and consideration 
is to be given to the time that would be necessary to repair the 
failure.
    (4) Designation of the immediate actions to be taken in the event of 
an excursion beyond the value of the parameter established in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (5) Provisions for reporting, semiannually, parameter excursions and 
the corrective actions taken, and provisions for reporting within 10 
days any significant excursion.
    (6) Identification of the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) or of 
the readings obtained.
    (7) Recordkeeping requirements for certifications and calibrations.
    (d) Mercury cell chlor-alkali plants--cell room ventilation system. 
(1) Stationary sources determining cell room emissions in accordance 
with Sec. 61.53(c)(4) shall maintain daily records of all leaks or 
spills of mercury. The records shall indicate the amount, location, 
time, and date the leaks or spills occurred, identify the cause of the 
leak or spill, state the immediate

[[Page 50]]

steps taken to minimize mercury emissions and steps taken to prevent 
future occurrences, and provide the time and date on which corrective 
steps were taken.
    (2) The results of monitoring shall be recorded, retained at the 
source, and made available for inspection by the Administrator for a 
minimum of 2 years.

Sec. 61.65  Emission standard for ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride
and polyvinyl chloride plants.

    An owner or operator of an ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride, and/
or polyvinyl chloride plant shall comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (a) Relief valve discharge (RVD). Except for an emergency relief 
discharge, and except as provided in Sec. 61.65(d), there is to be no 
discharge to the atmosphere from any relief valve on any equipment in 
vinyl chloride service. An emergency relief discharge means a discharge 
which could not have been avoided by taking measures to prevent the 
discharge. Within 10 days of any relief valve discharge, except for 
those subject to Sec. 61.65(d), the owner or operator of the source 
from which the relief valve discharge occurs shall submit to the 
Administrator a report in writing containing information on the source, 
nature and cause of the discharge, the date and time of the discharge, 
the approximate total vinyl chloride loss during the discharge, the 
method used for determining the vinyl chloride loss (the calculation of 
the vinyl chloride loss), the action that was taken to prevent the 
discharge, and measures adopted to prevent future discharges.
    (b) Fugitive emission sources--(1) Loading and unloading lines. 
Vinyl chloride emissions from loading and unloading lines in vinyl 
chloride service which are opened to the atmosphere after each loading 
or unloading operation are to be minimized as follows:
    (i) After each loading or unloading operation and before opening a 
loading or unloading line to the atmosphere, the quantity of vinyl 
chloride in all parts of each loading or unloading line that are to be 
opened to the atmosphere is to be reduced so that the parts combined 
contain no greater than 0.0038 m \3\ (0.13 ft \3\) of vinyl chloride, at 
standard temperature and pressure; and
    (ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from a loading or unloading line in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is to be ducted 
through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride 
in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period), 
or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66.
    (2) Slip gauges. During loading or unloading operations, the vinyl 
chloride emissions from each slip gauge in vinyl chloride service are to 
be minimized by ducting any vinyl chloride discharged from the slip 
gauge through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl 
chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour 
period), or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66.
    (3) Leakage from pump, compressor, and agitator seals:
    (i) Rotating pumps. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all 
rotating pumps in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by 
installing sealless pumps, pumps with double mechanical seals or 
equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66. If double mechanical seals are 
used, vinyl chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by 
maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any leak that 
occurs is into the pump; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two 
seals through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl 
chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as 
provided in Sec. 61.66. Compliance

[[Page 55]]

with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance 
with the provisions of this paragraph.
    (ii) Reciprocating pumps. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all 
reciprocating pumps in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by 
installing double outboard seals, or equivalent as provided in Sec. 
61.66. If double outboard seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from 
the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the 
two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the pump; by ducting any 
vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control system from which 
the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 
10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66. Compliance with the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance with the 
provisions of this paragraph.
    (iii) Rotating compressor. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on 
all rotating compressors in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized 
by installing compressors with double mechanical seals, or equivalent as 
provided in Sec. 61.66. If double mechanical seals are used, vinyl 
chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the 
pressure between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the 
compressor; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through 
a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the 
exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in Sec. 
61.66. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V 
demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
    (iv) Reciprocating compressors. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals 
on all reciprocating compressors in vinyl chloride service are to be 
minimized by installing double outboard seals, or equivalent as provided 
in Sec. 61.66. If double outboard seals are used, vinyl chloride 
emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure 
between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the 
compressor; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through 
a control system from which concentration of vinyl chloride in the 
exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in Sec. 
61.66. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V 
demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
    (v) Agitator. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all agitators 
in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by installing agitators 
with double mechanical seals, or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66. 
If double mechanical seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from the 
seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two 
seals so that any leak that occurs is into the agitated vessel; by 
ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control 
system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust 
gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66.
    (4) Leaks from relief valves. Vinyl chloride emissions due to leaks 
from each relief valve on equipment in vinyl chloride service shall 
comply with Sec. 61.242-4 of subpart V of this part.
    (5) Manual venting of gases. Except as provided in Sec. 
61.64(a)(3), all gases which are manually vented from equipment in vinly 
chloride service are to be ducted through a control system from which 
the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 
10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided in Sec. 
61.66.
    (6) Opening of equipment. Vinyl chloride emissions from opening of 
equipment (excluding crude, intermediate, and final EDC storage tanks, 
but including prepolymerization reactors used in the manufacture of bulk 
resins and loading or unloading lines that are not opened to the 
atmosphere after each loading or unloading operation) are to be 
minimized follows:
    (i) Before opening any equipment for any reason, the quantity of 
vinyl chloride which is contained therein is to be reduced to an amount 
which occupies a volume of no more than 2.0 percent of the equipment's 
containment volume or 0.0950 cubic meters (25 gallons), whichever is 
larger, at standard temperature and pressure.
    (ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from the equipment in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section is to be ducted through a 
control system

[[Page 56]]

from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does 
not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided 
in Sec. 61.66.
    (7) Samples. Unused portions of samples containing at least 10 
percent by weight vinyl chloride are to be returned to the process or 
destroyed in a control device from which concentration of vinyl chloride 
in the exhaust gas does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period) or 
equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66. Sampling techniques are to be 
such that sample containers in vinyl chloride service are purged into a 
closed process system. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 
subpart V demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
    (8) Leak detection and elimination. Vinyl chloride emissions due to 
leaks from equipment in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized as 
follows:
    (i) A reliable and accurate vinyl chloride monitoring system shall 
be operated for detection of major leaks and identification of the 
general area of the plant where a leak is located. A vinyl chloride 
monitoring system means a device which obtains air samples from one or 
more points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples 
with gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all 
hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared 
spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an equivalent or alternative 
method. The vinyl chloride monitoring system shall be operated according 
to a program developed by the plant owner or operator. The owner or 
operator shall submit a description of the program to the Administrator 
within 45 days of the effective date of these regulations, unless a 
waiver of compliance is granted under Sec. 61.11, or the program has 
been approved and the Administrator does not request a review of the 
program. Approval of a program will be granted by the Administrator 
provided he finds:
    (A) The location and number of points to be monitored and the 
frequency of monitoring provided for in the program are acceptable when 
they are compared with the number of pieces of equipment in vinyl 
chloride service and size and physical layout of the plant.
    (B) It contains a definition of leak which is acceptable when 
compared with the background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the 
areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring 
system. Measurements of background concentrations of vinyl chloride in 
the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring 
system are to be included with the description of the program. The 
definition of leak for a given plant may vary among the different areas 
within the plant and is also to change over time as background 
concentrations in the plant are reduced.
    (C) It contains an acceptable plan of action to be taken when a leak 
is detected.
    (D) It provides for an acceptable calibration and maintenance 
schedule for the vinyl chloride monitoring system and portable 
hydrocarbon detector. For the vinyl chloride monitoring system, a daily 
span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride 
equal to the concentration defined as a leak according to paragraph 
(b)(8)(i)(B) of this section. The calibration is to be done with either:
    (1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in 
sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with section 
10.1 of Method 106, or
    (2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate 
concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration 
gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The 
manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each 
cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas 
cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and 
recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder 
before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas 
chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas 
mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration 
curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The 
requirements in

[[Page 57]]

Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for certification of cylinder 
standards and for establishment and verification of calibration 
standards are to be followed.
    (ii) For each process unit subject to this subpart, a formal leak 
detection and repair program shall be implemented consistent with 
subpart V of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of 
this section. This program is to be implemented within 90 days of the 
effective date of these regulations, unless a waiver of compliance is 
granted under Sec. 61.11. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(E) 
of this section, an owner or operator shall be exempt from Sec. 61.242-
1(d), Sec. 61.242-7 (a), (b), and (c), Sec. 61.246, and Sec. 61.247 
of subpart V of this part for any process unit in which the percentage 
of leaking valves is demonstrated to be less than 2.0 percent, as 
determined in accordance with the following:
    (A) A performance test as specified in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) of 
this section shall be conducted initially within 90 days of the 
effective date of these regulations, annually, and at times requested by 
the Administrator.
    (B) For each performance test, a minimum of 200 or 90 percent, 
whichever is less, of the total valves in VOC service (as defined in 
Sec. 60.481 of subpart VV of part 60) within the process unit shall be 
randomly selected and monitored within 1 week by the methods specified 
in Sec. 61.245(b) of this part. If an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm 
or greater is measured, a leak is detected. The leak percentage shall be 
determined by dividing the number of valves in VOC service for which 
leaks are detected by the number of tested valves in VOC service.
    (C) If a leak is detected, it shall be repaired in accordance with 
Sec. 61.242-7 (d) and (e) of subpart V of this part.
    (D) The results of the performance test shall be submitted in 
writing to the Administrator in the first quarterly report following the 
performance test as part of the reporting requirements of Sec. 61.70.
    (E) Any process unit in which the percentage of leaking valves is 
found to be greater than 2.0 percent according to the performance test 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) of this section must comply with 
all provisions of subpart V of this part within 90 days.
    (iii) Open-ended valves or lines located on multiple service process 
lines which operate in vinyl chloride service less than 10 percent of 
the time are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 61.242-6 of subpart 
V, provided the open-ended valves or lines are addressed in the 
monitoring system required by paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section. The 
Administrator may apply this exemption to other existing open-ended 
valves or lines that are demonstrated to require significant retrofit 
cost to comply with the requirements of Sec. 61.242-6 of subpart V.
    (9) Inprocess wastewater. Vinyl chloride emissions to the atmosphere 
from inprocess wastewater are to be reduced as follows:
    (i) The concentration of vinyl chloride in each inprocess wastewater 
stream containing greater than 10 ppm vinyl chloride measured 
immediately as it leaves a piece of equipment and before being mixed 
with any other inprocess wastewater stream is to be reduced to no more 
than 10 ppm by weight before being mixed with any other inprocess 
wastewater stream which contains less than 10 ppm vinyl chloride; before 
being exposed to the atmosphere; before being discharged to a wastewater 
treatment process; or before being discharged untreated as a wastewater. 
This paragraph does apply to water which is used to displace vinyl 
chloride from equipment before it is opened to the atmosphere in 
accordance with Sec. 61.64(a)(2) or paragraph (b)(6) of this section, 
but does not apply to water which is used to wash out equipment after 
the equipment has already been opened to the atmosphere in accordance 
with Sec. 61.64(a)(2) or paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
    (ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from the inprocess wastewater in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section is to be ducted 
through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride 
in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); 
or equivalent as provided in Sec. 61.66.
    (c) The requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6), 
(b)(7) and

[[Page 58]]

(b)(8) of this section are to be incorporated into a standard operating 
procedure, and made available upon request for inspection by the 
Administrator. The standard operating procedure is to include provisions 
for measuring the vinyl chloride in equipment 4.75 m\3\ (1255 gal) in 
volume for which an emission limit is prescribed in Sec. 61.65(b)(6)(i) 
after opening the equipment and using Method 106, a portable hydrocarbon 
detector, or an alternative method. The method of measurement is to meet 
the requirements in Sec. 61.67(g)(5)(i)(A) or (g)(5)(i)(B).
    (d) A RVD that is ducted to a control device that is continually 
operating while emissions from the release are present at the device is 
subject to the following requirements:
    (1) A discharge from a control device other than a flare shall not 
exceed 10 ppm (average over a 3-hour period) as determined by the 
continuous emission monitor system required under Sec. 61.68. Such a 
discharge is subject to the requirements of Sec. 61.70.
    (2) For a discharge routed to a flare, the flare shall comply with 
the requirements of Sec. 60.18.
    (i) Flare operations shall be monitored in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 60.18(d) and 60.18(f)(2). For the purposes of 
Sec. 60.18(d), the volume and component concentration of each relief 
valve discharge shall be estimated and calculation shall be made to 
verify ongoing compliance with the design and operating requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 60.18 (c)(3) through (c)(6). If more than one relief valve is 
discharged simultaneously to a single flare, these calculations shall 
account for the cumulative effect of all such relief valve discharges. 
These calculations shall be made and reported quarterly for all 
discharges within the quarter. Failure to comply with any of the 
requirements of this paragraph will be a violation of Sec. 61.65(d)(2). 
Monitoring for the presence of a flare pilot flame shall be conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 60.18(f)(2). If the results of this monitoring or 
any other information shows that the pilot flame is not present 100 
percent of the time during which a relief valve discharge is routed to 
the flare, the relief valve discharge is subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 61.65(a).
    (ii) A report describing the flare design shall be provided to the 
Administrator not later than 90 days after the adoption of this 
provision or within 30 days of the installation of a flare system for 
control of relief valve discharge whichever is later. The flare design 
report shall include calculations based upon expected relief valve 
discharge component concentrations and net heating values (for PVC this 
calculation shall be based on values expected if a release occurred at 
the instant the polymerization starts); and estimated maximum exit 
velocities based upon the design throat capacity of the gas in the 
relief valve.

Sec. 61.66  Equivalent equipment and procedures.

    Upon written application from an owner or operator, the 
Administrator may approve use of equipment or procedures which have been 
demonstrated to his satisfaction to be equivalent in terms of reducing 
vinyl chloride emissions to the atmosphere to those prescribed for 
compliance with a specific paragraph of this subpart.

[51 FR 34912, Sept. 30, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 61.67  Emission tests.

    (a) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under Sec. 
61.13, the owner or operator of a source to which this subpart applies 
shall test emissions from the source,
    (1) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing 
source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the 
effective date, or
    (2) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source, initial 
startup of which occurs after the effective date.
    (b) The owner or operator shall provide the Administrator at least 
30 days prior notice of an emission test to afford the Administrator the 
opportunity to have an observer present during the test.

[[Page 59]]

    (c) Any emission test is to be conducted while the equipment being 
tested is operating at the maximum production rate at which the 
equipment will be operated and under other relevant conditions as may be 
specified by the Administrator based on representative performance of 
the source.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) When at all possible, each sample is to be analyzed within 24 
hours, but in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Vinyl 
chloride emissions are to be determined within 30 days after the 
emission test. The owner or operator shall report the determinations to 
the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched before the close of 
the next business day following the determination.
    (f) The owner or operator shall retain at the plant and make 
available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a 
minimum of 3 years, records of emission test results and other data 
needed to determine emissions.
    (g) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the 
test methods in appendix B to this part for each test as required by 
paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4), and (g)(5) of this section, 
unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If 
the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results 
obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference 
method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not 
agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the 
Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the 
method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn. Whenever 
Method 107 is specified, and the conditions in Section 1.2, 
``Applicability'' of Method 107A are met, Method 107A may be used.
    (1) Method 106 is to be used to determine the vinyl chloride 
emissions from any source for which an emission limit is prescribed in 
Sec. 61.62(a) or (b), Sec. 61.63(a), or Sec. 61.64(a)(1), (b), (c), 
or (d), or from any control system to which reactor emissions are 
required to be ducted in Sec. 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive 
emissions are required to be ducted in Sec. 61.65(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), 
(b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii).
    (i) For each run, one sample is to be collected. The sampling site 
is to be at least two stack or duct diameters downstream and one half 
diameter upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, 
contraction, or visible flame. For a rectangular cross section, an 
equivalent diameter is to be determined from the following equation:

Equivalent diameter = 2(length)(width)/(length + width)


The sampling point in the duct is to be at the centroid of the cross 
section. The sample is to be extracted at a rate proportional to the gas 
velocity at the sampling point. The sample is to contain a minimum 
volume of 50 liters (1.8 ft\3\) corrected to standard conditions and is 
to be taken over a period as close to 1 hour as practicable.
    (ii) Each emission test is to consist of three runs. For the purpose 
of determining emissions, the average of results of all runs is to 
apply. The average is to be computed on a time weighted basis.
    (iii) For gas streams containing more that 10 percent oxygen, the 
concentration of vinyl chloride as determined by Method 106 is to be 
corrected to 10 percent oxygen (dry basis) for determination of 
emissions by using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.474

Where:

C<INF>b(corrected)</INF> = The concentration of vinyl chloride in the 
exhaust gases, corrected to 10 percent oxygen.
C<INF>b</INF> = The concentration of vinyl chloride as measured by 
Method 106.
20.9 = Percent oxygen in the ambient air at standard conditions.
10.9 = Percent oxygen in the ambient air at standard conditions, minus 
the 10.0 percent oxygen to which the correction is being made.
Percent O<INF>2</INF> = Percent oxygen in the exhaust gas as measured by 
Method 3 of appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.

    (iv) For those emission sources where the emission limit is 
prescribed in terms of mass rather than concentration, mass emissions 
are to be determined using the following equation:

[[Page 60]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.475

Where:

C<INF>BX</INF> = Vinyl chloride emissions, g/kg (lb/lb) product.
C<INF>b</INF> = Concentration of vinyl chloride as measured by Test

60 of this chapter, m\3\/hr (ft\3\/hr).
K = Unit conversion factor, 1,000 g/kg (1 lb/lb).
10<SUP>-6</SUP> = Conversion factor for ppm.
Z = Production rate, kg/hr (lb/hr).

    (2) Method 107 or Method 601 (incorporated by reference as specified 
in Sec. 61.18) is to be used to determine the concentration of vinyl 
chloride in each inprocess wastewater stream for which an emission limit 
is prescribed in Sec. 61.65(b)(9)(i).
    (3) When a stripping operation is used to attain the emission limits 
in Sec. 61.64(e) and (f), emissions are to be determined using Method 
107 as follows:
    (i) The number of strippers (or reactors used as strippers) and 
samples and the types and grades of resin to be sampled are to be 
determined by the Administrator for each individual plant at the time of 
the test based on the plant's operation.
    (ii) Each sample is to be taken immediately following the stripping 
operation.
    (iii) The corresponding quantity of material processed by each 
stripper (or reactor used as a stripper) is to be determined on a dry 
solids basis and by a method submitted to and approved by the 
Administrator.
    (iv) At the prior request of the Administrator, the owner or 
operator shall provide duplicates of the samples required in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) Where control technology other than or in addition to a 
stripping operation is used to attain the emission limit in Sec. 
61.64(e), emissions are to be determined as follows:
    (i) Method 106 is to be used to determine atmospheric emissions from 
all of the process equipment simultaneously. The requirements of 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section are to be met.
    (ii) Method 107 is to be used to determine the concentration of 
vinyl chloride in each inprocess wastewater stream subject to the 
emission limit prescribed in Sec. 61.64(e). Vinyl chloride mass 
emissions are to be determined using the following equation:

ft\3\).
Q<INF>water</INF> = Wastewater flow rate, determined in accordance with 
a method which has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator, 
m\3\/hr (ft\3\/hr).
K = Unit conversion factor, 1,000 g/kg (1 lb/lb).
10<SUP>-6</SUP> = Conversion factor for ppm.
Z = Production rate, kg/hr (lb/hr), determined in accordance with a 
method which has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator.

    (5) The reactor opening loss for which an emission limit is 
prescribed in Sec. 61.64(a)(2) is to be determined. The number of 
reactors for which the determination is to be made is to be specified by 
the Administrator for each individual plant at the time of the 
determination based on the plant's operation.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, the 
reactor opening loss is to be determined using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.477

Where:

C<INF>BX</INF> = Vinyl chloride emissions, g/kg (lb/lb) product.
C<INF>b</INF> = Concentration of vinyl chloride, in ppmv, as determined 
by Method 106 or a portable hydrocarbon detector which measures 
hydrocarbons with a sensitivity of at least 10 ppmv.
V<INF>R</INF> = Capacity of the reactor, m\3\ (ft\3\).
D<INF>VC</INF> = Density of vinyl chloride at standard conditions, 2.60 
kg/m\3\ (0.162 lb/ft\3\).
K = Unit conversion factor, 1,000 g/kg (1 lb/lb).
10<SUP>-6</SUP> = Conversion factor for ppm.

[[Page 61]]

Z = Production rate, kg/hr (lb/hr).

    (A) If Method 106 is used to determine the concentration of vinyl 
chloride (C<INF>b</INF>), the sample is to be withdrawn at a constant 
rate with a probe of sufficient length to reach the vessel bottom from 
the manhole. Samples are to be taken for 5 minutes within 6 inches of 
the vessel bottom, 5 minutes near the vessel center, and 5 minutes near 
the vessel top.
    (B) If a portable hydrocarbon detector is used to determine the 
concentration of vinyl chloride (C<INF>b</INF>), a probe of sufficient 
length to reach the vessel bottom from the manhole is to be used to make 
the measurements. One measurement will be made within 6 inches of the 
vessel bottom, one near the vessel center and one near the vessel top. 
Measurements are to be made at each location until the reading is 
stabilized. All hydrocarbons measured are to be assumed to be vinyl 
chloride.
    (C) The production rate of polyvinyl chloride (Z), which is the 
product of the average batch weight and the number of batches produced 
since the reactor was last opened to the atmosphere, is to be determined 
by a method submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
    (ii) A calculation based on the number of evacuations, the vacuum 
involved, and the volume of gas in the reactor is hereby approved by the 
Administrator as an alternative method for determining reactor opening 
loss for postpolymerization reactors in the manufacture of bulk resins. 
Calculation methods based on techniques other than repeated evacuation 
of the reactor may be approved by the Administrator for determining 
reactor opening loss for postpolymerization reactors in the manufacture 
of bulk resins.
    (6) For a reactor that is used as a stripper, the emissions of vinyl 
chloride from reactor opening loss and all sources following the reactor 
used as a stripper for which an emission limit is prescribed in Sec. 
61.64(f) are to be determined. The number of reactors for which the 
determination is to be made is to be specified by the Administrator for 
each individual plant at the time of the determination based on the 
plant's operation.
    (i) For each batch stripped in the reactor, the following 
measurements are to be made:
    (A) The concentration of vinyl chloride in resin after stripping, 
measured according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section;
    (B) The reactor vacuum at end of strip from plant instrument; and
    (C) The reactor temperature at the end of strip from plant 
instrument.
    (ii) For each batch stripped in the reactor, the following 
information is to be determined:
    (A) The vapor pressure of water in the reactor at the end of strip 
from the following table:

    (h)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can 
reasonably contain equipment in vinyl chloride service is presumed to be 
in vinyl chloride service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that 
the piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service. For a piece of 
equipment to be considered not in vinyl chloride service, it must be 
determined that the percent vinyl chloride content can be reasonably 
expected not to exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams or 
contained liquid volumes and 10 percent by volume for gas streams or 
contained gas volumes, which also includes gas volumes above liquid 
streams or contained liquid volumes. For purposes of determining the 
percent vinyl chloride content of the process fluid that is contained in 
or contacts equipment, procedures that conform to the methods described 
in ASTM D2267-68, 78, or 88 or D4420-94 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 61.18) shall be used.
    (2)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than 
the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section to demonstrate that 
the percent vinyl chloride content does not exceed 10 percent by weight 
for liquid streams and 10 percent by volume for gas streams, provided 
that the engineering judgment demonstrates that the vinyl chloride 
content clearly does not exceed 10 percent. When an owner or operator 
and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is 
not in vinyl chloride service, however, the procedures in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
    (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is 
in vinyl chloride service, the determination can be revised only after 
following the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) Samples used in determining the percent vinyl chloride content 
shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or 
contacts the equipment.

Sec. 61.68  Emission monitoring.

    (a) A vinyl chloride monitoring system is to be used to monitor on a 
continuous basis the emissions from the sources for which emission 
limits are prescribed in Sec. Sec. 61.62 (a) and (b), 61.63(a), and 
61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c), and (d), and for any control system to which 
reactor emissions are required to be ducted in Sec. 61.64(a)(2) or to 
which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in Sec. 61.65 
(b)(1)(ii), and (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6) (ii), and (b)(9)(ii).
    (b) The vinyl chloride monitoring system(s) used to meet the 
requirement in paragraph (a) of this section is to be a device which 
obtains representative samples from one or more applicable emission 
points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples with 
gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all 
hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared 
spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an alternative method. The 
vinyl chloride monitoring system used to meet the requirements in Sec. 
61.65(b)(8)(i) may be used to meet the requirements of this section.
    (c) A daily span check is to be conducted for each vinyl chloride 
monitoring system used. For all of the emission sources listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, except the one for which an emission 
limit is prescribed in Sec. 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be 
conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to 10 ppm. For 
the emission source for which an emission limit is prescribed in Sec. 
61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted

[[Page 64]]

with a concentration of vinyl chloride which is determined to be 
equivalent to the emission limit for that source based on the emission 
test required by Sec. 61.67. The calibration is to be done with either:
    (1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in 
Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with Section 
10.1 of Method 106, or
    (2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate 
concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration 
gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The 
manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each 
cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas 
cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration and 
recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder 
before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas 
chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas 
mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration 
curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The 
requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for 
certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and 
verification of calibration standards are to be followed.
    (d) When exhaust gas(es), having emission limits that are subject to 
the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, are emitted to the 
atmosphere without passing through the control system and required vinyl 
chloride monitoring system, the vinyl chloride content of the emission 
shall be calculated (in units of each applicable emission limit) by best 
practical engineering judgment based on the discharge duration and known 
VC concentrations in the affected equipment as determined in accordance 
with Sec. 61.67(h) or other acceptable method.
    (e) For each 3-hour period, the vinyl chloride content of emissions 
subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section 
shall be averaged (weighted according to the proportion of time that 
emissions were continuously monitored and that emissions bypassed the 
continuous monitor) for purposes of reporting excess emissions under 
Sec. 61.70(c)(1).
    (f) For each vinyl chloride emission to the atmosphere determined in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to be in excess of the 
applicable emission limits, the owner or operator shall record the 
identity of the source(s), the date, time, and duration of the excess 
emission, the cause of the excess emission, and the approximate total 
vinyl chloride loss during the excess emission, and the method used for 
determining the vinyl chloride loss. This information shall be retained 
and made available for inspection by the Administrator as required by 
Sec. 61.71(a).

Sec. 61.69  Initial report.

    (a) An owner or operator of any source to which this subpart applies 
shall submit a statement in writing notifying the Administrator that the 
equipment and procedural specifications in Sec. 61.65 (b)(1), (b)(2), 
(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7), and (b)(8) are being 
implemented.
    (b)(1) In the case of an existing source or a new source which has 
an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the statement is 
to be submitted within 90 days of the effective date, unless a waiver of 
compliance is granted under Sec. 61.11, along with the information 
required under Sec. 61.10. If a waiver of compliance is granted, the 
statement is to be submitted on a date scheduled by the Administrator.
    (2) In the case of a new source which did not have an initial 
startup date preceding the effective date, the statement is to be 
submitted within 90 days of the initial startup date.
    (c) The statement is to contain the following information:
    (1) A list of the equipment installed for compliance,
    (2) A description of the physical and functional characteristics of 
each piece of equipment,
    (3) A description of the methods which have been incorporated into 
the

[[Page 65]]

standard operating procedures for measuring or calculating the emissions 
for which emission limits are prescribed in Sec. 61.65 (b)(1)(i) and 
(b)(6)(i),
    (4) A statement that each piece of equipment is installed and that 
each piece of equipment and each procedure is being used.

Sec. 61.70  Reporting.

    (a)(1) The owner or operator of any source to which this subpart 
applies shall submit to the Administrator on March 15, June 15, 
September 15, and December 15 of each year a report in writing 
containing the information required by this section. The first report is 
to be submitted following the first full 3-month reporting period after 
the initial report is submitted.
    (2) In the case of an existing source, the approved reporting 
schedule shall be used. In addition, quarterly reports shall be 
submitted exactly 3 months following the current reporting dates.
    (b)(1) In the case of an existing source or a new source which has 
an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the first report 
is to be submitted within 180 days of the effective date, unless a 
waiver of compliance is granted under Sec. 61.11. If a waiver of 
compliance is granted, the first report is to be submitted on a date 
scheduled by the Administrator.
    (2) In the case of a new source which did not have an initial 
startup date preceding the effective date, the first report is to be 
submitted within 180 days of the initial startup date.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the 
test methods in appendix B to this part to conduct emission tests as 
required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, unless an 
alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the 
Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained 
by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. 
If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, 
the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the 
Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the 
method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn.

or during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits 
specified for any control system to which reactor emissions are required 
to be ducted in Sec. 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are 
required to be ducted in Sec. 61.65(b)(I)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5), 
(b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii). The number of 3-hour periods for which 
average emissions were determined during the reporting period shall be 
reported. If emissions in excess of the emission limits are not 
detected, the report shall contain a statement that no excess emissions 
have been detected. The emissions are to be determined in accordance 
with Sec. 61.68(e).
    (2) In polyvinyl chloride plants for which a stripping operation is 
used to attain the emission level prescribed in Sec. 61.64(e), the 
owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl 
chloride content in the polyvinyl chloride resin.

polyvinyl chloride resin is to be taken from each batch of each grade of 
resin immediately following the completion of the stripping operation, 
and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time the batch 
is completed. The corresponding quantity of material processed in each 
stripper batch is to be recorded and identified by resin type and grade 
and the date and time the batch is completed.
    (ii) If continuous stripping is used, one representative sample of 
polyvinyl chloride resin is to be taken for each grade of resin 
processed or at intervals of 8 hours for each grade of resin which is

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.481

Where:

A<INF>T</INF> = 24-hour average concentration of type T resin in ppm 
(dry weight basis).
Q<INF>T</INF> = Total production of type T resin over the 24-hour 
period, in kg (ton).
T = Type of resin.
M<INF>Gi</INF> = Concentration of vinyl chloride in one sample of grade 
G<INF>i</INF> resin in ppm.
P<INF>Gi</INF> = Production of grade G<INF>i</INF> resin represented by 
the sample, in kg (ton).
G<INF>i</INF> = Grade of resin: e.g., G<INF>1</INF>, G<INF>2</INF>, 
G<INF>3</INF>.
n = Total number of grades of resin produced during the 24-hour period.

    The number of 24-hour average concentrations for each resin type 
determined during the reporting period shall be reported. If no 24-hour 
average resin vinyl chloride concentrations in excess of the limits 
prescribed in Sec. 61.64(e) are measured, the report shall state that 
no excess resin vinyl chloride concentrations were measured.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain at the source and make 
available for inspection by the Administrator for a minimum of 3 years 
records of all data needed to furnish the information required by 
paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. The records are to contain the 
following information:
    (A) The vinyl chloride content found in all the samples required in 
paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, identified by the 
resin type and grade and the time and date of the sample, and

accordance with Sec. 61.67(g)(5), except that emissions for each 
reactor are to be determined. The number of reactor openings during the 
reporting period shall be reported. If emissions in excess of the 
emission limits are not detected, the report shall include a statement 
that excess emissions have not been detected.
    (4) In polyvinyl chloride plants for which stripping in the reactor 
is used to attain the emission level prescribed in Sec. 61.64(f), the 
owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl 
chloride emissions from reactor opening loss and all sources following 
the reactor used as a stripper.
    (i) One representative sample of polyvinyl chloride resin is to be 
taken from each batch of each grade of resin immediately following the 
completion of the stripping operation, and identified by resin type and 
grade and the date and time the batch is completed. The corresponding 
quantity of material processed in each stripper batch is to be recorded 
and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time the batch 
is completed.
    (ii) The vinyl chloride content in each sample is to be determined 
by Method 107 as prescribed in Sec. 61.67(g)(3).

[[Page 67]]

    (iii) The combined emissions from reactor opening loss and all 
sources following the reactor used as a stripper are to be determined 
for each batch stripped in a reactor according to the procedure 
prescribed in Sec. 61.67(g)(6).

    Source: 54 FR 51695, Dec. 15, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 61.90  Designation of facilities.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to operations at any facility 
owned or operated by the Department of Energy that emits any 
radionuclide other than radon-222 and radon-220 into the air, except 
that this subpart does not apply to disposal at facilities subject to 40 
CFR part 191, subpart B or 40 CFR part 192.


<R05>
Sec. 61.91  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meaning 
given them in the Clean Air Act or 40 CFR part 61, subpart A. The 
following terms shall have the following specific meanings:
    (a) Effective dose equivalent means the sum of the products of 
absorbed dose and appropriate factors to account for differences in 
biological effectiveness due to the quality of radiation and its 
distribution in the body of reference man. The unit of the effective 
dose equivalent is the rem. For purposes of this subpart, doses caused 
by radon-222 and its respective decay products formed after the radon is 
released from the facility are not included. The method for calculating 
effective dose equivalent and the definition of reference man are 
outlined in the International Commission on Radiological Protection's 
Publication No. 26.
    (b) Facility means all buildings, structures and operations on one 
contiguous site.
    (c) Radionuclide means a type of atom which spontaneously undergoes 
radioactive decay.
    (d) Residence means any home, house, apartment building, or other 
place of dwelling which is occupied during any portion of the relevant 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 61.92  Standard.

    Emissions of radionuclides to the ambient air from Department of 
Energy facilities shall not exceed those amounts that would cause any 
member of the public to receive in any year an effective dose equivalent 
of 10 mrem/yr.


<R05>
Sec. 61.93  Emission monitoring and test procedures.

    (a) To determine compliance with the standard, radionuclide 
emissions shall be determined and effective dose equivalent values to 
members of the public calculated using EPA approved sampling procedures, 
computer models CAP-88 or AIRDOS-PC, or other procedures for which EPA 
has granted prior approval. DOE facilities for which the maximally 
exposed individual lives within 3 kilometers of all sources of emissions 
in the facility, may use EPA's COMPLY model and associated procedures 
for determining dose for purposes of compliance.
    (b) Radionuclides emission rates from existing point sources (stacks 
or vents) shall be measured in accordance with the following 
requirements or with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, 
or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
    (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the 
following methods:
    (i) Reference Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter 
shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks 
and large vents.
    (ii) Reference Method 2A of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter 
shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
    (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon 
the variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, 
continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For 
relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.

[[Page 69]]

    (2) Radionuclides shall be directly monitored or extracted, 
collected and measured using the following methods:
    (i) Reference Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter 
shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.
    (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously 
with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent 
stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following 
the guidance presented in ANSIN13.1-1969 ``Guide to Sampling Airborne 
Radioactive Materials in Nuclear Facilities'' (including the guidance 
presented in appendix A of ANSIN13.1) (incorporated by reference--see 
Sec. 61.18). The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to 
batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab 
samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may 
be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and 
radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab 
samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a 
representative sample of the emissions.
    (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures 
based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 
114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from 
those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from 
the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement 
procedures.
    (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
    (3) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at an 
existing source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at an 
existing source in accordance with the site selection and sample 
extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate 
measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction 
procedures provided that:
    (i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b) (1) or 
(2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
    (ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate 
the emissions.
    (iii) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
    (iv) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
    (4)(i) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be made at all 
release points which have a potential to discharge radionuclides into 
the air in quantities which could cause an effective dose equivalent in 
excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides which could contribute 
greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a 
release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may 
determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other 
release points which have a potential to release radionuclides into the 
air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low 
emissions.
    (ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission 
measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is 
necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that 
release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to 
discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, 
the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge 
of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control 
equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise 
normal.
    (5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at 
critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air 
dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if 
the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
    (i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously 
sampled for collection of radionuclides.
    (ii) Those radionuclides released from the facility, which are the 
major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected 
and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.

[[Page 70]]

    (iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective 
dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and 
distinguishable from background.
    (iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to 
the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine 
compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides 
being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the 
value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in 
Table 2, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured 
concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each 
radionuclide is less than 1.
    (v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
    (vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance 
with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for 
approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and 
analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.
    (c) Radionuclide emission rates from new point sources (stacks or 
vents) as defined in subpart A shall be measured in accordance with the 
following requirements, or other procedures for which EPA has granted 
prior approval:
    (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the 
following methods:
    (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 ``Sampling and Monitoring Releases of 
Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear 
Facilities' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 61.18) shall be used 
to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large 
vents.
    (ii) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to measure flow rates through 
pipes and small vents.
    (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon 
variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, 
continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For 
relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
    (2) Radionuclide shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected 
and measured using the following methods:
    (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to select monitoring or 
sampling sites.
    (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously 
with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent 
stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following 
the guidance presented in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999. The requirements for 
continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is 
in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with 
EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where 
continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are 
relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with 
sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the 
emissions.
    (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures 
based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 
114 of this part. Use of methods based on principles of measurement 
different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part 
must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right 
to approve measurement procedures.
    (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999.
    (d) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at a 
source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of 
this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at a source in 
accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of 
paragraph (b)(2) or (c) of this section, the facility owner or operator 
may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site 
selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
    (1) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) 
or (c) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
    (2) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate 
the emissions.

[[Page 71]]

    (3) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
    (4) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
    (e) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made at 
all release points that have a potential to discharge radionuclides into 
the air in quantities that could cause an effective dose equivalent in 
excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides that could contribute 
greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a 
release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may 
determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other 
release points that have a potential to release radionuclides into the 
air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low 
emissions.
    (f) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission 
measurement requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, it is 
necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that 
release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to 
discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, 
the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge 
of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control 
equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise 
normal.
    (g) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at 
critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air 
dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if 
the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
    (1) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously 
sampled for collection of radionuclides.
    (2) Those radionuclides released from the facility that are the 
major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected 
and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.
    (3) Radionuclide concentrations that would cause an effective dose 
equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and 
distinguishable from background.
    (4) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to 
the concentration levels in Table 2 appendix E of this part to determine 
compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides 
being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the 
value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in 
Table 2 of appendix E of this part, and the sum of the fractions that 
result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in 
Table 2 of appendix E of this part for each radionuclide is less than 1.
    (5) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114 of this 
part.
    (6) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with 
the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for 
approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and 
analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.

radioactive materials undergo at the facility.

[[Page 72]]

    (4) A list of the stacks or vents or other points where radioactive 
materials are released to the atmosphere.
    (5) A description of the effluent controls that are used on each 
stack, vent, or other release point and an estimate of the efficiency of 
each control device.
    (6) Distances from the points of release to the nearest residence, 
school, business or office and the nearest farms producing vegetables, 
milk, and meat.
    (7) The values used for all other user-supplied input parameters for 
the computer models (e.g., meteorological data) and the source of these 
data.
    (8) A brief description of all construction and modifications which 
were completed in the calendar year for which the report is prepared, 
but for which the requirement to apply for approval to construct or 
modify was waived under Sec. 61.96 and associated documentation 
developed by DOE to support the waiver. EPA reserves the right to 
require that DOE send to EPA all the information that normally would be 
required in an application to construct or modify, following receipt of 
the description and supporting documentation.
    (9) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer or 
public official in charge of the facility and contain the following 
declaration immediately above the signature line: ``I certify under 
penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the 
information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those 
individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I 
believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I 
am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false 
information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 
U.S.C. 1001.''
    (c) If the facility is not in compliance with the emission limits of 
Sec. 61.92 in the calendar year covered by the report, then the 
facility must commence reporting to the Administrator on a monthly basis 
the information listed in paragraph (b) of this section, for the 
preceding month. These reports will start the month immediately 
following the submittal of the annual report for the year in 
noncompliance and will be due 30 days following the end of each month. 
This increased level of reporting will continue until the Administrator 
has determined that the monthly reports are no longer necessary. In 
addition to all the information required in paragraph (b) of this 
section, monthly reports shall also include the following information:
    (1) All controls or other changes in operation of the facility that 
will be or are being installed to bring the facility into compliance.
    (2) If the facility is under a judicial or administrative 
enforcement decree, the report will describe the facilities performance 
under the terms of the decree.
    (d) In those instances where the information requested is 
classified, such information will be made available to EPA separate from 
the report and will be handled and controlled according to applicable 
security and classification regulations and requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 61.95  Recordkeeping requirements.

    All facilities must maintain records documenting the source of input 
parameters including the results of all measurements upon which they are 
based, the calculations and/or analytical methods used to derive values 
for input parameters, and the procedure used to determine effective dose 
equivalent. This documentation should be sufficient to allow an 
independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the determination made 
concerning the facility's compliance with the standard. These records 
must be kept at the site of the facility for at least five years and, 
upon request, be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or 
his authorized representative.

documenting the source of input parameters including the results of all 
measurements upon which they are based, the calculations and/or 
analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the 
procedure used to determine compliance. This documentation should be 
sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the 
determination made concerning the facility's compliance with the 
standard, and, if claimed, qualification for exemption from reporting. 
These records must be kept at the site of the facility for at least five 
years and upon request be made available for inspection by the 
Administrator, or his authorized representative.


<R05>
Sec. 61.106  Applications to construct or modify.

    (a) In addition to any activity that is defined as construction 
under 40 CFR part 61, subpart A, any fabrication, erection or 
installation of a new building or structure within a facility is also 
defined as new construction for purposes of 40 CFR part 61, subpart A.
    (b) An application under Sec. 61.07 does not need to be filed for 
any new construction of or modification within an existing facility if 
one of the following conditions is met:
    (1) The effective dose equivalent calculated by using methods 
described in Sec. 61.103, that is caused by all emissions from the 
facility including those potentially emitted by the proposed new 
construction or modification, is less than 10% of the standard 
prescribed in Sec. 61.102.
    (2) The effective dose equivalent calculated by using methods 
described in Sec. 61.103, that is caused by all emissions from the new 
construction or modification, is less than 1% of the limit prescribed in 
Sec. 61.102. A facility is eligible for this exemption only if the 
facility, based on its last annual report, is in compliance with this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 61.107  Emission determination.

    (a) Facility owners or operators may, in lieu of monitoring, 
estimate radionuclide emissions in accordance with appendix D, or other 
procedure for which EPA has granted prior approval.
    (b) Radionuclide emission rates from existing point sources (stacks 
or vents) shall be measured in accordance with the following 
requirements or within the requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
section, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
    (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the 
following methods:
    (i) Reference Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter 
shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks 
and large vents.
    (ii) Reference Method 2A of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter 
shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
    (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon 
the variability of the effluent flow rate.

[[Page 76]]

For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements 
shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic 
measurements are necessary.
    (2) Radionuclides shall be directly monitored or extracted, 
collected, and measured using the following methods:
    (i) Reference Method 1 of appendix A part 60 of this chapter shall 
be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.
    (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously 
using an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent 
stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following 
the guidance presented in ANSIN13.1-1969 ``Guide to Sampling Airborne 
Radioactive Materials in Nuclear Facilities'' (including the guidance 
presented in appendix A of ANSIN13.1) (incorporated by reference--see 
Sec. 61.18). The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to 
batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab 
samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may 
be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and 
radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab 
samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a 
representative sample of the emissions.
    (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures 
based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 
114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from 
those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from 
the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve alternative 
measurement procedures in whole or in part.
    (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
    (3) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at an 
existing source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at an 
existing source in accordance with the site selection and sample 
extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate 
measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction 
procedures provided that:
    (i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and 
(2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
    (ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate 
the emissions.
    (iii) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
    (iv) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
    (4)(i) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be made at all 
release points which have a potential to discharge radionuclides into 
the air in quantities which could cause an effective dose equivalent in 
excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides which could contribute 
greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a 
release point shall be measured. For other release points which have a 
potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory 
measurements should be made to verify the low emissions.
    (ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission 
measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is 
necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that 
release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to 
discharge radionuclides into the air, the estimated radionuclide release 
rates shall be based on the discharge of the uncontrolled effluent 
stream into the air.
    (5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at 
critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air 
dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standards 
if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
    (i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously 
sampled for collection of radionuclides.
    (ii) Those radionuclides released from the facility, which are the 
major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected 
and measured as

[[Page 77]]

part of the environmental measurements program.
    (iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective 
dose equivalent greater than or equal to 10% of the standard shall be 
readily detectable and distinguishable from background.
    (iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to 
the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine 
compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides 
being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the 
value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in 
Table 2 and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured 
concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each 
radionuclide is less than 1.
    (v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
    (vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance 
with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for 
approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and 
analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.
    (c) The following facilities may use either the methodologies and 
quality assurance programs described in paragraph (b) of this section or 
may use the following:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Uranium mills may determine their emissions in conformance with 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 4.14 dated April 
1980. In addition, they may conduct a quality assurance program as 
described in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 4.15 
dated February 1979.
    (d) Radionuclide emission rates from new point sources (stacks or 
vents) as defined in subpart A shall be measured in accordance with the 
following requirements, or other procedures for which EPA has granted 
prior approval:
    (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the 
following methods:
    (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 ``Sampling and Monitoring Releases of 
Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear 
Facilities'' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 61.18) shall be used 
to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large 
vents.
    (ii) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to measure flow rates through 
pipes and small vents.
    (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon 
variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, 
continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For 
relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
    (2) Radionuclide shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected 
and measured using the following methods:
    (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to select monitoring or 
sampling sites.
    (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously 
with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent 
stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following 
the guidance presented in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999. The requirements for 
continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is 
in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with 
EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where 
continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are 
relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with 
sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the 
emissions.
    (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures 
based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 
114 of this part. Use of methods based on principles of measurement 
different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part 
must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right 
to approve measurement procedures.
    (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999.

[[Page 78]]

    (e) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at a 
source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (d) of 
this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at a source in 
accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of 
paragraph (b)(2) or (d) of this section, the facility owner or operator 
may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site 
selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
    (1) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) 
or (d) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
    (2) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate 
the emissions.
    (3) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
    (4) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
    (f) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) or (d) of this section shall be made at 
all release points that have a potential to discharge radionuclides into 
the air in quantities that could cause an effective dose equivalent in 
excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides that could contribute 
greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a 
release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may 
determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other 
release points that have a potential to release radionuclides into the 
air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low 
emissions.
    (g) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission 
measurement requirements of paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, it is 
necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that 
release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to 
discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, 
the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge 
of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control 
equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise 
normal.
    (h) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at 
critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air 
dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if 
the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
    (1) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously 
sampled for collection of radionuclides.
    (2) Those radionuclides released from the facility that are the 
major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected 
and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.
    (3) Radionuclide concentrations that would cause an effective dose 
equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and 
distinguishable from background.
    (4) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to 
the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E of this part to 
determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple 
radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be 
demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the 
concentration level in Table 2 of appendix E of this part, and the sum 
of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is 
divided by the value in Table 2 of appendix E of this part for each 
radionuclide is less than 1.
    (5) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the 
performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114 of this 
part.
    (6) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with 
the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for 
approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and 
analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.

Sec. 61.123  Emission testing.

    (a) Each owner or operator of an elemental phosphorus plant shall 
test emissions from the plant within 90 days of the effective date of 
this standard and annually thereafter. The Administrator may temporarily 
or permanently waive the annual testing requirement or increase the 
frequency of testing, if the Administrator determines that more testing 
is required.
    (b) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an 
emission test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test.
    (c) An emission test shall be conducted at each operational calciner 
or nodulizing kiln. If emissions from a calciner or nodulizing kiln are 
discharged through more than one stack, then an emission test shall be 
conducted at each stack and the total emission rate from the calciner or 
kiln shall be the sum of the emission rates from each of the stacks.
    (d) Each emission test shall consist of three sampling runs that 
meet the requirements of Sec. 61.125. The phosphate rock processing 
rate during each run shall be recorded. An emission rate in curies per 
Mg or curies per ton of phosphate rock processed shall be calculated for 
each run. The average of all three runs shall apply in computing the 
emission rate for the test. The annual polonium-210 emission rate from a 
calciner or nodulizing kiln shall be determined by multiplying the 
measured polonium-210 emission rate in curies per Mg or curies per ton 
of phosphate rock processed by the annual phosphate rock processing rate 
in Mg (tons). In determining the annual phosphate rock processing rate, 
the values used for operating hours and operating capacity shall be 
values that will maximize the expected processing rate. For determining 
compliance with the emission standard of Sec. 61.122, the total annual 
emission rate is the sum of the annual emission rates for all operating 
calciners and nodulizing kilns.
    (e) If the owner or operator changes his operation in such a way as 
to increase his emissions of polonium-210, such as changing the type of 
rock processed, the temperature of the calciners or kilns, or increasing 
the annual phosphate rock processing rate, then a new

[[Page 81]]

emission test, meeting the requirements of this section, shall be 
conducted within 45 days under these conditions.
    (f) Each owner or operator of an elemental phosphorus plant shall 
furnish the Administrator with a written report of the results of the 
emission test within 60 days of conducting the test. The report must 
provide the following information:
    (1) The name and location of the facility.
    (2) The name of the person responsible for the operation of the 
facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different).
    (3) A description of the effluent controls that are used on each 
stack, vent, or other release point and an estimate of the efficiency of 
each device.
    (4) The results of the testing, including the results of each 
sampling run completed.
    (5) The values used in calculating the emissions and the source of 
these data.
    (6) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in 
charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately 
above the signature line: ``I certify under penalty of law that I have 
personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted 
herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately 
responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted 
information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are 
significant penalties for submitting false information including the 
possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.''

    (b) To determine whether or not a piece of equipment is in benzene 
service, the methods in Sec. 61.245(d) shall be used, except that, for 
exhausters, the percent benzene shall be 1 percent by weight, rather 
than the 10 percent by weight described in Sec. 61.245(d).

<R05>
Sec. 61.139  Provisions for alternative means for process vessels, 
storage tanks, and tar-intercepting sumps.

    (a) As an alternative means of emission limitation for a source 
subject to Sec. 61.132(a)(2) or Sec. 61.132(d), the owner or operator 
may route gases from the source through a closed vent system to a carbon 
adsorber or vapor incinerator that is at least 98 percent efficient at 
removing benzene from the gas stream.
    (1) The provisions of Sec. 61.132(a)(1) and Sec. 61.132(a) (2)(i) 
and (ii) shall apply to the source.
    (2) The seals on the source and closed vent system shall be designed 
and operated for no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument 
reading of less than 500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as 
determined by the methods specified in Sec. 61.245(c).
    (3) The provisions of Sec. 61.132(b) shall apply to the seals and 
closed vent system.
    (b) For each carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall adhere to 
the following practices:
    (1) Benzene captured by each carbon adsorber shall be recycled or 
destroyed in a manner that prevents benzene from being emitted to the 
atmosphere.
    (2) Carbon removed from each carbon adsorber shall be regenerated or 
destroyed in a manner that prevents benzene from being emitted to the 
atmosphere.
    (3) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
shall initiate regeneration of the spent carbon bed and vent the 
emissions from the source to a regenerated carbon bed

[[Page 89]]

no later than when the benzene concentration or organic vapor 
concentration level in the adsorber outlet vent reaches the maximum 
concentration point, as determined in Sec. 61.139(h).
    (4) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
shall replace the carbon at the scheduled replacement time, or as soon 
as practicable (but not later than 16 hours) after an exceedance of the 
maximum concentration point is detected, whichever is sooner.
    (i) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the scheduled 
replacement time means the day that is estimated to be 90 percent of the 
demonstrated bed life, as defined in Sec. 61.139(h)(5).
    (ii) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, an exceedance of the 
maximum concentration point shall mean any concentration greater than or 
equal to the maximum concentration point as determined in Sec. 
61.139(h).
    (c) Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be 
determined as follows:
    (1) For each carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator, the owner or 
operator shall demonstrate compliance with the efficiency limit by a 
compliance test as specified in Sec. 61.13 and Sec. 61.139(g). If a 
waiver of compliance has been granted under Sec. 61.11, the deadline 
for conducting the initial compliance test shall be incorporated into 
the terms of the waiver. The benzene removal efficiency rate for each 
carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator shall be calculated as in the 
following equation:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

Where:

E=percent removal of benzene.
C<INF>aj</INF>=concentration of benzene in vents after the control 
device, parts per million (ppm).
C<INF>bi</INF>=concentration of benzene in vents before the control 
device, ppm.
Q<INF>aj</INF> = volumetric flow rate in vents after the control device, 
standard cubic meters/minute (scm/min) [standard cubic feet/minute (scf/
min)].
Q<INF>bi</INF> = volumetric flow rate in vents before the control 
device, scm/min (scf/min).
m=number of vents after the control device.
n=number of vents after the control device.

    (2) Compliance with all other provisions in this section shall be 
determined by inspections or the review of records and reports.
    (d) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
shall install and operate a monitoring device that continuously 
indicates and records either the concentration of benzene or the 
concentration level of organic compounds in the outlet vent of the 
carbon adsorber. The monitoring device shall be installed, calibrated, 
maintained and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's 
specifications.
    (1) Measurement of benzene concentration shall be made according to 
Sec. 61.139(g)(2).
    (2) All measurements of organic compound concentration levels shall 
be reasonable indicators of benzene concentration.
    (i) The monitoring device for measuring organic compound 
concentration levels shall be based on one of the following detection 
principles: Infrared absorption, flame ionization, catalytic oxidation, 
photoionization, or thermal conductivity.
    (ii) The monitoring device shall meet the requirements of part 60, 
appendix A, Method 21, sections 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4. For the purpose 
of the application of Method 21 to this section, the words ``leak 
definition'' shall be the maximum concentration point, which would be 
estimated until it is established under Sec. 61.139(h). The calibration 
gas shall either be benzene or methane and shall be at a concentration 
associated with 125 percent of the expected organic compound 
concentration level for the carbon adsorber outlet vent.
    (e) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
shall monitor either the concentration of benzene or the concentration 
level of organic compounds at the outlet vent of the adsorber. The 
monitoring device shall be calibrated, operated and maintained in 
accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
    (1) Measurements of benzene concentration shall be made according to 
Sec. 61.139(g)(2). The measurement shall be conducted over at least one 
5-minute interval during which flow into the carbon adsorber is expected 
to occur.

[[Page 90]]

    (2) All measurements of organic compound concentration levels shall 
be reasonable indicators of benzene concentration.
    (i) The monitoring device for measuring organic compound 
concentration levels shall meet the requirements of paragraphs Sec. 
61.139(d)(2) (i) and (ii).
    (ii) The probe inlet of the monitoring device shall be placed at 
approximately the center of the carbon adsorber outlet vent. The probe 
shall be held there for at least 5 minutes during which flow into the 
carbon adsorber is expected to occur. The maximum reading during that 
period shall be used as the measurement.
    (3) Monitoring shall be performed at least once within the first 7 
days after replacement of the carbon bed occurs, and monthly thereafter 
until 10 days before the scheduled replacement time, at which point 
monitoring shall be done daily, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(4) 
and (e)(5) of this section.
    (4) If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum 
concentration point during the monthly monitoring or on the first day of 
daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, 
then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the 
daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed on the day after the last 
scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected, or 10 
days before the exceedance was detected, whichever is longer.
    (5) If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum 
concentration point during the daily monitoring as prescribed in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, except on the first day, then, after 
replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily 
monitoring of the replacement carbon bed 10 days before the exceedance 
was detected.
    (6) If the owner or operator is monitoring on the schedule required 
in paragraph (e)(4) or paragraph (e)(5) of this section, and the 
scheduled replacement time is reached without exceeding the maximum 
concentration point, the owner or operator may return to the monitoring 
schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for subsequent carbon beds.
    Note: This note provides an example of the monitoring schedules in 
paragraphs (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section. Assume that the 
scheduled replacement time for a non-regenerative carbon adsorber is the 
105th day after installation. According to the monitoring schedule in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, initial monitoring would be done 
within 7 days after installation, monthly monitoring would be done on 
the 30th, 60th and 90th days, and daily monitoring would begin on the 
95th day after installation. Now assume that an exceedance of the 
maximum concentration point is detected on the 90th day after 
installation. On the replacement carbon bed, the owner or operator would 
begin daily monitoring on the 61st day after installation (i.e., the day 
after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was 
detected), according to the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section. If, instead, the exceedance were detected on the first bed on 
the 95th day, the daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on 
the 85th day after installation (i.e., 10 days before the point in the 
cycle where the exceedance was detected); this is a second example of 
the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Finally, assume 
that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 
100th day after the first carbon adsorber was installed. According to 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section, daily monitoring of the replacement 
bed would begin on the 90th day after installation (i.e., 10 days 
earlier than when the exceedance was detected on the previous bed). In 
all of these examples, the initial monitoring of the replacement bed 
within 7 days of installation and the monthly monitoring would proceed 
as set out in paragraph (e)(3) of this section until daily monitoring 
was required.
    (f) For each vapor incinerator, the owner or operator shall comply 
with the monitoring requirements specified below:
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the 
manufacturer's specifications a temperature monitoring device equipped 
with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed 
in degrees Celsius or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]C, whichever is 
greater.
    (i) Where a vapor incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is 
used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the 
firebox.
    (ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring 
devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and 
after the catalyst bed.

[[Page 91]]

    (2) Comply with paragraph (f)(2)(i), paragraph (f)(2)(ii), or 
paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (i) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the 
manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of 
vent stream flow to the incinerator at least once every hour for each 
source. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from 
each source at a point closest to the inlet of each vapor incinerator 
and before being joined with any other vent stream.
    (ii) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the 
manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of 
vent stream flow away from the vapor incinerator at least once every 15 
minutes. The flow indicator shall be installed in each bypass line, 
immediately downstream of the valve that, if opened, would divert the 
vent stream away from the vapor incinerator.
    (iii) Where a valve that opens a bypass line is secured in the 
closed position with a car seal or a lock-and-key configuration, a flow 
indicator is not required. The owner or operator shall perform a visual 
inspection at least once every month to check the position of the valve 
and the condition of the car seal or lock-and-key configuration. The 
owner or operator shall also record the date and duration of each time 
that the valve was opened and the vent stream diverted away from the 
vapor incinerator.
    (g) In conducting the compliance tests required in Sec. 61.139(c), 
and measurements specified in Sec. 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), 
the owner or operator shall use as reference methods the test methods 
and procedures in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, or other methods as 
specified in this paragraph, except as specified in Sec. 61.13.
    (1) For compliance tests, as described in Sec. 61.139(c)(1), the 
following provisions apply.
    (i) All tests shall be run under representative emission 
concentration and vent flow rate conditions. For sources with 
intermittent flow rates, representative conditions shall include typical 
emission surges (for example, during the loading of a storage tank).
    (ii) Each test shall consist of three separate runs. These runs will 
be averaged to yield the volumetric flow rates and benzene 
concentrations in the equation in Sec. 61.139(c)(1). Each run shall be 
a minimum of 1 hour.
    (A) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, each run shall take place 
in one adsorption cycle, to include a minimum of 1 hour of sampling 
immediately preceding the initiation of carbon bed regeneration.
    (B) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, all runs can occur 
during one adsorption cycle.
    (iii) The measurements during the runs shall be paired so that the 
inlet and outlet to the control device are measured simultaneously.
    (iv) Method 1 or 1A shall be used as applicable for locating 
measurement sites.
    (v) Method 2, 2A, or 2D shall be used as applicable for measuring 
vent flow rates.
    (vi) Method 18 shall be used for determining the benzene 
concentrations (C<INF>aj</INF> and C<INF>bi</INF>). Either the 
integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure or the direct interface 
procedure may be used. A separation column constructed of stainless 
steel, 1.83 m by 3.2 mm, containing 10 percent 1,2,3-tris (2-
cyanoethoxy) propane (TECP) on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb P AW, with a 
column temperature of 80 [deg]C, a detector temperature of 225 [deg]C, 
and a flow rate of approximately 20 ml/min, may produce adequate 
separations. The analyst can use other columns, provided that the 
precision and accuracy of the analysis of benzene standards is not 
impaired. The analyst shall have available for review information 
confirming that there is adequate resolution of the benzene peak.
    (A) If the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure is used, 
the sample rate shall be adjusted to maintain a constant proportion to 
vent flow rate.
    (B) If the direct interface sampling and analysis procedure is used, 
then each performance test run shall be conducted in intervals of 5 
minutes. For each interval ``t,'' readings from each measurement shall 
be recorded, and the flow rate (Q<INF>aj</INF> or Q<INF>bi</INF>) and 
the corresponding benzene concentration (C<INF>aj</INF>

[[Page 92]]

or C<INF>bi</INF>) shall be determined. The sampling system shall be 
constructed to include a mixing chamber of a volume equal to 5 times the 
sampling flow rate per minute. Each analysis performed by the 
chromatograph will then represent an averaged emission value for a 5-
minute time period. The vent flow rate readings shall be timed to 
account for the total sample system residence time. A dual column, dual 
detector chromatograph can be used to achieve an analysis interval of 5 
minutes. The individual benzene concentrations shall be vent flow rate 
weighted to determine sample run average concentrations. The individual 
vent flow rates shall be time averaged to determine sample run average 
flow rates.
    (2) For testing the benzene concentration at the outlet vent of the 
carbon adsorber as specified under Sec. Sec. 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and 
(h)(3)(ii), the following provisions apply.
    (i) The measurement shall be conducted over one 5-minute period.
    (ii) The requirements in Sec. 61.139(g)(1)(i) shall apply to the 
extent practicable.
    (iii) The requirements in Sec. 61.139(g)(1)(vi) shall apply. 
Section 7.2 of method 18 shall be used as described in Sec. 
61.139(g)(1)(vi)(B) for benzene concentration measurements.
    (h) For each carbon adsorber, the maximum concentration point shall 
be expressed either as a benzene concentration or organic compound 
concentration level, whichever is to be indicated by the monitoring 
device chosen under Sec. 61.139 (d) or (e).
    (1) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:
    (i) No later than the deadline for the initial compliance test as 
specified in Sec. 61.139(c)(1);
    (ii) At the request of the Administrator; and
    (iii) At any time chosen by the owner or operator.
    (2) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:
    (i) On the first carbon bed to be installed in the adsorber;
    (ii) At the request of the Administrator;
    (iii) On the next carbon bed after the maximum concentration point 
has been exceeded (before the scheduled replacement time) for each of 
three previous carbon beds in the adsorber since the most recent 
determination; and
    (iv) At any other time chosen by the owner or operator.
    (3) The maximum concentration point for each carbon adsorber shall 
be determined through the simultaneous measurement of the outlet of the 
carbon adsorber with the monitoring device and Method 18, except as 
allowed in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
    (i) Several data points shall be collected according to a schedule 
determined by the owner or operator. The schedule shall be designed to 
take frequent samples near the expected maximum concentration point.
    (ii) Each data point shall consist of one 5-minute benzene 
concentration measurement using Method 18 as specified in Sec. 
61.139(g)(2), and of a simultaneous measurement by the monitoring 
device. The monitoring device measurement shall be conducted according 
to Sec. 61.139 (d) or (e), whichever is applicable.
    (iii) The maximum concentration point shall be the concentration 
level, as indicated by the monitoring device, for the last data point at 
which the benzene concentration is less than 2 percent of the average 
value of the benzene concentration at the inlet to the carbon adsorber 
during the most recent compliance test.
    (4) If the maximum concentration point is expressed as a benzene 
concentration, the owner or operator may determine it by calibrating the 
monitoring device with benzene at a concentration that is 2 percent of 
the average benzene concentration measured at the inlet to the carbon 
adsorber during the most recent compliance test. The reading on the 
monitoring device corresponding to the calibration concentration shall 
be the maximum concentration point. This method of determination would 
affect the owner or operator as follows:

[[Page 93]]

    (i) For a regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator is 
exempt from the provisions in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (ii) For a non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator 
is required to collect the data points in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section with only the monitoring device, and is exempt from the 
simultaneous Method 18 measurement.
    (5) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the demonstrated bed 
life shall be the carbon bed life, measured in days from the time the 
bed is installed until the maximum concentration point is reached, for 
the carbon bed that is used to determine the maximum concentration 
point.
    (i) The following recordkeeping requirements are applicable to 
owners and operators of control devices subject to Sec. 61.139. All 
records shall be kept updated and in a readily accessible location.
    (1) The following information shall be recorded for each control 
device for the life of the control device:
    (i) The design characteristics of the control device and a list of 
the source or sources vented to it.
    (ii) For each carbon absorber, a plan for the method for handling 
captured benzene and removed carbon to comply with paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (iii) The dates and descriptions of any changes in the design

show that the measurements of organic compound concentrations are 
reasonable indicators of benzene concentrations.
    (2) For each compliance test as specified in Sec. 61.139(c)(1), the 
date of the test, the results of the test, and other data needed to 
determine emissions shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 61.13(g) for 
at least 2 years or until the next compliance test on the control 
device, whichever is longer.
    (3) For each vapor incinerator, the average firebox temperature of 
the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of 
the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured and averaged 
over the most recent compliance test shall be recorded for at least 2 
years or until the next compliance test on the incinerator, whichever is 
longer.
    (4) For each carbon adsorber, for each determination of a maximum 
concentration point as specified in Sec. 61.139(h), the date of the 
determination, the maximum concentration point, and data needed to make 
the determination shall be recorded for at least 2 years or until the 
next maximum concentration point determination on the carbon adsorber, 
whichever is longer.
    (5) For each carbon absorber, the dates of and data from the 
monitoring required in Sec. 61.139(d) and (e), the date and time of 
replacement of each carbon bed, the date of each exceedance of the 
maximum concentration point, and a brief description of the corrective 
action taken shall be recorded for at least 2 years. Also, the 
occurrences when the captured benzene or spent carbon are not handled as 
required in Sec. 61.139(b)(1) and (2) shall be recorded for at least 2 
years.
    (6) For each vapor incinerator, the data from the monitoring 
required in Sec. 61.139(f)(1), the dates of all periods of operation 
during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent

operation during which the parameter boundaries are exceeded is a 3-hour 
period of operation during which:
    (i) For each vapor incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator, 
the average combustion temperature is more than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) 
below the average combustion temperature during the most recent 
performance test.
    (ii) For each catalytic incinerator, the average temperature of the 
vent stream immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 [deg]C 
(50 [deg]F) below the average temperature of the vent stream during the

    (c) Procedures for asbestos emission control. Each owner or operator 
of a demolition or renovation activity to whom this paragraph applies, 
according to paragraph (a) of this section, shall comply with the 
following procedures:
    (1) Remove all RACM from a facility being demolished or renovated 
before any activity begins that would break up, dislodge, or similarly 
disturb the material or preclude access to the material for subsequent 
removal. RACM need not be removed before demolition if:
    (i) It is Category I nonfriable ACM that is not in poor condition 
and is not friable.
    (ii) It is on a facility component that is encased in concrete or 
other similarly hard material and is adequately wet whenever exposed 
during demolition; or
    (iii) It was not accessible for testing and was, therefore, not 
discovered until after demolition began and, as a result of the 
demolition, the material cannot be safely removed. If not removed for 
safety reasons, the exposed RACM and any asbestos-contaminated debris 
must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and adequately wet 
at all times until disposed of.
    (iv) They are Category II nonfriable ACM and the probability is low 
that the materials will become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to 
powder during demolition.
    (2) When a facility component that contains, is covered with, or is 
coated with RACM is being taken out of the facility as a unit or in 
sections:
    (i) Adequately wet all RACM exposed during cutting or disjoining 
operations; and
    (ii) Carefully lower each unit or section to the floor and to ground 
level, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or 
disturbing the RACM.
    (3) When RACM is stripped from a facility component while it remains 
in place in the facility, adequately wet the RACM during the stripping 
operation.
    (i) In renovation operations, wetting is not required if:
    (A) The owner or operator has obtained prior written approval from 
the Administrator based on a written application that wetting to comply 
with this paragraph would unavoidably damage equipment or present a 
safety hazard; and
    (B) The owner or operator uses of the following emission control 
methods:

[[Page 104]]

    (1) A local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and 
operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the 
stripping and removal of the asbestos materials. The system must exhibit 
no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in 
accordance with the requirements in Sec. 61.152.
    (2) A glove-bag system designed and operated to contain the 
particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping of the asbestos 
materials.
    (3) Leak-tight wrapping to contain all RACM prior to dismantlement.
    (ii) In renovation operations where wetting would result in 
equipment damage or a safety hazard, and the methods allowed in 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section cannot be used, another method may 
be used after obtaining written approval from the Administrator based 
upon a determination that it is equivalent to wetting in controlling 
emissions or to the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section.
    (iii) A copy of the Administrator's written approval shall be kept 
at the worksite and made available for inspection.
    (4) After a facility component covered with, coated with, or 
containing RACM has been taken out of the facility as a unit or in 
sections pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, it shall be 
stripped or contained in leak-tight wrapping, except as described in 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If stripped, either:
    (i) Adequately wet the RACM during stripping; or
    (ii) Use a local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed 
and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by 
the stripping. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the 
outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the 
requirements in Sec. 61.152.
    (5) For large facility components such as reactor vessels, large 
tanks, and steam generators, but not beams (which must be handled in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section), the 
RACM is not required to be stripped if the following requirements are 
met:
    (i) The component is removed, transported, stored, disposed of, or 
reused without disturbing or damaging the RACM.
    (ii) The component is encased in a leak-tight wrapping.
    (iii) The leak-tight wrapping is labeled according to Sec. 
61.149(d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) during all loading and unloading 
operations and during storage.
    (6) For all RACM, including material that has been removed or 
stripped:
    (i) Adequately wet the material and ensure that it remains wet until 
collected and contained or treated in preparation for disposal in 
accordance with Sec. 61.150; and
    (ii) Carefully lower the material to the ground and floor, not 
dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the 
material.
    (iii) Transport the material to the ground via leak-tight chutes or 
containers if it has been removed or stripped more than 50 feet above 
ground level and was not removed as units or in sections.
    (iv) RACM contained in leak-tight wrapping that has been removed in 
accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section 
need not be wetted.
    (7) When the temperature at the point of wetting is below 0 [deg]C 
(32 [deg]F):
    (i) The owner or operator need not comply with paragraph (c)(2)(i) 
and the wetting provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall remove facility components 
containing, coated with, or covered with RACM as units or in sections to 
the maximum extent possible.
    (iii) During periods when wetting operations are suspended due to 
freezing temperatures, the owner or operator must record the temperature 
in the area containing the facility components at the beginning, middle, 
and end of each workday and keep daily temperature records available for 
inspection by the Administrator during normal business hours at the 
demolition or renovation site. The owner or operator shall retain the 
temperature records for at least 2 years.
    (8) Effective 1 year after promulgation of this regulation, no RACM 
shall

[[Page 105]]

be stripped, removed, or otherwise handled or disturbed at a facility 
regulated by this section unless at least one on-site representative, 
such as a foreman or management-level person or other authorized 
representative, trained in the provisions of this regulation and the 
means of complying with them, is present. Every 2 years, the trained on-
site individual shall receive refresher training in the provisions of 
this regulation. The required training shall include as a minimum: 
applicability; notifications; material identification; control 
procedures for removals including, at least, wetting, local exhaust 
ventilation, negative pressure enclosures, glove-bag procedures, and 
High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; waste disposal work 
practices; reporting and recordkeeping; and asbestos hazards and worker 
protection. Evidence that the required training has been completed shall 
be posted and made available for inspection by the Administrator at the 
demolition or renovation site.
    (9) For facilities described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
adequately wet the portion of the facility that contains RACM during the 
wrecking operation.
    (10) If a facility is demolished by intentional burning, all RACM 
including Category I and Category II nonfriable ACM must be removed in 
accordance with the NESHAP before burning.

Sec. 61.151  Standard for inactive waste disposal sites for asbestos
mills and manufacturing and fabricating operations.

    Each owner or operator of any inactive waste disposal site that was 
operated by sources covered under Sec. 61.142, 61.144, or 61.147 and 
received deposits of asbestos-containing waste material generated by the 
sources, shall:
    (a) Comply with one of the following:
    (1) Either discharge no visible emissions to the outside air from an 
inactive waste disposal site subject to this paragraph; or
    (2) Cover the asbestos-containing waste material with at least 15 
centimeters (6 inches) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, and 
grow and maintain a cover of vegetation on the area adequate to prevent 
exposure of the asbestos-containing waste material. In desert areas 
where vegetation would be difficult to maintain, at least 8 additional 
centimeters (3 inches) of well-graded, nonasbestos crushed rock may be 
placed on top of the final cover instead of vegetation and maintained to 
prevent emissions; or
    (3) Cover the asbestos-containing waste material with at least 60 
centimeters (2 feet) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, and 
maintain it to prevent exposure of the asbestos-containing waste; or
    (4) For inactive waste disposal sites for asbestos tailings, a 
resinous or petroleum-based dust suppression agent that effectively 
binds dust to control surface air emissions may be used instead of the 
methods in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section. Use the 
agent in the manner and frequency recommended for the particular 
asbestos tailings by the manufacturer of the dust suppression agent to 
achieve and maintain dust control. Obtain prior written approval of the 
Administrator to use other equally effective dust suppression agents. 
For purposes of this paragraph, any used, spent, or other waste oil is 
not considered a dust suppression agent.
    (b) Unless a natural barrier adequately deters access by the general 
public, install and maintain warning signs and fencing as follows, or 
comply with paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
    (1) Display warning signs at all entrances and at intervals of 100 m 
(328 ft) or less along the property line of the site or along the 
perimeter of the sections of the site where asbestos-containing waste 
material was deposited. The warning signs must:
    (i) Be posted in such a manner and location that a person can easily 
read the legend; and
    (ii) Conform to the requirements for 51 cmx36 cm 
(20<gr-thn-eq>x14<gr-thn-eq>) upright format signs specified in 29 CFR 
1910.145(d)(4) and this paragraph; and
    (iii) Display the following legend in the lower panel with letter 
sizes and styles of a visibility at least equal to those specified in 
this paragraph.

    (3) When requesting a determination on whether a natural barrier 
adequately deters public access, supply information enabling the 
Administrator to determine whether a fence or a natural barrier 
adequately deters access by the general public.
    (c) The owner or operator may use an alternative control method that 
has received prior approval of the Administrator rather than comply with 
the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (d) Notify the Administrator in writing at least 45 days prior to 
excavating or otherwise disturbing any asbestos-containing waste 
material that has been deposited at a waste disposal site under this 
section, and follow the procedures specified in the notification. If the 
excavation will begin on a date other than the one contained in the 
original notice, notice of the new start date must be provided to the 
Administrator at least 10 working days before excavation begins and in 
no event shall excavation begin earlier than the date specified in the 
original notification. Include the following information in the notice:
    (1) Scheduled starting and completion dates.
    (2) Reason for disturbing the waste.
    (3) Procedures to be used to control emissions during the 
excavation, storage, transport, and ultimate disposal of the excavated 
asbestos-containing waste material. If deemed necessary, the 
Administrator may require changes in the emission control procedures to 
be used.
    (4) Location of any temporary storage site and the final disposal 
site.
    (e) Within 60 days of a site becoming inactive and after the 
effective date of this subpart, record, in accordance with State law, a 
notation on the deed to the facility property and on any other 
instrument that would normally be examined during a title search; this 
notation will in perpetuity notify any potential purchaser of the 
property that:

process.
    (2) Results of analyses, using polarized light microscopy, that 
document the asbestos content of the wastes processed.
    (3) Results of analyses, using transmission electron microscopy, 
that document that the output materials are free of asbestos. Samples 
for analysis are to be collected as 8-hour composite samples (one 200-
gram (7-ounce) sample per hour), beginning with the initial introduction 
of RACM or asbestos-containing waste material and continuing until the 
end of the performance test.
    (4) A description of operating parameters, such as temperature and 
residence time, defining the full range over which the process is 
expected to operate to produce nonasbestos (asbestos-free) materials. 
Specify the limits for each operating parameter within which the process 
will produce nonasbestos (asbestos-free) materials.

  Sec. Appendix A to Subpart M of Part 61--Interpretive Rule Governing 
                         Roof Removal Operations

                 I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP

    1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more 
than one percent asbestos as determined using the methods specified in 
appendix E, subpart E, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light 
Microscopy. The NESHAP classifies ACM as either ``friable'' or 
``nonfriable''. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, 
pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM 
that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by 
hand pressure.
    1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM 
or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II ACM are distinguished 
from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. 
Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing gaskets, packings, resilient 
floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing 
products containing more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing 
products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-
containing single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-
containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof coatings and 
mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products 
that use other bituminous or resinous binders (such as coal tars or 
pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM 
includes all other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) 
shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing more than 
one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely 
to become friable when damaged than is Category I ACM. The applicability 
of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of 
the material at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of 
the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3) the amount of 
ACM involved.
    1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is 
referred to as ``regulated asbestos-containing material'' (RACM). RACM 
is defined in Sec. 61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable 
asbestos-containing material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has 
become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will be 
sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that 
has already been or is likely to become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced 
to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a 
renovation or demolition operation, then all friable ACM in the 
operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, 
are subject to the NESHAP.

      A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material

    1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family 
homes or on residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling 
units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the 
total asbestos-containing roof area undergoing renovation is less than 
160 ft\2\, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method 
to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its condition 
(friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would 
recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing 
material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating 
blade (RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing 
material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing 
roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft\2\ of that material will create 
160 ft\2\ of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, ``RB roof 
cutter'' means an engine-powered roof cutting machine with one or more 
rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with 
blades having sharp or tapered edges, and/or which does not use a 
rotating blade, is used for ``slicing'' rather than ``cutting'' the 
roofing material; such equipment is not included in the term ``RB roof 
cutter''.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof 
cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used 
to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, 
any project that is 5580 ft\2\ or greater is subject to the NESHAP; 
conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or 
equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove 
Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material in a roof 
removal project that is less than 5580 ft\2\, the project is not subject 
to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for 
demolitions. EPA further construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or 
other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on 
Category I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the 
area of roof to be removed.
    1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II 
roofing material), if the area of the roofing material to be removed is 
at least 160 ft\2\ and the removal methods will

[[Page 123]]

crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from 
other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 
ft\2\ or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the 
NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or other Category 
II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft\2\, the removal 
is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, 
except that notification is always required for demolitions. 40 CFR 
61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage 
asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. If A/C 
shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without 
160 ft\2\ or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, 
reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other ACM that has 
been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not 
subject to the NESHAP, even where the total area of the roofing material 
to be removed exceeds 160 ft\2\; provided, however, that if the 
renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal 
operation is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation 
activities exceeds 160 ft\2\. See the definition of regulated asbestos-
containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141.
    1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can 
qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore, to determine if a 
removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is 
subject to the NESHAP, any suspect roofing material (i.e. roofing 
material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such 
roofing material contains more than one percent asbestos and if the 
removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified 
and the work practices in Sec. 61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's 
view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of 
suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for 
asbestos if the contractor follows the notification and work practice 
requirements of the NESHAP.

            B. A/C Shingle Removal (Category II ACM Removal)

    1.B.1. A/C shingles, which are Category II nonfriable ACM, become 
regulated ACM if the material has a high probability of becoming or has 
become crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by the forces expected 
to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation 
operations. 40 CFR 61.141. However, merely breaking an A/C shingle (or 
any other category II ACM) that is not friable may not necessarily cause 
the material to become RACM. A/C shingles are typically nailed to 
buildings on which they are attached. EPA believes that the extent of 
breakage that will normally result from carefully removing A/C shingles 
and lowering the shingles to the ground will not result in crumbling, 
pulverizing or reducing the shingles to powder. Conversely, the extent 
of breakage that will normally occur if the A/C shingles are dropped 
from a building or scraped off of a building with heavy machinery would 
cause the shingles to become RACM. EPA therefore construes the NESHAP to 
mean that the removal of A/C shingles that are not friable, using 
methods that do not crumble, pulverize, or reduce the A/C shingles to 
powder (such as pry bars, spud bars and shovels to carefully pry the 
material), is not subject to the NESHAP provided that the A/C shingles 
are properly handled during and after removal, as discussed in this 
paragraph and the asbestos NESHAP. This interpretation also applies to 
other Category II nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing materials.

 C. Cutting vs. Slicing and Manual Methods for Removal of Category I ACM

    1.C.1. Because of damage to the roofing material, and the potential 
for fiber release, roof removal operations using rotating blade (RB) 
roof cutters or other equipment that sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof 
material are subject to the NESHAP. As EPA interprets the NESHAP, the 
use of certain manual methods (using equipment such as axes, hatchets, 
or knives, spud bars, pry bars, and shovels, but not saws) or methods 
that slice, shear, or punch (using equipment such as a power slicer or 
power plow) does not constitute ``cutting, sanding, grinding or 
abrading.'' This is because these methods do not destroy the structural 
matrix or integrity of the material such that the material is crumbled, 
pulverized or reduced to powder. Hence, it is EPA's interpretation that 
when such methods are used, assuming the roof material is not friable, 
the removal operation is not subject to the regulation.
    1.C.2. Power removers or power tear-off machines are typically used 
to pry the roofing material up from the deck after the roof membrane has 
been cut. It is EPA's interpretation that when these machines are used 
to pry roofing material up, their use is not regulated by the NESHAP.
    1.C.3. As noted previously, the NESHAP only applies to the removal 
of asbestos-containing roofing materials. Thus, the NESHAP does not 
apply to the use of RB cutters to remove non-asbestos built up roofing 
(BUR). On roofs containing some asbestos-containing and some non-
asbestos-containing materials, coverage under the NESHAP depends on the 
methods used to remove each type of material in addition to other 
coverage thresholds specified above. For example, it is not uncommon for 
existing roofs to be made of non-asbestos BUR and base flashings that do 
contain asbestos. In that situation, EPA construes the

[[Page 124]]

NESHAP to be inapplicable to the removal of the non-asbestos BUR using 
an RB cutter so long as the RB cutter is not used to cut 5580 ft\2\ or 
more of the asbestos-containing base flashing or other asbestos-
containing material into sections. In addition, the use of methods that 
slice, shear, punch or pry could then be used to remove the asbestos 
flashings and not trigger coverage under the NESHAP.

                            II. Notification

    2.1. Notification for a demolition is always required under the 
NESHAP. However, EPA believes that few roof removal jobs constitute 
``demolitions'' as defined in the NESHAP (Sec. 61.141). In particular, 
it is EPA's view that the removal of roofing systems (i.e., the roof 
membrane, insulation, surfacing, coatings, flashings, mastic, shingles, 
and felt underlayment), when such removal is not a part of a demolition 
project, constitutes a ``renovation'' under the NESHAP. If the operation 
is a renovation, and Category I roofing material is being removed using 
either manual methods or slicing, notification is not required by the 
NESHAP. If Category II material is not friable and will be removed 
without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, no 
notification is required. Also, if the renovation involves less than the 
threshold area for applicability as discussed above, then no 
notification is required. However, if a roof removal meets the 
applicability and threshold requirements under the NESHAP, then EPA (or 
the delegated agency) must be notified in advance of the removal in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 61.145(b), as follows:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Notification must be given in writing at least 10 
working days in advance and must include the information in Sec. 
61.145(b)(4), except for emergency renovations as discussed below.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The notice must be updated as necessary, 
including, for example, when the amount of asbestos-containing roofing 
material reported changes by 20 percent or more.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> EPA must be notified if the start date of the 
roof removal changes. If the start date of a roof removal project is 
changed to an earlier date, EPA must be provided with a written notice 
of the new start date at least 10 working days in advance. If the start 
date changes to a later date, EPA must be notified by telephone as soon 
as possible before the original start date and a written notice must be 
sent as soon as possible.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> For emergency renovations (as defined in Sec. 
61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety or public 
health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the 
notification must be postmarked or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, 
but no later than the following work day.

                     III. Emission Control Practices

   A. Requirements To Adequately Wet and Discharge No Visible Emission

    3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal 
operations include requirements that the affected material be adequately 
wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of 
properly. The requirements for disposal of waste materials are discussed 
separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements 
discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that 
are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section I above.
    3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation 
(Sec. Sec. 61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires that RACM be 
adequately wet (as defined in Sec. 61.141) during the operation that 
damages or disturbs the asbestos material until collected for disposal.
    3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, 
grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to remove Category I 
asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements 
of Sec. 61.145(c) apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will 
consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the 
``adequately wet'' and ``discharge no visible emission'' requirements of 
the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated with the 
following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and 
extends down close to the roof surface; and (2) a device for spraying a 
fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in 
operation during the cutting of the roof.

                 B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements

    3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may 
not be required during the cutting of Category I asbestos roofing 
material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with 
Sec. 61.145(c)(3)(i), that wetting will unavoidably damage the 
building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard 
while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, 
the roof removal operation will be exempted from the requirement to wet 
during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to 
base such a decision. Before proceeding with a dry removal, the 
contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions 
will be made on a case-by-case basis.
    3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the 
wetting requirements are not necessary. Where EPA grants an exemption 
from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage 
to equipment within the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP 
specifies alternative control methods (Sec. 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)).

[[Page 125]]

Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust 
ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do not produce visible 
emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 61.152, or (c) other methods that have 
received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative 
emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has 
received written approval from EPA and the method is being implemented 
consistent with the approved procedures (Sec. 61.145(c)(3)(ii) or Sec. 
61.152(b)(3)).
    3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or 
roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is below freezing, as 
specified in Sec. 61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated 
as the reason for not wetting, records must be kept of the temperature 
at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not 
performed and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 
years. 42 CFR Sec. 61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation that 
in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the 
Administrator is needed for using emission control methods listed in 
Sec. 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that 
have been previously approved by the Administrator. However, such 
written application or approval is required for alternative emission 
control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and 
debris collected from cutting must still be kept wet and placed in 
containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste 
disposal would continue to apply as described elsewhere in this notice 
and the Asbestos NESHAP.

                    C. Waste Collection and Handling

    3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing 
and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand or abrade Category I 
nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the 
NESHAP and can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further 
construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material 
(such as A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, 
pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from the removal is not 
subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets 
the NESHAP to be inapplicable to waste resulting from roof removal 
operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described 
in section I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal 
regulations may apply.
    3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or 
other method that similarly damages the roofing material, is used to cut 
Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material 
from the cut (the sawdust or debris) is considered asbestos containing 
waste subject to Sec. 61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage 
thresholds discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This 
sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated in 
accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the 
NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free of the sawdust and 
debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is 
collected as discussed below in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 
3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste 
because it is considered to be Category I nonfriable material (as long 
as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is 
Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further 
sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material). EPA further believes that 
if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris, i.e., it is 
contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste 
material and be handled in accordance with Sec. 61.150.
    3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an 
RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the roofing material) 
to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and 
debris resulting from the cutting of the roof should be collected as 
soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until 
collected and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where 
the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends down close to 
the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist 
of water inside the blade guard, and the spraying device is in operation 
during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be 
confined along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust 
and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or vacuum up the 
damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum 
cleaner or debris collector that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 
to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the 
bulk of the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets 
the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the remainder 
of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate 
roofs), sweeping up the debris and then wet wiping the surface may be 
done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that 
if these decontamination procedures are followed, the remaining roofing 
material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos 
waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination 
procedures are followed, if the remaining portions of the roof are non-
asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the 
remaining portions are removed using removal methods that slice, shear, 
punch or

[[Page 126]]

pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining portions do 
not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the 
NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements are not 
applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's 
interpretation, the failure of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris 
collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material 
created by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing 
material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste, provided that 
such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by 
gentle sweeping) and disposed of as asbestos waste. Other methods of 
decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local 
delegated agency.
    3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is 
not collected immediately, it will be necessary to lightly mist the dust 
or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in 
containers. The dust or debris should be lightly misted frequently 
enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne 
emissions, prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's 
interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed, the 
remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of 
as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining roof material is in fact 
nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the 
removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof 
material.
    3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing 
material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided the 
roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the 
appearance of rough, jagged or damaged edges on the remaining roofing 
material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that 
such remaining roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos 
waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if the sawdust 
or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected 
as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust 
along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such 
material ``friable'' for purposes of this interpretive rule or the 
NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the 
cutting operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near 
the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting operation. Where 
roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of 
the RB cutter (i.e. where such remaining roofing material near the 
cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand 
pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant 
will ensure that such friable material need not be treated or disposed 
of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied 
to the friable material after the roofing material has been collected 
into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's 
view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is 
followed in operations where roofing material near the cutline has been 
rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the 
decontamination procedures set forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been 
followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet 
requirements would be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the 
remaining roofing material.
    3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and debris 
from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such as plastic 
bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels required by OSHA 
(29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers must have labels that 
identify the waste generator (such as the name of the roofing 
contractor, abatement contractor, and/or building owner or operator) and 
the location of the site at which the waste was generated.

                           IV. Waste Disposal

                        A. Disposal Requirements

    4.A.1. Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is practical, all 
collected dust and debris from cutting as well as any contaminated 
roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in 
accordance with Sec. 61.154 or to an EPA-approved site that converts 
asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with Sec. 61.155. 
During the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning 
signs must be affixed to the vehicles.

                        B. Waste Shipment Record

    4.B.1. For each load of asbestos waste that is regulated under the 
NESHAP, a waste shipment record (WSR) must be maintained in accordance 
with Sec. 61.150(d). Information that must be maintained for each waste 
load includes the following:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Name, address, and telephone number of the waste 
generator
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Name and address of the local, State, or EPA 
regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP 
program
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Quantity of waste in cubic meters (or cubic 
yards)
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Name and telephone number of the disposal site 
operator
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Name and physical site location of the disposal 
site
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Date transported
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Name, address, and telephone number of the 
transporter(s)
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Certification that the contents meet all 
government regulations for transport by highways.

[[Page 127]]

    4.B.2. The waste generator is responsible for ensuring that a copy 
of the WSR is delivered to the disposal site along with the waste 
shipment. If a copy of the WSR signed by the disposal site operator is 
not returned to the waste generator within 35 days, the waste generator 
must contact the transporter and/or the disposal site to determine the 
status of the waste shipment. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(3). If the signed WSR is 
not received within 45 days, the waste generator must report, in 
writing, to the responsible NESHAP program agency and send along a copy 
of the WSR. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(4). Copies of WSRs, including those signed 
by the disposal site operator, must be retained for at least 2 years. 40 
CFR 61.150(d)(5).

                               V. Training

    5.1. For those roof removals that are subject to the NESHAP, at 
least one on-site supervisor trained in the provisions of the NESHAP 
must be present during the removal of the asbestos roofing material. 40 
CFR 61.145(c)(8). In EPA's view, this person can be a job foreman, a 
hired consultant, or someone who can represent the building owner or 
contractor responsible for the removal. In addition to the initial 
training requirement, a refresher training course is required every 2 
years. The NESHAP training requirements became effective on November 20, 
1991.
    5.2. Asbestos training courses developed specifically to address 
compliance with the NESHAP in roofing work, as well as courses developed 
for other purposes can satisfy this requirement of the NESHAP, as long 
as the course covers the areas specified in the regulation. EPA believes 
that Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) training courses 
will, for example, satisfy the NESHAP training requirements. However, 
nothing in this interpretive rule or in the NESHAP shall be deemed to 
require that roofing contractors or roofing workers performing 
operations covered by the NESHAP must be trained or accredited under 
AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement 
Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). Likewise, state or local authorities may 
independently impose additional training, licensing, or accreditation 
requirements on roofing contractors performing operations covered by the 
NESHAP, but such additional training, licensing or accreditation is not 
called for by this interpretive rule or the federal NESHAP.
    5.3. For removal of Category I asbestos containing roofing material 
where RB roof cutters or equipment that similarly damages the asbestos-
containing roofing material are used, the NESHAP training requirements 
(Sec. 61.145(c)(8)) apply as discussed in Section I above. It is EPA's 
intention that removal of Category I asbestos-containing roofing 
material using hatchets, axes, knives, and/or the use of spud bars, pry 
bars and shovels to lift the roofing material, or similar removal 
methods that slice, punch, or shear the roof membrane are not subject to 
the training requirements, since these methods do not cause the roof 
removal to be subject to the NESHAP. Likewise, it is EPA's intention 
that roof removal operations involving Category II nonfriable ACM are 
not subject to the training requirements where such operations are not 
subject to the NESHAP as discussed in section I above.

                     From Glass Manufacturing Plants

    Source: 51 FR 28025, Aug. 4, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 61.160  Applicability and designation of source.

    (a) The source to which this subpart applies is each glass melting 
furnace that uses commercial arsenic as a raw material. This subpart 
does not apply to pot furnaces.
    (b) Rebricking is not considered construction or modification for 
the purposes of Sec. 61.05(a).


<R05>
Sec. 61.161  Definitions.

    The terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 
Sec. 61.02, or in this section as follows:
    Arsenic-containing glass type means any glass that is distinguished 
from other glass solely by the weight percent of arsenic added as a raw 
material and by the weight percent of arsenic in the glass produced. Any 
two or more glasses that have the same weight percent of arsenic in the 
raw materials as well as in the glass produced shall be considered to 
belong to one arsenic-containing glass type, without regard to the 
recipe used or any other characteristics of the glass or the method of 
production.
    By-pass the control device means to operate the glass melting 
furnace without operating the control device to which that furnace's 
emissions are directed routinely.
    Commercial arsenic means any form of arsenic that is produced by 
extraction

[[Page 128]]

from any arsenic-containing substance and is intended for sale or for 
intentional use in a manufacturing process. Arsenic that is a naturally 
occurring trace constituent of another substance is not considered 
``commercial arsenic.''
    Cullet means waste glass recycled to a glass melting furnace.
    Glass melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in 
which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature, refined, 
and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations, 
superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat 
exchangers, melter cooling system, exhaust system, refractory brick 
work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control 
systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and 
distributing molten glass to forming apparatuses. The forming 
apparatuses, including the float bath used in flat glass manufacturing, 
are not considered part of the glass melting furnace.
    Glass produced means the glass pulled from the glass melting 
furnace.
    Inorganic arsenic means the oxides and other noncarbon compounds of 
the element arsenic included in particulate matter, vapors, and 
aerosols.
    Malfunction means any sudden failure of air pollution control 
equipment or process equipment or of a process to operate in a normal or 
usual manner so that emissions of arsenic are increased.
    Pot furnace means a glass melting furnace that contains one or more 
refractory vessels in which glass is melted by indirect heating. The 
openings of the vessels are in the outside wall of the furnace and are 
covered with refractory stoppers during melting.
    Rebricking means cold replacement of damaged or worn refractory 
parts of the glass melting furnace. Rebricking includes replacement of 
the refractories comprising the bottom, sidewalls, or roof of the 
melting vessel; replacement of refractory work in the heat exchanger; 
and replacement of refractory portions of the glass conditioning and 
distribution system.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source for 
any purpose.
    Theoretical arsenic emissions factor means the amount of inorganic 
arsenic, expressed in grams per kilogram of glass produced, as 
determined based on a material balance.
    Uncontrolled total arsenic emissions means the total inorganic 
arsenic in the glass melting furnace exhaust gas preceding any add-on 
emission control device.

    (c) An owner or operator of a source subject to the requirements of 
this section may, after approval by the Administrator, bypass the 
control device to which arsenic emissions from the furnace are directed 
for a limited period of time for designated purposes such as maintenance 
of the control device, as specified in Sec. 61.165(e).
    (d) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction, the owner or operator of a glass melting furnace subject to 
the provisions of this subpart shall operate and maintain the furnace 
and associated air pollution control equipment in a manner

[[Page 129]]

consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing 
emissions of inorganic arsenic to the atmosphere to the maximum extent 
practicable. Determination of whether acceptable operating and 
maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information 
available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited 
to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, 
inspection of the source, and review of other records.

Sec. 61.163  Emission monitoring.

    (a) An owner or operator of a glass melting furnace subject to the 
emission limit in Sec. 61.162(a)(2) or Sec. 61.162(b)(2) shall:
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous 
monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions 
discharged into the atmosphere from the control device; and
    (2) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring device 
for the continuous measurement of the temperature of the gas entering 
the control device.
    (b) All continuous monitoring systems and monitoring devices shall 
be installed and operational prior to performance of an emission test 
required by Sec. 61.164(a). Verification of operational status shall, 
at a minimum, consist of an evaluation of the monitoring system in 
accordance with the requirements and procedures contained in Performance 
Specification 1 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60.
    (c) During the emission test required in Sec. 61.164(a) each owner 
or operator subject to paragraph (a) of this section shall:
    (1) Conduct continuous opacity monitoring from the beginning of the 
first test run until the completion of the third test run. Process and 
control equipment shall be operated in a manner that will minimize 
opacity of emissions, subject to the Administrator's approval.
    (2) Calculate 6-minute opacity averages from 24 or more data points 
equally spaced over each 6-minute period during the test runs.
    (3) Determine, based on the 6-minute opacity averages, the opacity

or log-normal (whichever the owner or operator determines is more 
representative) distribution of the average opacity values.
    (4) Conduct continuous monitoring of the temperature of the gas 
entering the control device from the beginning of the first test run 
until completion of the third test run.
    (5) Calculate 15-minute averages of the temperature of the gas

61.162(b)(2).
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 60.13(d) and Sec. 60.13(f) shall 
apply to an owner or operator subject to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Except for system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero and span adjustments required under Sec. 60.13(d), all continuous 
monitoring systems shall be in continuous operation and shall meet 
minimum frequency of operation requirements by completing a minimum of 
one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period 
and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.
    (g) An owner or operator subject to paragraph (a) of this section 
shall:
    (1) Reduce all opacity data to 6-minute averages. Six-minute 
averages shall be calculated from 24 or more data points equally spaced 
over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during periods of monitoring 
system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span 
adjustments shall not be included in the data averages calculated under 
this paragraph, and
    (2) Calculate 15-minute averages of the temperature of the gas 
entering the control device for each 15-minute operating period.
    (h) After receipt and consideration of written application, the 
Administrator may approve alternative monitoring systems for the 
measurement of one or more process or operating parameters that is or 
are demonstrated to enable

[[Page 130]]

accurate and representative monitoring of a properly operating control 
device. Upon approval of an alternative monitoring system for an 
affected source, the Administrator will specify requirements to replace 
the requirements of paragraphs (a)--(g) of this section for that system.

<R05>
Sec. 61.164  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 61.162, the owner or 
operator shall conduct emission tests, reduce test data, and follow the 
procedures specified in this section unless the Administrator:
    (1) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a reference 
method with minor changes in methodology;
    (2) Approves the use of an equivalent method;
    (3) Approves the use of an alternative method the results of which 
he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific 
source is in compliance; or
    (4) Waives the requirement for emission tests as provided under 
Sec. 61.13.
    (b) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained, the owner or 
operator shall conduct emission tests required by this section:
    (1) No later than 90 days after the effective date of this subpart 
for a source that has an initial startup date preceding the effective 
date; or
    (2) No later than 90 days after startup for a source that has an 
initial startup date after the effective date.
    (3) At such other times as may be required by the Administrator 
under section 114 of the Act.
    (4) While the source is operating under such conditions as the 
Administrator may specify, based on representative performance of the 
source.
    (c) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 61.162(a)(1) when less than 
8.0 Mg (8.8 ton) per year of elemental arsenic is added to any existing 
glass melting furnace, or to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 
61.162(b)(1) when less than 1.0 Mg (1.1 ton) per year of elemental 
arsenic is added to any new or modified glass melting furnace, an owner 
or operator shall:
    (1) Derive a theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emission factor (T), 
based on material balance calculations for each arsenic-containing glass 
type (i) produced during the 12-month period, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.483

Where:

T<INF>i</INF> = The theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emission factor for 
each glass type (i), g/kg (lb/ton).

produced for each glass type (i), g/kg (lb/ton).
B<INF>gi</INF> = Weight of elemental arsenic per unit weight of glass 
produced for each glass type (i), g/kg (lb/ton).

    (2) Estimate theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emissions for the 12-
month period for each arsenic-containing glass type as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.484

Where:

Y<INF>i</INF> = Theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emission estimate for 
the 12-month period for each glass type, Mg/year (ton/year).

[[Page 131]]

each type of glass (i) produced during the 12-month period as calculated 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, g/kg (lb/ton).
G<INF>i</INF> = Quantity of each arsenic-containing glass type (i) 
produced during the 12-month period, kg/yr (ton/yr).
K = conversion factor for unit consistency, 10\6\ g/Mg (2,000 lb/ton).

    (3) Estimate the total theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emissions 
for the 12-month period by finding the sum of the values calculated for 
Y<INF>i</INF> in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (4) If the value determined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is 
equal to or greater than the applicable limit in Sec. 61.162(a)(1) or 
(b)(1), conduct the emission testing and calculations described in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. If the value is less 
than the applicable limit, the source is in compliance and no emission 
testing or additional calculations are required.
    (d) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 61.162(a)(1) when 8.0 Mg 
(8.8 ton) per year or more of elemental arsenic are added to any 
existing glass melting furnace, or to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 
61.162(b)(1) when 1.0 Mg (1.1 ton) per year or more of elemental arsenic 
is added to any new or modified glass melting furnace, an owner or 
operator shall:
    (1) Estimate the theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emissions for each 
glass type for the 12-month period by performing the calculations 
described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Conduct emission testing to determine the actual uncontrolled 
arsenic emission rate during production of the arsenic-containing glass 
type with the highest theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emissions as 
calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owner or operator 
shall use the following test methods and procedures:
    (i) Use Method 108 in appendix B to this part for determinig the 
arsenic emission rate, g/hr (lb/hr). The emission rate shall equal the 
arithmetic mean of the results of three 60-minute test runs.
    (ii) Use the following methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60:
    (A) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverse.
    (B) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flowrate.
    (C) Method 3 for gas analysis.
    (D) For sources equipped with positive pressure fabric filters, use 
Section 8.0 of Method 5D to determine a suitable sampling location and 
procedure.
    (3) Determine the actual uncontrolled arsenic emission factor 
(R<INF>a</INF>) as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.485

Where:

R<INF>a</INF> = Actual uncontrolled arsenic emission factor, g/kg (lb/
ton).
E<INF>a</INF> = Actual uncontrolled arsenic emission rate from paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, g/hr (lb/hr).
P = Rate of glass production, kg/hr (ton/hr), determined by dividing the 
weight of glass pulled from the furnace during the emission test by the 
number of hours taken to perform the test under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.

    (4) Calculate a correction factor to relate the theoretical and the 
actual uncontrolled arsenic emission factors as follows:

F = R<INF>a</INF> / T<INF>i</INF>

Where:
F=the correction factor.
R<INF>a</INF> = Actual uncontrolled arsenic emission factor, determined 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, g/kg (lb/ton).
T<INF>i</INF> = Theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emission factor, g/kg 
(lb/ton), determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the same 
glass type for which R<INF>a</INF> was determined.

    (5) Determine the uncontrolled arsenic emission rate for the 12-
month period, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.486

Where:

U = Uncontrolled arsenic emission rate for the 12-month period, Mg/yr 
(ton/yr).
T<INF>i</INF> = Theoretical uncontrolled arsenic emission factor for 
each type of glass (i) produced during the 12-month period as calculated 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, g/kg (lb/ton).

source is in compliance.
    (e) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 61.162(a)(2) or (b)(2), an 
owner or operator shall:
    (1) Conduct emission testing to determine the percent reduction of 
inorganic arsenic emissions being achieved by the control device, using 
the following test methods and procedures:
    (i) Use Method 108 in appendix B to this part to determine the 
concentration of arsenic in the gas streams entering and exiting the 
control device. Conduct three 60-minute test runs, each consisting of 
simultaneous testing of the inlet and outlet gas streams. The gas 
streams shall contain all the gas exhausted from the glass melting 
furnace.
    (ii) Use the following methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60:
    (A) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses.
    (B) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flowrate.
    (C) Method 3 for gas analysis.
    (D) For sources equipped with positive pressure fabric filters, use 
Section 8.0 of Method 5D to determine a suitable sampling location and 
procedure.
    (2) Calculate the percent emission reduction for each run as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.052

Where:

D= the percent emission reduction.
C<INF>b</INF>= the arsenic concentration of the stack gas entering the 
control device, as measured by Method 108.
C<INF>a</INF>= the arsenic concentration of the stack gas exiting the 
control device, as measured by Method 108.

    (3) Determine the average percent reduction of arsenic by 
calculating the arithmetic mean of the results for the three runs. If it 
is at least 85 percent, the source is in compliance.

[[Page 135]]


<R05>
Sec. 61.172  Standard for new and existing sources.

    (a) The provisions of paragraphs (b)-(f) of this section do not 
apply to any copper converter at a facility where the total arsenic 
charging rate for the copper converter department averaged over a 1-year 
period is less than 75 kg/hr (165 lb/hr), as determined under Sec. 
61.174(f).
    (b) The owner or operator of each copper converter subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall reduce inorganic arsenic emissions to 
the atmosphere by meeting the following design, equipment, work 
practice, and operational requirements:
    (1) Install, operate, and maintain a secondary hood system on each 
copper converter. Each secondary hood system shall consist of a hood 
enclosure, air curtain fan(s), exhaust system fan(s), and ductwork that 
conveys the captured emissions to a control device, and shall meet the 
following specifications:
    (i) The configuration and dimensions of the hood enclosure shall be 
such that the copper converter mouth, charging ladles, skimming ladles, 
and any other material transfer vessels used will be housed within the 
confines or influence of the hood enclosure during each mode of copper 
converter operation.
    (ii) The back of the hood enclosure shall be fully enclosed and 
sealed against the primary hood. Portions of the side-walls in contact 
with the copper converter shall be sealed against the converter.
    (iii) Openings in the top and front of the hood enclosure to allow 
for the entry and egress of ladles and crane appartus shall be minimized 
to the fullest extent practicable.
    (iv) The hood enclosure shall be fabricated in such a manner and of 
materials of sufficient strength to withstand incidental contact with 
ladles and crane apparatus with no significant damage.
    (v) One side-wall of the hood enclosure shall be equipped with a 
horizontal-slotted plenum along the top, and the opposite side-wall 
shall be equipped with an exhaust hood. The horizontal-slotted plenum 
shall be designed to allow the distance from the base to the top of the 
horizontal slot to be adjustable up to a dimension of 76 mm.
    (vi) The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be connected to a fan. When 
activated, the fan shall push air through the horizontal slot, producing 
a horizontal air curtain above the copper converter that is directed to 
the exhaust hood. The fan power output installed shall be sufficient to 
overcome static pressure losses through the ductwork upstream of the 
horizontal-slotted plenum and across the plenum, and to deliver at least 
22,370 watts (30 air horsepower) at the horizontal-slotted plenum 
discharge.
    (vii) The exhaust hood shall be sized to completely intercept the 
airstream from the horizontal-slotted plenum combined with the 
additional airflow resulting from entrainment of the surrounding air. 
The exhaust hood shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan 
shall pull the combined airstream into the exhaust hood.
    (viii) The entire secondary hood system shall be equipped with 
dampers and instrumentation, as appropriate, so that the desired air 
curtain and exhaust flow are maintained during each mode of copper 
converter operation.
    (2) Optimize the capture of secondary inorganic arsenic emissions by 
operating the copper converter and secondary hood system at all times as 
follows:
    (i) Copper converter. (A) Increase the air curtain and exhaust flow 
rates to their optimum conditions prior to raising the primary hood and 
rolling the copper converter out for charging, skimming, or pouring.
    (B) Once rolled out, prior to the commencement of skimming or 
pouring, hold the copper converter in an idle position until fuming from 
the molten bath has been minimized.
    (C) During skimming, raise the receiving ladle off the ground and 
position the ladle as close to the copper converter mouth as possible to 
minimize the drop distance between the converter mouth and the receiving 
ladle.
    (D) Control the rate of flow into the receiving ladle to the extent 
practicable to minimize fuming.

[[Page 136]]

    (E) Upon the completion of each charge, withdraw the charging ladle 
or vessel used from the confines of the secondary hood in a slow, 
deliberate manner.
    (F) During charging, skimming, or pouring, ensure that the crane 
block does not disturb the air flow between the horizontal-slotted 
plenum and the exhaust hood.
    (ii) Secondary hood system. (A) Operate the secondary hood system 
under conditions that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic 
arsenic emissions.
    (B) Within 30 days after the effective date of this subpart, or 
within 30 days after the initial operation of each secondary hood 
system, whichever comes later, provide to the Administrator a list of 
operating conditions for the secondary hood system that will result in 
the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions. This list shall 
specify the operating parameters for the following:
    (1) The dimensions of the horizontal slot.
    (2) The velocity of air through the horizontal slot during each mode 
of converter operation.
    (3) The distance from the horizontal slot to the exhaust hood.
    (4) The face velocity at the opening of the exhaust hood during each 
mode of converter operation.
    (C) Operate the secondary hood system under the conditions listed in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, unless otherwise specified by 
the Administrator.
    (D) Notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days if there is 
any change in the operating conditions submitted pursuant to the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) that will result in any 
reduction in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.
    (3) Comply with the following inspection and maintenance 
requirements after installing the secondary hood system required in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
    (i) At least once every month, visually inspect the components of 
the secondary hood system that are exposed to potential damage from 
crane and ladle operation, including the hood enclosure, side- and back-
wall hood seals, and the horizontal slot.
    (ii) Replace or repair any defective or damaged components of the 
secondary hood system within 30 days after discovering the defective or 
damaged components.
    (c) No owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall cause or allow to be discharged into 
the atmosphere any copper converter secondary emissions that exit from a 
control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 11.6 mg/dscm 
(0.0051 gr/dscf).
    (d) The owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall submit a description of a plan for 
control of inorganic arsenic emissions from the copper converter and 
associated air pollution control equipment. This plan shall be submitted 
within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, unless a waiver 
of compliance is granted under Sec. 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is 
granted, the plan shall be submitted on a date set by the Administrator. 
Approval of the plan will be granted by the Administrator provided he 
finds that:
    (1) It includes a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions 
and for reporting them immediately to smelter supervisory personnel.
    (2) It specifies the procedures that will be followed to ensure that 
equipment or process breakdowns due entirely or in part to poor 
maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur.
    (3) It specifies the measures that will be taken to ensure 
compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e) The owner or operator shall implement the plan required under 
paragraph (d) of this section unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator.
    (f) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction, the owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall operate and maintain the converter and 
associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with 
good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions of 
inorganic arsenic to the atmosphere to

[[Page 137]]

the maximum extent practicable. Determination of whether acceptable 
operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on 
information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is 
not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance 
procedures, inspection of the source, and review of other records.

in continuous operation and meets frequency of operation requirements by 
completing a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analysis for each 
successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each 
successive 6-minute period. Each data point shall represent the opacity 
measured for one cycle of sampling and analysis and shall be expressed 
as percent opacity.
    (b) Except as required in paragraph (c) of this section, calculate

Sec. 61.207  Radium-226 sampling and measurement procedures.

    (a) Before removing phosphogypsum from a stack for distribution in 
commerce pursuant to Sec. 61.204, or Sec. 61.206, the owner or 
operator of a phosphogypsum stack shall measure the average radium-226 
concentration at the location in the stack from which phosphogypsum will 
be removed. Measurements shall be performed for each such location prior 
to the initial distribution in commerce of phosphogypsum removed from 
that location and at least once during each calendar year while 
distribution of phosphogypsum removed from the location continues.
    (1) A minimum of 30 phosphogypsum samples shall be taken at 
regularly spaced intervals across the surface of the location on the 
stack from which the phosphogypsum will be removed. Let n<INF>1</INF> 
represent the number of samples taken.
    (2) Measure the radium-226 concentration of each of the 
n<INF>1</INF> samples in accordance with the analytical procedures 
described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 114.
    (3) Calculate the mean, x<INF>1</INF>, and the standard deviation, 
s<INF>1</INF>, of the n<INF>1</INF> radium-226 concentrations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03FE99.054

Where x<INF>1</INF> and s<INF>1</INF> are expressed in pCi/g.

    (4) Calculate the 95th percentile for the distribution, x*, using 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03FE99.055

Where x* is expressed in pCi/g.

    (5) If the purpose for removing phosphogypsum from a stack is for 
distribution to commerce pursuant to Sec. 61.206, the owner or operator 
of a phosphogypsum stack shall report the mean, standard deviation, 95th 
percentile and sample size. If the purpose for removing phosphogypsum 
from a stack is for distribution to commerce pursuant to Sec. 61.204, 
the additional sampling procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section shall apply.
    (b) Based on the values for x<INF>1</INF> and x* calculated in 
paragraphs paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, determine which of 
the following conditions will be met:
    (1) If x<INF>1</INF> < 10 pCi/g and x* <= 10 pCi/g; phosphogypsum 
may be removed from this area of the stack for distribution in commerce 
pursuant to Sec. 61.204.
    (2) If x<INF>1</INF>, < 10 pCi/g and x* <ls-thn-eq> 10 pCi/g, the 
owner or operator may elect to follow the procedures for further 
sampling set forth in paragraph (c) of this section:
    (3) If x<INF>1</INF> <ls-thn-eq>= 10 pCi/g; phosphogypsum shall not 
be removed from this area of the stack for distribution in commerce 
pursuant to Sec. 61.204.
    (c) If the owner or operator elects to conduct further sampling to 
determine if phosphogypsum can be removed from this area of the stack, 
the following procedure shall apply. The objective of

[[Page 150]]

the following procedure is to demonstrate, with a 95% probability, that 
the phosphogypsum from this area of the stack has a radium-226 
concentration no greater than 10 pCi/g. The procedure is iterative, the 
sample size may have to be increased more than one time; otherwise the 
phosphogypsum cannot be removed from this area of the stack for 
distribution to commerce pursuant to Sec. 61.204.
    (1)(i) Solve the following equation for the total number of samples 
required:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR03FE99.056

    (ii) The sample size n<INF>2</INF> shall be rounded upwards to the 
next whole number. The number of additional samples needed is 
n<INF>A</INF> = n<INF>2</INF>-n<INF>1</INF>.
    (2) Obtain the necessary number of additional samples, 
n<INF>A</INF>, which shall also be taken at regularly spaced intervals 
across the surface of the location on the stack from which phosphogypsum 
will be removed.
    (3) Measure the radium-226 concentration of each of the 
n<INF>A</INF> additional samples in accordance with the analytical 
procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 114.
    (4) Recalculate the mean and standard deviation of the entire set of 
n<INF>2</INF> radium-226 concentrations by joining this set of 
n<INF>A</INF> concentrations with the n<INF>1</INF> concentrations 
previously measured. Use the formulas in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, substituting the entire set of n<INF>2</INF> samples in place 
of the n1 samples called for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
thereby determining the mean, x<INF>2</INF>, and standard deviation, 
s<INF>2</INF>, for the entire set of n<INF>2</INF> concentrations.
    (5) Repeat the procedure described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, substituting the recalculated mean, x<INF>2</INF>, for 
x<INF>1</INF>, the recalculated standard deviation, s<INF>2</INF>, for 
s<INF>1</INF>, and total sample size, n<INF>2</INF>, for n<INF>1</INF>.
    (6) Repeat the procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
substituting the recalculated mean, x<INF>2</INF> for x<INF>1</INF>.

mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected 
Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on 
the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has:
    (i) Failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce, in 
significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill 
tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) 
(i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones 
for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve 
compliance with the 20 pCi/m \2\-s flux standard; and
    (ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly 
interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a 
permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 
pCi/m \2\-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site.
    (2) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T on a 
site-specific basis as applied to owners and operators of non-
operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by 
the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines 
by rulemaking, based on the record:
    (i) That NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed in 
significant part on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the 
operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, 
regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement 
States; and
    (ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly 
interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a 
permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 
pCi/m \2\-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site.
    (3) Upon completion of the reconsideration of rescission pursuant to

[[Page 154]]

Sec. 61.226(c) the Administrator may issue a finding that reinstatement 
of this subpart is not appropriate if the Administrator finds:
    (i) NRC and the affected Agreement States are on a programmatic 
basis implementing and enforcing, in significant part, the regulations 
governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and 
NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the 
license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of 
emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with 
the 20 pCi/m \2\-s flux standard; or
    (ii) NRC or an affected Agreement State are on a site-specific 
basis, in significant part, achieving compliance by the operator of the 
site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or 
standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States.
    (b) Procedures to petition for reconsideration of rescission of this 
subpart. (1) A person may petition the Administrator to reconsider the 
rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under Sec. 61.226(a).
    (2) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission 
and seek reinstatement of this subpart under Sec. 61.226(a)(1) 
(programmatic basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner 
demonstrates that written notice of the alleged failure(s) was provided 
to NRC at least 60 days before filing the petition with EPA. This 
notification shall include a statement of the grounds for such a 
petition and this notice requirement may be satisfied by, but is not 
limited to, submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a 
proceeding conducted by NRC.
    (3) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission 
and seek reinstatement of this subpart under Sec. 61.226(a)(2) (site-
specific basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates 
that a written request was made to NRC or an affected Agreement State 
for enforcement or other relief at least 60 days before filing its 
petition with EPA, and unless the petitioner alleges that NRC or the 
affected Agreement State failed to respond to such request by taking 
action, as necessary, to assure timely implementation and enforcement of 
the 20 pCi/m \2\-s flux standard.
    (4) Upon receipt of a petition under Sec. 61.226(b)(1) that is not 
dismissed under Sec. 61.226(b)(2) or (b)(3), EPA will propose to grant 
or deny an authorized petition to reconsider, take comments on the 
Agency's proposed action, and take final action granting or denying such 
petition to reconsider within 300 days of receipt.
    (c) Reconsideration of rescission of this subpart initiated by the 
Administrator. (1) The Administrator may initiate reconsideration of the 
rescission and reinstatement of this subpart as applied to owners and 
operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA 
has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed 
to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing 
the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the 
tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for 
the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve 
compliance with the 20 pCi/m \2\-s flux standard.
    (2) Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the 
rescission and reinstatement of this subpart under Sec. 61.226(c)(1), 
EPA shall consult with NRC to address EPA's concerns and if the 
consultation does not resolve the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 
60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking to 
reinstate this subpart.

Sec. 61.245  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall comply with the test methods and procedures requirements provided 
in this section.
    (b) Monitoring, as required in Sec. Sec. 61.242, 61.243, 61.244, 
and 61.135, shall comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR 
part 60.
    (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 
Method 21.
    (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its 
use by the procedures specified in Method 21.
    (4) Calibration gases shall be:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of 
approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane.
    (5) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential 
leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in 
Method 21.
    (c) When equipment is tested for compliance with or monitored for no 
detectable emissions, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
following requirements:
    (1) The requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) shall apply.
    (2) The background level shall be determined, as set forth in Method 
21.

[[Page 166]]

    (3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential 
leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in 
Method 21.
    (4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration 
indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 
500 ppm for determining compliance.
    (d)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can 
conceivably contain equipment in VHAP service is presumed to be in VHAP 
service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of 
equipment is not in VHAP service. For a piece of equipment to be 
considered not in VHAP service, it must be determined that the percent 
VHAP content can be reasonably expected never to exceed 10 percent by 
weight. For purposes of determining the percent VHAP content of the 
process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, procedures 
that conform to the methods described in ASTM Method D-2267 
(incorporated by the reference as specified in Sec. 61.18) shall be 
used.
    (2)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than 
the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to demonstrate that 
the percent VHAP content does not exceed 10 percent by weight, provided 
that the engineering judgment demonstrates that the VHAP content clearly 
does not exceed 10 percent by weight. When an owner or operator and the 
Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in 
VHAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
    (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is 
in VHAP service, the determination can be revised only after following 
the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) Samples used in determining the percent VHAP content shall be 
representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the 
equipment or the gas being combusted in the flare.
    (e)(1) Method 22 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to 
determine compliance of flares with the visible emission provisions of 
this subpart.
    (2) The presence of a flare pilot flame shall be monitored using a 
thermocouple or any other equivalent device to detect the presence of a 
flame.
    (3) The net heating value of the gas being combusted in a flare 
shall be calculated using the following equation:

    Source: 54 FR 51703, Dec. 15, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 61.250  Designation of facilities.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to owners or operators of 
facilities licensed to manage uranium byproduct materials during and 
following the processing of uranium ores, commonly referred to as 
uranium mills and their associated tailings. This subpart does not apply 
to the disposal of tailings.


<R05>
Sec. 61.251  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meaning 
given them in the Clean Air Act or 40 CFR part 61, subpart A. The 
following terms shall have the following specific meanings:
    (a) Area means the vertical projection of the pile upon the earth's 
surface.
    (b) Continuous disposal means a method of tailings management and 
disposal in which tailings are dewatered by mechanical methods 
immediately after generation. The dried tailings are then placed in 
trenches or other disposal areas and immediately covered to limit 
emissions consistent with applicable Federal standards.
    (c) Dewatered means to remove the water from recently produced 
tailings by mechanical or evaporative methods such that the water 
content of the tailings does not exceed 30 percent by weight.
    (d) Existing impoundment means any uranium mill tailings impoundment 
which is licensed to accept additional tailings and is in existence as 
of December 15, 1989.
    (e) Operation means that an impoundment is being used for the 
continued placement of new tailings or is in standby status for such 
placement. An impoundment is in operation from the day that tailings are 
first placed in the impoundment until the day that final closure begins.
    (f) Phased disposal means a method of tailings management and 
disposal which uses lined impoundments which are filled and then 
immediately dried and covered to meet all applicable Federal standards.
    (g) Uranium byproduct material or tailings means the waste produced 
by the extraction or concentration of uranium from any ore processed 
primarily for its source material content. Ore bodies depleted by 
uranium solution extraction and which remain underground do not 
constitute byproduct material for the purposes of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 61.252  Standard.

    (a) Radon-222 emissions to the ambient air from an existing uranium 
mill tailings pile shall not exceed 20 pCi/(m\2\-sec) (1.9 pCi/(ft\2\-
sec)) of radon-222.
    (b) After December 15, 1989, no new tailings impoundment can be 
built unless it is designed, constructed and operated to meet one of the 
two following work practices:
    (1) Phased disposal in lined tailings impoundments that are no more 
than 40 acres in area and meet the requirements of 40 CFR 192.32(a) as 
determined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The owner or operator 
shall have no more than two impoundments, including existing 
impoundments, in operation at any one time.
    (2) Continuous disposal of tailings such that tailings are dewatered 
and immediately disposed with no more than 10 acres uncovered at any 
time and operated in accordance with Sec. 192.32(a) as determined by 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
    (c) All mill owners or operators shall comply with the provisions of 
40 CFR 192.32(a) in the operation of tailings piles, the exemption for 
existing piles in 40 CFR 192.32(a) notwithstanding.

<R05>
Sec. 61.253  Determining compliance.

    Compliance with the emission standard in this subpart shall be 
determined annually through the use of Method 115 of appendix B. When 
measurements are to be made over a one year period, EPA shall be 
provided with a schedule of the measurement frequency to be used. The 
schedule may be submitted to EPA prior to or after the first measurement 
period. EPA shall be notified 30 days

[[Page 171]]

prior to any emissions test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the 
test.


<R05>
Sec. 61.254  Annual reporting requirements.

    (a) The owners or operators of operating existing mill impoundments 
shall report the results of the compliance calculations required in 
Sec. 61.253 and the input parameters used in making the calculation for 
each calendar year shall be sent to EPA by March 31 of the following 
year. Each report shall also include the following information:
    (1) The name and location of the mill.
    (2) The name of the person responsible for the operation of the 
facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different).
    (3) The results of the testing conducted, including the results of 
each measurement.
    (4) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in 
charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately 
above the signature line: ``I certify under penalty of law that I have 
personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted 
herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately 
responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted 
information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are 
significant penalties for submitting false information including the 
possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.''
    (b) If the facility is not in compliance with the emission limits of 
Sec. 61.252 in the calendar year covered by the report, then the 
facility must commence reporting to the Administrator on a monthly basis 
the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section, for the 
preceding month. These reports will start the month immediately 
following the submittal of the annual report for the year in 
noncompliance and will be due 30 days following the end of each month. 
This increased level of reporting will continue until the Administrator 
has determined that the monthly reports are no longer necessary. In 
addition to all the information required in paragraph (a) of this 
section, monthly reports shall also include the following information:
    (1) All controls or other changes in operation of the facility that 
will be or are being installed to bring the facility into compliance.
    (2) If the facility is under a judicial or administrative 
enforcement decree, the report will describe the facilities performance 
under the terms of the decree.
    (c) The first report will cover the emissions of calendar year 1990.


<R05>
Sec. 61.255  Recordkeeping requirements.

    The owner or operator of the mill must maintain records documenting 
the source of input parameters including the results of all measurements 
upon which they are based, the calculations and/or analytical methods 
used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used to 
determine compliance. In addition, the documentation should be 
sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the 
determination made concerning the facility's compliance with the 
standard. These records must be kept at the mill for at least five years 
and upon request be made available for inspection by the Administrator, 
or his authorized representative.

surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside a 
storage vessel that has a permanently affixed roof. The internal 
floating roof shall be floating on the liquid surface at all times, 
except during initial fill and during those intervals when the storage 
vessel is completely emptied or subsequently emptied and refilled. When 
the roof is resting on the leg supports, the process of filling, 
emptying, or refilling shall be continuous and shall be accomplished as 
rapidly as possible.
    (2) Each internal floating roof shall be equipped with one of the 
closure devices listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the 
internal floating roof. This requirement does not apply to each existing 
storage vessel for which construction of an internal floating roof 
equipped with a continuous seal commenced on or before July 28, 1988. A 
continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that 
completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and 
the edge of the internal floating roof.
    (i) A foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid 
(liquid-mounted seal). A liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-
filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid between the wall of the 
storage vessel

[[Page 173]]

and the floating roof continuously around the circumference of the 
vessel.
    (ii) Two seals mounted one above the other so that each forms a 
continuous closure that completely covers the space between the wall of 
the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof. The lower 
seal may be vapor-mounted, but both must be continuous.
    (iii) A metallic shoe seal. A metallic shoe seal (also referred to 
as a mechanical shoe seal) is, but is not limited to, a metal sheet held 
vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by springs or weighted 
levers and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A flexible 
coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet 
and the floating roof.
    (3) Automatic bleeder vents are to be closed at all times when the 
roof is floating, except when the roof is being floated off or is being 
landed on the roof leg supports.
    (4) Each opening in a noncontact internal floating roof except for 
automatic bleeder vents (vacuum breaker vents) and the rim space vents 
is to provide a projection below the liquid surface.
    (5) Each internal floating roof shall meet the specifications listed 
below. If an existing storage vessel had an internal floating roof with 
a continuous seal as of July 28, 1988, the requirements listed below do 
not have to be met until the first time after September 14, 1989, the 
vessel is emptied and degassed or September 14, 1999, whichever occurs 
first,
    (i) Each opening in the internal floating roof except for leg 
sleeves, automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, column wells, ladder 
wells, sample wells, and stub drains is to be equipped with a cover or 
lid. The cover or lid shall be equipped with a gasket. Covers on each 
access hatch and automatic gauge float well shall be bolted.
    (ii) Each penetration of the internal floating roof for the purposes 
of sampling shall be a sample well. Each sample well shall have a slit 
fabric cover that covers at least 90 percent of the opening.
    (iii) Each automatic bleeder vent shall be gasketed.
    (iv) Rim space vents shall be equipped with a gasket.
    (v) Each penetration of the internal floating roof that allows for 
passage of a ladder shall have a gasketed sliding cover.
    (vi) Each penetration of the internal floating roof that allows for 
passage of a column supporting the fixed roof shall have a flexible 
fabric sleeve seal or a gasketed sliding cover.
    (6) Each cover or lid on any opening in the internal floating roof 
shall be closed (i.e., no visible gaps), except when a device is in 
actual use Covers on each access hatch and each automatic gauge float 
well which are equipped with bolts shall be bolted when they are not in 
use. Rim space vents are to be set to open only when the internal 
floating roof is not floating or at the manufacturer's recommended 
setting.
    (b) The storage vessel shall have an external floating roof.
    (1) An external floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck-
type cover that rests on the liquid surface in a vessel with no fixed 
roof.
    (2) Each external floating roof shall be equipped with a closure 
device between the wall of the storage vessel and the roof edge. Except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the closure device is 
to consist of two seals, one above the other. The lower seal is referred 
to as the primary seal and the upper seal is referred to as the 
secondary seal.
    (i) The primary seal shall be either a metallic shoe seal or a 
liquid-mounted seal. A liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-
filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid between the wall of the 
storage vessel and the floating roof continuously around the 
circumference of the vessel. A metallic shoe seal (which can also be 
referred to as a mechanical shoe seal) is, but is not limited to, a 
metal sheet held vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by 
springs or weighted levers and is connected by braces to the floating 
roof. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space 
between the metal sheet and the floating roof. Except as provided in 
Sec. 61.272(b)(4), the primary seal shall completely cover

[[Page 174]]

the annular space between the edge of the floating roof and the vessel 
wall.
    (ii) The secondary seal shall completely cover the annular space 
between the external floating roof and the wall of the storage vessel in 
a continuous fashion except as allowed in Sec. 61.272(b)(4).
    (3) Except for automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents, each 
opening in the noncontact external floating roof shall provide a 
projection below the liquid surface. Except for automatic bleeder vents, 
rim space vents, roof drains, and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof 
is to be equipped with a gasketed cover, seal or lid which is to be 
maintained in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap) 
except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder vents are to 
be closed at all times when the roof is floating, except when the roof 
is being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim 
vents are to be set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof 
leg supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting. Automatic 
bleeder vents and rim space vents are to be gasketed. Each emergency 
roof drain is to be provided with a slotted membrane fabric cover that 
covers at least 90 percent of the area of the opening.
    (4) The roof shall be floating on the liquid at all times (i.e., off 
the roof leg supports) except during initial fill until the roof is 
lifted off leg supports and when the vessel is completely emptied and 
subsequently refilled. The process of emptying and refilling when the 
roof is resting on the leg supports shall be continuous and shall be 
accomplished as rapidly as possible.
    (5) The requirement for a secondary seal does not apply to each 
existing storage vessel that was equipped with a liquid-mounted primary 
seal as of July 28, 1988, until after the first time after September 14, 
1989, when the vessel is emptied and degassed or 10 years from September 
14, 1989, whichever occurs first.
    (c) The storage vessel shall be equipped with a closed vent system 
and a control device.
    (1) The closed vent system shall be designed to collect all benzene 
vapors and gases discharged from the storage vessel and operated with no 
detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 
500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined in Sec. 
61.242-11 (subpart V).
    (2) The control device shall be designed and operated to reduce 
inlet benzene emissions by 95 percent or greater. If a flare is used as 
the control device, it shall meet the specifications described in the 
general control device requirements of 40 CFR 60.18.
    (3) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (c)(2) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices 
do not apply during periods of routine maintenance. During periods of 
routine maintenance, the benzene level in the storage vessel(s) serviced 
by the control device subject to the provisions of Sec. 61.271(c) may 
be lowered but not raised. Periods of routine maintenance shall not 
exceed 72 hours as outlined in the maintenance plan required by Sec. 
61.272(c)(1)(iii).
    (4) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (c)(2) of this section for closed vents and control devices do not 
apply during a control system malfunction. A control system malfunction 
means any sudden and unavoidable failure of air pollution control 
equipment. A failure caused entirely or in part by design deficiencies, 
poor maintenance, careless operation, or other preventable upset 
condition or equipment breakdown is not considered a malfunction.
    (d) The owner or operator of each affected storage vessel shall meet 
the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section or Sec. 
61.270(g) as follows:
    (1) The owner or operator of each existing benzene storage vessel 
shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this 
section no later than 90 days after September 14, 1989, with the 
exceptions noted in paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(5), unless a waiver of 
compliance has been approved by the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 61.11.
    (2) The owner or operator of each benzene storage vessel upon which 
construction commenced after September 14, 1989 shall meet the 
requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section

[[Page 175]]

or Sec. 61.270(g) prior to filling (i.e., roof is lifted off leg 
supports) the storage vessel with benzene.
    (3) The owner or operator of each benzene storage vessel upon which 
construction commenced on or after July 28, 1988, and before September 
14, 1989, shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of 
this section on September 14, 1989.

Sec. 61.272  Compliance provisions.

    (a) For each vessel complying with Sec. 61.271(a) (fixed roof and 
internal floating roof) each owner or operator shall:
    (1) After installing the control equipment required to comply with 
Sec. 61.271(a), visually inspect the internal floating roof, the 
primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to 
filling the storage vessel with benzene. If there are holes, tears or 
other openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal 
fabric, or defects in the internal floating roof, the owner or operator 
shall repair the items before filling the storage vessel.
    (2) Visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal 
or the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof 
hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial 
fill, or at least once every 12 months after September 14, 1989, except 
as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. If the internal 
floating roof is not resting on the surface of the benzene liquid inside 
the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the roof, or the seal is 
detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or 
operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel 
from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during 
inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days 
and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up 
to 30 additional days may be requested from the Administrator in the 
inspection report required in Sec. 61.275(a). Such a request for an 
extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable 
and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will ensure 
that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be 
emptied as soon as possible.
    (3) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, 
the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes 
and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and 
degassed. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with 
this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of 
vessels conducting the annual visual inspections as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and at intervals greater than 5 years 
in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (i) For all the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) 
of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in 
writing at least 30 days prior to the refilling of each storage vessel 
to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. 
If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not 
planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the 
inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, the owner or 
operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the 
refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone 
immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the 
inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the 
written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so 
that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to 
refilling.
    (ii) If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has 
holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the 
secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the 
seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces from 
the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open 
area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that 
none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before 
refilling the storage vessel with benzene.

[[Page 176]]

    (4) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in 
Sec. 61.271(a)(2)(ii):
    (i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section at least every 5 years; or
    (ii) Visually inspect the vessel annually as specified in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and at least every 10 years as specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (b) For each vessel complying with Sec. 61.271(b) (external 
floating roof) the owner or operator shall:
    (1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the 
primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel, and the secondary seal 
and the wall of the storage vessel according to the following frequency.
    (i) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and 
secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the 
primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic 
testing of the vessel or within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene 
or within 90 days of September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at 
least once every 5 years thereafter, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with a liquid-
mounted primary seal and without a secondary seal as provided for in 
Sec. 61.271(b)(5), measurement of gaps between the vessel wall and the 
primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed within 90 days of September 
14, 1989, and at least once per year thereafter. When a secondary seal 
is installed over the primary seal, measurement of primary seal gaps 
shall be performed within 90 days of installation and at least once 
every 5 years thereafter.
    (iii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and 
secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the 
secondary seal shall be performed within 90 days of the initial fill 
with benzene, within 90 days of installation of the secondary seal, or 
within 90 days after September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at 
least once per year thereafter.
    (iv) If any source ceases to store benzene for a period of 1 year or 
more, subsequent introduction of benzene into the vessel shall be 
considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), 
(b)(1)(ii), and (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary 
seals individually by the following procedures:
    (i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels 
when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
    (ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the vessel 
in each place where a 0.32 centimeter (cm) (1/8 in) diameter uniform 
probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) 
between the seal and the wall of the storage vessel and measure the 
circumferential distance of each such location.
    (iii) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined by using probes of 
various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the vessel 
wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective 
circumferential distance.
    (3) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually. Divide the sum for each seal 
by the nominal diameter of the vessel and compare each ratio to the 
respective standards in Sec. 61.272(b)(4) and Sec. 61.272(b)(5).
    (4) Repair conditions that do not meet requirements listed in 
paragraph (b)(4) (i) and (ii) within 45 days of identification in any 
inspection or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 
days.
    (i) The accumulated area of gaps between the vessel wall and the 
metallic shoe seal or the liquid-mounted primary seal shall not exceed 
212 cm\2\ per meter of vessel diameter (10.0 in\2\ per foot of vessel 
diameter) and the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 3.81 
cm (1\1/2\ in).
    (A) One end of the metallic shoe is to extend into the stored liquid 
and the other end is to extend a minimum vertical distance of 61 cm (24 
in) above the stored liquid surface.
    (B) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the shoe, 
seal fabric, or seal envelope.

[[Page 177]]

    (ii) The secondary seal is to meet the following requirements:
    (A) The secondary seal is to be installed above the primary seal so 
that it completely covers the space between the roof edge and the vessel 
wall except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (B) The accumulated area of gaps between the vessel wall and the 
secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 cm\2\ per meter of vessel diameter 
(1.0 in\2\ per foot of vessel diameter) or the width of any portion of 
any gap shall not exceed 1.27 cm (\1/2\ in). These seal gap requirements 
may be exceeded during the measurement of primary seal gaps as required 
by paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (C) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the seal 
or seal fabric.
    (iii) If a failure that is detected during inspections required in 
this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel 
cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up to 30 additional 
days may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report 
required in Sec. 61.275(d). Such extension request must include a 
demonstration of unavailability of alternate storage capacity and a 
specification of a schedule that will assure that the control equipment 
will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
    (5) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 30 days in 
advance of any gap measurements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer 
present.
    (6) Visually inspect the external floating roof, the primary seal, 
secondary seal, and fittings each time the vessel is emptied and 
degassed.
    (i) If the external floating roof has defects, the primary seal has 
holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the 
secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the 
seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary 
so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before 
filling or refilling the storage vessel with benzene.
    (ii) For all the inspections required by paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing 
at least 30 days prior to filling or refilling of each storage vessel to 
afford the Administrator the opportunity to inspect the storage vessel 
prior to refilling. If the inspection required by paragraph (b)(6) of 
this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have 
known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, 
the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days 
prior to refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by 
telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating 
why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, this notification 
including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by 
express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days 
prior to the refilling.
    (c) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a 
closed vent system and control device as required in Sec. 60.271(c), 
other than a flare, shall meet the following requirements.
    (1) Within 90 days after initial fill or after September 14, 1989, 
whichever comes last, submit for approval by the Administrator, an 
operating plan containing the information listed below.
    (i) Documentation demonstrating that the control device being used 
achieves the required control efficiency during reasonably expected 
maximum loading conditions. This documentation is to include a 
description of the gas stream which enters the control device, including 
flow and benzene content under varying liquid level conditions (dynamic 
and static) and manufacturer's design specifications for the control 
device. If the control device or the closed vent capture system receives 
vapors, gases or liquids, other than fuels, from sources that are not 
designated sources under this subpart, the efficiency demonstration is 
to include consideration of all vapors, gases and liquids received by 
the closed vent capture system and control device. If an enclosed 
combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a 
minimum temperature of 816 [deg]C (1,500 [deg]F) is used to meet the 95

[[Page 178]]

percent requirement, documentation that those conditions exist is 
sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
    (ii) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to 
ensure that the control device is operated and maintained in conformance 
with its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of 
that parameter (or parameters).
    (iii) A maintenance plan for the system including the type of 
maintenance necessary, planned frequency of maintenance, and lengths of 
maintenance periods for those operations that would require the closed 
vent system or the control device to be out of compliance with Sec. 
61.271(c). The maintenance plan shall require that the system be out of 
compliance with Sec. 61.271(c) for no more than 72 hours per year.
    (2) Operate, monitor the parameters, and maintain the closed vent 
system and control device in accordance with the operating plan 
submitted to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, unless the plan was modified by the Administrator during 
the approval process. In this case, the modified plan applies.
    (d) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a 
closed vent system and a flare to meet the requirements in Sec. 
61.271(c) shall meet the requirements as specified in the general 
control device requirements in 40 CFR 60.18 (e) and (f).

Sec. 61.273  Alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) Upon written application from any person, the Administrator may 
approve the use of alternative means of emission limitation which have 
been demonstrated to his satisfaction to achieve a reduction in benzene 
emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by 
any requirement in Sec. 61.271 (a), (b), or (c) of this subpart.
    (b) Determination of equivalence to the reduction in emissions 
achieved by the requirements of Sec. 61.271 (a), (b), or (c) will be 
evaluated using the following information to be included in the written 
application to the Administrator:
    (1) Actual emissions tests that use full-size or scale-model storage 
vessels that accurately collect and measure all benzene emissions from a 
given control device, and that accurately simulate wind and account for 
other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure.
    (2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is 
an accurate method of determining equivalence.
    (c) The Administrator may condition approval of equivalency on 
requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance 
to achieve the same emission reduction as the requirements of Sec. 
61.271 (a), (b), or (c).
    (d) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an application for 
equivalence may be approvable, the Administrator will publish a notice 
of preliminary determination in the Federal Register and provide the 
opportunity for public hearing. After notice and opportunity for public 
hearing, the Administrator will determine the equivalence of the 
alternative means of emission limitation and will publish the final 
determination in the Federal Register.

subpart applies after installing control equipment in accordance with 
Sec. 61.271(a) (fixed roof and internal floating roof) shall submit a 
report describing the results of each inspection conducted in accordance 
with Sec. 61.272(a). For vessels for which annual inspections are 
required under Sec. 61.272(a)(2), the first report is to be submitted 
no more than 12 months after the initial report submitted in accordance 
with Sec. 61.274, and each report is to be submitted within 60 days of 
each annual inspection.
    (1) Each report shall include the date of the inspection of each 
storage vessel and identify each storage vessel in which:
    (i) The internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the 
benzene liquid inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the 
roof, or the seal is detached from the internal floating roof, or there 
are holes, tears or other openings in the seal or seal fabric; or
    (ii) There are visible gaps between the seal and the wall of the 
storage vessel.
    (2) Where an annual report identifies any condition in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section the annual report shall describe the nature of 
the defect, the date the storage vessel was emptied, and the nature of

<R05>
Sec. 61.301  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act, or in subpart A or subpart V of part 61.
    Bulk terminal means any facility which receives liquid product 
containing benzene by pipelines, marine vessels, tank trucks, or 
railcars, and loads the product for further distribution into tank 
trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.
    Car-sealed means having a seal that is placed on the device used to 
change the position of a valve (e.g., from open to closed) such that the 
position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal and 
requiring the replacement of the old seal, once broken, with a new seal.
    Control device means all equipment used for recovering or oxidizing 
benzene vapors displaced from the affected facility.
    Incinerator means any enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying organic compounds and that does not extract energy in the 
form of steam or process heat. These devices do not rely on the heating 
value of the waste gas to sustain efficient combustion. Auxiliary fuel 
is burned in the device and the heat from the fuel flame heats the waste 
gas to combustion temperature. Temperature is controlled by controlling 
combustion air or fuel.
    Leak means any instrument reading of 10,000 ppmv or greater using 
Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    Loading cycle means the time period from the beginning of filling a 
tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel until flow to the control device 
ceases, as measured by the flow indicator.
    Loading rack means the loading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves, 
relief valves, and other piping and valves necessary to fill tank 
trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.
    Marine vessel means any tank ship or tank barge which transports 
liquid product such as benzene.
    Nonvapor tight means any tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel that 
does not pass the required vapor-tightness test.
    Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by 
burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, except water that is heated 
to produce steam.
    Steam generating unit means any enclosed combustion device that uses 
fuel energy in the form of steam.
    Vapor collection system means any equipment located at the affected 
facility used for containing benzene vapors displaced during the loading 
of tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels. This does not include the 
vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck, railcar, or 
marine vessel vapor collection manifold system.
    Vapor-tight marine vessel means a marine vessel with a benzene 
product tank that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months 
to have no leaks. This demonstration shall be made using Method 21 of 
part 60, appendix A, during the last 20 percent of loading and during a 
period when the vessel is being loaded at its maximum loading rate. A 
reading of greater than 10,000 ppm as methane shall constitute a leak. 
As an alternative, a marine vessel owner or operator may use the vapor-
tightness test described in Sec. 61.304(f) to demonstrate vapor 
tightness. A marine vessel operated at negative pressure is assumed to 
be vapor-tight for the purpose of this standard.
    Vapor-tight tank truck or vapor-tight railcar means a tank truck or 
railcar for which it has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 
months that its product tank will sustain a pressure change of not more 
than 750 pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum 
of 4,500 pascals. This capability is to be demonstrated using

[[Page 183]]

the pressure test procedure specified in Method 27 of appendix A to 40 
CFR part 60, and a pressure measurement device which has a precision of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm water and which is capable of measuring 
above the pressure at which the tank truck or railcar is to be tested 
for vapor tightness.

<R05>
Sec. 61.302  Standards.

    (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall equip each 
loading rack with a vapor collection system that is:
    (1) Designed to collect all benzene vapors displaced from tank 
trucks, railcars, or marine vessels during loading, and
    (2) Designed to prevent any benzene vapors collected at one loading 
rack from passing through another loading rack to the atmosphere.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install a 
control device and reduce benzene emissions routed to the atmosphere 
through the control device by 98 weight percent. If a boiler or process 
heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement, then 
the vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a 
device.
    (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall operate any 
flare used to comply with paragraph (b) of this section in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 60.18 (b) through (f).
    (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit 
loading of benzene into vapor-tight tank trucks and vapor-tight railcars 
using the following procedures:
    (1) The owner or operator shall obtain the vapor-tightness 
documentation described in Sec. 61.305(h) for each tank truck or 
railcar loaded at the affected facility. The test date in the 
documentation must be within the preceding 12 months. The vapor-
tightness test to be used for tank trucks and railcars is Method 27 of 
appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
    (2) The owner or operator shall cross-check the identification 
number for each tank truck or railcar to be loaded with the file of 
vapor-tightness documentation before the corresponding tank truck or 
railcar is loaded. If no documentation is on file, the owner or operator 
shall obtain a copy of the information from the tank truck or railcar 
operator before the tank truck or railcar is loaded.
    (3) Alternate procedures to those described in paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(d)(2) of this section may be used upon application to, and approval by, 
the Administrator.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit the 
loading of marine vessels to those vessels that are vapor tight as 
determined by either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), or (e)(4) of this 
section.
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that 
each marine vessel is loaded with the benzene product tank below 
atmospheric pressure (i.e., at negative pressure). If the pressure is 
measured at the interface between the shoreside vapor collection pipe 
and the marine vessel vapor line, the pressure measured according to the 
procedures in Sec. 61.303(f) must be below atmospheric pressure.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use the 
following procedure to obtain the vapor-tightness documentation 
described in Sec. 61.305(h). The vapor-tightness test for marine 
vessels is Method 21 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, and shall be 
applied to any potential sources of vapor leaks. A reading of 10,000 
ppmv or greater as methane shall constitute a leak.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain the 
leak test documentation described in Sec. 61.305(h) for each marine 
vessel prior to loading, if available. The date of the test listed in 
the documentation must be within the 12 preceding months.
    (ii) If there is no documentation of a successful leak test 
conducted on the marine vessel in the preceding 12 months, the owner or 
operator of an affected facility shall require that a leak test of the 
marine vessel be conducted during the final 20 percent of loading of the 
marine vessel or shall not load the vessel. The test shall be conducted 
when the marine vessel is being loaded at the maximum allowable loading 
rate.

[[Page 184]]

    (A) If no leak is detected, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall require that the documentation described in Sec. 
61.305(h) is completed prior to departure of the vessel. The owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall retain a copy of the vapor-
tightness documentation on file.
    (B) If any leak is detected, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall require that the vapor-tightness failure be documented 
for the marine vessel owner or operator prior to departure of the 
vessel. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall retain a 
copy of the vapor-tightness documentation on file. Delay of repair of 
equipment for which leaks have been detected will be allowed if the 
repair is technically infeasible without dry-docking the vessel. This 
equipment will be excluded from future Method 21 of appendix A to 40 CFR 
part 60 tests until repairs are effected. Repair of this equipment shall 
occur the next time the vessel is dry-docked.
    (iii) If the marine vessel has failed its most recent vapor-
tightness test as described in Sec. 61.302(e)(2)(ii), the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall require that the owner or 
operator of the nonvapor-tight marine vessel provide documentation that 
the leaks detected during the previous vapor-tightness test have been 
repaired, or proof that repair is technically infeasible without dry-
docking the vessel. Once the repair documentation has been provided, the 
owner or operator may load the marine vessel. The owner or operator 
shall require that the vapor-tightness test described in Sec. 
61.302(e)(2)(ii) be conducted during loading, and shall retain a copy of 
the vapor-tightness documentation on file.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain a 
copy of the marine vessel's vapor-tightness documentation described in 
Sec. 61.305(h) for a test conducted within the preceding 12 months in 
accordance with Sec. 61.304(f).
    (4) Alternate procedures to those described in paragraphs (e)(1), 
(e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section may be used upon application to, and 
approval by, the Administrator.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit 
loading of benzene to tank trucks, railcars, and marine vessels equipped 
with vapor collection equipment that is compatible with the affected 
facility's vapor collection system.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit 
loading of tank trucks, railcars, and marine vessels to tank trucks, 
railcars, and marine vessels whose collection systems are connected to 
the affected facility's vapor collection systems.
    (h) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that 
the vapor collection and benzene loading equipment of tank trucks and 
railcars shall be designed and operated to prevent gauge pressure in the 
tank truck or railcar tank from exceeding, during loading, the initial 
pressure the tank was pressured up to and shown to be vapor tight at 
during the most recent vapor-tightness test using Method 27 of appendix 
A to 40 CFR part 60. This vapor-tightness test pressure is not to be 
exceeded when measured by the procedures specified in Sec. 61.304(c).
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that 
no pressure-vacuum vent in the affected facility's vapor collection 
system for tank trucks and railcars shall begin to open at a system 
pressure less than the maximum pressure at which the tank truck or 
railcar is operated.
    (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that 
the maximum normal operating pressure of the marine vessel's vapor 
collection equipment shall not exceed 0.8 times the relief set pressure 
of the pressure-vacuum vents. This level is not to be exceeded when 
measured by the procedures specified in Sec. 61.304(d).
    (k) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall inspect the 
vapor collection system and the control device for detectable emissions, 
and shall repair any leaks detected, in accordance with Sec. 61.242-11 
(e) and (f). This inspection of the vapor collection system and control 
device shall be done during the loading of tank trucks, railcars, or 
marine vessels.
    (l) Vent systems that contain valves that could divert a vent stream 
from a control device shall have car-sealed opened all valves in the 
vent system from the emission source to the control

[[Page 185]]

device, and car-sealed closed all valves in the vent system that would 
lead the vent stream to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, 
bypassing the control device.

Sec. 61.304  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) The procedures for determining compliance with Sec. 61.302(b) 
for all control devices other than flares is as follows:
    (1) All testing equipment shall be prepared and installed as 
specified in the appropriate test methods.
    (2) The time period for a performance test shall be not less than 6 
hours, during which at least 300,000 liters of benzene are loaded. If 
the throughput criterion is not met during the initial 6 hours, the test 
may be either continued until the throughput criterion is met, or 
resumed the next day with at least another 6 complete hours of testing.
    (3) For intermittent control devices:
    (i) The vapor holder level of the intermittent control device shall 
be recorded at the start of the performance test. The end of the 
performance test shall coincide with the time when the vapor holder is 
at its original level.
    (ii) At least two startups and shutdowns of the control device shall 
occur during the performance test. If this does not occur under an 
automatically controlled operation, the system shall be manually 
controlled.
    (4) An emission testing interval shall consist of each 5-minute 
period during the performance test. For each interval:
    (i) The reading from each measurement instrument shall be recorded.
    (ii) Method 1 or 1A of part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be 
used for selection of the sampling site,
    (iii) The volume exhausted shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 
2C, or 2D of part 60, appendix A, as appropriate.
    (iv) The average benzene concentration upstream and downstream of 
the control device in the vent shall be determined using Method 25A or 
Method 25B of appendix A of this part, using benzene as the calibration 
gas. The average benzene concentration shall correspond to the volume 
measurement by taking into account the sampling system response time.
    (5) The mass emitted during each testing interval shall be 
calculated as follows:

M<INF>i</INF>=FKV<INF>S</INF> C

where:
M<INF>i</INF>=Mass of benzene emitted during testing interval i, kg.
V<INF>s</INF>=Volume of air-vapor mixture exhausted, m\3\ at standard 
conditions.
C=Benzene concentration (as measured) at the exhaust vent, ppmv.
K=Density, (kg/m\3\ benzene), standard conditions.
K=3.25 for benzene.
F=Conversion factor, (m\3\ benzene/m\3\ air)(1/ppmv).
F=10/<SUP>-6</SUP>/.
s=Standard conditions, 20 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg.

    (6) The benzene mass emission rates before and after the control 
device shall be calculated as follows:

where:

E=Mass flow rate of benzene emitted, kg/hr.
M<INF>i</INF>=Mass of benzene emitted during testing interval i, kg.
T=Total time of all testing intervals, hr.
n=Number of testing intervals.

    (7) The percent reduction across the control device shall be 
calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.057

where:
R=Control efficiency of control device, %.
E<INF>b</INF>=Mass flow rate of benzene prior to control device, kg/hr.
E<INF>a</INF>=Mass flow rate of benzene after control device, kg/hr.

    (b) When a flare is used to comply with Sec. 61.302(b), a 
performance test according to Method 22 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 
shall be performed to determine visible emissions. The observation 
period shall be at least 2 hours. Performance testing shall be conducted 
during at least three complete loading cycles with a separate test run 
for each loading cycle. The observation period for detecting visible 
emissions shall encompass each loading cycle. Integrated sampling to 
measure process vent stream flow rate shall be performed continuously 
during each loading cycle.
    (c) For the purpose of determining compliance with Sec. 61.302(h), 
the following procedures shall be used:
    (1) Calibrate and install a pressure measurement device (liquid 
manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument), which has a 
precision of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm H<INF>2</INF>0 in the range 
that the tank truck or railcar was initially pressured to during the 
most recent vapor-tightness test.
    (2) Connect the pressure measurement device to a pressure tap in the 
affected facility's vapor collection system, located as close as 
possible to the connection with the tank truck or railcar.
    (3) During the performance test, record the pressure every 5 minutes 
while a tank truck or railcar is being loaded, and record the highest 
instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading cycle. Every 
loading rack shall be tested at least once during the performance test.
    (4) If more than one loading rack is used simultaneously, then the 
performance test shall be conducted simultaneously to represent the 
maximum capacity.
    (d) For the purpose of determining compliance with Sec. 61.302(j), 
the following procedures shall be used:
    (1) Calibrate and install a pressure measurement device (liquid 
manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument), capable of 
measuring up to the relief set pressure of the pressure-vacuum vents.
    (2) Connect the pressure measurement device to a pressure tap in the 
affected facility's vapor collection system, located as close as 
possible to the connection with the marine vessel.
    (3) During the performance test, record the pressure every 5 minutes 
while a marine vessel is being loaded, and record the highest 
instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading cycle.
    (e) Immediately prior to a performance test required for 
determination of compliance with Sec. 61.302(b), all potential sources 
of vapor leakage in the affected facility's vapor collection system 
equipment shall be inspected for detectable emissions as required in 
Sec. 61.302(k). The monitoring shall be conducted only while a vapor-
tight tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel is being loaded. All 
identified leaks in the terminal's vapor collection system shall be 
repaired prior to conducting the performance test.
    (f) The following test method shall be used to comply with the 
marine vessel vapor-tightness requirements of Sec. 61.302(e)(3):
    (1) Each benzene product tank shall be pressurized with dry air or 
inert gas to not less than 1.0 psig and not more than the pressure of 
the lowest relief valve setting.
    (2) Once the pressure is obtained, the dry air or inert gas source 
shall be shut off.
    (3) At the end of one-half hour, the pressure in the benzene product 
tank and piping shall be measured. The change in pressure shall be 
calculated using the following formula:

[Delta] P=P<INF>i</INF>--P<INF>f</INF>

where:

[Delta] P=Change in pressure, inches of water.
P<INF>i</INF>=Pressure in tank when air/gas source is shut off, inches 
of water.
P<INF>f</INF>=Pressure in tank at the end of one-half hour after air/gas 
source is shut off, inches of water.


[[Page 188]]


    (4) The change in pressure, [Delta] P, shall be compared to the 
pressure drop calculated using the following formula:

[Delta] PM=0.861 P<INF>ia</INF> L/V

where:

[Delta] PM=Maximum allowable pressure change, inches of water.
P<INF>ia</INF>=Pressure in tank when air/gas source is shut off, pounds 
per square inch, absolute (psia).
L=Maximum permitted loading rate of vessel, barrels per hour.
V=Total volume of product tank, barrels.

    (5) If [Delta]P<=[Delta]PM, the vessel is vapor tight.
    (6) If [Delta]P<ls-thn-eq>[Delta]PM, the vessel is not vapor tight 
and the source of the leak must be identified and repaired prior to 
retesting.

gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting 
of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as 
during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor 
headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Segregated stormwater sewer system means a drain and collection 
system designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall 
runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from all other individual 
drain systems.
    Sewer line means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other 
enclosed conduit used to convey waste to a downstream waste management 
unit.
    Slop oil means the floating oil and solids that accumulate on the 
surface of an oil-water separator.
    Sour water stream means a stream that:
    (1) Contains ammonia or sulfur compounds (usually hydrogen sulfide) 
at concentrations of 10 ppm by weight or more;
    (2) Is generated from separation of water from a feed stock, 
intermediate, or product that contained ammonia or sulfur compounds; and
    (3) Requires treatment to remove the ammonia or sulfur compounds.
    Sour water stripper means a unit that:
    (1) Is designed and operated to remove ammonia or sulfur compounds 
(usually hydrogen sulfide) from sour water streams;
    (2) Has the sour water streams transferred to the stripper through 
hard piping or other enclosed system; and
    (3) Is operated in such a manner that the offgases are sent to a 
sulfur recovery unit, processing unit, incinerator, flare, or other 
combustion device.
    Surface impoundment means a waste management unit which is a natural 
topographic depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed 
primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made 
materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes 
or waste containing free liquids, and which is

[[Page 194]]

not an injection well. Examples of surface impoundments are holding, 
storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.
    Tank means a stationary waste management unit that is designed to 
contain an accumulation of waste and is constructed primarily of 
nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) which 
provide structural support.

transport mechanism used in handling, storage, treatment, or disposal of 
waste. Examples of a waste management unit include a tank, surface 
impoundment, container, oil-water separator, individual drain system, 
steam stripping unit, thin-film evaporation unit, waste incinerator, and 
landfill.
    Waste stream means the waste generated by a particular process unit, 
product tank, or waste management unit. The characteristics of the waste 
stream (e.g., flow rate, benzene concentration, water content) are 
determined at the point of waste generation. Examples of a waste stream 
include process wastewater, product tank drawdown, sludge and slop oil 
removed from waste management units, and landfill leachate.

Sec. 61.342  Standards: General.

    (a) An owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual 
benzene quantity from facility waste is less than 10 megagrams per year 
(Mg/yr) (11 ton/yr) shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section. The total annual benzene quantity from 
facility waste is the sum of the annual benzene quantity for each waste 
stream at the facility that has a flow-weighted annual average water 
content greater than 10 percent or that is mixed with water, or other 
wastes, at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content 
greater than 10 percent. The benzene quantity in a waste stream is to be 
counted only once without multiple counting if other waste streams are 
mixed with or generated from the original waste stream. Other specific 
requirements for calculating the total annual benzene waste quantity are 
as follows:
    (1) Wastes that are exempted from control under Sec. Sec. 
61.342(c)(2) and 61.342(c)(3) are included in the calculation of the 
total annual benzene quantity if they have an annual average water 
content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or 
other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water 
content greater than 10 percent.

[[Page 195]]

    (2) The benzene in a material subject to this subpart that is sold 
is included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if 
the material has an annual average water content greater than 10 
percent.
    (3) Benzene in wastes generated by remediation activities conducted 
at the facility, such as the excavation of contaminated soil, pumping 
and treatment of groundwater, and the recovery of product from soil or 
groundwater, are not included in the calculation of total annual benzene 
quantity for that facility. If the facility's total annual benzene 
quantity is 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) or more, wastes generated by 
remediation activities are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) 
through (h) of this section. If the facility is managing remediation 
waste generated offsite, the benzene in this waste shall be included in 
the calculation of total annual benzene quantity in facility waste, if 
the waste streams have an annual average water content greater than 10 
percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and 
the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.
    (4) The total annual benzene quantity is determined based upon the 
quantity of benzene in the waste before any waste treatment occurs to 
remove the benzene except as specified in Sec. 61.355(c)(1)(i) (A) 
through (C).
    (b) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual 
benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/
yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of 
this section no later than 90 days following the effective date, unless 
a waiver of compliance has been obtained under Sec. 61.11, or by the 
initial startup for a new source with an initial startup after the 
effective date.
    (1) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply 
with the rule within the required time may request a waiver of 
compliance under Sec. 61.10.
    (2) As part of the waiver application, the owner or operator shall 
submit to the Administrator a plan under Sec. 61.10(b)(3) that is an 
enforceable commitment to obtain environmental benefits to mitigate the 
benzene emissions that result from extending the compliance date. The 
plan shall include the following information:
    (i) A description of the method of compliance, including the control 
approach, schedule for installing controls, and quantity of the benzene 
emissions that result from extending the compliance date;
    (ii) If the control approach involves a compliance strategy designed 
to obtain integrated compliance with multiple regulatory requirements, a 
description of the other regulations involved and their effective dates; 
and
    (iii) A description of the actions to be taken at the facility to 
obtain mitigating environmental benefits, including how the benefits 
will be obtained, the schedule for these actions, and an estimate of the 
quantifiable benefits that directly result from these actions.
    (c) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual 
benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/
yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
manage and treat the facility waste as follows:
    (1) For each waste stream that contains benzene, including (but not 
limited to) organic waste streams that contain less than 10 percent 
water and aqueous waste streams, even if the wastes are not discharged 
to an individual drain system, the owner or operator shall:
    (i) Remove or destroy the benzene contained in the waste using a 
treatment process or wastewater treatment system that complies with the 
standards specified in Sec. 61.348 of this subpart.
    (ii) Comply with the standards specified in Sec. Sec. 61.343 
through 61.347 of this subpart for each waste management unit that 
receives or manages the waste stream prior to and during treatment of 
the waste stream in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Each waste management unit used to manage or treat waste 
streams that will be recycled to a process shall comply with the 
standards specified in Sec. Sec. 61.343 through 61.347. Once the waste 
stream is recycled to a process, including to a tank used for the 
storage of production process feed, product, or

[[Page 196]]

product intermediates, unless this tank is used primarily for the 
storage of wastes, the material is no longer subject to paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (2) A waste stream is exempt from paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
provided that the owner or operator demonstrates initially and, 
thereafter, at least once per year that the flow-weighted annual average 
benzene concentration for the waste stream is less than 10 ppmw as 
determined by the procedures specified in Sec. 61.355(c)(2) or Sec. 
61.355(c)(3).
    (3) A waste stream is exempt from paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
provided that the owner or operator demonstrates initially and, 
thereafter, at least once per year that the conditions specified in 
either paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (c)(3)(ii) of this section are met.
    (i) The waste stream is process wastewater that has a flow rate less 
than 0.02 liters per minute (0.005 gallons per minute) or an annual 
wastewater quantity of less than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr); or
    (ii) All of the following conditions are met:
    (A) The owner or operator does not choose to exempt process 
wastewater under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section,
    (B) The total annual benzene quantity in all waste streams chosen 
for exemption in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section does not exceed 
2.0 Mg/yr (2.2 ton/yr) as determined in the procedures in Sec. 
61.355(j), and
    (C) The total annual benzene quantity in a waste stream chosen for 
exemption, including process unit turnaround waste, is determined for 
the year in which the waste is generated.
    (d) As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(c) and (e) of this section, an owner or operator of a facility at which 
the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or 
greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this 
section may elect to manage and treat the facility waste as follows:
    (1) The owner or operator shall manage and treat facility waste 
other than process wastewater in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (2) The owner or operator shall manage and treat process wastewater 
in accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) Process wastewater shall be treated to achieve a total annual 
benzene quantity from facility process wastewater less than 1 Mg/yr (1.1 
ton/yr). Total annual benzene from facility process wastewater shall be 
determined by adding together the annual benzene quantity at the point 
of waste generation for each untreated process wastewater stream plus 
the annual benzene quantity exiting the treatment process for each 
process wastewater stream treated in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (ii) Each treated process wastewater stream identified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section shall be managed and treated in accordance

    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of Hg emissions, including both particulate and gaseous Hg, from chlor-
alkali plants and other sources (as specified in the regulations) where 
the carrier-gas stream in the duct or stack is principally air.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically 
from the source and collected in acidic iodine monochloride (ICl) 
solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to 
elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical 
cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Sample Collection. Sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) reduces ICl 
and causes premature depletion of the ICl solution.
    4.2 Sample Analysis.
    4.2.1 ICl concentrations greater than 10<SUP>-4</SUP> molar inhibit 
the reduction of the Hg (II) ion in the aeration cell.
    4.2.2 Condensation of water vapor on the optical cell windows causes 
a positive interference.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the 
specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of 
the American Chemical Society; where such specifications are not 
available, use the best available grade.
    7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are required for 
sample collection:
    7.1.1 Water. Deionized distilled, to conform to ASTM D 1193-77 or 91 
(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 61.18), Type 1. If high 
concentrations of organic matter are not expected to be present, the 
analyst may eliminate the KMnO<INF>4</INF> test for oxidizable organic 
matter. Use this water in all dilutions and solution preparations.
    7.1.2 Nitric Acid, 50 Percent (v/v). Mix equal volumes of 
concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> and water, being careful to add the acid to 
the water slowly.
    7.1.3 Silica Gel. Indicating type, 6- to 16-mesh. If previously 
used, dry at 175 [deg]C (350 [deg]F) for 2 hours. The tester may use new 
silica gel as received.
    7.1.4 Potassium Iodide (KI) Solution, 25 Percent. Dissolve 250 g of 
KI in water, and dilute to 1 liter.
    7.1.5 Iodine Monochloride Stock Solution, 1.0 M. To 800 ml of 25 
percent KI solution, add 800 ml of concentrated HCl. Cool to room 
temperature. With vigorous stirring, slowly add 135 g of potassium 
iodate (KIO<INF>3</INF>), and stir until all free iodine has dissolved. 
A clear orange-red solution occurs when all the KIO<INF>3</INF> has been 
added. Cool to room temperature, and dilute to 1800 ml with water. Keep 
the solution in amber glass bottles to prevent degradation.
    7.1.6 Absorbing Solution, 0.1 M ICl. Dilute 100 ml of the 1.0 M ICl 
stock solution to 1 liter with water. Keep the solution in amber glass 
bottles and in darkness to prevent degradation. This reagent is stable 
for at least two months.
    7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis. The following reagents and 
standards are required for sample preparation and analysis:
    7.2.1 Reagents.
    7.2.1.1 Tin (II) Solution. Prepare fresh daily, and keep sealed when 
not being used. Completely dissolve 20 g of tin (II) chloride (or 25 g 
of tin (II) sulfate) crystals (Baker Analyzed reagent grade or any other 
brand that will give a clear solution) in 25 ml of concentrated HCl. 
Dilute to 250 ml with water. Do not substitute HNO<INF>3</INF>, 
H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>, or other strong acids for the HCl.
    7.2.1.2 Sulfuric Acid, 5 Percent (v/v). Dilute 25 ml of concentrated 
H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> to 500 ml with water.
    7.2.2 Standards
    7.2.2.1 Hg Stock Solution, 1 mg Hg/ml. Prepare and store all Hg 
standard solutions in borosilicate glass containers. Completely dissolve 
0.1354 g of Hg (II) chloride in 75 ml of water in a 100-ml glass 
volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>, and adjust 
the volume to exactly 100 ml with water. Mix thoroughly. This solution 
is stable for at least one month.
    7.2.2.2 Intermediate Hg Standard Solution, 10 [micro]g Hg/ml. 
Prepare fresh weekly. Pipet 5.0 ml of the Hg stock solution (Section 
7.2.2.1) into a 500-ml glass volumetric flask, and add 20 ml of the 5 
percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> solution. Dilute to exactly 500 ml 
with water. Thoroughly mix the solution.
    7.2.2.3 Working Hg Standard Solution, 200 ng Hg/ml. Prepare fresh 
daily. Pipet 5.0 ml of the intermediate Hg standard solution (Section 
7.2.2.2) into a 250-ml volumetric glass flask. Add 10 ml of the 5 
percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> and 2 ml of the 0.1 M ICl absorbing 
solution taken as a blank (Section 8.7.4.3), and dilute to 250 ml with 
water. Mix thoroughly.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    Because of the complexity of this method, testers should be trained 
and experienced with the test procedures to ensure reliable results. 
Since the amount of Hg that is collected generally is small, the method 
must be carefully applied to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
    8.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure outlined in 
Method 5, Section 8.1, except omit Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3.
    8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Follow the general procedure 
outlined in Method 5, Section 8.2, with the exception of the following:
    8.2.1 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads to 
assure that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to 
maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).
    8.2.2 Perform test runs such that samples are obtained over a period 
or periods that accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in 
a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, run sufficient tests 
for the accurate determination of the emissions that

[[Page 238]]

occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours 
is recommended. In some instances, high Hg or high SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentrations make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum 
time. This is indicated by reddening (liberation of free iodine) in the 
first impinger. In these cases, the sample run may be divided into two 
or more subruns to ensure that the absorbing solution is not depleted.
    8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
    8.3.1 Clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and connectors) by 
rinsing with 50 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>, tap water, 0.1 M ICl, tap 
water, and finally deionized distilled water. Place 100 ml of 0.1 M ICl 
in each of the first three impingers. Take care to prevent the absorbing 
solution from contacting any greased surfaces. Place approximately 200 g 
of preweighed silica gel in the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be 
used, but care should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and 
carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel 
container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. 
Alternatively, determine and record the weight of the silica gel plus 
impinger to the nearest 0.5 g.
    8.3.2 Install the selected nozzle using a Viton A O-ring when stack 
temperatures are less than 260 [deg]C (500 [deg]F). Use a fiberglass 
string gasket if temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in 
Method 5) for details. Other connecting systems using either 316 
stainless steel or Teflon ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with 
heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper 
distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.
    8.3.3 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 101-1, using (if 
necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass 
joints. Grease only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid the 
possibility of contamination by the silicone grease.

    Note: An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger 
and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.

    8.3.4 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set 
the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating 
temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed 
ice around the impingers.
    8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures outlined 
in Method 5, Section 8.4.
    8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure outlined 
in Method 5, Section 8.5. For each run, record the data required on a 
data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 101-4.
    8.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Section 
8.6.
    8.7 Sample Recovery. Begin proper cleanup procedure as soon as the 
probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period.
    8.7.1 Allow the probe to cool. When it can be safely handled, wipe 
off any external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle, 
and place a cap over it. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the 
sampling train is cooling. Capping would create a vacuum and draw liquid 
out from the impingers.
    8.7.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove 
the probe from the train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the open 
outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be 
present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the impinger. Use either 
ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps to close these 
openings.
    8.7.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup area 
that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Hg contamination. 
The ambient air in laboratories located in the immediate vicinity of Hg-
using facilities is not normally free of Hg contamination.
    8.7.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note any 
abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows.
    8.7.4.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe).
    8.7.4.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the 
first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid 
present (e.g., see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed 
to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only glass 
storage bottles and graduated cylinders that have been precleaned as in 
Section 8.3.1) Place the contents of the first three impingers into a 
1000-ml glass sample bottle.
    8.7.4.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other 
exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover 
the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, and 
probe liner as follows: Rinse these components with two 50-ml portions 
of 0.1 M ICl. Next, rinse the probe nozzle, fitting and liner, and each 
piece of connecting glassware between the probe liner and the back half 
of the third impinger with a maximum of 400 ml of water. Add all 
washings to the 1000-ml glass sample bottle containing the liquid from 
the first three impingers.
    8.7.4.1.3 After all washings have been collected in the sample 
container, tighten the lid on the container to prevent leakage during 
shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the liquid to determine 
later whether leakage occurred during transport. Label the container to 
identify clearly its contents.
    8.7.4.2 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 
8.7.6.3.

[[Page 239]]

    8.7.4.3 Container No. 3 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 50 ml of 
the 0.1 M ICl absorbing solution in a 100-ml sample bottle. Seal the 
container. Use this blank to prepare the working Hg standard solution 
(Section 7.2.2.3).

    9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardizations

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
    10.1 Before use, clean all glassware, both new and used, as follows: 
brush with soap and tap water, liberally rinse with tap water, soak for 
1 hour in 50 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>, and then rinse with deionized 
distilled water.
    10.2 Sampling Equipment. Calibrate the sampling equipment according 
to the procedures outlined in the following sections of Method 5: 
Section 10.1 (Probe Nozzle), Section 10.2 (Pitot Tube Assembly), Section 
10.3 (Metering System), Section 10.5 (Temperature Sensors), Section 10.6 
(Barometer).
    10.3 Aeration System Flow Rate Meter. Assemble the aeration system 
as shown in Figure 101-5. Set the outlet pressure on the aeration gas 
cylinder regulator to a minimum pressure of 500 mm Hg (10 psi), and use 
the flow metering valve and a bubble flowmeter or wet-test meter to 
obtain a flow rate of 1.5 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 liters/min (0.053 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.0035 cfm) through the aeration cell. After the 
calibration of the aeration system flow rate meter is complete, remove 
the bubble flowmeter from the system.
    10.4 Optical Cell Heating System. Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, 
add 50 ml of water to the bottle section of the aeration cell, and 
attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the cell. Attach the 
aeration cell to the optical cell and while aerating at 1.5 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 liters/min (0.053 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.0035 cfm), 
determine the minimum variable transformer setting necessary to prevent 
condensation of moisture in the optical cell and in the connecting 
tubing. (This setting should not exceed 20 volts.)
    10.5 Spectrophotometer and Recorder.
    10.5.1 The Hg response may be measured by either peak height or peak 
area.

    Note: The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which 
elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects 
the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum 
absorbance (peak height). Therefore, to obtain reproducible results, 
bring all solutions to room temperature before use.

    10.5.2 Set the spectrophotometer wavelength at 253.7 nm, and make 
certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent 
water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 50-
ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. 
Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of 
the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.

    Note: Always add the Hg-containing solution to the aeration cell 
after the 50 ml of water.

    10.5.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Before 
attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration 
cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 
101-3) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter the optical cell 
when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there is no flow through 
the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle 
section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Pipet 5 ml of tin 
(II) reducing solution into the aeration cell through the side arm, and 
immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn 
on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and 
immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring. Determine the 
maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 
percent of the recorder full scale.
    10.6 Calibration Curve.
    10.6.1 After setting the recorder scale, repeat the procedure in 
Section 10.5 using 0.0-, 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquots of 
the working standard solution (final amount of Hg in the aeration cell 
is 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ng, respectively). Repeat this 
procedure on each aliquot size until two consecutive peaks agree within 
3 percent of their average value.

    Note: To prevent Hg carryover from one sample to another, do not 
close the aeration cell from the optical cell until the recorder pen has 
returned to the baseline.)

    10.6.2 It should not be necessary to disconnect the aeration gas 
inlet line from the

[[Page 240]]

aeration cell when changing samples. After separating the bottle and 
bubbler sections of the aeration cell, place the bubbler section into a 
600-ml beaker containing approximately 400 ml of water. Rinse the bottle 
section of the aeration cell with a stream of water to remove all traces 
of the tin (II) reducing agent. Also, to prevent the loss of Hg before 
aeration, remove all traces of the reducing agent between samples by 
washing with water. It will be necessary, however, to wash the aeration 
cell parts with concentrated HCl if any of the following conditions 
occur: (1) A white film appears on any inside surface of the aeration 
cell, (2) the calibration curve changes suddenly, or (3) the replicate 
samples do not yield reproducible results.
    10.6.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank 
(0.0-ml aliquot)--which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full 
scale--from the averaged peak heights of the 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 
5.0-ml aliquot standards. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 
percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a 
reagent or carry-over of Hg from a previous sample. Prepare the 
calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard 
solution versus the corresponding final total Hg weight in the aeration 
cell (in ng), and draw the best fit straight line. This line should 
either pass through the origin or pass through a point no further from 
the origin than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full 
scale. If the line does not pass through or very near to the origin, 
check for nonlinearity of the curve and for incorrectly prepared 
standards.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Loss Check. Check the liquid level in each container to 
see whether liquid was lost during transport. If a noticeable amount of 
leakage occurred, either void the sample or use methods subject to the 
approval of the Administrator to account for the losses.
    11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat each sample as follows:
    11.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe). Carefully transfer the 
contents of Container No. 1 into a 1000-ml volumetric flask, and adjust 
the volume to exactly 1000 ml with water.
    11.2.2 Dilutions. Pipet a 2-ml aliquot from the diluted sample from 
Section 11.2.1 into a 250-ml volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of 5 percent 
H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>, and adjust the volume to exactly 250 ml 
with water. This solution is stable for at least 72 hours.

    Note: The dilution factor will be 250/2 for this solution.

    11.3 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a 
calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.3 through 10.6.
    11.3.1 Mercury Samples. Repeat the procedure used to establish the 
calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot (1 to 5 ml) of the 
diluted sample (from Section 11.2.2) until two consecutive peak heights 
agree within 3 percent of their average value. The peak maximum of an 
aliquot (except the 5-ml aliquot) must be greater than 10 percent of the 
recorder full scale. If the peak maximum of a 1.0-ml aliquot is off 
scale on the recorder, further dilute the original source sample to 
bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the 
spectrophotometer.
    11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to 
check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank 
must pass through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference 
between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the 
corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and 
the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or 
recalibration of the analyzer is required.
    11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of 
Standard Additions as follows to check at least one sample from each 
source for matrix effects on the Hg results. The Method of Standard 
Additions procedures described on pages 9-4 and 9-5 of the section 
entitled ``General Information'' of the Perkin Elmer Corporation Atomic 
Absorption Spectrophotometry Manual, Number 303-0152 (Reference 16 in 
Section 16.0) are recommended. If the results of the Method of Standard 
Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of the value obtained by the 
routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the 
source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.
    11.4 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or 
silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. (This 
step may be conducted in the field.)

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal 
significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures 
only after the final calculation. Other forms of the equations may be 
used as long as they give equivalent results.
    12.1 Average Dry Gas Meter Temperature and Average Orifice Pressure 
Drop, Dry Gas Volume, Volume of Water Vapor Condensed, Moisture Content, 
and Isokinetic Variation. Same as Method 5, Sections 12.2 through 12.5 
and 12.11, respectively.
    12.2 Stack Gas Velocity. Using the data from this test and Equation 
2-9 of Method 2, calculate the average stack gas velocity v<INF>s</INF>.
    12.3 Total Mercury.
    12.3.1 For each source sample, correct the average maximum 
absorbance of the two

[[Page 241]]

consecutive samples whose peak heights agree within 3 percent of their 
average for the contribution of the solution blank (see Section 10.6.3). 
Use the calibration curve and these corrected averages to determine the 
final total weight of Hg in ng in the aeration cell for each source 
sample.
    12.3.2 Correct for any dilutions made to bring the sample into the 
working range of the spectrophotometer. Then calculate the Hg in the 
original solution, m<INF>Hg</INF>, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.491

Where:

C<INF>Hg(AC)</INF> = Total ng of Hg in aliquot analyzed (reagent blank 
subtracted).
DF = Dilution factor for the Hg-containing solution (before adding to 
the aeration cell; e.g., DF = 250/2 if the source samples were diluted 
as described in Section 11.2.2).
V<INF>f</INF> = Solution volume of original sample, 1000 ml for samples 
diluted as described in Section 11.2.1.
10<SUP>-3</SUP> = Conversion factor, [micro]g/ng.
S = Aliquot volume added to aeration cell, ml.

    12.4 Mercury Emission Rate. Calculate the daily Hg emission rate, R, 
using Equation 101-2. For continuous operations, the operating time is 
equal to 86,400 seconds per day. For cyclic operations, use only the 
time per day each stack is in operation. The total Hg emission rate from 
a source will be the summation of results from all stacks.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.492

Where:

K<INF>1</INF> = 0.3858 [deg]K/mm Hg for metric units.
K<INF>1</INF> = 17.64 [deg]R/in. Hg for English units.
K<INF>3</INF> = 10<SUP>-6</SUP> g/[micro]g for metric units.
     = 2.2046 `` x 10<SUP>-9</SUP> lb/[micro]g for English units.
P<INF>s</INF> = Absolute stack gas pressure, mm Hg (in. Hg).
t = Daily operating time, sec/day.
T<INF>s</INF> = Absolute average stack gas temperature, [deg]K ([deg]R).
V<INF>m(std)</INF> = Dry gas sample volume at standard conditions, scm 
(scf).
V<INF>w(std)</INF> = Volume of water vapor at standard conditions, scm 
(scf).

    12.5 Determination of Compliance. Each performance test consists of 
three repetitions of the applicable test method. For the purpose of 
determining compliance with an applicable national emission standard, 
use the average of the results of all repetitions.

                         13.0 Method Performance

    The following estimates are based on collaborative tests, wherein 13 
laboratories performed duplicate analyses on two Hg-containing samples 
from a chlor-alkali plant and on one laboratory-prepared sample of known 
Hg concentration. The sample concentrations ranged from 2 to 65 [micro]g 
Hg/ml.
    13.1 Precision. The estimated intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory 
standard deviations are 1.6 and 1.8 [micro]g Hg/ml, respectively.
    13.2 Accuracy. The participating laboratories that analyzed a 64.3 
[micro]g Hg/ml (in 0.1 M ICl) standard obtained a mean of 63.7 [micro]g 
Hg/ml.
    13.3 Analytical Range. After initial dilution, the range of this 
method is 0.5 to 120 [micro]g Hg/ml. The upper limit can be extended by 
further dilution of the sample.

equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 and in this part. 
Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should 
also have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test 
methods: Methods 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 5 of part 60

    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of Hg emissions from sewage sludge incinerators and other sources as 
specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn 
isokinetically from the source and are collected in acidic potassium 
permanganate (KMnO<INF>4</INF>) solution. The Hg collected (in the 
mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from 
the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry.

                       3.0 Definitions. [Reserved]

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Sample Collection. Excessive oxidizable organic matter in the 
stack gas prematurely depletes the KMnO<INF>4</INF> solution and thereby 
prevents further collection of Hg.
    4.2 Analysis. Condensation of water vapor on the optical cell 
windows causes a positive interference.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. 
Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in 
preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with 
copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under 
shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal 
burns.
    5.2.1 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Highly toxic. Vapors are highly 
irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May 
cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to 
concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few 
minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, 
producing hydrogen gas.
    5.2.2 Nitric Acid (HNO<INF>3</INF>). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, 
nose, and lungs. Vapors cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. 
Reaction to inhalation may be delayed as long as 30 hours and still be 
fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous 
reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.
    5.2.3 Sulfuric acid (H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>). Rapidly 
destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage 
may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the 
larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with 
edema. 3 mg/m\3\ will cause lung damage in uninitiated. 1 mg/m\3\ for 8 
hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. 
Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals 
and organics.
    5.3 Chlorine Evolution. Hydrochloric acid reacts with 
KMnO<INF>4</INF> to liberate chlorine gas. Although this is a minimal 
concern when small quantities of HCl (5-10 ml) are used in the impinger 
rinse, a potential safety hazard may still exist. At sources that emit 
higher concentrations of oxidizable materials (e.g., power plants), more 
HCl may be required to remove the larger amounts of brown deposit formed 
in the impingers. In such cases, the potential safety hazards due to 
sample container pressurization are greater, because of the larger 
volume of HCl rinse added to the recovered sample. These hazards are 
eliminated by storing and analyzing the HCl impinger wash separately 
from the permanganate impinger sample.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Sample Collection and Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, 
Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, with the following exceptions:
    6.1.1 Probe Liner. Same as in Method 101, Section 6.1.2, except that 
if a filter is used ahead of the impingers, the probe heating system 
must be used to minimize the condensation of gaseous Hg.
    6.1.2 Filter Holder (Optional). Borosilicate glass with a rigid 
stainless-steel wire-screen filter support (do not use glass frit 
supports) and a silicone rubber or Teflon gasket, designed to provide a 
positive seal against leakage from outside or around the filter. The 
filter holder must be equipped with a filter heating system capable of 
maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 120 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F) during 
sampling to minimize both water and gaseous Hg condensation. A filter 
may also be used in cases where the stream contains large quantities of 
particulate matter.
    6.2 Sample Analysis. Same as Method 101, Section 6.3, with the 
following additions and exceptions:

[[Page 249]]

    6.2.1 Volumetric Pipets. Class A; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 10-, and 20-
ml.
    6.2.2 Graduated Cylinder. 25-ml.
    6.2.3 Steam Bath.
    6.2.4 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer or Equivalent. Any atomic 
absorption unit with an open sample presentation area in which to mount 
the optical cell is suitable. Instrument settings recommended by the 
particular manufacturer should be followed. Instruments designed 
specifically for the measurement of mercury using the cold-vapor 
technique are commercially available and may be substituted for the 
atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
    6.2.5 Optical Cell. Alternatively, a heat lamp mounted above the 
cell or a moisture trap installed upstream of the cell may be used.
    6.2.6 Aeration Cell. Alternatively, aeration cells available with 
commercial cold vapor instrumentation may be used.
    6.2.7 Aeration Gas Cylinder. Nitrogen, argon, or dry, Hg-free air, 
equipped with a single-stage regulator. Alternatively, aeration may be 
provided by a peristaltic metering pump. If a commercial cold vapor 
instrument is used, follow the manufacturer's recommendations.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

exhibiting at least 99.95 percent efficiency on 0.3-[mu]m dioctyl 
phthalate smoke particles. The filter in cases where the gas stream 
contains large quantities of particulate matter, but blank filters 
should be analyzed for Hg content.

not being used. Completely dissolve 20 g of tin (II) chloride (or 25 g 
of tin (II) sulfate) crystals (Baker Analyzed reagent grade or any other 
brand that will give a clear solution) in 25 ml of concentrated HCl. 
Dilute to 250 ml with water. Do not substitute HNO<INF>3</INF> 
H2SO<INF>4</INF>, or other strong acids for the HCl.

sodium chloride and 12 g of hydroxylamine sulfate (or 12 g of 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride) in water and dilute to 100 ml.
    7.2.4 Hydrochloric Acid, 8 N. Same as Section 7.1.7.
    7.2.5 Nitric Acid, 15 Percent (V/V). Carefully add 15 ml 
HNO<INF>3</INF> to 85 ml of water.
    7.2.6 Antifoam B Silicon Emulsion. J.T. Baker Company (or 
equivalent).
    7.2.7 Mercury Stock Solution, 1 mg Hg/ml. Prepare and store all Hg 
standard solutions in borosilicate glass containers. Completely dissolve 
0.1354 g of Hg (II) chloride in 75 ml of water. Add 10 ml of 
concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>, and adjust the volume to exactly 100 ml 
with water. Mix thoroughly. This solution is stable for at least one 
month.
    7.2.8 Intermediate Hg Standard Solution, 10 [micro]g/ml. Prepare 
fresh weekly. Pipet 5.0 ml of the Hg stock solution (Section 7.2.7) into 
a 500 ml volumetric flask, and add 20 ml of 15 percent HNO<INF>3</INF> 
solution. Adjust the volume to exactly 500 ml with water. Thoroughly mix 
the solution.
    7.2.9 Working Hg Standard Solution, 200 ng Hg/ml. Prepare fresh 
daily. Pipet 5.0 ml from the ``Intermediate Hg Standard Solution'' 
(Section 7.2.8) into a 250-ml volumetric flask. Add 5 ml of 4 percent 
KMnO<INF>4</INF> absorbing solution and 5 ml of 15 percent 
HNO<INF>3</INF>. Adjust the volume to exactly 250 ml with water. Mix 
thoroughly.
    7.2.10 Potassium Permanganate, 5 Percent (W/V). Dissolve 5 g of 
KMnO<INF>4</INF> in water and dilute to 100 ml.
    7.2.11 Filter. Whatman No. 40, or equivalent.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the 
following:
    8.1 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 101, Section 8.2, 
except that the liberation of free iodine in the first impinger

[[Page 250]]

due to high Hg or sulfur dioxide concentrations is not applicable. In 
this method, high oxidizable organic content may make it impossible to 
sample for the desired minimum time. This problem is indicated by the 
complete bleaching of the purple color of the KMnO<INF>4</INF> solution. 
In cases where an excess of water condensation is encountered, collect 
two runs to make one sample, or add an extra impinger in front of the 
first impinger (also containing acidified KMnO<INF>4</INF> solution).
    8.2 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 101, Section 8.3, 
with the exception of the following:
    8.2.1 In this method, clean all the glass components by rinsing with 
50 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>, tap water, 8 N HCl, tap water, and finally 
with deionized distilled water. Then place 50 ml of absorbing solution 
in the first impinger and 100 ml in each of the second and third 
impingers.
    8.2.2 If a filter is used, use a pair of tweezers to place the 
filter in the filter holder. Be sure to center the filter, and place the 
gasket in the proper position to prevent the sample gas stream from 
bypassing the filter. Check the filter for tears after assembly is 
completed. Be sure also to set the filter heating system at the desired 
operating temperature after the sampling train has been assembled.
    8.3 Sampling Train Operation. In addition to the procedure outlined 
in Method 101, Section 8.5, maintain a temperature around the filter (if 
applicable) of 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (248 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    8.4 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, Section 8.7, with the 
exception of the following:
    8.4.1 Transfer the probe, impinger assembly, and (if applicable) 
filter assembly to the cleanup area.
    8.4.2 Treat the sample as follows:
    8.4.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impinger, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if 
applicable, Container No. 1A (HCl rinse).
    8.4.2.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the 
first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid 
present (e.g., see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed 
to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only 
graduated cylinder and glass storage bottles that have been precleaned 
as in Section 8.2.1.) Place the contents of the first three impingers 
(four if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) into a 
1000-ml glass sample bottle labeled Container No. 1.

    Note: If a filter is used, remove the filter from its holder as 
outlined under Section 8.4.3.

    8.4.2.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other 
exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover 
the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe 
liner, front half of the filter holder (if applicable), and impingers as 
follows: Rinse these components with a total of 400 ml (350 ml if an 
extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) of fresh absorbing 
solution, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter 
from the impingers; add all washings to the 1000 ml glass sample bottle. 
To remove any residual brown deposits on the glassware following the 
permanganate rinse, rinse with approximately 100 ml of water, carefully 
assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers. Add 
this rinse to Container No. 1.
    8.4.2.1.3 If no visible deposits remain after this water rinse, do 
not rinse with 8 N HCl. If deposits do remain on the glassware after the 
water rinse, wash impinger walls and stems with 25 ml of 8 N HCl, and 
place the wash in a separate container labeled Container No. 1A as 
follows: Place 200 ml of water in a sample container labeled Container 
No. 1A. Wash the impinger walls and stem with the HCl by turning the 
impinger on its side and rotating it so that the HCl contacts all inside 
surfaces. Pour the HCl wash carefully with stirring into Container No. 
1A.
    8.4.2.1.4 After all washings have been collected in the appropriate 
sample container(s), tighten the lid(s) on the container(s) to prevent 
leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid 
level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred 
during transport. Label each container to identify its contents clearly.
    8.4.3 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 
8.7.6.3.
    8.4.4 Container No. 3 (Filter). If a filter was used, carefully 
remove it from the filter holder, place it in a 100-ml glass sample 
bottle, and add 20 to 40 ml of absorbing solution. If it is necessary to 
fold the filter, be sure that the particulate cake is inside the fold. 
Carefully transfer to the 100-ml sample bottle any particulate matter 
and filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket by using a dry 
Nylon bristle brush and a sharp-edged blade. Seal the container. Label 
the container to identify its contents clearly. Mark the height of the 
fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has 
occurred during transport.
    8.4.5 Container No. 4 (Filter Blank). If a filter was used, treat an 
unused filter from the same filter lot as that used for sampling 
according to the procedures outlined in Section 8.4.4.
    8.4.6 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 650 ml of 4 
percent KMnO<INF>4</INF> absorbing solution in a 1000-ml sample bottle. 
Seal the container.
    8.4.7 Container No. 6 (HCl Rinse Blank). Place 200 ml of water in a 
1000-ml sample bottle, and add 25 ml of 8 N HCl carefully

[[Page 251]]

with stirring. Seal the container. Only one blank sample per 3 runs is 
required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Same as Method 101, Section 10.0, with the following exceptions:
    10.1 Optical Cell Heating System Calibration. Same as in Method 101, 
Section 10.4, except use a-25 ml graduated cylinder to add 25 ml of 
water to the bottle section of the aeration cell.
    10.2 Spectrophotometer and Recorder Calibration.
    10.2.1 The Hg response may be measured by either peak height or peak 
area.

    Note: The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which 
elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects 
the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum 
absorbance (peak height). To obtain reproducible results, all solutions 
must be brought to room temperature before use.

    10.2.2 Set the spectrophotometer wave length at 253.7 nm, and make 
certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent 
water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 25-
ml graduated cylinder, add 25 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. 
Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of 
the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.

    Note: Always add the Hg-containing solution to the aeration cell 
after the 25 ml of water.

    10.2.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Add 5 ml of 
absorbing solution to the aeration bottle, and mix well. Before 
attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration 
cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 
101-3 of Method 101) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter 
the optical cell when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there 
is no flow through the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, 
attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. 
Add sodium chloride-hydroxylamine in 1 ml increments until the solution 
is colorless. Now add 5 ml of tin (II) solution to the aeration bottle 
through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the 
solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell 
exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued 
stirring. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this 
value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Loss Check. Check the liquid level in each container to 
see if liquid was lost during transport. If a noticeable amount of 
leakage occurred, either void the sample or use methods subject to the 
approval of the Administrator to account for the losses.
    11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat sample containers as follows:
    11.2.1 Containers No. 3 and No. 4 (Filter and Filter Blank).
    11.2.1.1 If a filter is used, place the contents, including the 
filter, of Containers No. 3 and No. 4 in separate 250-ml beakers, and 
heat the beakers on a steam bath until most of the liquid has 
evaporated. Do not heat to dryness. Add 20 ml of concentrated 
HNO<INF>3</INF> to the beakers, cover them with a watch glass, and heat 
on a hot plate at 70 [deg]C (160 [deg]F) for 2 hours. Remove from the 
hot plate.
    11.2.1.2 Filter the solution from digestion of the Container No. 3 
contents through Whatman No. 40 filter paper, and save the filtrate for 
addition to the Container No. 1 filtrate as described in Section 11.2.2. 
Discard the filter paper.
    11.2.1.3 Filter the solution from digestion of the Container No. 4 
contents through Whatman No. 40 filter paper, and save the filtrate for 
addition to Container No. 5 filtrate as described in Section 11.2.3 
below. Discard the filter paper.
    11.2.2 Container No. 1 (Impingers, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if 
applicable, No. 1A (HCl rinse).
    11.2.2.1 Filter the contents of Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 
40 filter paper into a 1 liter volumetric flask to remove the brown 
manganese dioxide (MnO<INF>2</INF>) precipitate. Save the filter for 
digestion of the brown MnO<INF>2</INF> precipitate. Add the sample 
filtrate from Container No. 3 to the 1-liter volumetric flask, and 
dilute to volume with water. If the combined filtrates are greater than 
1000 ml, determine the volume to the

[[Page 252]]

nearest ml and make the appropriate corrections for blank subtractions. 
Mix thoroughly. Mark the filtrate as analysis Sample No. A.1 and analyze 
for Hg within 48 hr of the filtration step. Place the saved filter, 
which was used to remove the brown MnO<INF>2</INF> precipitate, into an 
appropriate sized container. In a laboratory hood, add 25 ml of 8 N HCl 
to the filter and allow to digest for a minimum of 24 hours at room 
temperature.
    11.2.2.2 Filter the contents of Container 1A through Whatman No. 40 
filter paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Then filter the digestate 
of the brown MnO<INF>2</INF> precipitate from Container No. 1 through 
Whatman No. 40 filter paper into the same 500-ml volumetric flask, and 
dilute to volume with water. Mark this combined 500 ml dilute solution 
as analysis Sample No. A.2. Discard the filters.
    11.2.3 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank) and No. 6 (HCl 
Rinse Blank).
    11.2.3.1 Treat Container No. 5 as Container No. 1 (as described in 
Section 11.2.2), except substitute the filter blank filtrate from 
Container No. 4 for the sample filtrate from Container No. 3, and mark 
as Sample A.1 Blank.
    11.2.3.2 Treat Container No. 6 as Container No. 1A, (as described in 
Section 11.2.2, except substitute the filtrate from the digested blank 
MnO<INF>2</INF> precipitate for the filtrate from the digested sample 
MnO<INF>2</INF> precipitate, and mark as Sample No. A.2 Blank.

    Note: When analyzing samples A.1 Blank and HCl A.2 Blank, always 
begin with 10 ml aliquots. This applies specifically to blank samples.

    11.3 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a 
calibration curve as outlined in Section 10.0.
    11.3.1 Mercury Samples. Then repeat the procedure used to establish 
the calibration curve with appropriately sized aliquots (1 to 10 ml) of 
the samples (from Sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3) until two consecutive peak 
heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If the 10 ml 
sample is below the detectable limit, use a larger aliquot (up to 20 
ml), but decrease the volume of water added to the aeration cell 
accordingly to prevent the solution volume from exceeding the capacity 
of the aeration bottle. If the peak maximum of a 1.0 ml aliquot is off 
scale, further dilute the original sample to bring the Hg concentration 
into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer. If the Hg content 
of the absorbing solution and filter blank is below the working range of 
the analytical method, use zero for the blank.
    11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to 
check the spectrophotometer calibration; recalibrate as necessary.
    11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Same as Method 101, 
Section 11.3.3.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Note: Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal 
significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures 
only after the final calculation. Other forms of the equations may be 
used as long as they give equivalent results.

    12.1 Nomenclature.

respectively.
    12.3 Total Mercury.
    12.3.1 For each source sample, correct the average maximum

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.498

    Note: This dilution factor applies only to the intermediate dilution 
steps, since the original sample volume [(V<INF>f</INF>)<INF>HCL</INF>] 
of ``HCl A.2'' has been factored out in the equation along with the 
sample aliquot (S). In Eq. 101A-1, the sample aliquot, S, is introduced 
directly into the aeration cell for analysis according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 11.3.1. A dilution factor is required only if it is 
necessary to bring the sample into the analytical instrument's 
calibration range.
    Note: The maximum allowable blank subtraction for the HCl is the 
lesser of the two following values: (1) the actual blank measured value 
(analysis Sample No. HCl A.2 blank), or (2) 5% of the Hg content in the 
combined HCl rinse and digested sample (analysis Sample No. HCl A.2).

 Method 102--Determination of Particulate and Gaseous Mercury Emissions 
               From Chlor-Alkali Plants (Hydrogen Streams)

    Note: This method does not include all of the specifications (e.g., 
equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from other methods in this part and in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. 
Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should 
have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test 
methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, Method 5, and Method 101.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analytes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of Hg emissions, including both particulate and gaseous Hg, from chlor-
alkali plants and other sources (as specified in the regulations) where 
the carrier-gas stream in the duct or stack is principally hydrogen.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn 
isokinetically from the source and collected in acidic iodine 
monochloride (ICl) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is 
reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an 
optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                            4.0 Interferences

    Same as Method 101, Section 4.2.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Corrosive Reagents. Same as Method 101, Section 5.2.
    5.3 Explosive Mixtures. The sampler must conduct the source test 
under conditions of utmost safety because hydrogen and air mixtures are 
explosive. Since the sampling train essentially is leakless, attention 
to safe operation can be concentrated at the inlet and outlet. If a leak 
does occur, however, remove the meter box cover to avoid a possible 
explosive mixture. The following specific precautions are recommended:
    5.3.1 Operate only the vacuum pump during the test. The other 
electrical equipment, e.g., heaters, fans, and timers, normally are not 
essential to the success of a hydrogen stream test.
    5.3.2 Seal the sample port to minimize leakage of hydrogen from the 
stack.
    5.3.3 Vent sampled hydrogen at least 3 m (10 ft) away from the 
train. This can be accomplished by attaching a 13-mm (0.50-in.) ID Tygon 
tube to the exhaust from the orifice meter.

    Note: A smaller ID tubing may cause the orifice meter calibration to 
be erroneous. Take care to ensure that the exhaust line is not bent or 
pinched.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    Same as Method 101, Section 6.0, with the exception of the 
following:
    6.1 Probe Heating System. Do not use, unless otherwise specified.
    6.2 Glass Fiber Filter. Do not use, unless otherwise specified.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    Same as Method 101, Section 7.0.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the 
following:
    8.1 Setting of Isokinetic Rates.
    8.1.1 If a nomograph is used, take special care in the calculation 
of the molecular weight of the stack gas and in the setting of the 
nomograph to maintain isokinetic conditions during sampling (Sections 
8.1.1.1 through 8.1.1.3 below).
    8.1.1.1 Calibrate the meter box orifice. Use the techniques 
described in APTD-0576 (see Reference 9 in Section 17.0 of Method 5). 
Calibration of the orifice meter at flow conditions that simulate the 
conditions at the source is suggested. Calibration should either be done 
with hydrogen or with some other gas having similar Reynolds Number

[[Page 255]]

so that there is similarity between the Reynolds Numbers during 
calibration and during sampling.
    8.1.1.2 The nomograph described in APTD-0576 cannot be used to 
calculate the C factor because the nomograph is designed for use when 
the stack gas dry molecular weight is 29 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>4. 
Instead, the following calculation should be made to determine the 
proper C factor:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.501

Where:

B<INF>ws</INF> = Fraction by volume of water vapor in the stack gas.
C<INF>p</INF> = Pitot tube calibration coefficient, dimensionless.
M<INF>d</INF> = Dry molecular weight of stack gas, lb/lb-mole.
P<INF>s</INF> = Absolute pressure of stack gas, in. Hg.
P<INF>m</INF> = Absolute pressure of gas at the meter, in. Hg.
T<INF>m</INF> = Absolute temperature of gas at the orifice, [deg]R.
[Delta]H<INF>@</INF> = Meter box calibration factor obtained in Section 
8.1.1.1, in. H<INF>2</INF>O.
0.00154 = (in. H<INF>2</INF>O/[deg]R).

    Note: This calculation is left in English units, and is not 
converted to metric units because nomographs are based on English units.

    8.1.1.3 Set the calculated C factor on the operating nomograph, and 
select the proper nozzle diameter and K factor as specified in APTD-
0576. If the C factor obtained in Section 8.1.1.2 exceeds the values 
specified on the existing operating nomograph, expand the C scale 
logarithmically so that the values can be properly located.
    8.1.2 If a calculator is used to set isokinetic rates, it is 
suggested that the isokinetic equation presented in Reference 13 in 
Section 17.0 of Method 101 be consulted.
    8.2 Sampling in Small (<12-in. Diameter) Stacks. When the stack 
diameter (or equivalent diameter) is less than 12 inches, conventional 
pitot tube-probe assemblies should not be used. For sampling guidelines, 
see Reference 14 in Section 17.0 of Method 101.

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Highly corrosive and toxic. Vapors are 
highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. 
May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to 
concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few 
minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, 
producing hydrogen gas. Personal protective equipment and safe 
procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact 
occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water at least 15 
minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual 
chemical burn as thermal burn.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

placed immediately against the back side of the Millipore filter as a 
guard against breakage of the Millipore. Include the backup filter in 
the analysis. To be equivalent, other filters shall exhibit at least 
99.95 percent efficiency (0.05 percent penetration) on 0.3 micron 
dioctyl phthalate smoke particles, and be amenable to the Be analysis 
procedure. The filter efficiency tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with ASTM D 2986-71, 78, 95a (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 
61.18). Test data from the supplier's quality control program are 
sufficient for this purpose.

minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent.
    6.3 Sample Recovery.
    6.3.1 Probe Cleaning Equipment. Probe brush or cleaning rod at least 
as long as probe, or equivalent. Clean cotton balls, or equivalent, 
should be used with the rod.
    6.3.2 Leakless Glass Sample Bottles. To contain sample.

    7.1.3 Wash Acid, 50 Percent (V/V) Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Mix equal 
volumes of concentrated HCl and water, being careful to add the acid 
slowly to the water.
    7.2 Analysis. Reagents and standards as necessary for the selected 
analytical procedure.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    Guidelines for source testing are detailed in the following 
sections. These guidelines are generally applicable; however, most 
sample sites differ to some degree and temporary alterations such as 
stack extensions or expansions often are required to insure the best 
possible sample site. Further, since Be is hazardous, care should be 
taken to minimize exposure. Finally, since the total quantity of Be to 
be collected is quite small, the test must be carefully conducted to 
prevent contamination or loss of sample.
    8.1 Selection of a Sampling Site and Number of Sample Runs. Select a 
suitable sample site that is as close as practicable to the point of 
atmospheric emission. If possible, stacks smaller than one foot in 
diameter should not be sampled.

[[Page 257]]

    8.1.1 Ideal Sampling Site. The ideal sampling site is at least eight 
stack or duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from any 
flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion or contraction. For 
rectangular cross sections, use Equation 103-1 in Section 12.2 to 
determine an equivalent diameter, D<INF>e</INF>.
    8.1.2 Alternate Sampling Site. Some sampling situations may render 
the above sampling site criteria impractical. In such cases, select an 
alternate site no less than two diameters downstream and one-half 
diameter upstream from any point of flow disturbance. Additional sample 
runs are recommended at any sample site not meeting the criteria of 
Section 8.1.1.
    8.1.3 Number of Sample Runs Per Test. Three sample runs constitute a 
test. Conduct each run at one of three different points. Select three 
points that proportionately divide the diameter, or are located at 25, 
50, and 75 percent of the diameter from the inside wall. For horizontal 
ducts, sample on a vertical line through the centroid. For rectangular 
ducts, sample on a line through the centroid and parallel to a side. If 
additional sample runs are performed per Section 8.1.2, proportionately 
divide the duct to accommodate the total number of runs.
    8.2 Measurement of Stack Conditions. Using the equipment described 
in Section 6.2, measure the stack gas pressure, moisture, and 
temperature to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas. Sound 
engineering estimates may be made in lieu of direct measurements. 
Describe the basis for such estimates in the test report.
    8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
    8.3.1 Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 103-1. It is 
recommended that all glassware be precleaned by soaking in wash acid for 
two hours.
    8.3.2 Leak check the sampling train at the sampling site. The 
leakage rate should not be in excess of 1 percent of the desired sample 
rate.
    8.4 Sampling Train Operation.
    8.4.1 For each run, measure the velocity at the selected sampling 
point. Determine the isokinetic sampling rate. Record the velocity head 
and the required sampling rate. Place the nozzle at the sampling point 
with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start 
the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. At the conclusion 
of the test, record the sampling rate. Again measure the velocity head 
at the sampling point. The required isokinetic rate at the end of the 
period should not have deviated more than 20 percent from that 
originally calculated. Describe the reason for any deviation beyond 20 
percent in the test report.
    8.4.2 Sample at a minimum rate of 14 liters/min (0.5 cfm). Obtain 
samples over such a period or periods of time as are necessary to 
determine the maximum emissions which would occur in a 24-hour period. 
In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs so as 
to allow determination or calculation of the emissions that occur over 
the duration of the cycle. A minimum sampling time of two hours per run 
is recommended.
    8.5 Sample Recovery.
    8.5.1 It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned as in 
Section 8.3. Sample recovery should also be performed in an area free of 
possible Be contamination. When the sampling train is moved, exercise 
care to prevent breakage and contamination. Set aside a portion of the 
acetone used in the sample recovery as a blank for analysis. The total 
amount of acetone used should be measured for accurate blank correction. 
Blanks can be eliminated if prior analysis shows negligible amounts.
    8.5.2 Remove the filter (and backup filter, if used) and any loose 
particulate matter from filter holder, and place in a container.
    8.5.3 Clean the probe with acetone and a brush or long rod and 
cotton balls. Wash into the container with the filter. Wash out the 
filter holder with acetone, and add to the same container.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Sampling Train. As a procedural check, compare the sampling 
rate regulation with a dry gas meter, spirometer, rotameter (calibrated 
for prevailing atmospheric conditions), or equivalent, attached to the 
nozzle inlet of the complete sampling train.
    10.2 Analysis. Perform the analysis standardization as suggested by 
the manufacturer of the instrument, or the procedures for the analytical 
method in use.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    Make the necessary preparation of samples and analyze for Be. Any 
currently acceptable method (e.g., atomic absorption, spectrographic, 
fluorometric, chromatographic) may be used.

method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 Particulate and gaseous Be emissions are withdrawn 
isokinetically from the source and are collected on a glass fiber filter 
and in water. The collected sample is digested in an acid solution and 
is analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Matrix Effects. Analysis for Be by flame atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry is sensitive to the chemical composition and to the 
physical properties (e.g., viscosity, pH) of the sample. Aluminum and 
silicon in particular are known to interfere when present in appreciable 
quantities. The analytical procedure includes (optionally) the use of 
the Method of Standard Additions to check for these matrix effects, and 
sample analysis using the Method of Standard Additions if significant 
matrix effects are found to be present (see Reference 2 in Section 
16.0).

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the

    5.2.1 Hydrochloric Acid (HC<INF>l</INF>). Highly toxic. Vapors are 
highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. 
May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to 
concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few 
minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, 
producing hydrogen gas.
    5.2.2 Hydrogen Peroxide (H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF>). Irritating to 
eyes, skin, nose, and lungs.

fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous 
reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.
    5.2.4 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). Causes severe damage to eyes and 
skin. Inhalation causes irritation to nose, throat, and lungs. Reacts

maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).
    8.2.2 Obtain samples over a period or periods of time that 
accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in a 24-hour 
period. In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs 
for the accurate determination of the emissions that occur over the 
duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours per run is 
recommended.
    8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 5, Section 8.3, 
with the exception of the following:
    8.3.1 Prior to assembly, clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and 
connectors) by first soaking in wash acid for 2 hours, followed by 
rinsing with water.
    8.3.2 Save a portion of the water for a blank analysis.
    8.3.3 Procedures relating to the use of metal probe liners are not 
applicable.
    8.3.4 Probe and filter heating systems are needed only if water 
condensation is a problem. If this is the case, adjust the heaters to 
provide a temperature at or above the stack temperature. However, 
membrane filters such as the Millipore AA are limited to about 107 
[deg]C (225 [deg]F). If the stack gas is in excess of about 93 [deg]C 
(200 [deg]F), consideration should be given to an alternate procedure 
such as moving the filter holder downstream of the first impinger to 
insure that the filter does not exceed its temperature limit. After the 
sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating 
system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time 
for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the 
impingers.

    Note: An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger 
and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.

    8.4 Leak Check Procedures, Sampling Train Operation, and Calculation 
of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Sections 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6, 
respectively.

[[Page 262]]

    8.5 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7, except treat the 
sample as follows: Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup 
area that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Be 
contamination. Inspect the train before and during this assembly, and 
note any abnormal conditions. Treat the sample as follows: Disconnect 
the probe from the impinger train.
    8.5.1 Container No. 1. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.1.
    8.5.2 Container No. 2. Place the contents (measured to 1 ml) of the 
first three impingers into a glass sample bottle. Use the procedures 
outlined in Section 8.7.6.2 of Method 5, where applicable, to rinse the 
probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, filter holder, and all 
glassware between the filter holder and the back half of the third 
impinger with water. Repeat this procedure with acetone. Place both 
water and acetone rinse solutions in the sample bottle with the contents 
of the impingers.
    8.5.3 Container No. 3. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
    8.6 Blanks.
    8.6.1 Water Blank. Save a portion of the water as a blank. Take 200 
ml directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in a plastic 
sample container labeled ``H<INF>2</INF>O blank.''
    8.6.2 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in 
sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled ``filter blank.''
    8.7 Post-test Glassware Rinsing. If an additional test is desired, 
the glassware can be carefully double rinsed with water and reassembled. 
However, if the glassware is out of use more than 2 days, repeat the 
initial acid wash procedure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
    10.1 Sampling Equipment. Same as Method 5, Section 10.0.
    10.2 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ml 
of the 1.0 [micro]g Be/ml working standard solution into separate 100 ml 
volumetric flasks, and dilute to the mark with water. The total amounts 
of Be in these standards are 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 [micro]g, respectively.
    10.3 Spectrophotometer and Recorder. The Be response may be measured 
by either peak height or peak area. Analyze an aliquot of the 10-
[micro]g standard at 234.8 nm using a nitrous oxide/acetylene flame. 
Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to 
read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.
    10.4 Calibration Curve.
    10.4.1 After setting the recorder scale, analyze an appropriately 
sized aliquot of each standard and the BLANK (see Section 11) until two 
consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value.
    10.4.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the 
blank--which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale--from 
the averaged peak heights of the standards. If the blank absorbance is 
greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Be 
contamination of a reagent or carry-over of Be from a previous sample. 
Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of 
each standard solution versus the corresponding total Be weight in the 
standard (in [micro]g).
    10.5 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the 
least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through 
the origin or through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the 
corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to 
determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical 
calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration 
values and the actual concentrations (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 [micro]g 
Be) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in 
Container No. 2. Note on the analytical data sheet whether leakage 
occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, 
either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator, to adjust the final results.
    11.2 Glassware Cleaning. Before use, clean all glassware according 
to the procedure of Section 8.3.1.

[[Page 263]]

    11.3 Sample Preparation. The digestion of Be samples is accomplished 
in part in concentrated HClO<INF>4</INF>.

    Note: The sample must be heated to light brown fumes after the 
initial HNO3 addition; otherwise, dangerous perchlorates may result from 
the subsequent HClO<INF>4</INF> digestion. HClO<INF>4</INF> should be 
used only under a hood.

    11.3.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose 
particulate matter from Container No. 1 to a 150-ml beaker. Add 35 ml 
concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>. To oxidize all organic matter, heat on a 
hotplate until light brown fumes are evident. Cool to room temperature, 
and add 5 ml 12 N H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> and 5 ml concentrated 
HClO<INF>4</INF>.
    11.3.2 Container No. 2. Place a portion of the water and acetone 
sample into a 150 ml beaker, and put on a hotplate. Add portions of the 
remainder as evaporation proceeds and evaporate to dryness. Cool the 
residue, and add 35 ml concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>. To oxidize all 
organic matter, heat on a hotplate until light brown fumes are evident. 
Cool to room temperature, and add 5 ml 12 N H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> 
and 5 ml concentrated HClO<INF>4</INF>. Then proceed with step 11.3.4.
    11.3.3 Final Sample Preparation. Add the sample from Section 11.3.2 
to the 150-ml beaker from Section 11.3.1. Replace on a hotplate, and 
evaporate to dryness in a HClO<INF>4</INF> hood. Cool the residue to 
room temperature, add 10.0 ml of 25 percent V/V HCl, and mix to dissolve 
the residue.
    11.3.4 Filter and Water Blanks. Cut each filter into strips, and 
treat each filter individually as directed in Section 11.3.1. Treat the 
200-ml water blank as directed in Section 11.3.2. Combine and treat 
these blanks as directed in Section 11.3.3.
    11.4 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the 
wavelength, slit width, and lamp current; and adjust the background 
corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular 
atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame 
characteristics as necessary.
    11.5 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a 
calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.4 and 10.5.
    11.5.1 Beryllium Samples. Repeat the procedure used to establish the 
calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot of each sample 
(from Section 11.3.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 
percent of their average value. The peak height of each sample must be 
greater than 10 percent of the recorder full scale. If the peak height 
of the sample is off scale on the recorder, further dilute the original 
source sample to bring the Be concentration into the calibration range 
of the spectrophotometer.
    11.5.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to 
check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank 
must pass through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference 
between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the 
corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and 
the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or 
recalibration of the analyzer is required.
    11.5.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of 
Standard Additions (see Reference 2 in Section 16.0) to check at least 
one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Be results. If the 
results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single 
source sample do not agree to within 5 percent of the value obtained by 
the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from 
the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.
    11.6 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or 
silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. (This 
step may be conducted in the field.)

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal 
significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures 
only after the final calculation. Other forms of the equations may be 
used as long as they give equivalent results.

maximum absorbance of the two consecutive samples whose peak heights 
agree within 3 percent of their average for the contribution of the 
solution blank (see Sections 11.3.4 and 11.5.2). Correcting for any 
dilutions if necessary, use the calibration curve and these corrected

[[Page 264]]

averages to determine the total weight of Be in each source sample.
    12.4 Beryllium Emission Rate. Calculate the daily Hg emission rate, 
R, using Equation 104-1. For continuous operations, the operating time 
is equal to 86,400 seconds per day. For cyclic operations, use only the 
time per day each stack is in operation. The total Hg emission rate from 
a source will be the summation of results from all stacks.

    11.1 Solids Content of Blended Sludge. Dry one of the 20-ml blended 
samples from Section 8.2 in an oven at 105 [deg]C (221 [deg]F) to 
constant weight. Cool in a desiccator, weigh and record the dry weight 
of the sample.
    11.2 Aqua Regia Digestion of Blended Samples.
    11.2.1 To each of the three remaining 20-ml samples from Section 8.2 
add 25 ml of aqua regia, and digest the on a hot plate at low heat (do 
not boil) for 30 min, or until samples are a pale yellow-brown color and 
are void of the dark brown color characteristic of organic matter. 
Remove from hotplate and allow to cool.
    11.2.2 Filter each digested sample separately through an S and S No. 
588 filter or equivalent, and rinse the filter contents with 50 ml of 
water. Transfer the filtrate and filter washing to a 100-ml volumetric 
flask, and carefully dilute to volume with water.
    11.3 Solids Content of the Sludge Before Blending. Remove two 100-ml 
portions of

[[Page 266]]

mixed sludge from the mortar mixer and place in separate, tared 400-ml 
beakers. Reweigh each beaker to determine the exact amount of sludge 
added. Dry in oven at 105 [deg]C (221 [deg]F) and cool in a desiccator 
to constant weight.
    11.4 Analysis for Mercury. Analyze the three aqua regia-digested

calibration curve and these corrected averages to determine the final Hg 
concentration in the solution cell for each sludge sample.

                        1.0 Scope and Application

    1.1 Analytes.

    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of vinyl chloride emissions from ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride, 
and polyvinyl chloride manufacturing processes. This method does not 
measure vinyl chloride contained in particulate matter.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 An integrated bag sample of stack gas containing vinyl chloride 
is subjected to GC analysis using a flame ionization detector (FID).

                       3.0 Definitions. [Reserved]

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 Resolution interferences of vinyl chloride may be encountered on 
some sources. Therefore, the chromatograph operator should select the 
column and operating parameters best suited to the particular analysis 
requirements. The selection made is subject to approval of the 
Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that confirming data are 
produced through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, and that 
the data are available for review by the Administrator. An example of 
this would be analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Analysis. The following reagents are required for analysis.

[[Page 269]]

    7.1.1 Helium or Nitrogen. Purity 99.9995 percent or greater, for 
chromatographic carrier gas.
    7.1.2 Hydrogen. Purity 99.9995 percent or greater.
    7.1.3 Oxygen or Air. Either oxygen (purity 99.99 percent or greater) 
or air (less than 0.1 ppmv total hydrocarbon content), as required by 
detector.
    7.2 Calibration. Use one of the following options: either Sections 
7.2.1 and 7.2.2, or Section 7.2.3.
    7.2.1 Vinyl Chloride. Pure vinyl chloride gas certified by the 
manufacturer to contain a minimum of 99.9 percent vinyl chloride. If the 
gas manufacturer maintains a bulk cylinder supply of 99.9+ percent vinyl 
chloride, the certification analysis may have been performed on this 
supply, rather than on each gas cylinder prepared from this bulk supply. 
The date of gas cylinder preparation and the certified analysis must 
have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the gas 
manufacturer to the buyer.
    7.2.2 Nitrogen. Same as described in Section 7.1.1.
    7.2.3 Cylinder Standards. Gas mixture standards (50-,10-, and 5 ppmv 
vinyl chloride) in nitrogen cylinders may be used to directly prepare a 
chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3 if the 
following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas 
composition with an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent or 
better. (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which 
the gas concentration does not change by greater than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer 
affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride 
concentration, and recommended maximum shelf to the cylinder before 
shipment to the buyer.
    7.2.3.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall 
certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder 
by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating his 
analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate his 
analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use as a minimum, a three 
point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer 
maintain (1) a high concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 
100 ppmv) to prepare his calibration curve by an appropriate dilution 
technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 5 
and 10 ppmv) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference 
between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and 
the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration 
standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer 
shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the 
three-point calibration.
    7.2.3.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before 
using a standard, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration 
standard (a) by comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole 
percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in 
Section 7.2.1 or (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder 
Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) prepared by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, if such SRM's are available. The agreement 
between the initially determined concentration value and the 
verification concentration value must be <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a 
time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards 
sold.
    7.2.4 Audit Cylinder Standards.
    7.2.4.1 Gas mixture standards with concentrations known only to the 
person supervising the analysis of samples. The concentrations of the 
audit cylinders should be: one low-concentration cylinder in the range 
of 5 to 20 ppmv vinyl chloride and one high-concentration cylinder in 
the range of 20 to 50 ppmv. When available, obtain audit samples from 
the appropriate EPA Regional Office or from the responsible enforcement 
authority.

    Note: The responsible enforcement agency should be notified at least 
30 days prior to the test date to allow sufficient time for sample 
delivery.

    7.2.4.2 Alternatively, audit cylinders obtained from a commercial 
gas manufacturer may be used provided: (a) the gas meets the conditions 
described in Section 7.2.3, (b) the gas manufacturer certifies the audit 
cylinder as described in Section 7.2.3.1, and (c) the gas manufacturer 
obtains an independent analysis of the audit cylinders to verify this 
analysis. Independent analysis is defined here to mean analysis 
performed by an individual different than the individual who performs 
the gas manufacturer's analysis, while using calibration standards and 
analysis equipment different from those used for the gas manufacturer's 
analysis. Verification is complete and acceptable when the independent 
analysis concentration is within 5 percent of the gas manufacturer's 
concentration.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    Note: Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons 
unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) nor by those 
who are unfamiliar with source sampling, because knowledge beyond the 
scope of this presentation is required.

    8.1 Bag Leak-Check. The following leak-check procedure is 
recommended, but not required, prior to sample collection. The post-test 
leak-check procedure is mandatory. Connect a water manometer and 
pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H<INF>2</INF>O (2 to 4 in. 
H<INF>2</INF>O).

[[Page 270]]

Allow to stand for 10 min. Any displacement in the water manometer 
indicates a leak. Also, check the rigid container for leaks in this 
manner.

    Note: An alternative leak-check method is to pressurize the bag to 5 
to 10 cm H2O and allow it to stand overnight. A deflated bag indicates a 
leak. For each sample bag in its rigid container, place a rotameter in 
line between the bag and the pump inlet. Evacuate the bag. Failure of 
the rotameter to register zero flow when the bag appears to be empty 
indicates a leak.

    8.2 Sample Collection. Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 
106-1. Join the quick connects as illustrated, and determine that all 
connection between the bag and the probe are tight. Place the end of the 
probe at the centroid of the stack and start the pump with the needle 
valve adjusted to yield a flow that will fill over 50 percent of bag 
volume in the specific sample period. After allowing sufficient time to 
purge the line several times, change the vacuum line from the container 
to the bag and evacuate the bag until the rotameter indicates no flow. 
Then reposition the sample and vacuum lines and begin the actual 
sampling, keeping the rate proportional to the stack velocity. At all 
times, direct the gas exiting the rotameter away from sampling 
personnel. At the end of the sample period, shut off the pump, 
disconnect the sample line from the bag, and disconnect the vacuum line 
from the bag container. Protect the bag container from sunlight.
    8.3 Sample Storage. Keep the sample bags out of direct sunlight. 
When at all possible, analysis is to be performed within 24 hours, but 
in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Aluminized Mylar 
bag samples must be analyzed within 24 hours.
    8.4 Post-test Bag Leak-Check. Subsequent to recovery and analysis of 
the sample, leak-check the sample bag according to the procedure 
outlined in Section 8.1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9.2 Immediately after the preparation of the calibration curve and 
prior to the sample analyses, perform the analysis audit described in 
appendix C, Procedure 2: ``Procedure for Field Auditing GC Analysis.''

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.

    10.1 Preparation of Vinyl Chloride Standard Gas Mixtures. (Optional 
Procedure-delete if cylinder standards are used.) Evacuate a 16-inch 
square Tedlar bag that has passed a leak-check (described in Section 
8.1) and meter in 5.0 liters of nitrogen. While the bag is filling, use 
the 0.5-ml syringe to inject 250 [micro]l of 99.9+ percent vinyl 
chloride gas through the wall of the bag. Upon withdrawing the syringe, 
immediately cover the resulting hole with a piece of adhesive tape. The 
bag now contains a vinyl chloride concentration of 50 ppmv. In a like 
manner use the 50 [micro]l syringe to prepare gas mixtures having 10-and 
5-ppmv vinyl chloride concentrations. Place each bag on a smooth surface 
and alternately depress opposite sides of the bag 50 times to further 
mix the gases. These gas mixture standards may be used for 10 days from 
the date of preparation, after which time new gas mixtures must be 
prepared. (Caution: Contamination may be a problem when a bag is reused 
if the new gas mixture standard is a lower concentration than the 
previous gas mixture standard.)
    10.2 Determination of Vinyl Chloride Retention Time. (This section 
can be performed simultaneously with Section 10.3.) Establish 
chromatograph conditions identical with those in Section 11.3. Determine 
proper attenuator position. Flush the sampling loop with helium or 
nitrogen and activate the sample valve. Record the injection time, 
sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, 
chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record peaks and detector responses 
that occur in the absence of vinyl chloride. Maintain conditions with 
the equipment plumbing arranged identically to Section 11.2, and flush 
the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the 
vinyl chloride calibration mixtures. Then activate the sample valve. 
Record the injection time. Select the peak that corresponds to vinyl 
chloride. Measure the distance on the chart from the injection time to 
the time at which the peak maximum occurs. This quantity divided by the 
chart speed is defined as the retention time. Since other organics may 
be present in the sample, positive identification of the vinyl chloride 
peak must be made.
    10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Make a GC 
measurement of each gas mixture standard (described in Section 7.2.3 or 
10.1) using conditions identical to those listed in Sections 11.2 and 
11.3. Flush the sampling loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min 
with one of the standard mixtures, and activate the sample valve.

[[Page 271]]

Record the concentration of vinyl chloride injected (C<INF>c</INF>), 
attenuator setting, chart speed, peak area, sample loop temperature, 
column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and retention time. Record 
the barometric pressure. Calculate A<INF>c</INF>, the peak area 
multiplied by the attenuator setting. Repeat until two consecutive 
injection areas are within 5 percent, then plot the average of those two 
values versus C<INF>c</INF>. When the other standard gas mixtures have 
been similarly analyzed and plotted, draw a straight line through the 
points derived by the least squares method. Perform calibration daily, 
or before and after the analysis of each emission test set of bag 
samples, whichever is more frequent. For each group of sample analyses, 
use the average of the two calibration curves which bracket that group 
to determine the respective sample concentrations. If the two 
calibration curves differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, 
then report the final results by both calibration curves.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Audit Sample Analysis. Immediately after the preparation of the 
calibration curve and prior to the sample analyses, perform the analysis 
audit described in Procedure 2 of appendix C to this part: ``Procedure 
for Field Auditing GC Analysis.''
    11.2 Sample Recovery. With a new piece of Teflon tubing identified 
for that bag, connect a bag inlet valve to the gas chromatograph sample 
valve. Switch the valve to receive gas from the bag through the sample 
loop. Arrange the equipment so the sample gas passes from the sample 
valve to 100-ml/min rotameter with flow control valve followed by a 
charcoal tube and a 1-in. H<INF>2</INF>O pressure gauge. Maintain the 
sample flow either by a vacuum pump or container pressurization if the 
collection bag remains in the rigid container. After sample loop purging 
is ceased, allow the pressure gauge to return to zero before activating 
the gas sampling valve.
    11.3 Analysis.
    11.3.1 Set the column temperature to 100 [deg]C (210 [deg]F) and the 
detector temperature to 150 [deg]C (300 [deg]F). When optimum hydrogen 
and oxygen (or air) flow rates have been determined, verify and maintain 
these flow rates during all chromatography operations. Using helium or 
nitrogen as the carrier gas, establish a flow rate in the range 
consistent with the manufacturer's requirements for satisfactory 
detector operation. A flow rate of approximately 40 ml/min should 
produce adequate separations. Observe the base line periodically and 
determine that the noise level has stabilized and that base line drift 
has ceased. Purge the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/
min, shut off flow, allow the sample loop pressure to reach atmospheric 
pressure as indicated by the H<INF>2</INF>O manometer, then activate the 
sample valve. Record the injection time (the position of the pen on the 
chart at the time of sample injection), sample number, sample loop 
temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and 
attenuator setting. Record the barometric pressure. From the chart, note 
the peak having the retention time corresponding to vinyl chloride as 
determined in Section 10.2. Measure the vinyl chloride peak area, 
A<INF>m</INF>, by use of a disc integrator, electronic integrator, or a 
planimeter. Measure and record the peak heights, H<INF>m</INF>. Record 
A<INF>m</INF> and retention time. Repeat the injection at least two 
times or until two consecutive values for the total area of the vinyl 
chloride peak agree within 5 percent of their average. Use the average 
value for these two total areas to compute the bag concentration.
    11.3.2 Compare the ratio of H<INF>m</INF> to A<INF>m</INF> for the 
vinyl chloride sample with the same ratio for the standard peak that is 
closest in height. If these ratios differ by more than 10 percent, the 
vinyl chloride peak may not be pure (possibly acetaldehyde is present) 
and the secondary column should be employed (see Section 6.3.2.2).
    11.4 Determination of Bag Water Vapor Content. Measure the ambient 
temperature and barometric pressure near the bag. From a water 
saturation vapor pressure table, determine and record the water vapor 
content of the bag, B<INF>wb</INF>, as a decimal figure. (Assume the 
relative humidity to be 100 percent unless a lesser value is known.)

                         13.0 Method Performance

    13.1 Analytical Range. This method is designed for the 0.1 to 50 
parts per million by volume (ppmv) range. However, common gas 
chromatograph (GC) instruments are capable of detecting 0.02 ppmv vinyl 
chloride. With proper calibration, the upper limit may be extended as 
needed.

    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of the vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) content of in-process wastewater 
samples, and the residual vinyl chloride monomer (RCVM) content of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, wet, cake, slurry, and latex samples. 
It cannot be used for polymer in fused forms, such as sheet or cubes. 
This method is not acceptable where methods from section 304(h) of the 
Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. (the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) 
are required.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    2.1 The basis for this method relates to the vapor equilibrium that 
is established at a constant known temperature in a closed system 
between RVCM, PVC resin, water, and air. The RVCM in a PVC resin will 
equilibrate rapidly in a closed vessel, provided that the temperature of 
the PVC resin is maintained above the glass transition temperature of 
that specific resin.
    2.2 A sample of PVC or in-process wastewater is collected in a vial 
or bottle and is conditioned. The headspace in the vial or bottle is 
then analyzed for vinyl chloride using gas chromatography with a flame 
ionization detector.

                       3.0 Definitions [Reserved]

                            4.0 Interferences

    4.1 The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating 
parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of 
vinyl chloride; however, resolution interferences may be encountered on 
some sources. Therefore, the chromatograph operator shall select the 
column and operating parameters best suited to his particular analysis 
requirements, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is 
automatic provided that confirming data are produced through an adequate 
supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different 
column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and that these data are made available 
for review by the Administrator.

                               5.0 Safety

    5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, 
operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the 
safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the 
user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to performing this test method.
    5.2 Toxic Analyte. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of 
sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, which is a carcinogen. Do not 
release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation 
of standards. Venting or purging with VCM/air mixtures must be held to a 
minimum. When they are required, the vapor must be routed to outside 
air. Vinyl chloride, even at low ppm levels, must never be vented inside 
the laboratory. After vials have been analyzed, the gas must be vented 
prior to removal of the vial from the instrument turntable. Vials must 
be vented through a hypodermic needle connected to an activated charcoal 
tube to prevent release of vinyl chloride into the laboratory 
atmosphere. The charcoal must be replaced prior to vinyl chloride 
breakthrough.

                       6.0 Equipment and Supplies

    6.1 Sample Collection. The following equipment is required:
    6.1.1 Glass bottles. 60-ml (2-oz) capacity, with wax-lined screw-on 
tops, for PVC samples.

vial at a temperature of 90 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]C (194 
[deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.9 [deg]F). The chromatograph shall be 
equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Perkin-Elmer 
Corporation Models F-40, F-42, F-45, HS-6, and HS-100, and Hewlett-
Packard Corporation Model 19395A have been found satisfactory. 
Chromatograph backflush capability may be required.
    6.3.2 Chromatographic Columns. Stainless steel 1 m by 3.2 mm and 2 m 
by 3.2 mm, both containing 50/80-mesh Porapak Q. Other columns may be 
used provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of vinyl 
chloride standards are not impaired and information confirming that 
there is adequate resolution of the vinyl chloride peak are available 
for review. (Adequate resolution is defined as an area overlap of not 
more than 10 percent of the vinyl chloride peak by an interferant peak. 
Calculation of area overlap is explained in Procedure 1 of appendix C to 
this part: ``Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak 
Resolution.'') Two 1.83 m columns, each containing 1 percent Carbowax 
1500 on Carbopak B, have been found satisfactory for samples containing 
acetaldehyde.

    6.3.6 Regulators. For required gas cylinders.
    6.3.7 Headspace Vial Pre-Pressurizer. Nitrogen pressurized 
hypodermic needle inside protective shield.

                       7.0 Reagents and Standards

    7.1 Analysis. Same as Method 106, Section 7.1, with the addition of 
the following:
    7.1.1 Water. Interference-free.
    7.2 Calibration. The following items are required for calibration:
    7.2.1 Cylinder Standards (4). Gas mixture standards (50-, 500-, 
2000- and 4000-ppm vinyl chloride in nitrogen cylinders). Cylinder 
standards may be used directly to prepare a chromatograph calibration 
curve as described in Section 10.3, if the following conditions are met: 
(a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent or better (see Section 7.2.1.1). (b) The 
manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas 
concentration does not change by greater than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date 
of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and 
recommended maximum shelf life to the cylinder before shipment to the 
buyer.
    7.2.1.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall 
certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder 
by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating the 
analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate the 
analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use, as a minimum, a 3-
point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer 
maintain (1) a high-concentration calibration standard (between 4000 and 
8000 ppm) to prepare the calibration curve by an appropriate dilution 
technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 50 
and 500 ppm) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference 
between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and 
the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration 
standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer 
shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the 3-
point calibration.
    7.2.1.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before 
using, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard by (a) 
comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl 
chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10.1 of 
Method 106 or by (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder 
Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) prepared by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, if such SRMs are available. The agreement 
between the initially determined concentration value and the 
verification concentration value must be within 5 percent. The 
manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval 
consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

    8.1 Sample Collection.
    8.1.1 PVC Sampling. Allow the resin or slurry to flow from a tap on 
the tank or silo until the tap line has been well purged. Extend and 
fill a 60-ml sample bottle under the tap, and immediately tighten a cap 
on the bottle. Wrap adhesive tape around the cap and bottle to prevent 
the cap from loosening. Place an identifying label on each bottle, and 
record the date, time, and sample location both on the bottles and in a 
log book.
    8.1.2 Water Sampling. At the sampling location fill the vials 
bubble-free to overflowing so that a convex meniscus forms at the top. 
The excess water is displaced as the sealing disc is carefully placed, 
with the Teflon side down, on the opening of the vial. Place the 
aluminum seal over the disc and the neck of the vial, and crimp into 
place. Affix an identifying label on the bottle, and record the date, 
time, and sample location both on the vials and in a log book.
    8.2 Sample Storage. All samples must be analyzed within 24 hours of 
collection, and must be refrigerated during this period.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
    10.1 Preparation of Standards. Calibration standards are prepared as 
follows: Place 100 [micro]l or about two equal drops of distilled water 
in the sample vial, then fill the vial with the VCM/nitrogen standard, 
rapidly seat the septum, and seal with the aluminum cap. Use a \1/8\-in. 
stainless steel line from the cylinder to the vial. Do not use rubber or 
Tygon tubing. The sample line from the cylinder must be purged (into a 
properly vented hood) for several minutes prior to filling the vials. 
After purging, reduce the flow rate to between 500 and 1000 cc/min. 
Place end of tubing into vial (near bottom). Position a septum on top of 
the vial, pressing it against the \1/8\-in. filling tube to minimize the 
size of the vent opening. This is necessary to minimize mixing air with 
the standard in the vial. Each vial is to be purged with standard for 90 
seconds, during which time the filling tube is gradually slid to the top 
of the vial. After the 90 seconds, the tube is removed with the septum, 
simultaneously sealing the vial. Practice will be necessary to develop 
good technique. Rubber gloves should be worn during the above 
operations. The sealed vial must then be pressurized for 60 seconds 
using the vial prepressurizer. Test the vial for leakage by placing a 
drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. Prepressurization of 
standards is not required unless samples have been prepressurized.
    10.2 Analyzer Calibration. Calibration is to be performed each 8-
hour period the chromatograph is used. Alternatively, calibration with 
duplicate 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards (hereafter 
described as a four-point calibration) may be performed on a monthly 
basis, provided that a calibration confirmation test consisting of 
duplicate analyses of an appropriate standard is performed once per 
plant shift, or once per chromatograph carrousel operation (if the 
chromatograph operation is less frequent than once per shift). The 
criterion for acceptance of each calibration confirmation test is that 
both analyses of 500-ppm standards [2,000-ppm standards if dispersion 
resin (excluding latex resin) samples are being analyzed] must be within 
5 percent of the most recent four-point calibration curve. If this 
criterion is not met, then a complete four-point calibration must be 
performed before sample analyses can proceed.
    10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Prepare two 
vials each of 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards. Run the 
calibration samples in exactly the same manner as regular samples. Plot 
A<INF>s</INF>, the integrator area counts for each standard sample, 
versus C<INF>c</INF>, the concentration of vinyl chloride in each 
standard sample. Draw a straight line through the points derived by the 
least squares method.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Preparation of Equipment. Install the chromatographic column 
and condition overnight at 160 [deg]C (320 [deg]F). In the first 
operation, Porapak columns must be purged for 1 hour at 230 [deg]C (450 
[deg]F).
    Do not connect the exit end of the column to the detector while 
conditioning. Hydrogen and air to the detector must be turned off while 
the column is disconnected.
    11.2 Flow Rate Adjustments. Adjust flow rates as follows:
    11.2.1. Nitrogen Carrier Gas. Set regulator on cylinder to read 50 
psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to produce a flow rate of 30.0 cc/
min. Accurately measure the flow rate at the exit end of the column 
using the soap film flowmeter and a stopwatch, with the oven and column 
at the analysis temperature. After the instrument program advances to 
the ``B'' (backflush) mode, adjust the nitrogen pressure regulator to 
exactly balance the nitrogen flow rate at the detector as was obtained 
in the ``A'' mode.
    11.2.2. Vial Prepressurizer Nitrogen.
    11.2.2.1 After the nitrogen carrier is set, solve the following 
equation and adjust the pressure on the vial prepressurizer accordingly.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.599

Where:

T<INF>1</INF> = Ambient temperature, [deg]K ([deg]R).
T<INF>2</INF> = Conditioning bath temperature, [deg]K ([deg]R).
P<INF>1</INF> = Gas chromatograph absolute dosing pressure (analysis 
mode), k Pa.

[[Page 277]]

P<INF>w1</INF> = Water vapor pressure 525.8 mm Hg @ 90 [deg]C.
P<INF>w2</INF> = Water vapor pressure 19.8 mm Hg @ 22 [deg]C.
7.50 = mm Hg per k Pa.
10 kPa = Factor to adjust the prepressurized pressure to slightly less 
than the dosing pressure.

    11.2.2.2 Because of gauge errors, the apparatus may over-pressurize 
the vial. If the vial pressure is at or higher than the dosing pressure, 
an audible double injection will occur. If the vial pressure is too low, 
errors will occur on resin samples because of inadequate time for head-
space gas equilibrium. This condition can be avoided by running several 
standard gas samples at various pressures around the calculated 
pressure, and then selecting the highest pressure that does not produce 
a double injection. All samples and standards must be pressurized for 60 
seconds using the vial prepressurizer. The vial is then placed into the 
90 [deg]C conditioning bath and tested for leakage by placing a drop of 
water on the septum at the needle hole. A clean, burr-free needle is 
mandatory.
    11.2.3. Burner Air Supply. Set regulator on cylinder to read 50 
psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to supply air to burner at a rate 
between 250 and 300 cc/min. Check with bubble flowmeter.
    11.2.4. Hydrogen Supply. Set regulator on cylinder to read 30 psig. 
Set regulator on chromatograph to supply approximately 35 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 cc/min. Optimize hydrogen flow to yield the most 
sensitive detector response without extinguishing the flame. Check flow 
with bubble meter and record this flow.
    11.3 Temperature Adjustments. Set temperatures as follows:
    11.3.1. Oven (chromatograph column), 140 [deg]C (280 [deg]F).
    11.3.2. Dosing Line, 150 [deg]C (300 [deg]F).
    11.3.3. Injection Block, 170 [deg]C (340 [deg]F).
    11.3.4. Sample Chamber, Water Temperature, 90 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1.0 [deg]C (194 [deg]F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.8 
[deg]F).
    11.4 Ignition of Flame Ionization Detector. Ignite the detector 
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    11.5 Amplifier Balance. Balance the amplifier according to the 
manufacturer's instructions.
    11.6 Programming the Chromatograph. Program the chromatograph as 
follows:
    11.6.1. I--Dosing or Injection Time. The normal setting is 2 
seconds.
    11.6.2. A--Analysis Time. The normal setting is approximately 70 
percent of the VCM retention time. When this timer terminates, the 
programmer initiates backflushing of the first column.
    11.6.3. B--Backflushing Time. The normal setting is double the 
analysis time.
    11.6.4. W--Stabilization Time. The normal setting is 0.5 min to 1.0 
min.
    11.6.5. X--Number of Analyses Per Sample. The normal setting is one.
    11.7. Sample Treatment. All samples must be recovered and analyzed 
within 24 hours after collection.
    11.7.1 Resin Samples. The weight of the resin used must be between 
0.1 and 4.5 grams. An exact weight must be obtained (within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent) for each sample. In the case of suspension 
resins, a volumetric cup can be prepared for holding the required amount 
of sample. When the cup is used, open the sample bottle, and add the cup 
volume of resin to the tared sample vial (tared, including septum and 
aluminum cap). Obtain the exact sample weight, add 100 ml or about two 
equal drops of water, and immediately seal the vial. Report this value 
on the data sheet; it is required for calculation of RVCM. In the case 
of dispersion resins, the cup cannot be used. Weigh the sample in an 
aluminum dish, transfer the sample to the tared vial, and accurately 
weigh it in the vial. After prepressurization of the samples, condition 
them for a minimum of 1 hour in the 90 [deg]C (190 [deg]F) bath. Do not 
exceed 5 hours. Prepressurization is not required if the sample weight, 
as analyzed, does not exceed 0.2 gram. It is also not required if 
solution of the prepressurization equation yields an absolute 
prepressurization value that is within 30 percent of the atmospheric 
pressure.

    Note: Some aluminum vial caps have a center section that must be 
removed prior to placing into sample tray. If the cap is not removed, 
the injection needle will be damaged.

    11.7.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Cake Samples. Decant the 
water from a wet cake sample, and turn the sample bottle upside down 
onto a paper towel. Wait for the water to drain, place approximately 0.2 
to 4.0 grams of the wet cake sample in a tared vial (tared, including 
septum and aluminum cap) and seal immediately. Then determine the sample 
weight (1 percent). All samples weighing over 0.2 gram, must be 
prepressurized prior to conditioning for 1 hour at 90 [deg]C (190 
[deg]F), except as noted in Section 11.7.1. A sample of wet cake is used 
to determine total solids (TS). This is required for calculating the 
RVCM.
    11.7.3 Dispersion Resin Slurry and Geon Latex Samples. The materials 
should not be filtered. Sample must be thoroughly mixed. Using a tared 
vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) add approximately eight 
drops (0.25 to 0.35 g) of slurry or latex using a medicine dropper. This 
should be done immediately after mixing. Seal the vial as soon as 
possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 
hour at 90 [deg]C (190 [deg]F) in the analyzer bath. Determine the TS on 
the slurry sample (Section 11.10).
    11.7.4 In-process Wastewater Samples. Using a tared vial (tared, 
including septum

[[Page 278]]

and aluminum cap) quickly add approximately 1 cc of water using a 
medicine dropper. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample 
weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 [deg]C (190 
[deg]F) in the analyzer bath.
    11.8 Preparation of Sample Turntable.
    11.8.1 Before placing any sample into turntable, be certain that the 
center section of the aluminum cap has been removed. The numbered sample 
vials should be placed in the corresponding numbered positions in the 
turntable. Insert samples in the following order:
    11.8.1.1 Positions 1 and 2. Old 2000-ppm standards for conditioning. 
These are necessary only after the analyzer has not been used for 24 
hours or longer.
    11.8.1.2 Position 3. 50-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
    11.8.1.3 Position 4. 500-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
    11.8.1.4 Position 5. 2000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
    11.8.1.5 Position 6. 4000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
    11.8.1.6 Position 7. Sample No. 7 (This is the first sample of the 
day, but is given as 7 to be consistent with the turntable and the 
integrator printout.)
    11.8.2 After all samples have been positioned, insert the second set 
of 50-, 500-, 2000-, and 4000-ppm standards. Samples, including 
standards, must be conditioned in the bath of 90 [deg]C (190 [deg]F) for 
a minimum of one hour and a maximum of five hours.
    11.9 Start Chromatograph Program. When all samples, including 
standards, have been conditioned at 90 [deg]C (190 [deg]F) for at least 
one hour, start the analysis program according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. These instructions must be carefully followed when 
starting and stopping a program to prevent damage to the dosing 
assembly.
    11.10 Determination of Total Solids. For wet cake, slurry, resin 
solution, and PVC latex samples, determine TS for each sample by 
accurately weighing approximately 3 to 4 grams of sample in an aluminum 
pan before and after placing in a draft oven (105 to 110 [deg]C (221 to 
230 [deg]F)). Samples must be dried to constant weight. After first 
weighing, return the pan to the oven for a short period of time, and 
then reweigh to verify complete dryness. The TS are then calculated as 
the final sample weight divided by initial sample weight.

Method 107A--Determination of Vinyl Chloride Content of Solvents, Resin-
Solvent Solution, Polyvinyl Chloride Resin, Resin Slurry, Wet Resin, and 
                              Latex Samples

Introduction

    Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons 
unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) or by those 
who are unfamiliar with source sampling because knowledge beyond the 
scope of this presentation is required. Care must be exercised to 
prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, a carcinogen.

1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This is an alternative method and applies to the 
measurement of the vinyl chloride content of solvents, resin solvent 
solutions, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, wet cake slurries, latex, and 
fabricated resin samples. This method is not acceptable where methods 
from Section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., (the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 as amended by the 
Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.
    1.2 Principle. The basis for this method lies in the direct 
injection of a liquid sample into a chromatograph and the subsequent 
evaporation of all volatile material into the carrier gas stream of the 
chromatograph, thus permitting analysis of all volatile material 
including vinyl chloride.

2. Range and Sensitivity

    The lower limit of detection of vinyl chloride in dry PVC resin is 
0.2 ppm. For resin solutions, latexes, and wet resin, this limit rises 
inversely as the nonvolatile (resin) content decreases.
    With proper calibration, the upper limit may be extended as needed.

3. Interferences

    The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters 
herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl 
chloride. In cases where resolution interferences are encountered, the 
chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters 
best suited to his

[[Page 280]]

particular analysis problem, subject to the approval of the 
Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that the tester produces 
confirming data through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, 
such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and 
has the data available for review by the Administrator.

4. Precision and Reproducibility

    A standard sample of latex containing 181.8 ppm vinyl chloride 
analyzed 10 times by the alternative method showed a standard deviation 
of 7.5 percent and a mean error of 0.21 percent.
    A sample of vinyl chloride copolymer resin solution was analyzed 10 
times by the alternative method and showed a standard deviation of 6.6 
percent at a level of 35 ppm.

5. Safety

    Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during 
preparation of standards. Venting or purging with vinyl chloride monomer 
(VCM) air mixtures must be held to minimum. When purging is required, 
the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low-ppm 
levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory.

analysis of vinyl chloride standards are not impaired and that he has 
available for review information confirming that there is adequate 
resolution of the vinyl chloride peak. (Adequate resolution is defined 
as an area overlap of not more than 10 percent of the vinyl chloride 
peak by an interfering peak. Calculation of area overlap is explained in

107A-1. If the chromatogram is comparable to A, the THF should be 
sparged with pure nitrogen for approximately 2 hours using the fritted 
glass sparger to attempt to remove the interfering peak. Reanalyze the 
sparged THF to determine whether the THF is acceptable for use. If the 
scan is comparable to B, the THF should be acceptable for use in the 
analysis.

in place of THF.
    7.2 Calibration. The following item is required:
    7.2.1 Vinyl Chloride 99.9 Percent. Ideal Gas Products lecture 
bottle, or equivalent. For preparation of standard solutions.

8. Procedure

    8.1 Sampling. Allow the liquid or dried resin to flow from a tap on 
the tank, silo, or pipeline until the tap has been purged. Fill a wide-
mouth pint bottle, and immediately tightly cap the bottle. Place an 
identifying label on each bottle and record the date, time, sample 
location, and material.
    8.2 Sample Treatment. Sample must be run within 24 hours.
    8.2.1 Resin Samples. Weigh 9.00 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01 g of THF 
or DMAC in a tared 20-ml vial. Add 1.00 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01 g of 
resin to the tared vial containing the THF or DMAC. Close the vial 
tightly with the screw cap, and shake or otherwise agitate the vial 
until complete solution of the resin is obtained. Shaking may require 
several minutes to several hours, depending on the nature of the resin.
    8.2.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Resin Sample. Slurry must be 
filtered using a small Buchner funnel with vacuum to yield a wet resin 
sample. The filtering process must be continued only as long as a steady 
stream of water is exiting from the funnel. Excessive filtration time 
could result in some loss of VCM. The wet resin sample is weighed into a 
tared 20-ml vial with THF or DMAC as described earlier for resin samples 
(8.2.1) and treated the same as the resin sample. A sample of the wet 
resin is used to determine total solids as required for calculating the 
residual VCM (Section 8.3.4).
    8.2.3 Latex and Resin Solvent Solutions. Samples must be thoroughly 
mixed. Weigh 1.00 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01 g of the latex or resin-
solvent solution into a 20-ml vial containing 9.00 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.01 g of THF or DMAC as for the resin samples (8.2.1). 
Cap and shake until complete solution is obtained. Determine the total 
solids of the latex or resin solution sample (Section 8.3.4).
    8.2.4 Solvents and Non-viscous Liquid Samples. No preparation of 
these samples is required. The neat samples are injected directly into 
the GC.
    8.3 Analysis.
    8.3.1 Preparation of GC. Install the chromatographic column, and 
condition overnight at 70 [deg]C. Do not connect the exit end of the 
column to the detector while conditioning.
    8.3.1.1 Flow Rate Adjustments. Adjust the flow rate as follows:
    a. Nitrogen Carrier Gas. Set regulator on cylinder to read 60 psig. 
Set column flow controller on the chromatograph using the soap film 
flowmeter to yield a flow rate of 40 cc/min.
    b. Burner Air Supply. Set regulator on the cylinder at 40 psig. Set 
regulator on the chromatograph to supply air to the burner to yield a 
flow rate of 250 to 300 cc/min using the flowmeter.
    c. Hydrogen. Set regulator on cylinder to read 60 psig. Set 
regulator on the chromatograph to supply 30 to 40 cc/min using the 
flowmeter. Optimize hydrogen flow to yield the most sensitive detector 
response without extinguishing the flame. Check flow with flowmeter and 
record this flow.

[[Page 282]]

    d. Nitrogen Back Flush Gas. Set regulator on the chromatograph using 
the soap film flowmeter to yield a flow rate of 40 cc/min.
    8.3.1.2 Temperature Adjustments. Set temperature as follows:
    a. Oven (chromatographic column) at 70 [deg]C.
    b. Injection Port at 100 [deg]C.
    c. Detector at 300 [deg]C.
    8.3.1.3 Ignition of Flame Ionization Detector. Ignite the detector 
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allow system to stabilize 
approximately 1 hour.
    8.3.1.4 Recorder. Set pen at zero and start chart drive.
    8.3.1.5 Attenuation. Set attenuation to yield desired peak height 
depending on sample VCM content.
    8.3.2 Chromatographic Analyses.
    a. Sample Injection. Remove needle from 50-microliter syringe. Open 
sample vial and draw 50-microliters of THF or DMAC sample recovery 
solution into the syringe. Recap sample vial. Attach needle to the 
syringe and while holding the syringe vertically (needle uppermost), 
eject 40 microliters into an absorbent tissue. Wipe needle with tissue. 
Now inject 10 microliters into chromatograph system. Repeat the 
injection until two consecutive values for the height of the vinyl 
chloride peak do not vary more than 5 percent. Use the average value for 
these two peak heights to compute the sample concentration.
    b. Back Flush. After 4 minutes has elapsed after sample injection, 
actuate the back flush valve to purge the first 4 feet of the 
chromatographic column of solvent and other high boilers.
    c. Sample Data. Record on the chromatograph strip chart the data 
from the sample label.
    d. Elution Time. Vinyl chloride elutes at 2.8 minutes. Acetaldehyde 
elutes at 3.7 minutes. Analysis is considered complete when chart pen 
becomes stable. After 5 minutes, reset back flush valve and inject next 
sample.
    8.3.3 Chromatograph Servicing.
    a. Septum. Replace after five sample injections.
    b. Sample Port Liner. Replace the sample port liner with a clean 
spare after five sample injections.
    c. Chromatograph Shutdown. If the chromatograph has been shut down 
overnight, rerun one or more samples from the preceding day to test 
stability and precision prior to starting on the current day's work.
    8.3.4 Determination of Total Solids (TS). For wet resin, resin 
solution, and PVC latex samples, determine the TS for each sample by 
accurately weighing approximately 3 to 5 grams of sample into a tared 
aluminum pan. The initial procedure is as follows:
    a. Where water is the major volatile component: Tare the weighing 
dish, and add 3 to 5 grams of sample to the dish. Weigh to the nearest 
milligram.
    b. Where volatile solvent is the major volatile component: Transfer 
a portion of the sample to a 20-ml screw cap vial and cap immediately. 
Weigh the vial to the nearest milligram. Uncap the vial and transfer a 
3- to 5-gram portion of the sample to a tared aluminum weighing dish. 
Recap the vial and reweigh to the nearest milligram. The vial weight 
loss is the sample weight.
    To continue, place the weighing pan in a 130 [deg]C oven for 1 hour. 
Remove the dish and allow to cool to room temperature in a desiccator. 
Weigh the pan to the nearest 0.1 mg. Total solids is the weight of 
material in the aluminum pan after heating divided by the net weight of 
sample added to the pan originally times 100.

9. Calibration of the Chromatograph

    9.1 Preparation of Standards. Prepare a 1 percent by weight 
(approximate) solution of vinyl chloride in THF or DMAC by bubbling 
vinyl chloride gas from a cylinder into a tared 125-ml glass-stoppered 
flask containing THF or DMAC. The weight of vinyl chloride to be added 
should be calculated prior to this operation, i.e., 1 percent of the 
weight of THF or DMAC contained in the tared flask. This must be carried 
out in a laboratory hood. Adjust the vinyl chloride flow from the 
cylinder so that the vinyl chloride dissolves essentially completely in 
the THF or DMAC and is not blown to the atmosphere. Take particular care 
not to volatize any of the solution. Stopper the flask and swirl the 
solution to effect complete mixing. Weigh the stoppered flask to nearest 
0.1 mg to determine the exact amount of vinyl chloride added.
    Pipet 10 ml of the approximately 1 percent solution into a 100-ml 
glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and add THF or DMAC to fill to the 
mark. Cap the flask and invert 10 to 20 times. This solution contains 
approximately 1,000 ppm by weight of vinyl chloride (note the exact 
concentration).
    Pipet 50-, 10-, 5-, 1-, 0.5-, and 0.1-ml aliquots of the 
approximately 1,000 ppm solution into 10 ml glass stoppered volumetric 
flasks. Dilute to the mark with THF or DMAC, cap the flasks and invert 
each 10 to 20 times. These solutions contain approximately 500, 100, 50, 
10, 5, and 1 ppm vinyl chloride. Note the exact concentration of each 
one. These standards are to be kept under refrigeration in stoppered 
bottles, and must be renewed every 3 months.
    9.2 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve.
    Obtain the GC for each of the six final solutions prepared in 
Section 9.1 by using the procedure in Section 8.3.2. Prepare a chart 
plotting peak height obtained from the chromatogram of each solution 
versus the known concentration. Draw a straight line through

[[Page 283]]

the points derived by the least squares method.

10. Calculations

    10.1 Response Factor. From the calibration curve described in 
Section 9.2, select the value of C<INF>c</INF> that corresponds to 
H<INF>c</INF> for each sample. Compute the response factor, 
R<INF>f</INF>, for each sample as follows:

       8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage

    8.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure given in 
Method 5, Section 8.1, except the filter need not be weighed, and the 
200 ml of 0.1N NaOH and Container 4 should be tared to within 0.5 g.
    8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Follow the general procedure given 
in Method 5, Section 8.2, except select the nozzle size to maintain 
isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).
    8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Follow the general procedure 
given in Method 5, Section 8.3.
    8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Same as Method 5, Section 8.4.
    8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure given in 
Method 5, Section 8.5, except maintain isokinetic sampling flow rates 
below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm). For each run, record the data required on 
a data sheet similar to the one shown in Figure 108-2.
    8.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Section 
8.6.
    8.7 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7, except that 0.1 
N NaOH is used as the cleanup solvent instead of acetone and that the 
impinger water is treated as follows:
    8.7.1 Container Number 4 (Impinger Water). Clean each of the first 
three impingers and connecting glassware in the following manner:
    8.7.1.1 Wipe the impinger ball joints free of silicone grease, and 
cap the joints.
    8.7.1.2 Rotate and agitate each of the first two impingers, using 
the impinger contents as a rinse solution.
    8.7.1.3 Transfer the liquid from the first three impingers to 
Container Number 4. Remove the outlet ball-joint cap, and drain the 
contents through this opening. Do not separate the impinger parts (inner 
and outer tubes) while transferring their contents to the container.
    8.7.1.4 Weigh the contents of Container No. 4 to within 0.5 g. 
Record in the log the weight of liquid along with a notation of any 
color or film observed in the impinger catch. The weight of liquid is 
needed along with the silica gel data to calculate the stack gas 
moisture content.
    Note: Measure and record the total amount of 0.1 N NaOH used for 
rinsing under Sections 8.7.1.5 and 8.7.1.6.
    8.7.1.5 Pour approximately 30 ml of 0.1 NaOH into each of the first 
two impingers, and agitate the impingers. Drain the 0.1 N NaOH through 
the outlet arm of each impinger into Container Number 4. Repeat this 
operation a second time; inspect the impingers for any abnormal 
conditions.
    8.7.1.6 Wipe the ball joints of the glassware connecting the 
impingers and the back half of the filter holder free of silicone 
grease, and rinse each piece of glassware twice with 0.1 N NaOH; 
transfer this rinse into Container Number 4. (DO NOT RINSE or brush the 
glass-fritted filter support.) Mark the height of the fluid level to 
determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container 
to identify clearly its contents.
    8.8 Blanks.
    8.8.1 Sodium Hydroxide. Save a portion of the 0.1 N NaOH used for 
cleanup as a blank. Take 200 ml of this solution directly from the wash 
bottle being used and place it in a plastic sample container labeled 
``NaOH blank.''
    8.8.2 Water. Save a sample of the water, and place it in a container 
labeled ``H<INF>2</INF>O blank.''

[[Page 286]]

    8.8.3 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in 
sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled ``filter blank.''

    9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
    10.1 Sampling Equipment. Same as Method 5, Section 10.0.
    10.2 Preparation of Standard Solutions.
    10.2.1 For the high level procedure, pipet 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ml of 
the 1.0 mg As/ml stock solution into separate 100 ml volumetric flasks, 
each containing 5 ml of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>. Dilute to the mark 
with water.
    10.2.2 For the low level vapor generator procedure, pipet 1, 2, 3, 
and 5 ml of 1.0 [micro]g As/ml standard solution into separate reaction 
tubes. Dilute to the mark with water.
    10.2.3 For the low level graphite furnace procedure, pipet 1, 5, 10 
and 15 ml of 1.0 [micro]g As/ml standard solution into separate flasks 
along with 2 ml of the 5 percent nickel nitrate solution and 10 ml of 
the 3 percent H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF> solution. Dilute to the mark 
with water.
    10.3 Calibration Curve. Analyze a 0.8 N HNO<INF>3</INF> blank and 
each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in section 
11.4.1. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two 
consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. 
Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank--which must 
be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale--from the averaged peak 
height of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater 
than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is As contamination of 
a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the 
calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard 
solution versus the corresponding final total As weight in the solution.
    10.4 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the 
least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through 
the origin or through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the 
corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to 
determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical 
calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration 
values and the actual concentrations (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 mg As for 
the high-level procedure) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.
    Note: For instruments equipped with direct concentration readout 
devices, preparation of a standard curve will not be necessary. In all 
cases, follow calibration and operational procedures in the 
manufacturers' instruction manual.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in 
Containers Number 2 and Number 4. Note on the analytical data sheet 
whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of 
leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the 
approval of the Administrator, to adjust the final results.
    11.2 Sample Preparation.
    11.2.1 Container Number 1 (Filter). Place the filter and loose 
particulate matter in a 150 ml beaker. Also, add the filtered solid 
material from Container Number 2 (see Section 11.2.2). Add 50 ml of 0.1 
N NaOH. Then stir and warm on a hot plate at low heat (do not boil) for 
about 15 minutes. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>, bring to a 
boil, then simmer for about 15 minutes. Filter the solution through a 
glass fiber filter. Wash with hot water, and catch the filtrate in a 
clean 150 ml beaker. Boil the filtrate, and evaporate to dryness. Cool, 
add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>, and then warm and stir. Allow to 
cool. Transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, 
and mix well.
    11.2.2 Container Number 2 (Probe Wash).
    11.2.2.1 Filter (using a glass fiber filter) the contents of 
Container Number 2 into a 200 ml volumetric flask. Combine the filtered 
(solid) material with the contents of Container Number 1 (Filter).
    11.2.2.2 Dilute the filtrate to exactly 200 ml with water. Then 
pipet 50 ml into a 150 ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to 
cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>, and then warm and stir. 
Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute 
to volume with water, and mix well.

[[Page 287]]

    11.2.3 Container Number 4 (Impinger Solution). Transfer the contents 
of Container Number 4 to a 500 ml volumetric flask, and dilute to 
exactly 500-ml with water. Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml 
beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF>, bring to a boil, and 
evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, 
transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and 
mix well.
    11.2.4 Filter Blank. Cut each filter into strips, and treat each 
filter individually as directed in Section 11.2.1, beginning with the 
sentence, ``Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH.''
    11.2.5 Sodium Hydroxide and Water Blanks. Treat separately 50 ml of 
0.1 N NaOH and 50 ml water, as directed under Section 11.2.3, beginning 
with the sentence, ``Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker.''
    11.3 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the 
wavelength, slit width, and lamp current. Adjust the background 
corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular 
atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame 
characteristics as necessary.
    11.4 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a 
calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 through 10.4.
    11.4.1 Arsenic Samples. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of 
each diluted sample (from Sections 11.2.1 through 11.2.3) until two 
consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. 
If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.4.1.1. If 
the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration 
curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.8 N HNO<INF>3</INF> so that 
the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the 
calibration curve, determine the arsenic concentration in each sample 
fraction.

    Note: Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed 
operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument 
manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.

    11.4.1.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit 
of flame AAS is 10 [micro]g As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any 
sample is at a lower level, use the graphite furnace or vapor generator 
which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, 
or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are 
between 10 and 30 [micro]g/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in 
the use of such equipment.
    11.4.1.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing 
between 0 and 5 [micro]g of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 
15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this 
procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional 
atomic absorption until an approximate concentration is determined. 
After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of 
the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. 
Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 
[deg]C (120 [deg]F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. 
Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the 
instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent 
NaBH<INF>4</INF>, and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal 
over a 30-second time period.
    11.4.1.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Dilute the digested sample so 
that a 5 ml aliquot contains less than 1.5 [micro]g of arsenic. Pipet 5 
ml of this digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of 
the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, and 1 ml of the 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and dilute 
to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready for analysis.
    11.4.1.2 Run a blank (0.8 N HNO<INF>3</INF>) and standard at least 
after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The 
peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the 
origin than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. 
The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the 
product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the 
least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must 
be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
    11.4.1.3 Determine the arsenic concentration in the filter blank 
(i.e., the average of the two blank values from each lot).
    11.4.2 Container Number 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted 
in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) 
to the nearest 0.5 g; record this weight.
    11.5 Check for matrix effects on the arsenic results. Same as Method 
12, Section 11.5.
    11.6 Audit Sample Analysis.
    11.6.1 When the method is used to analyze samples to demonstrate 
compliance with a source emission regulation, a set of EPA audit samples 
must be analyzed, subject to availability.
    11.6.2 Concurrently analyze the audit samples and the compliance 
samples in the same manner to evaluate the technique of the analyst and 
the standards preparation.
    Note: It is recommended that known quality control samples be 
analyzed prior to the compliance and audit sample analyses to optimize 
the system accuracy and precision. These quality control samples may be 
obtained by contacting the appropriate EPA regional Office or the 
responsible enforcement authority.

    11.6.3 The same analyst, analytical reagents, and analytical system 
shall be used

[[Page 288]]

for the compliance samples and the EPA audit samples. If this condition 
is met, duplicate auditing of subsequent compliance analyses for the 
same enforcement agency within a 30-day period is waived. An audit 
sample set may not be used to validate different sets of compliance 
samples under the jurisdiction of separate enforcement agencies, unless 
prior arrangements have been made with both enforcement agencies.
    11.7 Audit Sample Results.
    11.7.1 Calculate the audit sample concentrations in g/m<INF>3</INF> 
and submit results using the instructions provided with the audit 
samples.
    11.7.2 Report the results of the audit samples and the compliance 
determination samples along with their identification numbers, and the 
analyst's name to the responsible enforcement authority. Include this 
information with reports of any subsequent compliance analyses for the 
same enforcement authority during the 30-day period.
    11.7.3 The concentrations of the audit samples obtained by the 
analyst shall agree within 10 percent of the actual concentrations. If 
the 10 percent specification is not met, reanalyze the compliance and 
audit samples, and include initial and reanalysis values in the test 
report.
    11.7.4 Failure to meet the 10 percent specification may require 
retests until the audit problems are resolved. However, if the audit 
results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the 
affected facility, the Administrator may waive the reanalysis 
requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the 
compliance test. While steps are being taken to resolve audit analysis 
problems, the Administrator may also choose to use the data to determine 
the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardizations

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
    10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 5, 10, and 25 ml of 
the stock As solution into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Add 10 ml 
KCl solution and dilute to the mark with 0.5 N HNO<INF>3</INF>. This 
will give standard concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 [micro]g As/
ml. For low-level arsenic samples that require the use of a graphite 
furnace or vapor generator, follow the procedures in Section 11.3:1. 
Dilute 10 ml of KCl solution to 100 ml with 0.5 N HNO<INF>3</INF> and 
use as a reagent blank.
    10.2 Calibration Curve. Analyze the reagent blank and each standard 
solution according to the procedures outlined in Section 11.3. Repeat 
this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks 
agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak 
height (or peak area) of the blank--which must be less than 2 percent of 
recorder full scale--from the averaged peak heights of each standard 
solution.

[[Page 294]]

If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the 
probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from 
a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the 
corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding 
final total As weight in the solution.
    10.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the 
least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through 
the origin or through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the 
corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to 
determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical 
calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration 
values and the actual concentrations must be less than 7 percent for all 
standards.
    Note: For instruments equipped with direct concentration readout 
devices, preparation of a standard curve will not be necessary. In all 
cases, follow calibration and operational procedures in the 
manufacturer's instruction manual.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Preparation. Weigh 50 to 500 mg of finely pulverized 
sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample into the Teflon cup of 
the digestion bomb, and add 2 ml each of concentrated HNO<INF>3</INF> 
and HF. Seal the bomb immediately to prevent the loss of any volatile 
arsenic compounds that may form. Heat in an oven at 105 [deg]C (221 
[deg]F) for 2 hours. Remove the bomb from the oven and allow to cool. 
Using a Teflon filter, quantitatively filter the digested sample into a 
50-ml polypropylene volumetric flask. Rinse the bomb three times with 
small portions of 0.5 N HNO<INF>3</INF>, and filter the rinses into the 
flask. Add 5 ml of KCl solution to the flask, and dilute to 50 ml with 
0.5 N HNO<INF>3</INF>.
    11.2 Spectrophotometer Preparation.
    11.2.1 Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp 
current. Adjust the background corrector as instructed by the 
manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as 
necessary.
    11.2.2 Develop a spectrophotometer calibration curve as outlined in 
Sections 10.2 and 10.3.
    11.3 Arsenic Determination. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot 
of each diluted sample (from Section 11.1) until two consecutive peak 
heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, 
follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.3.1. If the sample 
concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an 
appropriate dilution with 0.5 N HNO<INF>3</INF> so that the final 
concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration 
curve, determine the As concentration in each sample.
    Note: Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed 
operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument 
manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
    11.3.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit 
of flame AAS is 10 [micro]g As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any 
sample is at a lower level, use the vapor generator or graphite furnace 
which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, 
or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are 
between 10 and 30 [micro]g/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in 
the use of such equipment.
    11.3.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing 
between 0 and 5 [micro]g of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 
15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this 
procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional AAS 
until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the 
approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. 
Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent 
KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 [deg]C (120 [deg]F) water 
bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube 
to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has 
returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH<INF>4</INF> and 
integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time 
period.
    11.3.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Pipet 5 ml of the digested 
solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel 
nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO<INF>3</INF>, and 1 ml of the 
3 percent H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>2</INF>, and dilute to 10 ml with water. 
The sample is now ready to inject in the furnace for analysis.
    11.4 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to 
check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank 
must pass through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference 
between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the 
corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares 
slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 
percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
    11.5 Mandatory Check for Matrix Effects on the Arsenic Results. Same 
as Method 12, Section 11.5.
    11.6 Audit Sample Analysis.
    11.6.1 When the method is used to analyze samples to demonstrate 
compliance with a source emission regulation, a set of EPA

[[Page 295]]

audit samples must be analyzed, subject to availability.
    11.6.2 Concurrently analyze the audit samples and the compliance 
samples in the same manner to evaluate the technique of the analyst and 
the standards preparation.

    Note: It is recommended that known quality control samples be 
analyzed prior to the compliance and audit sample analyses to optimize 
the system accuracy and precision. These quality control samples may be 
obtained by contacting the appropriate EPA regional Office or the 
responsible enforcement authority.

    11.6.3 The same analyst, analytical reagents, and analytical system 
shall be used for the compliance samples and the EPA audit samples. If 
this condition is met, duplicate auditing of subsequent compliance 
analyses for the same enforcement agency within a 30-day period is 
waived. An audit sample set may not be used to validate different sets 
of compliance samples under the jurisdiction of separate enforcement 
agencies, unless prior arrangements have been made with both enforcement 
agencies.
    11.7 Audit Sample Results.
    11.7.1 Calculate the audit sample concentrations in g/m\3\ and 
submit results using the instructions provided with the audit samples.
    11.7.2 Report the results of the audit samples and the compliance 
determination samples along with their identification numbers, and the 
analyst's name to the responsible enforcement authority. Include this 
information with reports of any subsequent compliance analyses for the 
same enforcement authority during the 30-day period.
    11.7.3 The concentrations of the audit samples obtained by the 
analyst shall agree within 10 percent of the actual concentrations. If 
the 10 percent specification is not met, reanalyze the compliance and 
audit samples, and include initial and reanalysis values in the test 
report.
    11.7.4 Failure to meet the 10 percent specification may require 
retests until the audit problems are resolved. However, if the audit 
results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the 
affected facility, the Administrator may waive the reanalysis 
requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the 
compliance test. While steps are being taken to resolve audit analysis 
problems, the Administrator may also choose to use the data to determine 
the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility.

                   12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations

    12.1 Calculate the percent arsenic in the ore sample as follows:

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
    10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 5, 10, and 25 ml of 
the stock As solution into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Add 2 ml 
of HClO<INF>4</INF>, 10 ml of HCl, and dilute to the mark with water. 
This will provide standard concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 
[micro]g As/ml.
    10.2 Calibration Curve and Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality 
Control. Same as Method 108A, Sections 10.2 and 10.3

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Preparation. Weigh 100 to 1000 mg of finely pulverized 
sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample to a 150-ml Teflon 
beaker. Dissolve the sample by adding 15 ml of HNO<INF>3</INF>, 10 ml of 
HCl, 10 ml of HF, and 10 ml of HClO<INF>4</INF> in the exact order as 
described, and let stand for 10 minutes. In a HClO<INF>4</INF> fume 
hood, heat on a hot plate until 2-3 ml of HClO<INF>4</INF> remain, then 
cool. Add 20 ml of water and 10 ml of HCl. Cover and warm until the 
soluble salts are in solution. Cool, and transfer quantitatively to a 
100-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to the mark with water.
    11.2 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Same as in Method 108A, Section 
11.2.
    11.3 Arsenic Determination. If the sample concentration falls 
outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution 
with 2 percent HClO<INF>4</INF>/10 percent HCl (prepared by diluting 2 
ml concentrated HClO<INF>4</INF> and 10 ml concentrated HCl to 100 ml 
with water) so that the final concentration falls within the range of 
the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the As concentration 
in each sample.
    Note: Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed 
operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument 
manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
    Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check 
the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must 
pass through a point no further from the origin than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference 
between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the 
corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares 
slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 
percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
    11.4 Mandatory Check for Matrix Effects on the Arsenic Results. Same 
as Method 12, Section 11.5.
    11.5 Audit Sample Analysis. Same as in Method 108A, Section 11.6.

corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to 
determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical 
calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration 
values and the actual concentrations must be less than 7 percent for all 
standards.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    11.1 Sample Preparation.
    11.1.1 Weigh 1.0 g of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 
mg. Transfer the sample to a 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask and add 15 ml of 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, 4 ml HCl, 2 ml HF, 3 ml HClO<INF>4</INF>, and 15 ml 
H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>, in the order listed. In a HClO<INF>4</INF> 
fume hood, heat on a hot plate to decompose the sample. Then heat while 
swirling over an open flame until dense white fumes evolve. Cool, add 15 
ml of water, swirl to hydrate the H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> 
completely, and add several boiling granules. Cool to room temperature.
    11.1.2 Add 1 g of KBr, 1 g hydrazine sulfate, and 50 ml HCl. 
Immediately attach the distillation head with thermometer and dip the 
side arm into a 50-ml graduated cylinder containing 25 ml of water and 2 
ml of bromine water. Keep the graduated cylinder immersed in a beaker of 
cold water during distillation. Distill until the temperature of the 
vapor in the flask reaches 107 [deg]C (225 [deg]F). When distillation is 
complete, remove the flask from the hot plate, and simultaneously wash 
down the side arm with water as it is removed from the cylinder.
    11.1.3 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0020 to 
0.10 percent, dilute the distillate to the 50-ml mark of the cylinder 
with water, stopper, and mix. Transfer a 5.0-ml aliquot to a 50-ml 
volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of water and a boiling granule. Place the 
flask on a hot plate, and heat gently until the bromine is expelled and 
the color of methyl orange indicator persists upon the addition of 1 to 
2 drops. Cool the flask to room temperature. Neutralize just to the 
yellow color of the indicator with dropwise additions of 
NH<INF>4</INF>OH. Bring back to the red color by dropwise addition of 
dilute HCl, and add 10 ml excess. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color 
development as described in Section 11.2.
    11.1.4 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0002 to 
0.0010 percent As, transfer either the entire initial distillate or the 
measured remaining distillate from Section 11.1.2 to a 250-ml beaker. 
Wash the cylinder with two successive portions of concentrated 
HNO<INF>3</INF>, adding each portion to the distillate in the beaker. 
Add 4 ml of concentrated HClO<INF>4</INF>, a boiling granule, and cover 
with a flat watch glass placed slightly to one side. Boil gently on a 
hot plate until the volume is reduced to approximately 10 ml. Add 3 ml 
of HNO<INF>3</INF>, and continue the evaporation until HClO<INF>4</INF> 
is refluxing on the beaker cover. Cool briefly, rinse the underside of 
the watch glass and the inside of the beaker with about 3-5 ml of water, 
cover, and continue the evaporation to expel all but 2 ml of the 
HClO<INF>4</INF>.
    Note: If the solution appears cloudy due to a small amount of 
antimony distilling over, add 4 ml of 50 percent HCl and 5 ml of water, 
cover, and warm gently until clear. If cloudiness persists, add 5 ml of 
HNO<INF>3</INF> and 2 ml H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>. Continue the 
evaporation of volatile acids to solubilize the antimony until dense 
white fumes of H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> appear. Retain at least 1 ml 
of the H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>.
    11.1.5 To the 2 ml of HClO<INF>4</INF> solution or 1 ml of 
H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> solution, add 15 ml of water, boil gently 
for 2 minutes, and then cool. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color 
development by neutralizing the solution directly in the beaker just to 
the yellow indicator color by dropwise addition of NH<INF>4</INF>OH. 
Obtain the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl. Transfer the 
solution to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker successively with 
10 ml of dilute HCl, followed by several small portions of water. At 
this point the volume of solution in the flask should be no more than 40 
ml. Continue with the color development as described in Section 11.2.
    11.2 Analysis.
    11.2.1 Add 1 ml of KBrO<INF>3</INF> solution to the flask and heat 
on a low-temperature hot plate to about 50 [deg]C (122 [deg]F) to 
oxidize the arsenic and methyl orange. Add 5.0 ml of ammonium molybdate 
solution to the warm solution and mix. Add 2.0 ml of hydrazine sulfate 
solution, dilute until the solution comes within the neck of the flask, 
and mix. Place the flask in a 400 ml beaker, 80 percent full of boiling 
water, for 10 minutes. Enough heat must be supplied to prevent the water 
bath from cooling much below the boiling point upon inserting the 
volumetric flask. Remove the flask, cool to room temperature, dilute to 
the mark, and mix.

equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) 
essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference 
from methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. Therefore, to obtain 
reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough 
knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 1, 
Method 2, Method 3, and Method 5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of the polonium-210 content of particulate matter samples collected from 
stationary source exhaust stacks, and for the use of these data to 
calculate polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from all 
affected sources at a facility.
    1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this 
method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant 
sampling methods.

                          2.0 Summary of Method

    A particulate matter sample, collected according to Method 5, is 
analyzed for polonium-210 content: the polonium-210 in the sample is put 
in solution, deposited on a metal disc, and the radioactive 
disintegration rate measured. Polonium in acid solution spontaneously 
deposits on surfaces of metals that are more electropositive than 
polonium. This principle is routinely used in the radiochemical analysis 
of polonium-210. Data reduction procedures are provided, allowing the 
calculation of polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from 
all

                  10.0 Calibration and Standardization

    10.1 Standardization of Alpha Spectrometry System.
    10.1.1 Add a quantity of the actinide standard solution to a 100 ml 
volumetric flask so that the final concentration when diluted to a 
volume of 100 ml will be approximately 1 <INF>p</INF>Ci/ml.
    10.1.2 Add 10 ml of 16 M HNO<INF>3</INF> and dilute to 100 ml with 
water.
    10.1.3 Add 20 ml of 1 M HCl to each of six 150 ml beakers. Add 1.0 
ml of lanthanum carrier, 0.1 mg lanthanum per ml, to the acid solution 
in each beaker.
    10.1.4 Add 1.0 ml of the 1 pCi/ml working solution (from Section 
10.1.1) to each beaker. Add 5.0 ml of 3 M HF to each beaker.
    10.1.5 Cover beakers and allow solutions to stand for a minimum of 
30 minutes. Filter the contents of each beaker through a separate filter 
membrane using the suction filter apparatus. After each filtration, wash 
the filter membrane with 10 ml of distilled water and 5 ml of ethanol, 
and allow the filter membrane to air dry on the filter apparatus.
    10.1.6 Carefully remove the filter membrane and mount it, filtration 
side up, with double-side tape on the inner surface of a planchet. Place 
planchet in an alpha spectrometry system and count each planchet for 
1000 minutes.
    10.1.7 Calculate the counting efficiency of the detector for each 
aliquot of the 1 pCi/ml actinide working solution using Eq. 111-1 in 
Section 12.2.
    10.1.8 Determine the average counting efficiency of the detector, 
E<INF>c</INF>, by calculating the average of the six determinations.
    10.2 Preparation of Standardized Solution of Polonium-209.
    10.2.1 Add a quantity of the Po-209 solution to a 100 ml volumetric 
flask so that the final concentration when diluted to a 100 ml volume 
will be approximately 1 pCi/ml.
    10.2.2 Follow the procedures outlined in Sections 10.1.2 through 
10.1.6, except substitute 1.0 ml of polonium-209 tracer solution 
(Section 10.2.1) and 3.0 ml of 15 M ammonium hydroxide for the 1 pCi/ml 
actinide working solution and the 3 M HF, respectively.
    10.2.3 Calculate the activity of each aliquot of the polonium-209 
tracer solution using Eq. 111-2 in Section 12.3.
    10.2.4 Determine the average activity of the polonium-209 tracer 
solution, F, by averaging the results of the six determinations.
    10.3 Standardization of Internal Proportional Counter
    10.3.1 Add a quantity of the actinide standard solution to a 100 ml 
volumetric flask so that the final concentration when diluted to a 100 
ml volume will be approximately 100 pCi/ml.
    10.3.2 Follow the procedures outlined in Sections 10.1.2 through 
10.1.6, except substitute the 100 pCi/ml actinide working solution for 
the 1 pCi/ml solution, place the planchet in an internal proportional 
counter (instead of an alpha spectrometry system), and count for 100 
minutes (instead of 1000 minutes).
    10.3.3 Calculate the counting efficiency of the internal 
proportional counter for each aliquot of the 100 pCi/ml actinide working 
solution using Eq. 111-3 in 12.4.

proportional counter, E<INF>I</INF>, by averaging the results of the six 
determinations.

                        11.0 Analytical Procedure

    Note: Perform duplicate analyses of all samples, including 
background counts, quality assurance audit samples, and Method 5 
samples. Duplicate measurements are considered acceptable when the 
difference between them is less than two standard deviations as 
described in EPA 600/4-77-001 or subsequent revisions.
    11.1 Determination of Procedure Background. Background counts used 
in all equations are determined by performing the specific analysis 
required using the analytical reagents only. All procedure background 
counts and sample counts for the internal

[[Page 304]]

proportional counter should utilize a counting time of 100 minutes; for 
the alpha spectrometry system, 1000 minutes. These background counts 
should be performed no less frequently than once per 10 sample analyses.
    11.2 Determination of Instrument Background. Instrument backgrounds 
of the internal proportional counter and the alpha spectrometry system 
should be determined on a weekly basis. Instrument background should not 
exceed procedure background. If this occurs, it may be due to a 
malfunction or contamination, and should be corrected before use.
    11.3 Quality Assurance Audit Samples. An externally prepared 
performance evaluation sample shall be analyzed no less frequently than 
once per 10 sample analyses, and the results reported with the test 
results.
    11.4 Sample Preparation. Treat the Method 5 samples [i.e., the glass 
fiber filter (Container No. 1) and the acetone rinse (Container No. 2)] 
as follows:
    11.4.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose 
particulate matter from the sample container to a 150-ml Teflon beaker.
    11.4.2 Container No. 2. Note the level of liquid in the container, 
and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during 
transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void 
the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, 
to correct the final results. Transfer the contents to a 400-ml glass 
beaker. Add polonium-209 tracer solution to the glass beaker in an 
amount approximately equal to the amount of polonium-210 expected in the 
total particulate sample. Record the activity of the tracer solution 
added. Add 16 M nitric acid to the beaker to digest and loosen the 
residue.
    11.4.3 Transfer the contents of the glass beaker to the Teflon 
beaker containing the glass fiber filter. Rinse the glass beaker with 16 
M HNO<INF>3</INF>. If necessary, reduce the volume in the beaker by 
evaporation until all of the nitric acid HNO<INF>3</INF> from the glass 
beaker has been transferred to the Teflon beaker.
    11.4.4 Add 30 ml of 29 M HF to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to 
near dryness on a hot plate in a properly operating hood.

    Note: Do not allow the residue to go to dryness and overheat; this 
will result in loss of polonium.

    11.4.5 Repeat step 11.4.4 until the filter is dissolved.
    11.4.6 Add 100 ml of 16 M HNO<INF>3</INF> to the residue in the 
Teflon beaker and evaporate to near dryness.

    Note: Do not allow the residue to go to dryness.

    11.4.7 Add 50 ml of 16 M HNO<INF>3</INF> and 10 ml of 12 M 
perchloric acid to the Teflon beaker and heat until dense fumes of 
perchloric acid are evolved.
    11.4.8 Repeat steps 11.4.4 to 11.4.7 as necessary until sample is 
completely dissolved.
    11.4.9 Add 10 ml of 12 M HCl to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to 
dryness. Repeat additions and evaporations several times.
    11.4.10 Transfer the sample to a 250-ml volumetric flask and dilute 
to volume with 3 M HCl.
    11.5 Sample Screening. To avoid contamination of the alpha 
spectrometry system, check each sample as follows:
    11.5.1 Add 20 ml of 1 M HCl, 1 ml of the lanthanum carrier solution 
(0.1 mg La/ml), a 1 ml aliquot of the sample solution from Section 
11.4.10, and 3 ml of 15 M ammonium hydroxide to a 250-ml beaker in the 
order listed. Allow this solution to stand for a minimum of 30 minutes.
    11.5.2 Filter the solution through a filter membrane using the 
suction filter apparatus. Wash the filter membrane with 10 ml of water 
and 5 ml of ethanol, and allow the filter membrane to air dry on the 
filter apparatus.
    11.5.3 Carefully remove the filter membrane and mount it, filtration 
side up, with double-side tape on the inner surface of a planchet. Place 
the planchet in an internal proportional counter, and count for 100 
minutes.
    11.5.4 Calculate the activity of the sample using Eq. 111-4 in 
Section 12.5.
    11.5.5 Determine the aliquot volume of the sample solution from 
Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, such that the aliquot 
contains an activity between 1 and 4 picocuries. Use Eq. 111-5 in 
Section 12.6.
    11.6 Preparation of Silver Disc for Spontaneous Electrodeposition.
    11.6.1 Clean both sides of the polished silver disc with silver 
cleaner and with degreaser.
    11.6.2 Place disc on absorbent paper and spray one side with epoxy 
spray enamel. This should be carried out in a well-ventilated area, with 
the disc lying flat to keep paint on one side only. Allow paint to dry 
for 24 hours before using disc for deposition.
    11.7 Sample Analysis.
    11.7.1 Add the aliquot of sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be 
analyzed for polonium-210, the volume of which was determined in Section 
11.5.5, to a suitable 200-ml container to be placed in a constant 
temperature bath.

    Note: Aliquot volume may require a larger container.

    11.7.2 If necessary, bring the volume to 100 ml with 1 M HCl. If the 
aliquot volume exceeds 100 ml, use total aliquot.
    11.7.3 Add 200 mg of ascorbic acid and heat solution to 85 [deg]C 
(185 [deg]F) in a constant temperature bath.
    11.7.4 Suspend a silver disc in the heated solution using a glass or 
plastic rod with a hook inserted through the hole in the disc.

[[Page 305]]

The disc should be totally immersed in the solution, and the solution 
must be stirred constantly, at all times during the plating operation. 
Maintain the disc in solution for 3 hours.
    11.7.5 Remove the silver disc, rinse with deionized distilled water, 
and allow to air dry at room temperature.
    11.7.6 Place the disc, with deposition side (unpainted side) up, on 
a planchet and secure with double-side plastic tape. Place the planchet 
with disc in alpha spectrometry system and count for 1000 minutes.

   Method 114--Test Methods for Measuring Radionuclide Emissions from 
                           Stationary Sources

1. Purpose and Background

    This method provides the requirements for: (1) Stack monitoring and 
sample collection methods appropriate for radionuclides; (2) 
radiochemical methods which are used in determining the amounts of 
radionuclides collected by the stack sampling and; (3) quality assurance 
methods which are conducted in conjunction with these measurements. 
These methods are appropriate for emissions for stationary sources. A 
list of references is provided.
    Many different types of facilities release radionuclides into air. 
These radionuclides differ in the chemical and physical forms, half-
lives and type of radiation emitted. The appropriate combination of 
sample extraction, collection and analysis for an individual 
radionuclide is dependent upon many interrelated factors including the 
mixture of other radionuclides present. Because of this wide range of 
conditions, no single method for monitoring or sample collection and 
analysis of a radionuclide is applicable to all types of facilities. 
Therefore, a series of methods based on ``principles of measurement'' 
are described for monitoring and sample collection and analysis which 
are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides

[[Page 308]]

found in effluent streams at stationary sources. This approach provides 
the user with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate combination 
of monitoring and sample collection and analysis methods which are 
applicable to the effluent stream to be measured.

2. Stack Monitoring and Sample Collection Methods

    Monitoring and sample collection methods are described based on 
``principles of monitoring and sample collection'' which are applicable 
to the measurement of radionuclides from effluent streams at stationary 
sources. Radionuclides of most elements will be in the particulate form 
in these effluent streams and can be readily collected using a suitable 
filter media. Radionuclides of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, the 
noble gases and in some circumstances iodine will be in the gaseous 
form. Radionuclides of these elements will require either the use of an 
in-line or off-line monitor to directly measure the radionuclides, or 
suitable sorbers, condensers or bubblers to collect the radionuclides.
    2.1 Radionuclides as Particulates. The extracted effluent stream is 
passed through a filter media to remove the particulates. The filter 
must have a high efficiency for removal of sub-micron particles. The 
guidance in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 (section 6.6.2 Filter media) shall be 
followed in using filter media to collect particulates (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 61.18 of this part).
    2.2 Radionuclides as Gases.
    2.2.1 The Radionuclide Tritium (H-3). Tritium in the form of water 
vapor is collected from the extracted effluent sample by sorption, 
condensation or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may 
include silica gel, molecular sieves, and ethylene glycol or water 
bubblers.
    Tritium in the gaseous form may be measured directly in the sample 
stream using Method B-1, collected as a gas sample or may be oxidized 
using a metal catalyst to tritiated water and collected as described 
above.
    2.2.2 Radionuclides of Iodine. Iodine is collected from an extracted 
sample by sorption or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may 
include charcoal, impregnated charcoal, metal zeolite and caustic 
solutions.
    2.2.3 Radionuclides of Argon, Krypton and Xenon. Radionuclides of 
these elements are either measured directly by an in-line or off-line 
monitor, or are collected from the extracted sample by low temperature 
sorption techniques, Appropriate sorbers may include charcoal or metal 
zeolite.
    2.2.4 Radionuclides of Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Radon. 
Radionuclides of these elements are measured directly using an in-line 
or off-line monitor. Radionuclides of carbon in the form of carbon 
dioxide may be collected by dissolution in caustic solutions.
    2.3 Definition of Terms
    In-line monitor means a continuous measurement system in which the 
detector is placed directly in or adjacent to the effluent stream. This 
may involve either gross radioactivity measurements or specific 
radionuclide measurements. Gross measurements shall be made in 
conformance with the conditions specified in Methods A-4, B-2 and G-4.
    Off-line monitor means a measurement system in which the detector is 
used to continuously measure an extracted sample of the effluent stream. 
This may involve either gross radioactivity measurements or specific 
radionuclide measurements. Gross measurements shall be made in 
conformance with the conditions specified in Methods A-4, B-2 and G-4.
    Sample collection means a procedure in which the radionuclides are 
removed from an extracted sample of the effluent using a collection 
media. These collection media include filters, absorbers, bubblers and 
condensers. The collected sample is analyzed using the methods described 
in Section 3.

3. Radionuclide Analysis Methods

    A series of methods based on ``principles of measurement'' are 
described which are applicable to the analysis of radionuclides 
collected from airborne effluent streams at stationary sources. These 
methods are applicable only under the conditions stated and within the 
limitations described. Some methods specify that only a single 
radionuclide be present in the sample or the chemically separated 
sample. This condition should be interpreted to mean that no other 
radionuclides are present in quantities which would interfere with the 
measurement.
    Also identified (Table 1) are methods for a selected list of 
radionuclides. The listed radionuclides are those which are most 
commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing dose to 
members of the public. Use of methods based on principles of measurement 
other than those described in this section must be approved in advance 
of use by the Administrator. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, 
any of the described methods may be used provided the user can 
demonstrate that the applicability conditions of the method have been 
met.
    The type of method applicable to the analysis of a radionuclide is 
dependent upon the type of radiation emitted, i.e., alpha, beta or 
gamma. Therefore, the methods described below are grouped according to 
principles of measurements for the analysis of alpha, beta and gamma 
emitting radionuclides.
    3.1 Methods for Alpha Emitting Radionuclides
    3.1.1 Method A-1, Radiochemistry-Alpha Spectrometry.

[[Page 309]]

    Principle: The element of interest is separated from other elements, 
and from the sample matrix using radiochemical techniques. The procedure 
may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers 
(elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. 
The element is deposited on a planchet in a very thin film by 
electrodeposition or by coprecipitation on a very small amount of 
carrier, such as lanthanum fluoride. The deposited element is then 
counted with an alpha spectrometer. The activity of the nuclide of 
interest is measured by the number of alpha counts in the appropriate 
energy region. A correction for chemical yield and counting efficiency 
is made using a standardized radioactive nuclide (tracer) of the same 
element. If a radioactive tracer is not available for the element of 
interest, a predetermined chemical yield factor may be used.
    Applicability: This method is applicable for determining the 
activity of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, regardless of what other 
radionuclides are present in the sample provided the chemical separation 
step produces a very thin sample and removes all other radionuclides 
which could interfere in the spectral region of interest. APHA-605(2), 
ASTM-D-3972(13).
    3.1.2 Method A-2, Radiochemistry-Alpha Counting.
    Principle: The element of interest is separated from other elements, 
and from the sample matrix using radiochemistry. The procedure may 
involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers 
(elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. 
The element is deposited on a planchet in a thin film and counted with 
an alpha counter. A correction for chemical yield (if necessary) is 
made. The alpha count rate measures the total activity of all emitting 
radionuclides of the separated element.
    Applicability: This method is applicable for the measurement of any 
alpha-emitting radionuclide, provided no other alpha emitting 
radionuclide is present in the separated sample. It may also be 
applicable for determining compliance, when other radionuclides of the 
separated element are present, provided that the calculated emission 
rate is assigned to the radionuclide which could be present in the 
sample that has the highest dose conversion factor. IDO-12096(18).
    3.1.3 Method A-3, Direct Alpha Spectrometry.
    Principle: The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted 
directly on an alpha spectrometer. The sample must be thin enough and 
collected on the surface of the filter so that any absorption of alpha 
particle energy in the sample or the filter, which would degrade the 
spectrum, is minimal.
    Applicability: This method is applicable to simple mixtures of alpha 
emitting radionuclides and only when the amount of particulates 
collected on the filter paper are relatively small and the alpha spectra 
is adequately resolved. Resolutions should be 50 keV (FWHM) or better, 
ASTM-D-3084(16).
    3.1.4 Method A-4, Direct Alpha Counting (Gross alpha determination).
    Principle: The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted 
with an alpha counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-
absorption is not significant and the filter must be of such a nature 
that the particles are retained on the surface.
    Applicability: Gross alpha determinations may be used to measure 
emissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the 
sample contains only a single radionuclide, or the identity and isotopic 
ratio of the radionuclides in the sample are well-known, and (2) 
measurements using either Method A-1, A-2 or A-5 have shown that this 
method provides a reasonably accurate measurement of the emission rate. 
Gross alpha measurements are applicable to unidentified mixtures of 
radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described 
in section 3.7. APHA-601(3), ASTM-D-1943(10).
    3.1.5 Method A-5, Chemical Determination of Uranium.
    Principle: Uranium may be measured chemically by either colorimetry 
or fluorometry. In both procedures, the sample is dissolved, the uranium 
is oxidized to the hexavalent form and extracted into a suitable 
solvent. Impurities are removed from the solvent layer. For colorimetry, 
dibenzoylmethane is added, and the uranium is measured by the absorbance 
in a colorimeter. For fluorometry, a portion of the solution is fused 
with a sodium fluoride-lithium fluoride flux and the uranium is 
determined by the ultraviolet activated fluorescence of the fused disk 
in a fluorometer.
    Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurements of 
emission rates of uranium when the isotopic ratio of the uranium 
radionuclides is well known. ASTM-E-318(15), ASTM-D-2907(14).
    3.1.6 Method A-6, Radon-222--Continuous Gas Monitor.
    Principle: Radon-222 is measured directly in a continuously 
extracted sample stream by passing the air stream through a calibrated 
scintillation cell. Prior to the scintillation cell, the air stream is 
treated to remove particulates and excess moisture. The alpha particles 
from radon-222 and its decay products strike a zinc sulfide coating on 
the inside of the scintillation cell producing light pulses. The light 
pulses are detected by a photomultiplier tube which generates electrical 
pulses. These pulses are processed by the system electronics and the 
read out is in pCi/l of radon-222.

[[Page 310]]

    Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of 
radon-222 in effluent streams which do not contain significant 
quantities of radon-220. Users of this method should calibrate the 
monitor in a radon calibration chamber at least twice per year. The 
background of the monitor should also be checked periodically by 
operating the instrument in a low radon environment. EPA 520/1-89-
009(24).
    3.1.7 Method A-7, Radon-222-Alpha Track Detectors
    Principle: Radon-222 is measured directly in the effluent stream 
using alpha track detectors (ATD). The alpha particles emitted by radon-
222 and its decay products strike a small plastic strip and produce 
submicron damage tracks. The plastic strip is placed in a caustic 
solution that accentuates the damage tracks which are counted using a 
microscope or automatic counting system. The number of tracks per unit 
area is correlated to the radon concentration in air using a conversion 
factor derived from data generated in a radon calibration facility.
    Applicability: Prior approval from EPA is required for use of this 
method. This method is only applicable to effluent streams which do not 
contain significant quantities of radon-220, unless special detectors 
are used to discriminate against radon-220. This method may be used only 
when ATDs have been demonstrated to produce data comparable to data 
obtained with Method A-6. Such data should be submitted to EPA when 
requesting approval for the use of this method. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).
    3.2 Methods for Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.
    3.2.1 Method B-1, Direct Counting in Flow-Through Ionization 
Chambers.
    Principle: An ionization chamber containing a specific volume of gas 
which flows at a given flow rate through the chamber is used. The sample 
(effluent stream sample) acts as the counting gas for the chamber. The 
activity of the radionuclide is determined from the current measured in 
the ionization chamber.
    Applicability: This method is applicable for measuring the activity 
of a gaseous beta-emitting radionuclide in an effluent stream that is 
suitable as a counting gas, when no other beta-emitting nuclides are 
present. DOE/EP-0096(17), NCRP-58(23).
    3.2.2 Method B-2, Direct Counting With In-line or Off-line Beta 
Detectors.
    Principle: The beta detector is placed directly in the effluent 
stream (in-line) or an extracted sample of the effluent stream is passed 
through a chamber containing a beta detector (off-line). The activities 
of the radionuclides present in the effluent stream are determined from 
the beta count rate, and a knowledge of the radionuclides present and 
the relationship of the gross beta count rate and the specific 
radionuclide concentration.
    Applicability: This method is applicable only to radionuclides with 
maximum beta particle energies greater then 0.2 MeV. This method may be 
used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is 
known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide or the 
identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the effluent stream 
are well known. Specific radionuclide analysis of periodic grab samples 
may be used to identify the types and quantities of radionuclides 
present and to establish the relationship between specific radionuclide 
analyses and gross beta count rates.
    This method is applicable to unidentified mixtures of gaseous 
radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described 
in section 3.7.
    3.3 Methods for Non-Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.
    3.3.1 Method B-3, Radiochemistry-Beta Counting.
    Principle: The element of interest is separated from other elements, 
and from the sample matrix by radiochemistry. This may involve 
precipitation, distillation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. 
Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be 
used. The element is deposited on a planchet, and counted with a beta 
counter. Corrections for chemical yield, and decay (if necessary) are 
made. The beta count rate determines the total activity of all 
radionuclides of the separated element. This method may also involve the 
radiochemical separation and counting of a daughter element, after a 
suitable period of ingrowth, in which case it is specific for the parent 
nuclide.
    Applicability: This method is applicable for measuring the activity 
of any beta-emitting radionuclide, with a maximum energy greater than 
0.2 MeV, provided no other radionuclide is present in the separated 
sample. APHA-608(5).
    3.3.2 Method B-4, Direct Beta Counting (Gross beta determination).
    Principle: The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted 
with a beta counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-
absorption corrections can be made.
    Applicability: Gross beta measurements are applicable only to 
radionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater than 0.2 MeV. 
Gross beta measurements may be used to measure emissions of specific 
radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the sample contains only a 
single radionuclide, and (2) measurements made using Method B-3 show 
reasonable agreement with the gross beta measurement. Gross beta 
measurements are applicable to mixtures of radionuclides only for the 
purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7. APHA-602(4), 
ASTM-D-1890(11).
    3.3.3 Method B-5, Liquid Scintillation Spectrometry.

[[Page 311]]

    Principle: An aliquot of a collected sample or the result of some 
other chemical separation or processing technique is added to a liquid 
scintillation ``cocktail'' which is viewed by photomultiplier tubes in a 
liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is adjusted to 
establish a channel or ``window'' for the pulse energy appropriate to 
the nuclide of interest. The activity of the nuclide of interest is 
measured by the counting rate in the appropriate energy channel. 
Corrections are made for chemical yield where separations are made.
    Applicability: This method is applicable to any beta-emitting 
nuclide when no other radionuclide is present in the sample or the 
separated sample provided that it can be incorporated in the 
scintillation cocktail. This method is also applicable for samples which 
contain more than one radionuclide but only when the energies of the 
beta particles are sufficiently separated so that they can be resolved 
by the spectrometer. This method is most applicable to the measurement 
of low-energy beta emitters such as tritium and carbon-14. APHA-609(6), 
EML-LV-539-17(19).
    3.4 Gamma Emitting Radionuclides
    3.4.1 Method G-1, High Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.
    Principle: The sample is counted with a high resolution gamma 
detector, usually either a Ge(Li) or a high purity Ge detector, 
connected to a multichannel analyzer or computer. The gamma emitting 
radionuclides in the sample are measured from the gamma count rates in 
the energy regions characteristic of the individual radionuclide. 
Corrections are made for counts contributed by other radionuclides to 
the spectral regions of the radionuclides of interest. Radiochemical 
separations may be made prior to counting but are usually not necessary.
    Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of any 
gamma emitting radionuclide with gamma energies greater than 20 keV. It 
can be applied to complex mixtures of radionuclides. The samples counted 
may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gases. 
The method may also be applied to the analysis of gaseous gamma emitting 
radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the stream 
through a chamber or cell containing the detector. ASTM-3649(9), IDO-
12096(18).
    3.4.2 Method G-2, Low Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.
    Principle: The sample is counted with a low resolution gamma 
detector, a thallium activated sodium iodide crystal. The detector is 
coupled to a photomultiplier tube and connected to a multichannel 
analyzer. The gamma emitting radionuclides in the sample are measured 
from the gamma count rates in the energy regions characteristic of the 
individual radionuclides. Corrections are made for counts contributed by 
other radionuclides to the spectral regions of the radionuclides of 
interest. Radiochemical separation may be used prior to counting to 
obtain less complex gamma spectra if needed.
    Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of gamma 
emitting radionuclides with energies greater than 100 keV. It can be 
applied only to relatively simple mixtures of gamma emitting 
radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate 
filters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the 
analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by 
passing the gas stream through a chamber or cell containing the 
detector. ASTM-D-2459(12), EMSL-LV-0539-17(19).
    3.4.3 Method G-3, Single Channel Gamma Spectrometry.
    Principle: The sample is counted with a thallium activated sodium 
iodide crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube 
connected to a single channel analyzer. The activity of a gamma emitting 
radionuclide is determined from the gamma counts in the energy range for 
which the counter is set.
    Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of a 
single gamma emitting radionuclide. It is not applicable to mixtures of 
radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate 
filters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the 
analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by 
passing the gas stream through a chamber or cell containing the 
detector.
    3.4.4 Method G-4, Gross Gamma Counting.
    Principle: The sample is counted with a gamma detector usually a 
thallium activated sodium iodine crystal. The detector is coupled to a 
photomultiplier tube and gamma rays above a specific threshold energy 
level are counted.
    Applicability: Gross gamma measurements may be used to measure 
emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is known that the 
sample contains a single radionuclide or the identity and isotopic ratio 
of the radionuclides in the effluent stream are well known. When gross 
gamma measurements are used to determine emissions of specific 
radionuclides periodic measurements using Methods G-1 or G-2 should be 
made to demonstrate that the gross gamma measurements provide reliable 
emission data. This method may be applied to analysis of gaseous 
radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by placing the detector 
directly in or adjacent to the effluent stream or passing an extracted 
sample of the effluent stream through a chamber or cell containing the 
detector.
    3.5 Counting Methods. All of the above methods with the exception of 
Method A-5 involve counting the radiation emitted by the radionuclide. 
Counting methods applicable to the measurement of alpha, beta and

[[Page 312]]

gamma radiations are listed below. The equipment needed and the counting 
principles involved are described in detail in ASTM-3648(8).
    3.5.1 Alpha Counting:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Gas Flow Proportional Counters. The alpha 
particles cause ionization in the counting gas and the resulting 
electrical pulses are counted. These counters may be windowless or have 
very thin windows.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Scintillation Counters. The alpha particles 
transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light 
photons which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light photons 
to electrical pulses which are counted. The counters may involve the use 
of solid scintillation materials such as zinc sulfide or liquid 
scintillation solutions.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Solid-State Counters. Semiconductor materials, 
such as silicon surface-barrier p-n junctions, act as solid ionization 
chambers. The alpha particles interact which the detector producing 
electron hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied 
electrical field and the resulting electrical pulses are counted.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Alpha Spectrometers. Semiconductor detectors used 
in conjunction with multichannel analyzers for energy discrimination.
    3.5.2 Beta Counting:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Ionization Chambers. These chambers contain the 
beta-emitting nuclide in gaseous form. The ionization current produced 
is measured.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Geiger-Muller (GM) Counters-or Gas Flow 
Proportional Counters. The beta particles cause ionization in the 
counting gas and the resulting electrical pulses are counted. 
Proportional gas flow counters which are heavily shielded by lead or 
other metal, and provided with an anti-coincidence shield to reject 
cosmic rays, are called low background beta counters.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Scintillation Counters. The beta particles 
transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light 
photons, which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light photon 
to electrical pulses which are counted. This may involve the use of 
anthracene crystals, plastic scintillator, or liquid scintillation 
solutions with organic phosphors.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Liquid Scintillation Spectrometers. Liquid 
scintillation counters which use two photomultiplier tubes in 
coincidence to reduce background counts. This counter may also 
electronically discriminate among pulses of a given range of energy.
    3.5.3 Gamma Counting:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Low-Resolution Gamma Spectrometers. The gamma 
rays interact with thallium activated sodium iodide or cesium iodide 
crystal resulting in the release of light photons which strike a 
photomultiplier tube converting the light pulses to electrical pulses 
proportional to the energy of the gamma ray. Multi-channel analyzers are 
used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed 
in the crystal.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> High-Resolution gamma Spectrometers. Gamma rays 
interact with a lithium-drifted (Ge(Li)) or high-purity germanium (HPGe) 
semiconductor detectors resulting in a production of electron-hole 
pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field. A 
very stable low noise preamplifier amplifies the pulses of electrical 
charge resulting from the gamma photon interactions. Multichannel 
analyzers or computers are used to separate and store the pulses 
according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Single Channel Analyzers. Thallium activated 
sodium iodide crystals used with a single window analyzer. Pulses from 
the photomultiplier tubes are separated in a single predetermined energy 
range.
    3.5.4 Calibration of Counters. Counters are calibrated for specific 
radionuclide measurements using a standard of the radionuclide under 
either identical or very similar conditions as the sample to be counted. 
For gamma spectrometers a series of standards covering the energy range 
of interest may be used to construct a calibration curve relating gamma 
energy to counting efficiency.
    In those cases where a standard is not available for a radionuclide, 
counters may be calibrated using a standard with energy characteristics 
as similar as possible to the radionuclide to be measured. For gross 
alpha and beta measurements of the unidentified mixtures of 
radionuclides, alpha counters are calibrated with a natural uranium 
standard and beta counters with a cesium-137 standard. The standard must 
contain the same weight and distribution of solids as the samples, and 
be mounted in an identical manner. If the samples contain variable 
amounts of solids, calibration curves relating weight of solids present 
to counting efficiency are prepared. Standards other than those 
prescribed may be used provided it can be shown that such standards are 
more applicable to the radionuclide mixture measured.
    3.6 Radiochemical Methods for Selected Radionuclides. Methods for a 
selected list of radionuclides are listed in Table 1. The radionuclides 
listed are those which are most commonly used and which have the 
greatest potential for causing doses to members of the public. For 
radionuclides not listed in Table 1, methods based on any of the 
applicable ``principles of measurement'' described in section 3.1 
through 3.4 may be used.
    3.7 Applicability of Gross Alpha and Beta Measurements to 
Unidentified Mixtures of Radionuclides. Gross alpha and beta 
measurements may be used as a screening measurement as a part of an 
emission measurement program to identify the need to do specific 
radionuclide analyses or to confirm or verify that unexpected 
radionuclides are not being released in significant quantities.

[[Page 313]]

    Gross alpha (Method A-4) or gross beta (Methods B-2 or B-4) 
measurements may also be used for the purpose of comparing the measured 
concentrations in the effluent stream with the limiting ``Concentration 
Levels for Environmental Compliance'' in table 2 of appendix E. For 
unidentified mixtures, the measured concentration value shall be 
compared with the lowest environmental concentration limit for any 
radionuclide which is not known to be absent from the effluent stream.

4. Quality Assurance Methods

    Each facility required to measure their radionuclide emissions shall 
conduct a quality assurance program in conjunction with the radionuclide 
emission measurements. This program shall assure that the emission 
measurements are representative, and are of known precision and accuracy 
and shall include administrative controls to assure prompt response when 
emission measurements indicate unexpectedly large emissions. The program 
shall consist of a system of policies, organizational responsibilities, 
written procedures, data quality specifications, audits, corrective 
actions and reports. This quality assurance program shall include the 
following program elements:
    4.1 The organizational structure, functional responsibilities, 
levels of authority and lines of communications for all activities 
related to the emissions measurement program shall be identified and 
documented.
    4.2 Administrative controls shall be prescribed to ensure prompt 
response in the event that emission levels increase due to unplanned 
operations.
    4.3 The sample collection and analysis procedures used in measuring 
the emissions shall be described including where applicable:
    4.3.1 Identification of sampling sites and number of sampling 
points, including the rationale for site selections.
    4.3.2 A description of sampling probes and representativeness of the 
samples.
    4.3.3 A description of any continuous monitoring system used to 
measure emissions, including the sensitivity of the system, calibration 
procedures and frequency of calibration.
    4.3.4 A description of the sample collection systems for each 
radionuclide measured, including frequency of collection, calibration 
procedures and frequency of calibration.
    4.3.5 A description of the laboratory analysis procedures used for 
each radionuclide measured, including frequency of analysis, calibration 
procedures and frequency of calibration.
    4.3.6 A description of the sample flow rate measurement systems or 
procedures, including calibration procedures and frequency of 
calibration.
    4.3.7 A description of the effluent flow rate measurement 
procedures, including frequency of measurements, calibration procedures 
and frequency of calibration.
    4.4 The objectives of the quality assurance program shall be 
documented and shall state the required precision, accuracy and 
completeness of the emission measurement data including a description of 
the procedures used to assess these parameters. Accuracy is the degree 
of agreement of a measurement with a true or known value. Precision is a 
measure of the agreement among individual measurements of the same 
parameters under similar conditions. Completeness is a measure of the 
amount of valid data obtained compared to the amount expected under 
normal conditions.

[[Page 314]]

    4.5 A quality control program shall be established to evaluate and 
track the quality of the emissions measurement data against preset 
criteria. The program should include where applicable a system of 
replicates, spiked samples, split samples, blanks and control charts. 
The number and frequency of such quality control checks shall be 
identified.
    4.6 A sample tracking system shall be established to provide for 
positive identification of samples and data through all phases of the 
sample collection, analysis and reporting system. Sample handling and 
preservation procedures shall be established to maintain the integrity 
of samples during collection, storage and analysis.
    4.7 Regular maintenance, calibration and field checks shall be 
performed for each sampling system in use by satisfying the requirements 
found in Table 2: Maintenance, Calibration and Field Check Requirements.

             Method 115--Monitoring for Radon-222 Emissions

    This appendix describes the monitoring methods which must be used in 
determining the radon-222 emissions from underground uranium mines, 
uranium mill tailings piles, phosphogypsum stacks, and other piles of 
waste material emitting radon.

1. Radon-222 Emissions from Underground Uranium Mine Vents

    1.1 Sampling Frequency and Calculation of Emissions. Radon-222 
emissions from underground uranium mine vents shall be determined using 
one of the following methods:
    1.1.1 Continuous Measurement. These measurements shall be made and 
the emissions calculated as follows:
    (a) The radon-222 concentration shall be continuously measured at 
each mine vent whenever the mine ventilation system is operational.
    (b) Each mine vent exhaust flow rate shall be measured at least 4 
times per year.
    (c) A weekly radon-222 emission rate for the mine shall be 
calculated and recorded weekly as follows:

A<INF>w</INF>= C<INF>1</INF>Q<INF>1</INF>T<INF>1</INF> + 
C<INF>2</INF>Q<INF>2</INF>T<INF>2</INF> + . . . 
C<INF>i</INF>Q<INF>i</INF>T<INF>i</INF>

Where:
A<INF>w</INF>=Total radon-222 emitted from the mine during week (Ci)
C<INF>i</INF>=Average radon-222 concentration in mine vent i(Ci/m\3\)
Q<INF>i</INF>=Volumetric flow rate from mine vent i(m\3\/hr)
T<INF>i</INF>=Hours of mine ventilation system operation during week for 
mine vent i(hr)

    (d) The annual radon-222 emission rate is the sum of the weekly 
emission rates during a calendar year.
    1.1.2 Periodic Measurement. This method is applicable only to mines 
that continuously operate their ventilation system except for extended 
shutdowns. Mines which start up and shut down their ventilation system 
frequently must use the continuous measurement method describe in 
Section 1.1.1 above. Emission rates determined using periodic 
measurements shall be measured and calculated as follows:
    (a) The radon-222 shall be continuously measured at each mine vent 
for at least one week every three months.
    (b) Each mine vent exhaust flow rate shall be measured at least once 
during each of the radon-222 measurement periods.
    (c) A weekly radon-222 emission rate shall be calculated for each 
weekly period according to the method described in Section 1.1.1. In 
this calculation T=168 hr.
    (d) The annual radon-222 emission rate from the mine should be 
calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.090

Where:
A<INF>y</INF>=Annual radon-222 emission rate from the mine(Ci)
A<INF>wi</INF>=Weekly radon-222 emission rate during the measurement 
period i (Ci)
n=Number of weekly measurement periods per year
W<INF>s</INF>=Number of weeks during the year that the mine ventilation 
system is shut down in excess of 7 consecutive days, i.e. the sum

[[Page 316]]

of the number of weeks each shut down exceeds 7 days

    1.2 Test Methods and Procedures
    Each underground mine required to test its emissions, unless an 
equivalent or alternative method has been approved by the Administrator, 
shall use the following test methods:
    1.2.1 Test Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 shall be used to 
determine velocity traverses. The sampling point in the duct shall be 
either the centroid of the cross section or the point of average 
velocity.
    1.2.2 Test Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 shall be used to 
determine velocity and volumetric flow rates.
    1.2.3 Test Methods A-6 or A-7 of appendix B, Method 114 to part 61 
shall be used for the analysis of radon-222. Use of Method A-7 requires 
prior approval of EPA based on conditions described in appendix B.
    1.2.4 A quality assurance program shall be conducted in conformance 
with the programs described for Continuous Radon Monitors and Alpha 
Track Detectors in EPA 520/1-89-009. (2)

2. Radon-222 Emissions from Uranium Mill Tailings Piles

    2.1 Measurement and Calculation of Radon Flux from Uranium Mill 
Tailings Piles.
    2.1.1 Frequency of Flux Measurement. A single set of radon flux 
measurements may be made, or if the owner or operator chooses, more 
frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These 
measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All 
radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 2.1.2 
through 2.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, 
the requirement of paragraph 2.1.4(c) shall not apply. The mean radon 
flux from the pile shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux 
for each measurement period. The weather conditions, moisture content of 
the tailings and area of the pile covered by water existing at the time 
of the measurement shall be chosen so as to provide measurements 
representative of the long term radon flux from the pile and shall be 
subject to EPA review and approval.
    2.1.2 Distribution of Flux Measurements. The distribution and number 
of radon flux measurements required on a pile will depend on clearly 
defined areas of the pile (called regions) that can have significantly 
different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux 
shall be determined for each individual region of the pile. Regions that 
shall be considered for operating mill tailings piles are:

    (a) Water covered areas,
    (b) Water saturated areas (beaches),
    (c) Dry top surface areas, and
    (d) Sides, except where earthen material is used in dam 
construction.

    For mill tailings after disposal the pile shall be considered to 
consist of only one region.
    2.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be 
made within each region on the pile, except for those areas covered with 
water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locations across 
the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness will 
prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number of 
flux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative 
mean radon flux value for each type of region on an operating pile is:

    (a) Water covered area--no measurements required as radon flux is 
assumed to be zero,
    (b) Water saturated beaches--100 radon flux measurements,
    (c) Loose and dry top surface--100 radon flux measurements,
    (d) Sides--100 radon flux measurements, except where earthern 
material is used in dam construction.

    For a mill tailings pile after disposal which consists of only one 
region a minimum of 100 measurements are required.
    2.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following 
restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:

    (a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a 
rainfall.
    (b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurements period, the 
measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has 
washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.
    (c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature 
is below 35 [deg]F or if the ground is frozen.

    2.1.5 Areas of Pile Regions. The approximate area of each region of 
the pile shall be determined in units of square meters.
    2.1.6 Radon Flux Measurement. Measuring radon flux involves the 
adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The 
radon collector is placed on the surface of the pile area to be measured 
and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon 
collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The 
detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-
0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on uranium mill 
tailings, except the surface of the tailings shall not be penetrated by 
the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather the 
collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil or 
tailings used to seal the edge.
    2.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the pile 
and for the total

[[Page 317]]

pile shall be calculated and reported as follows:

    (a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided 
in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the 
pile shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements for 
the region and dividing by the total number of flux measurements for the 
region.
    (b) The mean radon flux for the total uranium mill tailings pile 
shall be calculated as follows.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.091

Where:

J<INF>s</INF>=Mean flux for the total pile (pCi/m\2\-s)
J<INF>i</INF>=Mean flux measured in region i (pCi/m\2\-s)
A<INF>i</INF>=Area of region i (m\2\)
A<INF>t</INF>=Total area of the pile (m\2\)

    2.1.8 Reporting. The results of individual flux measurements, the 
approximate locations on the pile, and the mean radon flux for each 
region and the mean radon flux for the total stack shall be included in 
the emission test report. Any condition or unusual event that occurred 
during the measurements that could significantly affect the results 
should be reported.
    3.0 Radon-222 Emissions from Phosphogypsum Stacks.
    3.1 Measurement and Calculation of the Mean Radon Flux. Radon flux 
measurements shall be made on phosphogypsum stacks as described below:
    3.1.1 Frequency of Measurements. A single set of radon flux 
measurements may be made after the phosphogypsum stack becomes inactive, 
or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be 
made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, 
monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as 
described in paragraphs 3.1.2 through 3.1.6 except that for measurements 
made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 3.1.4(c) shall 
not apply. For measurements made over a one year period, the radon flux 
shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement 
period.
    3.1.2 Distribution and Number of Flux Measurements. The distribution 
and number of radon flux measurements required on a stack will depend on 
clearly defined areas of the stack (called regions) that can have 
significantly different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean 
radon flux shall be determined for each individual region of the stack. 
Regions that shall be considered are:

    (a) Water covered areas,
    (b) Water saturated areas (beaches),
    (c) Loose and dry top surface areas,
    (d) Hard-packed roadways, and
    (e) Sides.

    3.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be 
made within each region on the phosphogypsum stack, except for those 
areas covered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced 
locations across the surface of the region, realizing that surface 
roughness will prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The 
minimum number of flux measurements considered necessary to determine a 
representative mean radon flux value for each type of region is:

    (a) Water covered area--no measurements required as radon flux is 
assumed to be zero,
    (b) Water saturated beaches--50 radon flux measurements,
    (c) Loose and dry top surface--100 radon flux measurements,
    (d) Hard-packed roadways--50 radon flux measurements, and
    (e) Sides--100 radon flux measurements.

A minimum of 300 measurements are required. A stack that has no water 
cover can be considered to consist of two regions, top and sides, and 
will require a minimum of only 200 measurements.
    3.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following 
restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:

    (a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a 
rainfall.
    (b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurement period, the 
measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has 
washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.
    (c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature 
is below 35 [deg]F or if the ground is frozen.

    3.1.5 Areas of Stack Regions. The approximate area of each region of 
the stack shall be determined in units of square meters.
    3.1.6 Radon Flux Measurements. Measuring radon flux involves the 
adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The 
radon collector is placed on the surface of the stack area to be 
measured and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The 
radon collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. 
The detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-
85-0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on phosphogypsum 
stacks, except the surface of the phosphogypsum shall not be penetrated 
by the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather 
the collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil 
or phosphogypsum used to seal the edge.
    3.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the 
phosphogypsum stack

[[Page 318]]

and for the total stack shall be calculated and reported as follows:

    (a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided 
in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the 
stack shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements

    4.0 Quality Assurance Procedures for Measuring Rn-222 Flux

                         A. Sampling Procedures

    Records of field activities and laboratory measurements shall be 
maintained. The following information shall be recorded for each 
charcoal canister measurement:

(a) Site
(b) Name of pile
(c) Sample location
(d) Sample ID number
(e) Date and time on
(f) Date and time off
(g) Observations of meteorological conditions and comments

    Records shall include all applicable information associated with 
determining the sample measurement, calculations, observations, and 
comments.

                            B. Sample Custody

    Custodial control of all charcoal samples exposed in the field shall 
be maintained in accordance with EPA chain-of-custody field procedures. 
A control record shall document all custody changes that occur between 
the field and laboratory personnel.

                 C. Calibration Procedures and Frequency

    The radioactivity of two standard charcoal sources, each containing 
a carefully determined quantity of radium-226 uniformly distributed 
through 180g of activated charcoal, shall be measured. An efficiency 
factor is computed by dividing the average measured radioactivity of the 
two standard charcoal sources, minus the background, in cpm by the known 
radioactivity of the charcoal sources in dpm. The same two standard 
charcoal sources shall be counted at the beginning and at the end of 
each day's counting as a check of the radioactivity counting equipment. 
A background count using unexposed charcoal should also be made at the 
beginning and at the end of each counting day to check for inadvertent 
contamination of the detector or other changes affecting the background. 
The unexposed charcoal comprising the blank is changed with each new 
batch of charcoal used.

            D. Internal Quality Control Checks and Frequency

    The charcoal from every tenth exposed canister shall be recounted. 
Five percent of the samples analyzed shall be either blanks (charcoal 
having no radioactivity added) or samples spiked with known quantities 
of radium-226.

              E. Data Precision, Accuracy, and Completeness

    The precision, accuracy, and completeness of measurements and 
analyses shall be within the following limits for samples measuring 
greater than 1.0 pCi/m\2\-s.
    (a) Precision: 10%
    (b) Accuracy: <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10%
    (c) Completeness: at least 85% of the measurements must yield 
useable results.

        Sec. Appendix C to Part 61--Quality Assurance Procedures

 Procedure 1--Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak Resolution

    In this method of dealing with resolution, the extent to which one 
chromatographic peak overlaps another is determined.
    For convenience, consider the range of the elution curve of each 
compound as running from -2[sigma] to +2[sigma]. This range is used in 
other resolution criteria, and it contains 95.45 percent of the area of 
a normal curve. If two peaks are separated by a known distance, b, one 
can determine the fraction of the area of one curve that lies within the 
range of the other. The extent to which the elution curve of a 
contaminant compound overlaps the curve of a compound that is under 
analysis is found by integrating the contaminant curve over the limits 
b-2[sigma]<INF>s</INF> to b+2[sigma]<INF>s,</INF> where 
[sigma]<INF>s</INF> is the standard deviation of the sample curve.
    This calculation can be simplified in several ways. Overlap can be 
determined for curves of unit area; then actual areas can be introduced. 
Desired integration can be resolved into two integrals of the normal 
distribution function for which there are convenient calculation 
programs and tables. An example would be Program 15 in Texas Instruments 
Program Manual ST1, 1975, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, Texas 75222.

[[Page 320]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.034

    In judging the suitability of alternate GC columns or the effects of 
altering chromatographic conditions, one can employ the area overlap as 
the resolution parameter with a specific maximum permissible value.

[[Page 321]]

    The use of Gaussian functions to describe chromatographic elution 
curves is widespread. However, some elution curves are highly 
asymmetric. In cases where the sample peak is followed by a contaminant 
that has a leading edge that rises sharply but the curve then tails off, 
it may be possible to define an effective width for t<INF>c</INF> as 
``twice the distance from the leading edge to a perpendicular line 
through the maxim of the contaminant curve, measured along a 
perpendicular bisection of that line.''

          Procedure 2--Procedure for Field Auditing GC Analysis

    Responsibilities of audit supervisor and analyst at the source 
sampling site include the following:
    A. The audit supervisor verifies that audit cylinders are stored in 
a safe location both before and after the audit to prevent vandalism.
    B. At the beginning and conclusion of the audit, the analyst records 
each cylinder number and pressure. An audit cylinder is never analyzed 
when the pressure drops below 200 psi.
    C. During the audit, the analyst performs a minimum of two 
consecutive analyses of each audit cylinder gas. The audit must be 
conducted to coincide with the analysis of source test samples, normally 
immediately after GC calibration and prior to sample analyses.
    D. At the end of audit analyses, the audit supervisor requests the 
calculated concentrations from the analyst and compares the results with 
the actual audit concentrations. If each measured concentration agrees 
with the respective actual concentration within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 
percent, he directs the analyst to begin analyzing source samples. Audit 
supervisor judgment and/or supervisory policy determine action when 
agreement is not within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent. When a 
consistent bias in excess of 10 percent is found, it may be possible to 
proceed with the sample analysis, with a corrective factor to be applied 
to the results at a later time. However, every attempt should be made to 
locate the cause of the discrepancy, as it may be misleading. The audit 
supervisor records each cylinder number, cylinder pressure (at the end 
of the audit), and all calculated concentrations. The individual being 
audited must not under any circumstance be told actual audit 
concentrations until calculated concentrations have been submitted to 
the audit supervisor.

    Sec. Appendix D to Part 61--Methods for Estimating Radionuclide 
                                Emissions

                        1. Purpose and Background

    Facility owners or operators may estimate radionuclide emissions to 
the atmosphere for dose calculations instead of measuring emissions. 
Particulate emissions from mill tailings piles should be estimated using 
the procedures listed in reference re <greek-i>2. All other emissions 
may be estimated by using the

[[Page 322]]

``Procedures'' listed below, or using the method described in reference 
<greek-i>1.

                              2. Procedure

    To estimate emissions to the atmosphere:
    (a) Determine the amount (in curies) used at facilities for the 
period under consideration. Radioactive materials in sealed packages 
that remain unopened, and have not leaked during the assessment period 
should not be included in the calculation.
    (b) Multiply the amount used by the following factors which depend 
on the physical state of the radionuclide. They are:
    (i) 1 for gases;
    (ii) 10<SUP>-3</SUP> for liquids or particulate solids; and
    (iii) 10<SUP>-6</SUP> for solids.
    If any nuclide is heated to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or 
more, boils at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or less, or is 
intentionally dispersed into the environment, it must be considered to 
be a gas.
    (c) If a control device is installed between the place of use and 
the point of release, multiply emissions from (b) by an adjustment 
factor. These are presented in Table 1.

     Sec. Appendix E to Part 61--Compliance Procedures Methods for 
                  Determining Compliance With Subpart I

                        1. Purpose and Background

    This Appendix provides simplified procedures to reduce the burden on 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees, and non-Department of 
Energy Federal facilities in determining compliance with 40 CFR part 61, 
subpart I. The procedures consist of a series of increasingly more 
stringent steps, depending on the facility's potential to exceed the 
standard.
    First, a facility can be found in compliance if the quantity of 
radioactive material possessed during the year is less than that listed 
in a table of annual possession quantities. A facility will also be in 
compliance if the average annual radionuclide emission concentration is 
less than that listed in a table of air concentration levels. If the 
facility is

[[Page 323]]

not in compliance by these tables, it can establish compliance by 
estimating a dose using screening procedure developed by the National 
Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements with a radiological 
source term derived using EPA approved emission factors. These 
procedures are described in a ``Guide for Determining Compliance with 
the Clean Air Act Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From NRC-Licenced 
and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.''
    A user-friendly computer program called COMPLY has been developed to 
reduce the burden on the regulated community. The Agency has also 
prepared a ``User's Guide for the COMPLY Code'' to assist the regulated 
community in using the code, and in handling more complex situations 
such as multiple release points. The basis for these compliance 
procedures are provided in ``Background Information Document: Procedures 
Approved for Demonstrating Compliance with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart I''. 
The compliance model is the highest level in the COMPLY computer code 
and provides for the most realistic assessment of dose by allowing the 
use of site-specific information.

                 2. Table of Annual Possession Quantity

    (a) Table 1 may be used for determining if facilities are in 
compliance with the standard. The possession table can only be used if 
the following conditions are met:
    (i) No person lives within 10 meters of any release point; and
    (ii) No milk, meat, or vegetables are produced within 100 meters of 
any release point.
    (b) Procedures described in Reference (1) shall be used to determine 
compliance or exemption from reporting by use of Table 2.

*Radionuclides boiling at 100 [deg]C or less, or exposed to a
  temperature of 100 [deg]C, must be considered a gas. Capsules
  containing radionuclides in liquid or powder form can be considered to
  be solids.
**Mo-99 contained in a generator to produce Technetium-99 can be assumed
  to be a solid.

                    3. Table of Concentration Levels

    (a) Table 2 may be used for determining if facilities are in 
compliance with the standard.
    1. The concentration table as applied to emission estimates can only 
be used if all releases are from point sources and concentrations have 
been measured at the stack or vent using EPA-approved methods, and the 
distance between each stack or vent and the nearest resident is greater 
than 3 times the diameter of the stack or vent. Procedures provided in 
Ref. (1) shall be used to determine compliance or exemption from 
reporting by use of Table 2.
    2. The concentration table may be used to determine compliance with 
the standard based on environmental measurements provided these 
measurements are made in conformance with the requirements of Sec. 
61.107(b)(5).

                         4. NCRP Screening Model

    The procedures described in Reference (4) may be used to determine 
doses to members of the general public from emissions of radionuclides 
to the atmosphere. Both the total dose from all radionuclides emitted, 
and the dose caused by radioactive iodine must be considered in 
accordance with the procedures in Ref. (1).

                       5. The COMPLY Computer Code

    The COMPLY computer code may be used to determine compliance with 
subpart I. The compliance model in the COMPLY computer code may be used 
to determine the dose to members of the general public from emissions of 
radionuclides to the atmosphere. The EPA may add radionuclides to all or 
any part of COMPLY to cover radionuclides that may be used by the 
regulated community.

<R05>
Sec. 62.01  Definitions.

    As used in this part, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act and in part 60 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 62.02  Introduction.

    (a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and 
disapproval of State plans for the control of pollutants and facilities 
under section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act, and the 
Administrator's promulgation of such plans or portions of plans thereof. 
Approval of a plan or any portion of a plan is based on a determination 
by the Administrator that it meets the requirements of section 111(d), 
and section 129 as applicable, of the Act and provisions of part 60 of 
this chapter.
    (b)(1) If a State does not submit a complete, approvable plan, the 
Administrator may then promulgate a substitute plan or part of a plan. 
The promulgated provision, plus the approved parts of the State plan, 
constitute the applicable plan for purposes of the act.
    (2) The part 60 subpart A of this chapter general provisions and 
appendices to part 60 apply to part 62, except as follows: 40 CFR 
60.7(a)(1), 60.7(a)(3), and 60.8(a) and where special provisions set 
forth under the applicable subpart of this part shall apply instead of 
any conflicting provisions.
    (c) The Administrator will promulgate substitute provisions for the 
disapproved regulatory provisions only. If a nonregulatory provision is 
disapproved, however, it will be noted in this part and a detailed 
explanation will be sent to the State.
    (d) All approved regulatory provisions of each plan are incorporated 
by reference in this part. Section 62.12 provides information on 
availability of applicable plans. The Administrator and State and local 
agencies shall enforce (1) regulatory provisions of a plan approved or 
promulgated by the Administrator, and (2) all permit conditions or 
denials issued in carrying out the approved or promulgated regulations 
for the review of designated facilities.
    (e) Each State's plan is dealt with in a separate subpart, with 
separate headings for different pollutants and facilities. The plans 
shall include an introductory section identifying the plan by name and 
the date of its submittal. Additional sections are included as necessary 
to specifically identify disapproved provisions, to set forth reasons 
for disapproval, and to set forth provisions of the plan promulgated by 
the Administrator. Except as otherwise specified, all supplemental 
information submitted to the Administrator with respect to any plan has 
been submitted by the Governor of the State.
    (f) Revisions to applicable plans will be included in this part when 
approved or promulgated by the Administrator.
    (g) Substitute plans promulgated by the Administrator for States 
that do not have approved plans are contained in separate subparts that 
appear after the subparts for States. These Federal plans include 
sections identifying the

[[Page 354]]

applicability of the plan, emission limits, compliance schedules, 
recordkeeping and reporting, performance testing, and monitoring 
requirements.

    The Administrator may, whenever he determines necessary, extend the 
period for submission of any plan or plan revision or portion thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 62.04  Approval status.

    The approval status of each State's plan or portions thereof, are 
set forth in each subpart. All plans are approved unless specifically 
disapproved in the appropriate subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 62.05  Legal authority.

    (a) The Administrator's determination of the absence or inadequacy 
of legal authority required to be included in the plan is set forth in 
each subpart. This includes the legal authority of local agencies and 
State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency 
if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a 
plan or portion thereof.
    (b) No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. 
Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the 
State because of inadequate authority, substitute provisions are 
promulgated by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 62.06  Negative declarations.

    A State may submit to the Administrator a letter certifying that no 
designated facilities exist in the State if such is the case. The 
negative declaration will be in lieu of a plan.


<R05>
Sec. 62.07  Emission standards, compliance schedules.

    (a) In each subpart, emission standards and compliance schedules 
which have been disapproved by the Administrator are identified, and 
those promulgated by the Administrator are set forth.
    (b) The Administrator's approval or promulgation of any compliance 
schedule shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to 
comply with any applicable emission limitation on or after the date for 
final compliance specified in the applicable schedule.


<R05>
Sec. 62.08  Emission inventories and source surveillance.

    (a) Each subpart identifies the plan provisions for source 
surveillance which are disapproved, and sets forth the Administrator's 
promulgation of necessary provisions for requiring designated sources to 
maintain records, make reports, and submit information.
    (b) The Administrator will not promulgate provisions for disapproved 
State or local agency procedures for testing, inspection, investigation, 
or detection. However, detailed critiques of such portions will be 
provided to the State.


<R05>
Sec. 62.09  Revision of plans by Administrator.

    After notice and opportunity for public hearing in each affected 
State, the Administrator may revise any provision of an applicable plan 
if:
    (a) The provision was promulgated by the Administrator and
    (b) The plan, as revised, will be consistent with the Act and with 
the requirements of part 60, subpart B of this chapter.


<R05>

subpart HHH; and ``Federal Plan Requirements for Small Municipal Waste 
Combustion Units Constructed on or Before August 30, 1999,'' 40 CFR part 
62, subpart JJJ.
    (b) Identification of sources: The three Federal plans apply to 
existing facilities as follows: MSW Landfills which commenced 
construction, reconstruction, or modification before May 30, 1991 and a 
MSW Landfill that has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987 
or the landfill has additional capacity for future waste deposition; 
HMIWIs that combust any amount of hospital, medical or infectious waste 
and that commenced construction on or before June 20, 1996; and Small 
MWCs with a capacity to combust at least 35 tons per day of municipal 
solid waste or refuse-derived fuel but no more than 250 tons per day of 
municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel and if the Small MWC 
commenced construction on or before August 30, 1999.
    (c) On April 24, 2006, EPA prepared and signed Memorandums of 
Agreement (MOAs) between EPA and NJDEP that define the policies, 
responsibilities and procedures pursuant to the three Federal plans 
identified in (a) above by which the Federal plans will be administered 
by both NJDEP and EPA. On May 15, 2006, Lisa P. Jackson, NJDEP 
Commissioner, signed the MOAs, therefore agreeing to the terms and 
conditions of the MOAs and accepting responsibility to enforce and 
implement the policies, responsibilities, and procedures for MSW 
Landfills, HMIWIs and Small MWCs.

Sec. 62.14100  Scope and delegation of authority.

    (a) This subpart contains emission requirements and compliance 
schedules for the control of pollutants from certain municipal waste 
combustors in accordance with section 111(d) and section 129 of the 
Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subparts B and Cb. This municipal 
waste combustor Federal plan applies to each affected facility as 
defined in Sec. 62.14102 that is not covered by an EPA approved and 
currently effective State or Tribal plan. This Federal plan, or portions 
thereof, also applies to each affected facility in any State whose 
approved State plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part. This 
Federal plan, or portions thereof, also applies to each affected 
facility located in Indian country if the approved Tribal plan for that 
area is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.
    (b) The following authorities shall be retained by the EPA 
Administrator and not transferred to the State upon delegation of 
authority to the State to implement and enforce the Federal plan:
    (1) An alternative emission standard;
    (2) Major alternatives to test methods;
    (3) Major alternatives to monitoring;
    (4) Waiver of recordkeeping; and
    (5) Waiver of training requirement for chief facility operators, 
shift supervisors, and control room operators who have obtained 
provisional certification on or before the effective date of this 
subpart, as provided in Sec. 62.14105(d)(2) of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14101  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given to 
them in the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subparts A, B, and Eb.
    Contract means a legally binding agreement or obligation that cannot 
be canceled or modified without substantial financial loss.
    De-rate means to make a permanent physical change to the municipal 
waste combustor unit that reduces the maximum combustion capacity of the 
unit to less than or equal to 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste. 
A permit restriction or a change in the method of operation does not 
qualify as de-rating. (See the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(j) 
of subpart Eb for calculating municipal waste combustor unit capacity.)
    EPA approved State plan means a State plan that EPA has reviewed and 
approved based on the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B to 
implement and enforce 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cb. An approved State plan 
becomes effective on the date specified in the notice published in the 
Federal Register announcing EPA's approval.
    Municipal waste combustor plant means one or more affected 
facilities (as defined in Sec. 62.14102) at the same location.
    Protectorate means American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the 
Virgin Islands.
    State means any of the 50 United States and the protectorates of the 
United States.

[[Page 430]]

    State plan means a plan submitted pursuant to section 111(d) and 
section 129(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subpart B 
that implements and enforces 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cb.
    Tribal plan means a plan submitted by a Tribal Authority pursuant to 
40 CFR parts 9, 35, 49, 50, and 81 that implements and enforces 40 CFR 
part 60, subpart Cb.

Sec. 62.14102  Affected facilities.

    (a) The affected facility to which this subpart applies is each 
municipal waste combustor unit with a capacity to combust greater than 
250 tons per day of municipal solid waste for which construction was 
commenced on or before September 20, 1994 that is not regulated by an 
EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan. Table 1 of 
this subpart lists those units regulated by an EPA approved State plan. 
Notwithstanding the exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, this subpart 
applies to affected facilities not regulated by an EPA approved and 
currently effective State or Tribal plan.
    (b) A municipal waste combustor unit regulated by an EPA approved 
and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not regulated by this 
subpart.
    (c) Any municipal waste combustor unit that has the capacity to 
combust more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste and is 
subject to a Federally enforceable permit limiting the maximum amount of 
municipal solid waste that may be combusted in the unit to less than 11 
tons per day is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator:
    (1) Notifies the EPA Administrator of an exemption claim;
    (2) Provides a copy of the Federally enforceable permit that limits 
the firing of municipal solid waste to less than 11 tons per day; and
    (3) Keeps records of the amount of municipal solid waste fired on a 
daily basis.
    (d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal 
waste combustor unit primarily for the purpose of complying with the 
emission requirements of this subpart are not considered in determining 
whether the unit is a modified or reconstructed facility under 40 CFR 
part 60, subpart Ea or subpart Eb.
    (e) A qualifying small power production facility, as defined in 
section 3(17)(C) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(17)(C)), that 
burns homogeneous waste (such as automotive tires or used oil, but not 
including refuse-derived fuel) for the production of electric energy is 
not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the facility 
notifies the EPA Administrator of this exemption and provides data 
documenting that the facility qualifies for this exemption.
    (f) A qualifying cogeneration facility, as defined in section 
3(18)(B) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(18)(B)), that burns 
homogeneous waste (such as automotive tires or used oil, but not 
including refuse-derived fuel) for the production of electric energy and 
steam or forms of useful energy (such as heat) that are used for 
industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes, is not subject to 
this subpart if the owner or operator of the facility notifies the EPA 
Administrator of this exemption and provides data documenting that the 
facility qualifies for this exemption.
    (g) Any unit combusting a single-item waste stream of tires is not 
subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the unit:
    (1) Notifies the EPA Administrator of an exemption claim; and
    (2) Provides data documenting that the unit qualifies for this 
exemption.
    (h) Any unit required to have a permit under section 3005 of the 
Solid Waste Disposal Act is not subject to this subpart.
    (i) Any materials recovery facility (including primary or secondary 
smelters) that combusts waste for the primary purpose of recovering 
metals is not subject to this subpart.
    (j) Any cofired combustor, as defined under 40 CFR 60.51b of subpart 
Eb that meets the capacity specifications in paragraph (a) of this 
section is not subject to this subpart if the owner or operator of the 
cofired combustor:
    (1) Notifies the EPA Administrator of an exemption claim;
    (2) Provides a copy of the Federally enforceable permit (specified 
in the

[[Page 431]]

than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter total mass, 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen for all affected facilities located within 
a municipal waste combustor plant, the owner or operator of the 
municipal waste combustor plant may elect to conduct annual performance 
tests for one affected facility (i.e., unit) per year at the municipal 
waste combustor plant. At a minimum, a performance test for dioxin/furan 
emissions shall be conducted annually (no more than 12 months following 
the previous performance test) for one affected facility at the 
municipal waste combustor plant. Each year a different affected facility 
at the municipal waste combustor plant shall be tested, and the affected 
facilities at the plant shall be tested in sequence (e.g., unit 1, unit 
2, unit 3, as applicable). If each annual performance test continues to 
indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 
nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), the owner or 
operator may continue conducting a performance test on only one affected 
facility per year. If any annual performance test indicates a dioxin/
furan emission level greater than 15 nanograms per dry standrd cubic 
meter (total mass), performance tests thereafter shall be conducted 
annually on all affected facilities at the plant until and unless all 
annual performance tests for all affected facilities at the plant over a 
2-year period indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal 
to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass).
    (2) The owner or operator who is following the alternative 
performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section may choose an alternative testing 
sequence (e.g., unit 1, 3, 2, 4) for affected facilities at the 
municipal waste combustor plant. The owner or operator must submit a 
request to EPA for approval of the alternative testing sequence. After 
approval, the alternative testing sequence is effective until a 
different testing sequence is received and approved by EPA.

Sec. 62.14350  Scope and delegation of authority.

    (a) This subpart contains emission requirements and compliance 
schedules for the control of designated pollutants from certain 
municipal solid waste landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the 
Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subpart B. This municipal solid waste 
landfills Federal plan applies to each designated facility as defined in 
Sec. 62.14352 of this subpart that is not covered by an EPA approved 
and currently effective State or Tribal plan.
    (b) The following authorities shall be retained by the Administrator 
and not transferred to the State or Tribe upon delegation of authority 
to the State or Tribe to implement and enforce the Federal plan pursuant 
to sections 101(a)(3) and 111 of the Clean Air Act:
    (1) Approval of alternative methods to determine site-specific NMOC 
concentration (C <INF>NMOC</INF>) or site-specific methane generation 
rate constant (k) used in calculating the annual NMOC emission rate (as 
provided in 40 CFR 60.754(a)(5) of subpart WWW),
    (2) Alternative emission standards,
    (3) Major alternatives \1\ to test methods,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Major changes to test methods or to monitoring are modifications 
made to a federally enforceable test method or to a federal monitoring 
requirement. These changes would involve the use of unproven technology 
or procedures or an entirely new method (which is sometimes necessary 
when the required test method or monitoring requirement is unsuitable).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Major alternatives to monitoring, or
    (5) Waivers of recordkeeping.

Sec. 62.14351  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given 
them in the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subparts A, B, and WWW.
    Achieve final compliance means to connect and operate the collection 
and control system as specified in the final control plan. Within 180 
days after the date the landfill is required to achieve final 
compliance, the initial performance test must be conducted.
    Award contract means the MSW landfill owner or operator enters into 
legally binding agreements or contractual obligations that cannot be 
canceled or modified without substantial financial loss to the MSW 
landfill owner or operator. The MSW landfill owner or operator may award 
a number of contracts to install the collection and control system. To 
meet this increment of progress, the MSW landfill owner or operator must 
award a contract or contracts to initiate on-site construction or 
installation of the collection and control system.
    Complete on-site construction means that all necessary collection 
system components and air pollution control devices identified in the 
final control plan are on site, in place, and ready for operation.
    Design capacity means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill 
can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent 
permit issued by the State, local, or Tribal agency responsible for 
regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in 
the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the 
design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to 
demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 
2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific 
density, which must be recalculated annually.
    EPA approved State plan means a State plan that EPA has approved 
based on the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B to implement and 
enforce 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc. An approved State plan becomes 
effective on the date specified in the notice published in the Federal 
Register announcing EPA's approval.
    Federal Indian Reservation means for purposes of the Clean Air Act, 
all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the 
jurisdiction of the

[[Page 442]]

United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, 
and including rights-of-way running through the reservation.
    Final control plan (Collection and control system design plan) means 
a plan that describes the collection and control system that will 
capture the gas generated within an MSW landfill. The collection and 
control system design plan must be prepared by a professional engineer 
and must describe a collection and control system that meets the 
requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(ii). The final control plan must 
contain engineering specifications and drawings of the collection and 
control system. The final control plan must include any alternatives to 
the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance 
measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of 40 CFR 
60.753 through 60.758 proposed by the owner or operator. The final 
control plan must either conform with the specifications for active 
collection systems in 40 CFR 60.759 or include a demonstration that 
shows that based on the size of the landfill and the amount of waste 
expected to be accepted, the system is sized properly to collect the 
gas, control emissions of NMOC to the required level and meet the 
operational standards for a landfill.
    Indian Country means all land within the limits of any Indian 
reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, 
notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way 
running through the reservation; all dependent Indian communities within 
the borders of the United States whether within the original or 
subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without 
the limits of a State; and all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to 
which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running 
through the same.
    Initiate on-site construction means to begin any of the following: 
installation of the collection and control system to be used to comply 
with the emission limits as outlined in the final control plan; physical 
preparation necessary for the installation of the collection and control 
system to be used to comply with the final emission limits as outlined 
in the final control plan; or, alteration of an existing collection and 
control system to be used to comply with the final emission limits as 
outlined in the final control plan.
    Modification means an increase in the permitted volume design 
capacity of the landfill by either horizontal or vertical expansion 
based on its permitted design capacity as of May 30, 1991. Modification 
does not occur until the owner or operator commences construction on the 
horizontal or vertical expansion.
    Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire 
disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household 
waste is placed in or on land. A municipal solid waste landfill may also 
receive other types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes such as commercial solid 
waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of a municipal 
solid waste landfill may be separated by access roads. A municipal solid 
waste landfill may be publicly or privately owned.
    Negative declaration letter means a letter to EPA declaring that 
there are no existing MSW landfills in the State or that there are no 
existing MSW landfills in the State that must install collection and 
control systems according to the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart 
Cc. The negative declaration letter must include the design capacities 
of any existing MSW landfills with a design capacity less than 2.5 
million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters.

<R05>
Sec. 62.14352  Designated facilities.

    (a) The designated facility to which this subpart applies is each 
municipal solid waste landfill in all States, protectorates, and Indian 
Country that meets the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, except for landfills exempted by paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section.
    (1) The municipal solid waste landfill commenced construction, 
reconstruction, or modification before May 30, 1991 (landfills that 
commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 
30, 1991 are subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW), and
    (2) The municipal solid waste landfill has accepted waste at any 
time since November 8, 1987 or the landfill has additional capacity for 
future waste deposition.
    (b) A municipal solid waste landfill regulated by an EPA approved 
and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not subject to the 
requirements of this subpart. States that have an approved and effective 
State plan are listed in table 1 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the 
exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, any MSW landfill located in a 
State or portion of Indian country that does not have an EPA approved 
and currently effective State or Tribal plan is subject to the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (c) A municipal solid waste landfill located in a State, locality, 
or portion of Indian country that submitted a negative declaration 
letter is not subject to the requirements of this subpart other than the 
requirements in the definition of design capacity to recalculate the 
site-specific density annually and in Sec. 62.14355 to submit an 
amended design capacity report in the event that the recalculated design 
capacity is equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 
million cubic meters. However, if the existing municipal solid waste 
landfill already has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 
million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, then it is subject to 
the requirements of the Federal plan. States, localities, or portions of 
Indian country that submitted negative declaration letters are listed in 
table 2 of this subpart.
    (d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal 
solid waste landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not 
considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an 
existing municipal solid waste landfill to the requirements of 40 CFR 
part 60, subpart WWW.
    (e) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of 
the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste 
landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 
million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the 
requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 
or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to 
either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application 
for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a 
municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design 
capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million 
cubic meters on January 7, 2,000 and not otherwise subject to either 
part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of Sec. 
70.5(a)(1)(i) or Sec. 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter April 6, 2000, even 
if the initial design capacity report is submitted earlier. In addition, 
the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to 
this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 
2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2000, and not otherwise subject 
to either part 70 or 71, but whose design capacity subsequently 
increases to equal or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic 
meters by a change that is not a modification or reconstruction becomes 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 70.5(a)(1)(i) or Sec. 
71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter upon the date the amended design capacity 
report is due.
    (f) When a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart is 
closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to 
maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the 
landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of 
either

[[Page 444]]

part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control 
system under Sec. 62.14353 of this subpart; or
    (2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system 
removal specified in 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(v).


<R05>
Sec. 62.14353  Standards for municipal solid waste landfill emissions.

    (a) The owner or operator of a designated facility having a design 
capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters 
must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(a) in addition to the 
applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements specified in this 
subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator of a designated facility having a design 
capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million 
cubic meters must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(b) in 
addition to the applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements 
specified in this subpart.


<R05>

for a designated facility is due within 90 days of the effective date of 
this subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator of a designated facility must submit 
notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of 
completing each increment of progress. Each notification must indicate 
which increment of progress specified in Sec. 62.14356(a)(1) through 
(a)(5) of this subpart has been achieved. The notification must be 
signed by the owner or operator of the landfill.
    (1) For the first increment of progress, the final control plan 
(collection and control system design plan) must be submitted in 
addition to the notification. A copy of the design plan must also be 
kept on site at the landfill.
    (2) For the second increment of progress, a signed copy of the 
contract(s) awarded must be submitted in addition to the notification.
    (c) The owner or operator of a designated facility who fails to meet

control authority) that is submitting alternative dates for increments 2 
and 3 according to Sec. 62.14356(d) of this subpart must do so by the 
date specified for

[[Page 445]]

submitting the final control plan. The date for submitting the final 
control plan is specified in Sec. 62.14356(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this 
subpart, as applicable. The owner or operator (or the State or Tribal 
air pollution control authority) must submit a justification if any of 
the alternative dates are later than the increment dates in table 3 of 
this subpart. In addition to submitting the alternative dates to the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator must also submit 
the alternative dates to the State.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14356  Compliance schedules and increments of progress.

    (a) Increments of progress. The owner or operator of a designated 
facility that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million 
megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters and a nonmethane organic compound 
emission rate greater than or equal to 50 megagrams per year must 
achieve the increments of progress specified in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(5) of this section to install air pollution control devices 
to meet the emission standards specified in Sec. 62.14353(b) of this 
subpart. (Refer to Sec. 62.14351 for a definition of each increment of 
progress.)
    (1) Submit control plan: Submit a final control plan (collection and 
control system design plan) according to the requirements of Sec. 
62.14353(b) of this subpart and 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2).

equipment as described in the EPA-approved final control plan.
    (4) Complete on-site construction: Complete on-site construction and 
installation of emission collection and/or control equipment.
    (5) Achieve final compliance: Complete construction in accordance 
with the design specified in the EPA-approved final control plan and 
connect the landfill gas collection system and air pollution control 
equipment such that they are fully operating. The initial performance 
test must be conducted within 180 days after the date the facility is 
required to achieve final compliance.
    (b) Compliance date. For each designated facility that has a design 
capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million 
cubic meters and a nonmethane organic compound emission rate greater 
than or equal to 50 Mg per year, planning, awarding of contracts, and 
installation of municipal solid waste landfill air emission collection 
and control equipment capable of meeting the standards in Sec. 
62.14353(b) must be accomplished within 30 months after the date the 
initial emission rate report (or the annual emission rate report) first 
shows that the nonmethane organic compounds emission rate equals or 
exceeds 50 megagrams per year.
    (c) Compliance schedules. The owner or operator of a designated 
facility that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million 
megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters and a nonmethane organic compound 
emission rate greater than or equal to 50 megagrams per year must 
achieve the increments of progress specified in paragraphs (a)(1)

develop your waste management plan it should identify, where possible, 
reasonably available additional waste management measures, taking into 
account the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, 
the costs of additional measures, the emission reductions expected to be 
achieved, and any other potential environmental or energy impacts they 
might have. In developing your waste management plan, you must consider 
the American Hospital Association publication entitled ``Ounce of 
Prevention: Waste Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities.'' 
This publication (AHA Catalog No. 057007) is available for purchase from

Sec. 62.14451  What are the testing requirements for HMIWI that
are not small rural?

    (a) If you operate an HMIWI that is not a small rural HMIWI, you 
must conduct an initial performance test for PM, opacity, CO, dioxin/
furan, HCl, Pb, Cd, and Hg using the test methods and procedures 
outlined in Sec. 62.14452.

[[Page 452]]

    (b) After the initial performance test is completed or is required 
to be completed under Sec. 62.14470, whichever date comes first, you 
must:
    (1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an 
annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous 
performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods 
listed in Sec. 62.14452.
    (2) Determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emission limits by 
conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following 
the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test 
methods listed in Sec. 62.14452. If all three performance tests over a 
3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit for a 
pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that 
pollutant for the next 2 years. At a minimum, you must conduct a 
performance test for PM, CO, and HCl every third year (no more than 36 
months following the previous performance test). If a performance test 
conducted every third year indicates compliance with the emission limit 
for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for 
that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test 
indicates noncompliance with the respective emission limit, you must 
conduct a performance test for that pollutant annually until all annual 
performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the 
emission limit.
    (c) The EPA Administrator may request a repeat performance test at 
any time.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14452  What test methods and procedures must I use?

    You must use the following test methods and procedures to conduct 
performance tests to determine compliance with the emission limits:
    (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test 
runs conducted under representative operating conditions;
    (b) The minimum sample time must be 1 hour per test run unless 
otherwise indicated in this section;
    (c) You must use EPA Reference Method 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A to select the sampling location and number of traverse points;
    (d) You must use EPA Reference Method 3, 3A, or 3B of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A for gas composition analysis, including measurement of 
oxygen concentration. You must use EPA Reference Method 3, 3A, or 3B of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A simultaneously with each reference method;
    (e) You must adjust pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen 
using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AU00.000

Where:

C<INF>adj</INF> = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas</INF> = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis at 
standard conditions
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen--7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis);
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O<INF>2</INF> = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis at 
standard conditions, percent.

    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, you must 
use EPA Reference Method 5 or 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to 
measure particulate matter emissions;
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, you must 
use EPA Reference Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure 
stack opacity;
    (h) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, you must 
use EPA Reference Method 10 or 10B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to 
measure the CO emissions;
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, you must 
use EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure 
total dioxin/furan emissions. The minimum sample time must be 4 hours 
per test run. If you have selected the toxic equivalency standards for 
dioxin/furans under Sec. 62.14411, you must use the following 
procedures to determine compliance:

[[Page 453]]

    (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through 
octa-congener emitted using EPA Reference Method 23;
    (2) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section, multiply the congener concentration by 
its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 2 of this 
subpart;
    (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) 
of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans 
emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
    (j) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, you must 
use EPA Reference Method 26 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure HCl 
emissions. If you have selected the percentage reduction standards for 
HCl under Sec. 62.14411, compute the percentage reduction in HCl 
emissions (%R<INF>HCl</INF>) using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AU00.001

Where:

%R<INF>HCl</INF> = percentage reduction of HCl emissions achieved;
E<INF>i</INF> = HCl emission concentration measured at the control 
device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis at standard 
conditions); and
E<INF>o</INF> = HCl emission concentration measured at the control 
device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis at standard 
conditions).

    (k) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, you must 
use EPA Reference Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to measure Pb, 
Cd, and Hg emissions. If you have selected the percentage reduction 
standards for metals under Sec. 62.14411, compute the percentage 
reduction in emissions (%R<INF>metal</INF>) using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AU00.002

Where:

%R<INF>metal</INF> = percentage reduction of metal emission (Pb, Cd, or 
Hg) achieved;
E<INF>i</INF> = metal emission concentration (Pb, Cd, or Hg) measured at 
the control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis at 
standard conditions); and
E<INF>o</INF> = metal emission concentration (Pb, Cd, or Hg) measured at 
the control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis at 
standard conditions).

    (l) If you are using a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) 
to demonstrate compliance with any of the emission limits under 
Sec. Sec. 62.14411 or 62.14412, you must:
    (1) Determine compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) 
using a 12-hour rolling average, calculated each hour as the average of 
the previous 12 operating hours (not including startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction). Performance tests using EPA Reference Methods are not 
required for pollutants monitored with CEMS.
    (2) Operate a CEMS to measure oxygen concentration, adjusting 
pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen as specified in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (3) Operate all CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures 
under appendices B and F of 40 CFR part 60.
    (m) Use of the bypass stack during a performance test will 
invalidate the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14453  What must I monitor?

    (a) If your HMIWI is a small rural HMIWI, or your HMIWI is equipped 
with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter, a wet scrubber, or a 
dry

[[Page 454]]

scrubber followed by a fabric filter and wet scrubber:
    (1) You must establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating 
parameters, indicated in Table 3, as site-specific operating parameters 
during the initial performance test to determine compliance with the 
emission limits; and
    (2) After the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 62.14470, whichever 
comes first, your HMIWI must not operate above any of the applicable 
maximum operating parameters or below any of the applicable minimum 
operating parameters listed in Table 3 and measured as 3-hour rolling 
averages (calculated each hour as the average of the previous 3 
operating hours), at all times except during startup, shutdown, 
malfunction, and performance tests.
    (b) If your HMIWI is not a small rural HMIWI, and you are using an 
air pollution control device other than a dry scrubber followed by a 
fabric filter, a wet scrubber, or a dry scrubber followed by a fabric 
filter and a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limits under Sec. 
62.14411, you must petition the EPA Administrator for site-specific 
operating parameters to be established during the initial performance 
test and you must continuously monitor those parameters thereafter. You 
may not conduct the initial performance test until the EPA Administrator 
has approved the petition.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14454  How must I monitor the required parameters?

    (a) You must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), 
maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the 
applicable maximum and minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 of 
this subpart such that these devices (or methods) measure and record 
values for the operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in 
Table 3 of this subpart at all times except during periods of startup 
and shutdown. For charge rate, the device must measure and record the 
date, time, and weight of each charge fed to the HMIWI. This must be 
done automatically, meaning that the only intervention from an operator 
during the process would be to load the charge onto the weighing device. 
For batch HMIWI, the maximum charge rate is measured on a daily basis 
(the amount of waste charged to the unit each day).
    (b) For all HMIWI except small rural HMIWI, you must install, 
calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate a 
device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack, including 
the date, time, and duration of such use.
    (c) For all HMIWI except small rural HMIWI, if you are using 
controls other than a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter, a wet 
scrubber, or a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter and a wet 
scrubber to comply with the emission limits under Sec. 62.14411, you 
must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, 
and operate the equipment necessary to monitor the site-specific 
operating parameters developed pursuant to Sec. 62.14453(b).
    (d) You must obtain monitoring data at all times during HMIWI 
operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction, 
calibration, or repair. At a minimum, valid monitoring data must be 
obtained for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of 
the operating days per calendar quarter that your HMIWI is combusting 
hospital waste and/or medical/infectious waste.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14455  What if my HMIWI goes outside of a parameter limit?

    (a) Operation above the established maximum or below the established 
minimum operating parameter(s) constitutes a violation of established 
operating parameter(s). Operating parameter limits do not apply during 
startup, shutdown, malfunction, and performance tests.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, if 
your HMIWI is a small rural HMIWI,

                          Permitting Obligation


<R05>
Sec. 62.14480  Does this subpart require me to obtain an operating 
permit under title V of the Clean Air Act and implementing 

regulations?

    This subpart requires you to obtain an operating permit under title 
V of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations (``title V permit'') 
unless you are only subject to the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements listed at Sec. 62.14400(b)(1) or (b)(2), and Sec. 
62.14400(c), of this subpart. Also, if you own or operate a unit 
described in Sec. 62.14400(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5) or (b)(6), you are not 
subject to any requirements of this subpart; therefore, this subpart 
does not require you to obtain a title V permit.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14481  When must I submit a title V permit application for my HMIWI?

    You must submit a title V permit application in time for it to be 
determined or deemed complete by no later than September 15, 2000 or by 
the effective date of a title V permits program in the jurisdiction in 
which the unit is located, whichever is later. (An earlier deadline may 
apply if your HMIWI is also subject to title V permitting requirements 
because of some other triggering requirement.) A ``complete'' title V 
permit application is one that has been approved by the appropriate 
permitting authority as complete

[[Page 461]]

under Section 503 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR parts 70 and 71. It is 
not enough to have submitted a title V permit application by September 
15, 2000 because the application must be determined or deemed complete 
by the permitting authority by that date for your HMIWI to operate after 
that date in compliance with Federal law.

  Subpart III_Federal Plan Requirements for Commercial and Industrial 
Solid Waste Incineration Units That Commenced Construction On or Before 
                            November 30, 1999

    Source: 68 FR 57539, Oct. 3, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 62.14500  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    (a) This subpart establishes emission requirements and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from commercial and industrial 
solid waste incineration (CISWI) units that are not covered by an EPA 
approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan. The pollutants 
addressed by these emission requirements are listed in Table 1 of this 
subpart. These emission requirements are developed in accordance with 
sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of 40 CFR part 
60.
    (b) In this subpart, ``you'' means the owner or operator of a CISWI 
unit.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14505  What are the principal components of this subpart?

    This subpart contains the eleven major components listed in 
paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section.
    (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
    (b) Waste management plan.
    (c) Operator training and qualification.
    (d) Emission limitations and operating limits.
    (e) Performance testing.
    (f) Initial compliance requirements.
    (g) Continuous compliance requirements.
    (h) Monitoring.
    (i) Recordkeeping and reporting.
    (j) Definitions.
    (k) Tables.

                              Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 62.14510  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a CISWI 
unit as defined in Sec. 62.14840 and the CISWI unit meets the criteria 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.

[[Page 468]]

    (1) Construction of your CISWI unit commenced on or before November 
30, 1999.
    (2) Your CISWI unit is not exempt under Sec. 62.14525.
    (3) Your CISWI unit is not regulated by an EPA approved and 
currently effective State or Tribal plan, or your CISWI unit is located 
in any State whose approved State or Tribal plan is subsequently vacated 
in whole or in part.
    (b) If you made changes after June 1, 2001 that meet the definition 
of modification or reconstruction after promulgation of the final 40 CFR 
part 60 subpart CCCC (New Source Performance Standards for Commercial 
and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units), your CISWI unit is 
subject to subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60 and this subpart no longer 
applies to that unit.
    (c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing 
CISWI unit primarily to comply with this subpart, then such changes do 
not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart CCCC of 40 
CFR part 60.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14515  Can my CISWI unit be covered by both a State plan
and this subpart?

    (a) If your CISWI unit is located in a State that does not have an 
EPA-approved State plan or your State's plan has not become effective, 
this subpart applies to your CISWI unit until the EPA approves a State 
plan that covers your CISWI unit and that State plan becomes effective. 
However, a State may enforce the requirements of a State regulation 
while your CISWI unit is still subject to this subpart.
    (b) After the EPA approves a State plan covering your CISWI unit, 
and after that State plan becomes effective, you will no longer be 
subject to this subpart and will only be subject to the approved and 
effective State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14520  How do I determine if my CISWI unit is covered by an 
approved and effective State or Tribal plan?

    This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of State and Tribal areas 
with approved Clean Air Act section 111(d) and section 129 plans along 
with the effective dates for such plans. The list is published annually. 
If this part does not indicate that your State or Tribal area has an 
approved and effective plan, you should contact your State environmental 
agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if the 
EPA has approved a State plan covering your unit since publication of 
the most recent version of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14521  If my CISWI unit is not listed in the Federal plan 
inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?

    If a CISWI unit is not listed in the Federal plan inventory, it is 
not necessarily exempt from this subpart. Sources subject to this 
subpart are not limited to the inventory of sources listed in Docket A-
2000-52 for the Federal plan. If your CISWI units meets the 
applicability criteria in Sec. 62.14510, this subpart applies to you 
whether or not your unit is listed in the Federal plan inventory in the 
docket.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14525  Can my combustion unit be exempt from this subpart?

    This subpart exempts 15 types of units described in paragraphs (a) 
through (o) of this section from complying with the requirements of this 
subpart except for the requirements specified in this section and in 
Sec. 62.14531.
    (a) Pathological waste incineration units. Incineration units

<R05>
Sec. 62.14625  What if all the qualified operators are temporarily
not accessible?

    If all qualified operators are temporarily not accessible (i.e., not 
at the facility and not able to be at the facility within 1 hour), you 
must meet one of the two criteria specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator 
is not accessible.
    (a) When all qualified operators are not accessible for more than 8 
hours, but less than 2 weeks, the CISWI unit may be operated by other 
plant personnel familiar with the operation of the CISWI unit who have 
completed a review of the information specified in Sec. 62.14620(a) 
within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when all 
qualified operators were not accessible and include this deviation in 
the annual report as specified under Sec. 62.14730.
    (b) When all qualified operators are not accessible for 2 weeks or 
more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 
days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are 
doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you 
anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible.
    (2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks 
outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is 
accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will 
be accessible and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue 
operation of the CISWI unit. You must submit the first status report 4 
weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the Administrator notifies you that 
your request to continue operation of the CISWI unit is disapproved, the 
CISWI unit may continue operation for 90 days, then must cease 
operation. Operation of the unit may resume if you meet the two 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under Sec. 
62.14595(a).
    (ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is 
accessible and that you are resuming operation.

                Emission Limitations and Operating Limits


<R05>
Sec. 62.14630  What emission limitations must I meet and by when?

    You must meet the emission limitations specified in table 1 of this 
subpart by the applicable final compliance date for your CISWI unit.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14635  What operating limits must I meet and by when?

    (a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must establish operating limits for

[[Page 477]]

four operating parameters (as specified in table 2 of this subpart) as 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the 
initial performance test.
    (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different 
procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 
110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission 
limitations.
    (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the 
daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test 
demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is 
calculated as 90 percent of the average pressure drop across the wet 
scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum 
amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the 
average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter 
emission limitations.
    (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as 90 
percent of the average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber 
measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as 90 percent of 
the average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during 
the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the 
hydrogen chloride emission limitation.
    (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the 
initial performance test on the date the initial performance test is 
required or completed (whichever is earlier).
    (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the 
bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of 
the operating time during any 6-month period. In calculating this 
operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter 
demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is 
counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted 
as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate 
corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount 
of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14640  What if I do not use a wet scrubber to comply with
the emission limitations?

    If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet 
scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the 
emission limitations under Sec. 62.14630, you must petition the 
Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the 
initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must 
not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has 
been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five 
items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
additional operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the 
relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
    (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for 
recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these 
parameters.

    (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test 
runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
    (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance 
test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating 
conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as 
required in Sec. 62.14700(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during 
the performance test.
    (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run 
duration specified in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (d) Method 1 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A must be used to select 
the sampling location and number of traverse points.
    (e) Method 3A or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A must be used for 
gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. 
Method 3A or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A must be used 
simultaneously with each method.
    (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be 
adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:

C<INF>adj</INF> = C <INF>meas</INF> (20.9-7)/(20.9-%O<INF>2</INF>) (Eq. 
1)

Where:

C<INF>adj</INF> = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas</INF> = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis);
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O<INF>2</INF> = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.

    (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following 
the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through 
octa-congener emitted using EPA Method 23.
    (2) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, multiply the congener concentration by 
its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 3 of this 
subpart.
    (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans 
emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14655  How are the performance test data used?

    You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart.

                     Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 62.14660  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the 
emission limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 40 
CFR 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in Table 
1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the procedure 
in Sec. 62.14635 or Sec. 62.14640. The initial performance test must 
be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart 
and the procedures in Sec. 62.14650.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14665  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 90 days 
after your final compliance date.

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 62.14670  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the
emission limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate 
matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required 
under 40 CFR 60.8 to determine compliance with the

[[Page 479]]

emission limitations. The annual performance test must be conducted 
using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the 
procedures in Sec. 62.14650.
    (b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 62.14635 or established under Sec. 62.14640. Operation above 
the established maximum or below the established minimum operating 
limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. 
Three-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance 
(except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different 
averaging period is established under Sec. 62.14640. Operating limits 
do not apply during performance tests.
    (c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish 
operating limits during the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14675  By what date must I conduct the annual 
performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, 
hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial 
performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 
months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14680  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant 
(particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive 
years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, 
you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the 
next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year 
and no later than 36 months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to 
conduct performance tests for these pollutants every third year, but 
each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you 
must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all 
performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14685  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish 
new operating limits?

    (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.
    (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is 
different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to 
demonstrate compliance.

you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), 
maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with 
the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in 
Sec. 62.14640.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14695  Is there a minimum amount of monitoring data I must obtain?

    (a) Except for monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments of 
the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring at all times the 
CISWI unit is operating.
    (b) Do not use data recorded during monitor malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities 
for meeting the requirements of this subpart, including data averages 
and calculations. You must use all the data collected during all other 
periods in assessing compliance with the operating limits.

Air Curtain Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Wood Wastes, Clean Lumber 
                            and/or Yard Waste


<R05>
Sec. 62.14765  What is an air curtain incinerator?

    An air curtain incinerator operates by forcefully projecting a 
curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion 
occurs. Incinerators of this type can be constructed above or below 
ground and with or without refractory walls and floor. (Air curtain 
incinerators are different from conventional combustion devices which 
typically have enclosed fireboxes and controlled air technology such as 
mass burn, modular, and fluidized bed combustors.)


<R05>
Sec. 62.14770  When must I achieve final compliance?

    If you plan to continue operating, then you must achieve final 
compliance by October October 4, 2004. It is unlawful for your air 
curtain incinerator to operate after October 4, 2004 if you have not 
achieved final compliance. An air curtain incinerator that continues to 
operate after October 4, 2004 without being in compliance is subject to 
penalties.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14795  How do I achieve final compliance?

    For the final compliance, you must complete all equipment changes 
and retrofit installation control devices so that, when the affected air 
curtain incinerator is placed into service, all necessary equipment and 
air pollution control devices operate as designed and meet the opacity 
limits of Sec. 62.14815.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14805  What must I do if I close my air curtain incinerator
and then restart it?

    (a) If you close your incinerator but will reopen it prior to the 
final compliance date in this subpart, you must achieve final compliance 
by October 4, 2004.
    (b) If you close your incinerator but will restart it after October 
4, 2004, you must have completed any needed emission control retrofits 
and meet the opacity limits of Sec. 62.14815 on the date your 
incinerator restarts operation.
    (c) You are subject to the operating permit requirements of title V 
of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70 or 71 until you close your air curtain 
incinerator and at the time you restart it.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14810  What must I do if I plan to permanently close my air 
curtain incinerator and not restart it?

    If you plan to permanently close your incinerator rather than comply 
with this subpart, you must submit a closure notification, including the 
date of closure, to the Administrator by March 31, 2004. In addition, 
while still in operation, your air curtain incinerator is subject to the 
same requirement

[[Page 484]]

to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit that applies to an 
air curtain incinerator that will not be permanently closing.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14815  What are the emission limitations for air curtain 
incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean 

lumber and/or yard waste?

    (a) After the date the initial test for opacity is required or 
completed (whichever is earlier), you must meet the limitations in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) The opacity limitation is 10 percent (6-minute average), except 
as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) The opacity limitation is 35 percent (6-minute average) during 
the startup period that is within the first 30 minutes of operation.
    (b) Except during malfunctions, the requirements of this subpart 
apply at all times, and each malfunction must not exceed 3 hours.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14820  How must I monitor opacity for air curtain 
incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber,

and/or yard waste?

    (a) Use Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A to determine 
compliance with the opacity limitation.
    (b) Conduct an initial test for opacity as specified in Sec. 60.8 
no later than January 2, 2005.
    (c) After the initial test for opacity, conduct annual tests no more 
than 12 calendar months following the date of your previous test.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14825  What are the recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean

lumber, and/or yard   waste?

    (a) Keep records of results of all initial and annual opacity tests 
onsite in either paper copy or electronic format, unless the 
Administrator approves another format, for at least 5 years.
    (b) Make all records available for submittal to the Administrator or 
for an inspector's onsite review.
    (c) Submit an initial report no later than 60 days following the 
initial opacity test that includes the information specified in

    Source: 68 FR 5158, Jan. 31, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 62.15000  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    (a) This subpart establishes emission requirements and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from existing small municipal 
waste combustion units that are not covered by an EPA approved and 
effective State plan. The pollutants addressed by these emission 
requirements are listed in tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. These 
emission requirements are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) 
and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of 40 CFR part 60.
    (b) In this subpart, ``you'' means the owner or operator of a small 
municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15005  What are the principal components of this subpart?

    This subpart contains five major components:
    (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
    (b) Good combustion practices:
    (1) Operator training.
    (2) Operator certification.
    (3) Operating requirements.
    (c) Emission limits.
    (d) Monitoring and stack testing.
    (e) Recordkeeping and reporting.

                      Applicability of this Subpart


<R05>
Sec. 62.15010  Is my municipal waste combustion unit covered by
this subpart?

    (a) This subpart applies to your small municipal waste combustion 
unit if the unit meets the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) and 
the criteria in either paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section:
    (1) Your municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust 
at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel 
but no more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-
derived fuel.
    (2) Your municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on 
or before August 30, 1999.
    (3) Your municipal waste combustion unit is not regulated by an EPA 
approved and effective State or Tribal plan.
    (4) Your municipal waste combustion unit is located in any State 
whose approved State plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part, 
or the municipal waste combustion unit is located in Indian country if 
the approved tribal plan for that area is subsequently vacated in whole 
or in part.
    (b) If you make a change to your municipal waste combustion unit 
that meets the definition of modification or reconstruction after June 
6, 2001, your municipal waste combustion unit becomes subject to subpart 
AAAA of 40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards for Small 
Municipal Waste Combustion Units) and this subpart no longer applies to 
your unit.
    (c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing 
municipal waste combustion unit primarily to comply with this subpart, 
then subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards 
for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to your unit. 
Such changes do not constitute modifications or reconstructions under 
subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60.
    (d) Upon approval of the State or tribal plan, this subpart will no 
longer apply, except for the provisions of this subpart that may have 
been incorporated by reference under the State or Tribal plan, or 
delegated to the State by the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15015  Can my small municipal waste combustion unit be 
covered by both a State plan and this subpart?

    (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit is located in a State 
that has a State plan that has not been approved by the EPA or has not 
become effective, then this subpart applies and the State plan would not 
apply to your municipal waste combustion unit. However, the State could 
enforce the requirements of a State regulation

[[Page 492]]

while your municipal waste combustion unit is still subject to this 
subpart.
    (b) After the State plan is approved by the EPA and becomes 
effective, your municipal waste combustion unit is no longer subject to 
this subpart and will only be subject to the approved and effective 
State plan.

to this subpart.
    (e) You must comply with the requirements specified in Sec. 
62.15395 and Sec. 62.15400 regarding title V permitting. If you comply 
with all of the requirements specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) 
of this section, you are no longer subject to title V permitting 
requirements as a result of this subpart. You will remain subject to 
title V permitting requirements, however, if you are subject as a result 
of one or more of the applicability criteria in 40 CFR 70.3(a) and (b) 
or 71.3(a) and (b).


<R05>
Sec. 62.15035  Is my small municipal waste combustion unit subject
to different requirements based on plant capacity?

    This subpart specifies different requirements for two different 
subcategories of municipal waste combustion units. These two 
subcategories are based on aggregate capacity of the municipal waste 
combustion plant as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 62.15135  After the required date for operator certification, 
who may operate the municipal waste combustion unit?

    After the required date for full or provisional certification, you 
must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit unless one of four 
employees is on duty:
    (a) A fully certified chief facility operator.
    (b) A provisionally certified chief facility operator who is 
scheduled to take the full certification exam.
    (c) A fully certified shift supervisor.
    (d) A provisionally certified shift supervisor who is scheduled to 
take the full certification exam.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15140  What if all the certified operators must be 
temporarily offsite?

    If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room 
operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the 
certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a 
certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor is 
away, you must meet one of three criteria:
    (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator.
    (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, 
and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified 
control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or 
approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the periods 
when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite and include this information in the annual report 
as specified under Sec. 62.15340(l).
    (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
    (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what 
caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified 
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
    (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the 
Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the 
Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action 
summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue 
operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective 
actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator 
withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may 
continue.

            Good Combustion Practices: Operating Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 62.15145  What are the operating practice requirements for my
municipal waste combustion unit?

    (a) You must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit at 
loads greater than 110 percent of the maximum demonstrated load of the 
municipal waste combustion unit (4-hour block average), as specified 
under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 62.15410).
    (b) You must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit so 
that the temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control 
device exceeds 17 [deg]C above the maximum demonstrated temperature of 
the particulate matter control device (4-hour block average), as 
specified under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 62.15410).
    (c) If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must maintain an 8-hour 
block average carbon feed rate at or above the highest average level 
established during the most recent dioxins/furans or mercury test.
    (d) If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must evaluate total 
carbon usage for each calendar quarter. The total amount of carbon 
purchased and

[[Page 499]]

delivered to your municipal waste combustion plant must be at or above 
the required quarterly usage of carbon. At your option, you may choose 
to evaluate required quarterly carbon usage on a municipal waste 
combustion unit basis for each individual municipal waste combustion 
unit at your plant. Calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon 
using the appropriate equation in Sec. 62.15390.
    (e) Your municipal waste combustion unit is exempt from limits on 
load level, temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control 
device, and carbon feed rate during any of five situations:
    (1) During your annual tests for dioxins/furans.
    (2) During your annual mercury tests (for carbon feed rate 
requirements only).
    (3) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual tests for dioxins/
furans.
    (4) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual mercury tests (for 
carbon feed rate requirements only).
    (5) Whenever the Administrator permits you to do any of five 
activities:
    (i) Evaluate system performance.
    (ii) Test new technology or control technologies.
    (iii) Perform diagnostic testing.
    (iv) Perform other activities to improve the performance of your 
municipal waste combustion unit.
    (v) Perform other activities to advance the state of the art for 
emission controls for your municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>

                     Continuous Emission Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 62.15170  What types of continuous emission monitoring must
I perform?

    To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:
    (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain 
gaseous pollutants.
    (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are 
operating correctly.
    (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
    (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15175  What continuous emission monitoring systems must I
install for gaseous pollutants?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur 
dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste 
combustion unit, also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a 
continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the 
continuous emission monitoring system for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air 
pollution control device.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in Sec. 
60.13 of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60.
    (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, 
you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
    (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a 
diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen 
monitor is not required and you must follow the requirements in Sec. 
62.15200.
    (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the 
percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install a continuous 
emission monitoring system for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.
    (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring 
method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at 
the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent 
reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an 
alternative monitoring method under Sec. 60.13(i) of subpart A of 40 
CFR part 60.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15180  How are the data from the continuous emission 
monitoring systems used?

    You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems 
for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in 
tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for 
dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, 
hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash, see Sec. 62.15235.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15185  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring
systems are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or 
carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal 
waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) 
continuous

[[Page 501]]

emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or 
carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as appropriate, 
and the appropriate test methods specified in table 6 of this subpart. 
Collect these data during each initial and annual evaluation of your 
continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable 
performance specifications in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Table 7 of 
this subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each 
continuous emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 for each continuous emission monitoring 
system. These procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly 
accuracy determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15190  Am I exempt from any 40 CFR part 60 appendix B or 
appendix F requirements to evaluate continuous emission 

monitoring systems?

    Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission 
monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen 
(or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from 
two requirements:
    (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of 40 
CFR part 60 (relative accuracy requirement).
    (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy 
test audit).


<R05>
Sec. 62.15195  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission
monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15200  What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide
instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?

    You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon 
dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring system. You may reestablish the relationship during annual 
evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
    (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in Appendix A of 40 CFR part 
60 to determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon 
dioxide monitor.
    (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test 
run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 
30 minutes in each hour.
    (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B to 
determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15205  What minimum amount of monitoring data must I collect
with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is this 

requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units 
only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 
percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour 
averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous 
emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the 
equivalent carbon dioxide level).
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of 40 
CFR part 60 requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to 
complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each 15-minute period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating 
hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. 
An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste 
or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation

[[Page 502]]

of this data collection requirement regardless of the emission level 
monitored, and you must notify the Administrator according to Sec. 
62.15340(e).
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with Sec. 62.15210.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15210  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into 
appropriate averaging times and units?

    (a) Use the equation in Sec. 62.15390(a) to calculate emissions at 
7 percent oxygen.
    (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in Appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, 
section 4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of 
sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of 
sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 5.4, to determine 
the daily geometric average percent reduction of potential sulfur 
dioxide emissions.
    (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use 
EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the daily arithmetic 
average for concentrations of nitrogen oxides.
    (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the 4-
hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as applicable) for concentrations 
of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15215  What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring 
system and how are the data used?

    (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity 
monitoring system.
    (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Sec. 60.13 of subpart A 40 CFR part 60.
    (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B 
of 40 CFR part 60. Complete this evaluation by 180 days after your final 
compliance date.
    (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
    (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9, as 
specified in Sec. 62.15245, to determine compliance with the applicable 
opacity limit in tables 2 or 4 of this subpart. The data obtained from 
your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to determine 
compliance with the opacity limit.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15220  What additional requirements must I meet for the 
operation of my continuous emission monitoring systems and continuous

opacity monitoring  system?

    Use the required span values and applicable performance 
specifications in table 8 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15225  What must I do if my continuous emission monitoring 
system is temporarily unavailable to meet the

data collection requirements?

    Refer to table 8 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for 
collecting data when these systems malfunction or when repairs, 
calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the 
minimum amount of data.

                              Stack Testing


<R05>
Sec. 62.15230  What types of stack tests must I conduct?

    Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission 
levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, 
opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15235  How are the stack test data used?

    You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, 
lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and 
fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission 
limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see Sec. 
62.15180.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15240  What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?

    (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in Sec. 
62.15230 by 180 days after your final compliance date.

[[Page 503]]

    (b) Conduct annual stack tests for these pollutants after the 
initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 
months after the previous stack test.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15245  What test methods must I use to stack test?

    (a) Follow table 8 of this subpart to establish the sampling 
location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse 
points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements 
for the different pollutants.
    (b) Make sure that stack tests for all these pollutants consist of 
at least three test runs, as specified in Sec. 60.8 (Performance Tests) 
of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60. Use the average of the pollutant 
emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine compliance 
with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart.
    (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same 
time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as 
specified in Sec. 62.15175.
    (d) Use the equations in Sec. 62.15390(a) to calculate emission 
levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the 
percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the 
reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test 
methods in table 6 of this subpart for other required equations.
    (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under Sec. 
60.8(b) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60 to
    (1) Use a reference method with minor changes in methodology;
    (2) Use an equivalent method;
    (3) Use an alternative method the results of which the Administrator 
has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance;
    (4) Waive the requirement for a performance test because you have 
demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance; or
    (5) Use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15250  May I conduct stack testing less often?

    (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II 
municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given 
pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission 
limit. In this case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for 
that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another 
stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third 
consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. 
Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every third year but no later 
than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows 
noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack 
tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years 
show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. This 
provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing 
requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate 
matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
    (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own 
or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. 
First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that 
are subject to this subpart. Second, all these municipal waste 
combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions 
less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In this case, 
you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste 
combustion unit per year at your plant. This provision only applies to 
stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
    (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack 
test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at 
your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units 
subject to this

[[Page 504]]

subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you determine a testing 
sequence, it must not be changed without approval by the Administrator.
    (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic 
meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard 
cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack 
tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this 
subpart per year.
    (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests 
on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your 
plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans 
emission levels less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard 
cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry 
standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for all municipal 
waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 
consecutive years.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15255  May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if 
unforeseen circumstances arise?

    You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in 
Sec. Sec. 62.15240(b) and 62.15250(b)(1) unless you apply to the 
Administrator for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator 
approves your request for alternate scheduling prior to the date on 
which you would otherwise have been required to conduct the next stack 
test.

                      Other Monitoring Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 62.15260  What other requirements must I meet for continuous
monitoring?

    You must also monitor three operating parameters:
    (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
    (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter air pollution control device.
    (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15265  How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste 
combustion unit?

    (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you 
must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a 
feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:
    (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or 
feed water) in kilograms per hour (or pounds per hour).
    (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block 
averages.
    (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method 
in ``American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME PTC 4.1--1964): Test 
Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1-1964 (Reaffirmed 
1991),'' section 4. The Director of the Federal Register approves this

    (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, 
calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed 
water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
    (b) If your municipal waste combustion unit does not generate steam, 
or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems 
and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that 
can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed 
rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must

Sec. 62.15270  How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at the
inlet of my particulate matter control device?

    You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure the temperature of the flue gas stream at the inlet

<R05>
Sec. 62.15275  How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?

    If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three 
requirements:
    (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be 
used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
    (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the 
average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, 
determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the 
carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating 
parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed 
rate based on the operating parameter level.
    (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all 
periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and 
combusting waste and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed rate 
in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating 
parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
    (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not 
operating.
    (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is 
operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.


<R05>
Sec. 62.15280  What minimum amount of monitoring data must I collect
with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is this 

requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 
1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
    (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
    (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter control device.
    (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per 
calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any 
municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of this data 
collection requirement and you must notify the Administrator according 
to Sec. 62.15340(e).

    (a) Concentration correction to 7 percent oxygen. Correct any 
pollutant concentration to 7 percent oxygen using equation 1 of this 
section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31JA03.000

Where:

C<INF>7%</INF> = concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
C<INF>unc</INF> = uncorrected pollutant concentration.
C<INF>O2</INF> = concentration of oxygen (%).


[[Page 513]]


    (b) Percent reduction in potential mercury emissions. Calculate the 
percent reduction in potential mercury emissions (%P<INF>Hg</INF>) using 
equation 2 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31JA03.001

Where:

%P<INF>Hg</INF> = percent reduction of potential mercury emissions
E<INF>i</INF> = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis
E<INF>o</INF> = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry 
basis

    (c) Percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions. 
Calculate the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31JA03.002

Where:

%P<INF>HCl</INF> = percent reduction of the potential hydrogen chloride 
emissions
E<INF>i</INF> = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis
E<INF>o</INF> = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis

    (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal 
waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, 
calculate the capacity of the municipal waste combustion unit based on 
24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the 
maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat 
input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on this 
maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived 
fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 
British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal 
solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram 
(4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on 
heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
    (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate 
the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum 
design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch 
multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 
hours. Calculate this maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the 
number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches 
in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the 
municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 
hours.
    (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply 
with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required 
quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 or 5 of this section for 
plant basis or unit basis:
    (1) Plant basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31JA03.003
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f<INF>i</INF> = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste 
combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. This is the average 
carbon feed rate during the most recent

[[Page 514]]

mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever has a higher feed 
rate).
h<INF>i</INF> = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was 
in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).
n = number of municipal waste combustion units, i, located at your 
plant.

    (2) Unit basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR31JA03.004
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the unit in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in 
kilograms (or pounds) per hour. This is the average carbon feed rate 
during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever 
has a higher feed rate).
h = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation 
during the calendar quarter (hours).
