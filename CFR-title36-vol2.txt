                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 200.2  Field organization.

    The field organization of the Forest Service consists of regions, 
stations, and areas as described below:
    (a) Regions of the National Forest System. For the purpose of 
managing the lands administered by the Forest Service, the United States 
is divided into nine geographic regions of the National Forest System. 
Each region has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Regional 
Forester who is responsible to the Chief for the activities assigned to 
that region. Within each region are located national forests and other 
lands of the Forest Service.
    (1) National Forests. Each Forest has a headquarters office and is 
supervised by a Forest Supervisor who is responsible to the Regional 
Forester. Two or more proclaimed or designated National Forests, or all 
of the Forests in a State, may be combined into one Forest Service 
Administrative Unit headed by one Forest Supervisor. Each Forest is 
divided into Ranger Districts. The Alaska Region is composed of two 
National Forests without Ranger Districts; with one Forest divided into 
three areas, each administered by a Forest Supervisor.
    (2) Ranger districts. Each district may include a portion of a 
national forest, a national grassland or portion thereof, a national 
recreation area, a wilderness or primitive area, and other lands 
administered by the Forest Service. Each district has a headquarters 
office and is supervised by a District Ranger (or Area Ranger in some 
cases) who is responsible to the Forest Supervisor.
    (b) Forest and rangeland research coordination. The field research 
program is coordinated by six research stations, the national Forest 
Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical 
Forestry. Each has a headquarters office and a Director who is 
responsible to the Chief for all research activities within a 
geographical area of the United States or its territories. Scientists 
are based at Research Work Units with laboratories located in 36 lower 
States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Scientists primarily conduct 
their work within a given geographical area, but due to the integrated 
and cooperative nature of the research program, they make work 
nationwide and internationally.
    (c) State and private forestry cooperation. Field level cooperation 
between the Forest Service, States, and the private sector on forestry 
activities is accomplished by the Northeastern Area State and Private 
Forestry for the Northeastern States; and by the National Forest 
Regional Offices in the Southeastern and Western States. The 
Northeastern Area is supervised by an Area Director who is responsible 
to the Chief for State and private forestry activities within the Area. 
Regional Foresters in Regions 1 through 8 and Region 10 are responsible 
for State and private forestry activities within those regions.
    (d) International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The Institute is 
managed by a Director who is the senior Forest Service official in 
Puerto Rico. The Director is responsible to the Chief for planning and 
directing research, science and technology exchange, technical 
assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and international 
cooperation on natural resources concerning tropical forestry.
    (e) Field addresses. The addresses of Regional Foresters, Station 
Directors, and Area Directors are given below. Under each Regional 
Office address is a list of National Forest Administrative Units by 
States with locations of Forest Supervisor headquarters. Headquarters 
locations for Ranger Districts, National Grasslands, and National

[[Page 7]]

Recreation Areas are not listed but may be obtained from Forest 
Supervisors or Regional Foresters.

                   Subpart B--Functions and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 200.3  Forest Service functions.

    (a) Legislative authority. The basic laws authorizing activities of 
the Forest Service are set forth in the U.S.C. in title 7 (Agriculture), 
chapters 14, 17, 33, 55, 59, and 61; title 16 (Conservation), chapters 
2, 3, 4, 5C, 6, 23, 27, 28, 30, 36, and 37; title 29 (Labor), chapter 
17; and title 43 (Public Lands), chapters 22 and 35.
    (b) Work of the Forest Service. Under delegated authority from the 
Secretary of Agriculture, the broad responsibilities of the Forest 
Service are:
    (1) Leadership in forestry. The Forest Service provides overall 
leadership in forest and forest-range conservation, development, and 
use. This involves determination of forestry conditions and 
requirements, and recommendations of policies and programs needed to 
keep the Nation's private and public lands fully productive.
    (2) National Forest System administration. (i) The Forest Service 
administers and manages the National Forest System lands in accordance 
with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of June 12, 1960 (16 U.S.C. 
528-531); the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 
August 17, 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614); and the National Forest 
Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a, 476, 500, 513-516, 
521b; 576b, 1600-1602, 1604, 1606, 1608-1614).

[[Page 10]]

    (ii) The National Forest System comprises about 188 million acres of 
land in the National Forests, National Grasslands, and other areas which 
have been transferred to the Forest Service for administration. On these 
public lands:
    (A) Forestry methods are applied in growing and harvesting timber,
    (B) Forage is scientifically managed for the use of domestic 
livestock whose numbers are kept in balance with the carrying capacity 
of the range,
    (C) Wildlife habitat and species are managed,
    (D) Watersheds are managed to safeguard the water supply and 
stabilize streamflow,
    (E) Recreation resources are managed for public enjoyment and 
benefit,
    (F) Many forms of land and resource use are granted under permit or 
lease, and
    (G) Physical and resource improvements needed to develop, protect, 
and use all resources are built and maintained.
    (3) Cooperative forestry. The Forest Service carries out cooperative 
forestry programs for public benefit through programs initiated by 
State, county, and other Federal agencies in accordance with the 
Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of July 1, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2101-
2111). These programs are directed at the protection, development, and 
sustained production of all forestry resources, both public and private.
    (4) Forest research. The Forest Service conducts research on 
problems involving protection, development, management, renewal, and 
continuous use of all resources, products, values, and services of 
forest lands in accordance with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
Resources Research Act of June 30, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641-1647). Research 
is conducted on:
    (i) Forest and range management, including the five basic resources 
of timber, forest soil and water, range forage, wildlife and fish 
habitat, and forest recreation,
    (ii) Forest protection from fire, insects, and disease,
    (iii) Forest products and engineering, and
    (iv) Forest resource economics including forest survey, forest 
economics, and forest products marketing.

<R05>
Sec. 200.4  Administrative issuances.

    (a) The regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture governing the 
protection and administration of National Forest System lands and other 
programs of the Forest Service are set forth in Chapter 2 of Title 36 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Administrative policy, procedure, and guidance to Forest Service 
employees for the conduct of Forest Service activities are issued as 
directives, or through correspondence, by the office of the Chief of the 
Forest Service and by the field officers listed in Sec. 200.2.
    (1) Directives are issued through the Forest Service Directive 
System, which is comprised of the Forest Service Manual and related 
Forest Service Handbooks. The Directive System codifies the agency's 
policy, practice, and procedure affecting more than one unit and the 
delegations of continuing authority and assignment of continuing 
responsibilities; serves as the primary administrative basis for the 
internal management and control of all programs; and is the primary 
source of administrative direction to Forest Service employees.
    (2) In contrast to direction issued through the Directive System, 
guidance issued to one or more organizational units through letters and 
memoranda relate to decisions or interpretations on specific activities, 
cases, or incidents or to other matters of agency business, especially 
those matters of short-term duration or immediate interest.
    (c) Forest Service Directive System issuances are published under 
delegated authority as follows:
    (1) The Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances 
to all Forest Service units are published by the Office of the Chief.
    (2) Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances may 
be supplemented as needed for field office use by a Regional Forester, a 
Regional

[[Page 11]]

Special Agent in Charge of Law Enforcement and Investigations, a 
Research Station Director, the International Institute for Tropical 
Forestry Director, the Area Director, or a Forest Supervisor.
    (d) Guidance issued through letters and memoranda must be issued in 
accordance with signing authorities delegated through issuances to the 
Forest Service Directive System.
    (e) An alphabetical index of the contents of the Forest Service 
Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks is published in Forest 
Service Handbook 1109.11, Directive System User Guide. The index 
contains a listing of all Series, Titles, and Chapters in the Forest 
Service Manual and a listing of all Forest Service Handbooks in the 
Directive System.
    (f) Forest Service Handbook 6209.11, Records Management Handbook, 
outlines and indexes the filing system for all correspondence and other 
records.
    (g) Forms and reports used by the agency are listed in, and 
instructions for their use are issued throughout, the Forest Service 
Directive System and are collated in Forest Service Handbook 1309.14, 
Information Requirements Handbook.

[62 FR 33367, June 19, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 200.5  Indexes.

    Publication of the indexes described in Sec. 200.4 is deemed both 
unnecessary and impractical because of the large volume of material 
involved. However, copies of the indexes are available for public review 
in the Forest Service headquarters office in Washington, DC, and at 
field offices listed under Sec. 200.2(d). The Forest Service will 
provide copies of any index upon request at a cost not to exceed the 
direct cost of duplication.

[40 FR 12790, Mar. 21, 1975. Redesignated at 62 FR 13540, Mar. 21, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 200.6  Information available; inspection, copying, and charges.

    (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 7 CFR 1.2, the Forest 
Service shall make available for public inspection and copying all 
published or unpublished directives, forms, records, and final opinions, 
including concurring or dissenting opinions and orders made in the 
adjudication of cases. Charges for information requested from the Forest

<R05>
Sec. 212.5  Road system management.

    (a) Traffic rules. Rules set forth under 36 CFR part 261 and this 
section shall apply to all National Forest System roads under the 
jurisdiction of the Forest Service except when in conflict with written 
agreement.
    (1) General. Traffic on roads is subject to State traffic laws where 
applicable except when in conflict with the rules established under 36 
CFR part 261.
    (2) Specific. The following specific traffic rules shall apply 
unless different rules are established in 36 CFR part 261.
    (i) The load, weight, length, height, and width limitations of 
vehicles shall be in accordance with the laws of the States wherein the 
road is located. Greater or lesser limits may be imposed and these 
greater or lesser limits shall be established as provided in 36 CFR part 
261.
    (ii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be restricted to use by certain 
classes of vehicles or types of traffic as provided in 36 CFR part 261. 
Classes of vehicles are defined to include, but not be limited to, 
distinguishable groupings such as passenger cars, buses, trucks, 
motorcycles, automobiles, 4-wheel drive vehicles and tailers. Types of 
traffic are defined to include, but not be limited to, groupings such as 
commercial hauling, recreation and administrative.
    (iii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use 
as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
    (iv) Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
    (b) Road system--(1) Identification of road system. For each 
national forest, national grassland, experimental forest, and any other 
units of the National Forest System (Sec. 212.1), the responsible 
official must identify the minimum road system needed for safe and 
efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of 
National Forest System lands. In determining the minimum road system, 
the responsible official must incorporate a science-based roads analysis 
at the appropriate scale and, to the degree practicable, involve a broad 
spectrum of interested and affected citizens, other state and federal 
agencies, and tribal governments. The minimum system is the road system 
determined to be needed to meet resource and other management objectives 
adopted in the relevant land and resource management plan (36 CFR part 
219), to meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to 
reflect long-term funding expectations, to ensure that the identified 
system minimizes adverse environmental impacts associated with road 
construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, and maintenance.
    (2) Identification of unneeded roads. Responsible officials must 
review the road system on each National Forest and Grassland and 
identify the roads on lands under Forest Service jurisdiction that are 
no longer needed to meet forest resource management objectives

[[Page 18]]

and that, therefore, should be decommissioned or considered for other 
uses, such as for trails. Decommissioning roads involves restoring roads 
to a more natural state. Activities used to decommission a road include, 
but are not limited to, the following: reestablishing former drainage 
patterns, stabilizing slopes, restoring vegetation, blocking the 
entrance to the road, installing water bars, removing culverts, 
reestablishing drainage-ways, removing unstable fills, pulling back road 
shoulders, scattering slash on the roadbed, completely eliminating the 
roadbed by restoring natural contours and slopes, or other methods 
designed to meet the specific conditions associated with the unneeded 
road. Forest officials should give priority to decommissioning those 
unneeded roads that pose the greatest risk to public safety or to 
environmental degradation.
    (c) Cost recovery on forest service roads. The Chief may determine 
that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, 
improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment thereof, used or to be 
used for commercial hauling of non-Federal forests products and other 
non-Federal products, commodities and materials, should be borne by the 
owners or haulers thereof. The Chief may condition the permission to use 
a road, or segment thereof, upon payment to the United States of the 
proportionate share of the cost and bearing proportionate maintenance as 
determined to be attributable to the owner's or hauler's use in 
accordance with Sec. 212.9. This condition to use roads would apply 
where the owners or haulers:
    (1) Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction, 
reconstruction, or improvements, and
    (2) Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of 
the costs.
    (d) Maintenance and reconstruction of forest service roads by users-
-(1) Maintenance. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an 
existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or 
users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and other 
products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition commensurate 
with the particular use requirements of each. The maintenance to be 
borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use and no individual 
user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of maintenance other 
than that commensurate with his use.
    (2) Reconstruction. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with 
an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or 
users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is 
requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate 
his use.
    (3) Deposits in lieu of performance. If the maintenance or 
reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that 
maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the 
Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to 
provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs. 
Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be 
used for the purposes deposited, except that:
    (i) Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may 
be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of 
performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates, 
and
    (ii) Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for 
which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or 
refunded.
    (e) Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator. Any fees or 
other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement 
or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's 
cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for 
making these payments.

Sec. 212.6  Ingress and egress.

    (a) Policy in acquiring and granting access. To assure effective 
protection, management, and utilization of lands administered by the 
Forest Service and intermingled and adjacent private and public lands, 
and for the use and development of the resources upon which

[[Page 19]]

communities within or adjacent to the National Forests are dependent, 
the Chief shall as promptly as is feasible obtain needed access thereto 
and shall grant appropriate access across National Forest and other 
lands and easements administered by the Forest Service to intermingled 
or adjacent landowners. Construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a 
road or highway requires written authorization.
    (b) Actual settlers and other persons residing within the National 
Forests and other areas administered by the Forest Service. Actual 
settlers and other persons residing within the National Forests and 
other areas administered by the Forest Service shall be permitted 
ingress and egress over the same and use of existing National Forest 
System roads and trails in order to reach their homes and to utilize 
their property: Provided, such ingress and egress or use shall conform 
to rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of 
the lands and the roads or trails to be used.
    (c) Others. Entering upon the National Forests and other lands 
administered by the Forest Service and use of existing National Forest 
System roads and trails shall be permitted for all proper and lawful 
purposes subject to compliance with rules and regulations governing the 
lands and the roads or trails to be used.

Sec. 212.7  Access procurement by the United States.

    (a) Existing or proposed forest development roads which are or will 
be parts of a system of a State, county, or other local subdivision. 
National Forest System roads which are or will be parts of a road system 
of a State, county, or other local subdivision and are on rights-of-way 
held in the name of the State, county, or other local subdivision may be 
constructed, reconstructed, improved or maintained by the Forest Service 
when there is an appropriate agreement with the State, county, or other 
local subdivision under authority of 23 U.S.C. 205: Provided, Such 
construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance is essential 
to provide safe and economical access to the National Forests and other 
lands administered by the Forest Service.
    (b) Acquisition of easements and rights of use. Except as otherwise 
provided in the regulations of this part, easements for road and trail 
construction across non-Federal lands and easements or rights of use 
over non-Federal roads and trails will be acquired in the name of the 
United States of America and its assigns. The easements or rights of use 
may be acquired by purchase, condemnation, donation, or as a reciprocal 
for permits or easements for roads or trails to be constructed or for 
easements over or permits to use existing roads or trails.
    (c) Methods of compensation for easements and rights of use acquired 
by the United States. Compensation in negotiated acquisitions may be:
    (1) By payment from appropriated funds;
    (2) Pursuant to reservation in the grant of easement to the United 
States whereby the grantor reserves the right to require haulers of 
Federal timber or other Federal products over the road conveyed or 
thereafter constructed by the grantor to make payments to the grantor in 
accordance with the terms of the reservation;
    (3) By granting reciprocal rights; or
    (4) By a combination of these methods.
    (d) Cooperative construction and use agreements. Where areas, partly 
lands administered by the Forest Service and partly private or other 
ownership are undeveloped or inadequately developed by roads, the Chief 
will, to the extent feasible and advantageous to the United States, join 
in planning, constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, and 
using an adequate road system on the basis of each party bearing the 
proportion of the cost attributable to the anticipated benefits as set 
forth in Sec. 212.9.

[[Page 20]]

    (e) Condemnation. Where access across non-Federal land or over a 
non-Federal road or trail cannot be obtained through negotiations with 
reasonable promptness, condemnation will be undertaken.
    (f) Access over non-Federal land and use of non-Federal roads or 
trails on a temporary basis. The Chief may negotiate a temporary 
agreement for access over non-Federal land and for use of an existing 
non-Federal road or trail where there is immediate need for temporary 
access for limited purposes that can be economically met by such 
procedure, or where the foreseeable need does not justify the 
expenditures necessary to provide a permanent road or trail.
    (g) Use and control of interests in roads, trails, and easements 
acquired by the United States. Interests in roads, trails, and easements 
acquired by the United States shall be under the control of the United 
States, subject to approved reservations, limitations and other 
provisions set forth in the easement, permit, or other indenture. This 
control by the United States may include restricting or conditioning the 
use of the interest owned by the United States in the road, trail, or 
easement where necessary.

Sec. 212.8  Permission to cross lands and easements owned by the United States and 
administered by the Forest Service.

    (a) Permission to construct or use roads across lands and assignable 
easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest 
Service. If a reciprocal benefit is needed by the United States, 
permission to construct or use a road across lands and across assignable 
easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest 
Service will be conditioned, except as provided in this section, for any 
applicant who seeks a permit to construct or use a road across the same, 
upon the grant to the United States of a reciprocal benefit. Such 
benefit shall bear:
    (1) A reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by 
the Forest Service; and
    (2) A value substantially similar to the value of the estate or 
interest in lands or easements applied for. In those instances where the 
values of the interests needed by the United States exceed those applied 
for by the applicant, the additional interests required by the United 
States will be acquired as provided in Sec. 212.7(b) and (c). Where 
values needed by the applicant exceed those needed by the United States, 
the difference in values will be determined under principles set forth 
below and in Secs. 212.5(c) and 212.9. If a reciprocal benefit is not 
needed by the United States, or the applicant shows good cause why the 
reciprocal benefit needed by the United States cannot or should not be 
granted by him, or the applicant declines to grant the reciprocal 
benefit requested by the United States or if a bona fide emergency 
exists, permission to construct or use a road across lands owned by the 
United States may be conditioned for any applicant upon reasonable 
charges and all other terms and conditions required by the Chief to 
protect the interests of the United States. Permits for such road 
construction or use will be non-exclusive and will be conditioned upon 
compliance with their terms and conditions and with the rules and 
regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and 
those applicable to such roads.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Replacement of prior grants. (1) Upon application to the Chief, 
an easement under the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1233, 16 U.S.C. 
525), shall be replaced by an easement under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Upon application to the Chief, an easement shall be granted 
under paragraph (d) of this section as a replacement for any 
stipulations for ingress and egress issued under the Act of June 4, 1897 
or permit or other document evidencing the applicant's right to use a

[[Page 21]]

road: Provided, The applicant has met the requirements for obtaining 
such easement as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Easements for roads crossing lands or easements administered by 
the Forest Service. (1) Applications for permanent or temporary 
easements for specified periods or otherwise to be granted under the Act 
of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1039, 16 U.S.C. 533), over lands or 
easements administered by the Forest Service, or over roads thereon will 
be approved by the Chief for those applicants who have conveyed or 
provided appropriate easements over roads, assignable easements and 
lands owned or controlled by them to the United States of America and 
its assigns and who have already constructed, or will, as scheduled by 
agreement, construct their proportionate share of the road or road 
system of which the segments described in the application are parts. The 
Chief, after approval of the application and the grant of the easement, 
will cause the same to be entered in the records of the Forest Service, 
and delivered to the applicant.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Chief may 
grant to the applicant a permanent or temporary easement for specified 
periods or otherwise upon such exchange of easements or share-cost 
arrangement or other reasonable consideration as he may deem 
appropriate.
    (3) The Chief may grant to a State or local subdivision thereof; 
easements for roads over lands or easements administered by the Forest 
Service and over roads thereon, when the roads thereon or roads to be 
constructed thereon will serve said lands and are, or will become a part 
of the road system maintained by such State or local subdivision for 
general public use: Provided, That easements shall not be granted under 
authority of this act (78 Stat. 1089), 16 U.S.C. 533 which may be 
granted under the Highway Act (72 Stat. 916, 23 U.S.C. 317), as amended. 
The easements shall contain such provisions, terms, and conditions as 
the Chief may determine are necessary to retain and protect the 
interests needed by the United States.
    (4) All instruments affecting permanent interests in land executed 
pursuant to this paragraph (d) of this section shall be recorded in each 
county where the lands are located. Copies of all instruments affecting 
interests in lands reserved from public domain shall be furnished by the 
Chief to the Secretary of the Interior.
    (5) The Chief may terminate any easement granted under the 
provisions of the Act of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1089, 16 U.S.C. 
534),
    (i) By consent of the owner of the easement,
    (ii) By condemnation, or
    (iii) Upon abandonment after nonuse by the owner of the easement for 
a period of 5 years. Before any easement is terminated for nonuse or 
abandonment, the owner of the easement must be given notice and, upon 
his request made within 60 days after receipt of the notice, a hearing 
in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR part 211, subpart B.

Sec. 212.9  Principles for sharing use of roads.

    The use of roads under arrangements for sharing costs or performance 
shall be in accordance with the following:
    (a) Road improvement. Use of a road for commercial hauling, except 
occasional or minor amounts, will be conditioned upon improvement or 
supplemental construction of the road to safety and economically serve 
the contemplated use, unless the Chief determines that the safety and 
economy of the established and foreseeable use by the United States, its 
users and cooperators will not be impaired by the use for which 
application is being made. With the consent of the Chief the applicant 
may deposit funds in the estimated amount required for the improvements 
or supplemental construction in lieu of performance. Such funds

[[Page 22]]

will be used by the Forest Service to do the planned work. The cost of 
the improvements or supplemental construction will be taken into account 
in determining any otherwise required contribution to cover the 
proportionate share of the cost of road acquisition, construction, 
reconstruction or improvement attributable to the use.
    (b) Corresponding benefits. Corresponding benefits which may be 
accepted by the Chief for sharing road use will be those which bear a 
reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the 
Forest Service. They may be in the form of:
    (1) Deposit of funds with the Forest Service for use in paying the 
cost of road construction, reconstruction, or improvement to be borne by 
the user;
    (2) The grant of a reciprocal right of substantially similar value 
to the road use sought;
    (3) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement by applicant of a 
road needed for access to and use of lands administered by the Forest 
Service; or (4) any combination of these.
    (c) Cost determinations for roads cooperatively constructed under 
agreements. When roads are constructed under cooperative agreements to 
meet mutual needs of the United States and others for access, 
determinations of the shares of costs to be borne by the United States 
and the cooperating parties will include consideration of:
    (1) The standard of road required for the planned hauling;
    (2) The share of planned use;
    (3) The location and volume of tributary timber owned by each party 
and expected to be hauled over the road or roads;
    (4) The tributary areas owned or controlled by each party;
    (5) Expected use by the public; and
    (6) Other appropriate considerations.
    (d) Cost recovery by the United States from others. When roads are 
used under permit for commercial hauling instead of under cooperative 
agreement, any cost to be recovered by the United States will be 
calculated in proportion to the planned use of the road. The road cost 
used in such calculation will be the amount or estimated amount expended 
in the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of 
that capacity of the road required to serve the use needs of all parties 
that are or reasonably can be expected to use the road. The road costs 
shall not exceed the replacement value of the road. Such road share-cost 
payments will be through deposits in advance of use unless the user 
provides a payment bond satisfactory to the Chief guaranteeing that 
payments will be made promptly upon billing by the Forest Service.
    (e) Cost sharing with a cooperator. The costs to achieve the agreed 
upon road or road system may be met by:
    (1) Use of appropriated funds;
    (2) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement of roads or 
segments of roads by purchasers of products from lands administered by 
the Forest Service or other users;
    (3) Use of deposits made by cooperator with the Forest Service to 
cover cooperator's agreed share;
    (4) Agreement with cooperator pursuant to which cooperator does more 
than his agreed share of constructing, reconstructing, or improving a 
road and recovers costs incurred in excess of his agreed share by 
charging purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest 
Service an equitable amount within the limits and to the total amount 
specified in the agreement; or
    (5) A combination of the aforementioned methods.
    (f) Road maintenance and resurfacing. Cooperators will share the 
road maintenance and resurfacing costs under suitable agreements to 
perform, arrange for performance by others, or by making deposits with 
the Forest Service which will be used to pay the cost of work necessary 
to keep such roads in satisfactory condition commensurate with use 
requirements of each cooperator. No cooperator shall be required to 
perform or bear such costs other than those occasioned by its individual 
use. Other users will bear costs in accordance with Sec. 212.5(d).
    (g) Interests to be acquired by the United States in roads or 
easements therefor. Where the United States is to bear or share the cost 
of constructing or improving, or acquiring a road system, a road, or a 
segment thereof, or acquires

[[Page 23]]

an easement therefor, the interest acquired will:
    (1) Be for perpetual use unless the road use falls within the 
limited classes where temporary roads or roads for limited periods are 
acceptable;
    (2) Provide adequately for foreseeable management, protection, and 
utilization needs of lands administered by the Forest Service and 
intermingled and adjacent private and public lands and for the use and 
development of the resources upon which communities within or adjacent 
to the National Forest are dependent; and
    (3) not be subject to conditions, reservations, or convenants 
unrelated to the road use, or which seek or might tend to direct or 
limit policies and procedures for management of lands administered by 
the Forest Service.

    The Chief may acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, and maintain 
National Forest System roads within and near the National Forests and 
other lands administered by the Forest Service in locations and 
according to specifications which will permit maximum economy in 
harvesting timber from such lands tributary to such roads and at the 
same time meet the requirements for protection, development, and 
management thereof and for utilization of the other resources thereof. 
Financing of such roads may be accomplished--
    (a) By the Chief utilizing appropriated funds,

other products, including provisions for amortization of road costs in 
contracts,
    (c) By cooperative financing with other public agencies and with 
private agencies or persons, or
    (d) By a combination of these methods: Provided, That where roads of 
a higher standard than that needed in the harvesting and removal of the 
timber and other products covered by the particular sale are to be 
constructed, the purchaser of the National Forest timber and other 
products shall not be required to bear that part of the costs necessary 
to meet such higher standard, and the Chief may make such arrangements 
to this end as may be appropriate, including arrangements for 
performance of purchaser's road development work under the Act of March 
3, 1925, as amended by section 5 of the Act of April 24, 1950 (16 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 215.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The rules of this part have two purposes. First, this 
part establishes a process by which the public receives notice and is 
provided an opportunity to comment on proposed actions for projects and 
activities implementing a land and resource management plan prior to a 
decision by the Responsible Official. Second, this part establishes an 
appeal process and identifies the decisions that may be appealed, who 
may appeal those decisions, the responsibilities of the participants in 
an appeal, and the procedures that apply for the prompt disposition of 
the appeal.
    (b) Scope. The notice of proposed actions and opportunity to comment 
provides an opportunity for the public to provide meaningful input prior 
to the decision on projects and activities implementing land and 
resource management plans. The rules of this part complement, but do not 
replace, numerous other opportunities to participate in and influence 
the agency's project and activity planning, such as those provided by 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) implementing 
regulations and procedures at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, the National

[[Page 26]]

Forest Management Act (NFMA) implementing regulations at part 219, and 
the pertinent requirements at part 216 regarding notice and comment for 
certain Forest Service Manual (FSM) directives. The appeal process is 
available to those who submit substantive comments during the comment 
period. Appeal disposition constitutes the final administrative 
determination of the United States Department of Agriculture. Throughout 
this part, references to decisions which affect an authorized use or 
occupancy of National Forest System lands and meet all other applicable 
requirements of this part, are subject to appeal by the holders of such 
authorizations under either this part or part 251, subpart C, but not 
under both parts. In addition, certain other parties meeting 
requirements of Sec. 251.86 may also be eligible to appeal projects 
under either this part or part 251, subpart C, but not under both parts.

documentation, the legal notice of decision, the Responsible Official's 
documentation of the informal disposition meeting, and the Appeal 
Reviewing Officer's recommendation.

official who reviews an appeal and makes a written recommendation to the 
Appeal Deciding Officer on disposition of the appeal.
    Appellant--An individual or organization filing an appeal who 
submitted substantive oral or written comments during the comment period 
on a specific project or activity.
    Categorically excluded (CE)--Proposed actions, which do not

    (4) Evidence of timely submission. When there is a question about 
timely submission of comments, timeliness shall be determined as 
follows:

responsibility to ensure timely receipt by other means.
    (b) Consideration of comments. (1) The Responsible Official shall 
consider all substantive written and oral comments submitted in 
compliance with paragraph (a).
    (2) All written comments received by the Responsible Official shall 
be placed in the project file and shall become a matter of public

in the newspaper of record (Sec. 215.7). It is the responsibility of 
appellants to ensure that their appeal is received in a timely manner.
    (b) Computation of time periods. (1) All time periods are computed

file an appeal. Appellants should not rely on dates or timeframe 
information provided by any other source.
    (c) Evidence of timely filing. When there is a question about timely 
filing of an appeal, timeliness shall be determined by:

    (3) When an appeal is electronically mailed, the appellant should 
normally receive an automated electronic acknowledgment from the agency 
as confirmation of receipt. If the appellant does not receive an 
automated acknowledgment of the receipt of the appeal, it is the 
appellant's responsibility to ensure timely receipt by other means.
    (d) Extensions. Time extensions, except as noted in paragraph (b) of 
this section, are not permitted.

    (a) Offer to meet. When an appeal is received, the Responsible 
Official, or designee, must contact the appellant and offer to meet and 
discuss resolution of the issues raised in the appeal. This contact 
shall be made as soon as practicable after the Appeal Deciding Officer 
receives the appeal and the Responsible Official is notified. In the 
case of multiple names or organizations, it is the responsibility of the 
lead appellant (Sec. 215.2) to contact any other persons named in their 
appeal who may desire to participate in the informal disposition 
meeting. If the appellant(s) decline to meet, the Responsible Official 
shall so advise the Appeal Deciding Officer.

the initial meeting shall take place within 15 days after the closing 
date for filing an appeal (Sec. 215.15). The location of the meeting 
shall be in the vicinity of the lands affected by the decision. When the 
District Ranger is the Responsible Official, meetings will generally be 
located on or near that Ranger District. When the Forest Supervisor, 
Regional Forester, or the Chief is the Responsible Official, meetings 
will generally take place at a location within or near the National 
Forest.
    (c) Meeting structure. Generally, the appellant(s) should be 
physically present at informal disposition meetings. If the appellant 
cannot attend a meeting in person because of schedule conflicts or 
travel distances, alternative types of meetings (such as telephone 
conferences or video conferences) may be arranged. All meetings are open 
to the public.
    (d) Outcome. After the informal disposition meeting, the Responsible 
Official shall notify the Appeal Deciding Officer in writing of the 
meeting participants and which of the following three outcomes occurred.
    (1) An appellant and the Responsible Official reach agreement on 
disposition of all or a portion of an appeal. The appellant shall 
withdraw all or the agreed upon portion of the appeal by letter to the 
Appeal Deciding Officer within 15 days of the agreement. When the 
appellant does not withdraw the appeal in writing, formal review and 
disposition of the appeal shall continue.
    (2) As a result of the agreement reached at the informal disposition 
meeting, new information is received or changes to the original decision 
or environmental analysis are proposed. The Responsible Official must 
follow the correction, supplementation, or revision of environmental 
documentation and reconsideration of decisions to take action guidance 
in FSH 1909.15, Chapter 10, section 18, and Secs. 215.3 and 215.4.
    (3) An appeal is not entirely resolved through informal disposition. 
Formal review and disposition of the unresolved portion of the appeal 
shall continue (Sec. 215.18).


<R05>
Sec. 215.18  Formal review and disposition procedures.

    (a) Scope of review. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall complete a 
review based on the appeal record (Sec. 215.2) and the Appeal Reviewing

[[Page 36]]

    (1) Issue a written appeal decision within 45 days following the end 
of the appeal-filing period, which affirms or reverses the Responsible 
Official's decision, either in whole or in part, and which may include 
instructions for further action. When an appeal decision involves 
instructions concerning new information or changed circumstances, the 
Responsible Official must follow the correction, supplementation, or 
revision of environmental documentation and reconsideration of decisions 
to take action guidance in FSH 1909.15, Chapter 10, section 18 and 
Secs. 215.3, 215.4, 215.11, and 215.12. The Appeal Deciding Officer 
shall send a copy of the appeal decision to the appellant(s), the Appeal 
Reviewing Officer, and the Responsible Official within 5 days; or
    (2) Not issue an appeal decision and so notify the appellant(s) in 
writing that an appeal decision will not be issued and that the 
Responsible Official's decision constitutes the final agency action of 
the Department of Agriculture (Sec. 215.15(e)(2)). Notification shall be 
sent no sooner than 46 days nor later than 50 days following the end of 
the appeal-filing period.
    (c) Final administrative determination. The Appeal Deciding 
Officer's appeal disposition constitutes the final administrative 
determination of the Department of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 215.19  Appeal Reviewing Officer.

    (a) Designation. The Appeal Reviewing Officer shall be:
    (1) Designated by the Chief or designee, and shall be a line officer 
at least at the level of the agency official who made the initial 
decision on the project or activity that is under appeal, who has not 
participated in the initial decision and will not be responsible for 
implementation of the initial decision after the appeal is decided; or
    (2) Designated by the Secretary in the case of Chief's decisions.
    (b) Review and recommendation. The Appeal Reviewing Officer shall 
review an appeal and the decision documentation and make a written 
recommendation to the Appeal Deciding Officer on the disposition of the 
appeal. That recommendation shall be released only upon issuance of an 
appeal decision.
    (c) Multiple appeals. In cases involving more than one appeal of a 
decision, the Appeal Reviewing Officer may consolidate appeals and issue 
one or more recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 215.20  Secretary's authority.

    (a) Nothing in this section shall restrict the Secretary of 
Agriculture from exercising any statutory authority regarding the 
protection, management, or administration of National Forest System 
lands.
    (b) Decisions of the Secretary of Agriculture or Under Secretary, 
Natural Resources and Environment are not subject to the notice, 
comment, and appeal procedures set forth in this part. A decision by the 
Secretary or Under Secretary constitutes the final administrative 
determination of the Department of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 215.21  Judicial proceedings.

    It is the position of the Department of Agriculture that any filing 
for Federal judicial review of a decision subject to appeal is premature 
and inappropriate unless the plaintiff has first sought to invoke and 
exhaust the appeal procedures in this part (7 U.S.C. 6912 (e)).


<R05>
Sec. 215.22  Applicability and effective date.

    (a) The notice, comment, and appeal procedures set out in this part,

or after June 4, 2003.
    (b) The provisions concerning electronic comments 
(Secs. 215.5(b)(vi-vii) and 215.6(a)(4)(iii)) and electronic appeals 
(Secs. 215.7(b)(2)(i) and (iii) and 215.15(c)(1) and (3)) are effective 
July 7, 2003.
    (c) The notice, comment, and appeal procedures of part 215 in effect 
prior to June 4, 2003 remain in effect for those projects and activities 
for which legal notice (Secs. 215.5 or 215.7) is published prior to June

Sec. 216.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes procedures to ensure that Federal, State, and 
local governments and the public have adequate notice and opportunity to 
comment upon the formulation of standards, criteria, and guidelines 
applicable to Forest Service programs.


<R05>
Sec. 216.2  Definitions.

    (a) The Forest Service Manual consists of numerous volumes organized 
by numerically coded subject matter. The volumes contain legal 
authorities, responsibilities, delegations, and general instruction and 
direction needed on a continuous basis by Forest Service officers at 
more than one unit to plan and execute programs. The parent text is 
issued by the national headquarters and sets forth the policies, and 
other guidance applicable Service-wide. National directives are 
supplemented, as necesary, by Forest Service field offices. Supplements 
to the Forest Service Manual are applicable only within the Forest 
Service organizational jurisdiction for which they are issued. The 
Forest Service Manual is revised to conform to changing law, orders, 
regulations, or management needs.
    (b) Public participation activities are actions initiated by the 
Forest Service to facilitate an exchange of information with the public. 
These actions include, but are not limited to, oral and written measures 
such as public notices, letters, discussion papers, and gatherings such 
as meetings, workshops, and hearings.
    (c) Standards, criteria, and guidelines means those written 
policies, instructions, and orders, originated by the Forest Service and 
issued in the Forest Service Manual which establish the general 
framework for the management and conduct of Forest Service programs.


<R05>
Sec. 216.3  Applicability; relationship to other public participation 
opportunities.

    (a) The requirements described in this part do not apply to--
    (1) Rules or regulations promulgated according to the requirements 
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553;
    (2) Instructions, procedures, and other material issued in Forest 
Service Handbooks; and
    (3) Proposed Manual directives which provide guidance and procedures

<R04>
 Subpart A--National Forest System Land and Resource Management Planning

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; and Secs. 6 and 15, 90 Stat. 2949, 2952, 
2958 (16 U.S.C. 1604, 1613).

    Source: 65 FR 67568, Nov. 9, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                         Purpose and Principles


<R05>
Sec. 219.1  Purpose.

    (a) Land and resource management planning guides how the Forest 
Service

[[Page 40]]

will fulfill its stewardship of the natural resources of the National 
Forest System to fulfill the designated purposes of the national forests 
and grasslands and honor their unique place in American life. The 
regulations in this subpart set forth a process for amending and 
revising land and resource management plans, hereafter referred to as 
plans, for the National Forest System and for monitoring the results of 
plan implementation under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976, 
16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq. The regulations in this subpart also guide the 
selection and implementation of site-specific actions. The principal 
authorities governing the development and the management of the National 
Forest System include: the Organic Administration Act of 1897, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 473 et seq.); the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 
1960 (16 U.S.C. 528 et seq.); the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1121 et. 
seq.); the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.); the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
seq.); the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resource Act of 1974, as 
amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et 
seq.); and the Clean Water Act of 1948, as amended by the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 
1987 and other laws (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., 1323 et seq.).
    (b) The National Forest System constitutes an extraordinary national 
legacy created by people of vision and preserved for future generations 
by diligent and far-sighted public servants and citizens. These are the 
peoples' lands, emblems of the nation's democratic traditions.
    (1) The national forests and grasslands provide a wide variety of 
uses, values, products, and services that are important to many people, 
including outdoor recreation, forage, timber, wildlife and fish, 
biological diversity, productive soils, clean air and water, and 
minerals. They also afford intangible benefits such as beauty, 
inspiration, and wonder.
    (2) To assure the continuation of this array of benefits this 
regulation affirms sustainability as the overall goal for stewardship of 
the natural resources of each national forest and grassland consistent 
with the laws that guide management of these lands.
    (3) Sustainability, composed of interdependent ecological, social, 
and economic elements, embodies the principles of multiple-use and 
sustained-yield without impairment to the productivity of the land. 
Sustainability means meeting needs of the present generation without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. 
Planning contributes to social and economic sustainability without 
compromising the basic composition, structure, and functioning of 
ecological systems. The progress toward achievement of sustainability is 
assessed through monitoring and evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 219.2  Principles.

    The planning regulations in this subpart are based on the following 
principles:
    (a) The first priority for planning to guide management of the 
National Forest System is to maintain or restore ecological 
sustainability of national forests and grasslands to provide for a wide 
variety of uses, values, products, and services. The benefits sought 
from these lands depend upon long-term ecological sustainability. 
Considering increased human uses, it is essential that uses of today do 
not impair the functioning of ecological processes and the ability of 
these natural resources to contribute to sustainability in the future.
    (1) Planning provides the guidance for maintaining or restoring the 
diversity of plant and animal communities and the productive capacity of 
ecological systems, the core elements of ecological sustainability.
    (2) Planning is based on science and other knowledge, including the 
use of scientifically based strategies for sustainability and benefits 
from independent scientific peer review.
    (3) Planning is based on the temporal and spatial scales necessary 
for sustainability.

[[Page 41]]

    (4) Planning includes the monitoring and evaluation of the 
achievement of goals.
    (b) Planning contributes to social and economic sustainability by 
providing for a wide variety of uses, values, products, and services 
without compromising the basic composition, structure, and function of 
ecological systems.
    (1) Planning recognizes and fosters a broad-based understanding of 
the interdependence of national forests and grasslands with economies 
and communities.
    (2) Planning fosters strategies and actions that provide for human 
use in ways that contribute to long-term sustainability.
    (c) Planning is efficiently integrated into the broader geographic, 
legal, and social landscape within which national forests and grasslands 
exist. Other agencies, governments, corporations, and citizens manage 
land in and around the national forests and grasslands. Planning, 
therefore, is outward looking with the goal of understanding the broader 
landscape in which the national forests and grasslands lie.
    (1) Planning fosters coordination among all affected federal 
agencies.
    (2) Planning proceeds in close cooperation with state, tribal, and 
local governments.
    (3) Planning recognizes the rights of American Indian tribes and 
Alaska Natives.
    (4) Planning is interdisciplinary, providing analyses and options 
that are responsive to a broad range of ecological, social, and 
economic.
    (5) Planning acknowledges the limits and variability of likely 
budgets.
    (d) Planning meaningfully engages the American people in the 
stewardship of their national forests and grasslands. Just as the Forest 
Service can help the American people learn about the limits and 
capabilities of the national forests and grasslands, managers also 
should be guided by the knowledge and values of the American people.
    (1) Planning encourages extensive collaborative citizen 
participation and builds upon the human resources in local communities 
and throughout the nation.
    (2) Planning actively seeks and addresses key issues and promotes a 
shared vision of desired conditions.
    (3) Planning and plans are understandable.
    (4) Planning restores and maintains the trust of the American people 
in the management of the national forests and grasslands.
    (e) Planning is an ongoing process, where decisions are adapted, as 
necessary, to address new issues, new information, and unforeseen 
events.
    (1) Planning is innovative and practical.
    (2) Planning is expeditious and efficient in achieving goals.
    (f) Planning seeks to manage National Forest System resources in a 
combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of 
the productivity of the land consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-
Yield Act of 1960.

                       The Framework for Planning


<R05>
Sec. 219.3  Overview.

    (a) The planning framework. Land and resource management planning is 
a flexible process for fitting solutions to the scope and scale of 
needed action. Planning, conducted according to the planning framework 
outlined in Secs. 219.3-219.11, involves engaging the public 
(Secs. 219.12-219.18) and applying the best available science 
(Secs. 219.22-219.25) to contribute to sustainability (Secs. 219.19-
219.21) in the use and enjoyment of National Forest System lands.
    (b) Levels of planning. Planning may be undertaken at the national, 
regional, national forest or grassland, and/or ranger district 
administrative levels depending on the scope and scale of issues.
    (1) The Chief of the Forest Service is responsible for national 
planning. National planning includes the Forest Service national 
strategic plan required under the Government Performance and Results Act 
of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306, 31 U.S.C. 1115-1119 and 9703-9704) that 
establishes national long-term goals, outcome measures, and strategies 
to be considered in managing the National Forest System and the 
Resources Planning Act Program (16 U.S.C. 1600).

[[Page 42]]

    (2) The Forest or Grassland Supervisor is the responsible official 
for a plan amendment or revision, except to the extent the Regional 
Forester or Chief decides to act as the responsible official.
    (3) When appropriate, two or more Forest or Grassland Supervisors, 
one or more Regional Foresters, or the Chief of the Forest Service may 
undertake planning which may amend or revise one or more plans.
    (4) The Chief of the Forest Service, Regional Foresters, National 
Forest and Grassland Supervisors, or District Rangers may authorize and 
implement site-specific actions.
    (c) An interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to planning. An 
interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to planning may be achieved by 
engaging the skills and interests of appropriate combinations of Forest 
Service staff, consultants, contractors, other federal agencies, states, 
American Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, or local government personnel, 
or other interested or affected people consistent with applicable laws.
    (d) Key elements. The planning cycle begins with the identification 
and consideration of issues and concludes with the monitoring and 
evaluation of results. Based upon the scope and scale of issues, 
planning includes one or more of the following key elements:
    (1) Identification and consideration of issues (Sec. 219.4);
    (2) Information development and interpretation (Sec. 219.5);
    (3) Proposed actions (Sec. 219.6);
    (4) Plan decisions (Sec. 219.7);
    (5) Amendment (Sec. 219.8);
    (6) Revision (Sec. 219.9);
    (7) Site-specific decisions (Sec. 219.10); and
    (8) Monitoring and evaluation for adaptive management (Sec. 219.11).


<R05>
Sec. 219.4  Identification and consideration of issues.

    (a) Origination of issues. Issues may originate from a variety of 
sources including, but are not limited to: inventories, assessments, 
analyses, monitoring and evaluation of projects; discussions among 
people and proposals by organizations or governments interested in or 
affected by National Forest System management; Presidential, 
Departmental, and Forest Service conservation leadership initiatives; 
cooperatively developed landscape goals (Sec. 219.12(b)); evaluation of 
sustainability (Sec. 219.9(b)(4)); enactment of new laws; policies such 
as the Forest Service national strategic plan; and applications for 
authorization for occupancy and use of National Forest System lands.
    (b) Consideration of issues. The responsible official has the 
discretion to determine, at any time, whether and to what extent an 
issue is appropriate for consideration.
    (1) In making this determination, the responsible official should 
consider:
    (i) The scope, complexity, and geographic scale of potential actions 
that may address an issue;
    (ii) Statutory requirements;
    (iii) Organizational and community capabilities and available 
resources, including current and likely Forest Service budgets;
    (iv) The scientific basis and merit of available data and analyses;
    (v) The relationship of possible actions to the Forest Service 
national strategic plan, other existing plans, adopted conservation 
strategies, biological opinions, or other strategies applicable within 
all or a portion of the plan area; and
    (vi) The opinions of interested or affected individuals, 
organizations, or other entities and the social and cultural values 
related to an issue.
    (2) The responsible official should consider the extent to which 
addressing the issue relates to or provides:
    (i) Opportunities to contribute to the achievement of cooperatively 
developed landscape goals;
    (ii) Opportunities for the national forests and grasslands to 
contribute to the restoration or maintenance of ecological 
sustainability, including maintenance or restoration of watershed 
function, such as water flow regimes to benefit aquatic resources, 
groundwater recharge, municipal water supply, or other uses, and 
maintaining or restoring ecological conditions needed for ecosystem and 
species diversity;
    (iii) Opportunities for the national forests or grasslands to 
contribute to social and economic sustainability;

[[Page 43]]

    (iv) Opportunities to recover threatened or endangered species and 
maintain or restore their habitat;
    (v) The potential for negative environmental effects, including 
human health, economic and social effects, upon minority and low income 
communities;
    (vi) Opportunities to maintain or restore ecological conditions that 
are similar to the biological and physical range of expected variability 
(Sec. 219.20(b)(1)); and
    (vii) Opportunities to contribute to knowledge about and 
preservation of historic and cultural resources.


<R05>
Sec. 219.5  Information development and interpretation.

    If the responsible official determines an issue should receive 
consideration, the responsible official should review relevant 
information such as inventories, broad-scale assessments, local 
analyses, or monitoring results to determine if additional information 
is desirable and if it can be obtained at a reasonable cost and in a 
timely manner. The responsible official, at his or her discretion, may 
choose the methods and determine the scope of information development 
and interpretation for an issue under consideration. A broad-scale 
assessment or a local analysis may be developed or supplemented if 
appropriate to the scope and scale of an issue. Broad-scale assessments, 
local analyses, monitoring results, and other studies are not site-
specific or plan decisions or proposals for agency action 
(Sec. 219.6(a)) subject to Forest Service NEPA procedures.
    (a) Broad-scale assessments. Broad-scale assessments provide 
information regarding ecological, economic, or social issues that are 
broad in geographic scale, sometimes crossing Forest Service regional 
administrative boundaries. Ecological information and analyses that may 
be provided in an assessment are addressed in Sec. 219.20(a). Social and 
economic information and analyses that may be provided in an assessment 
are addressed in Sec. 219.21(a).
    (1) Broad-scale assessment should provide the following as 
appropriate:
    (i) Findings and conclusions that describe historic conditions, 
current status, and future trends of ecological, social, and/or economic 
conditions, their relationship to sustainability, and the principal 
factors contributing to those conditions and trends. The responsible 
official may use these findings and conclusions to identify other issues 
(Sec. 219.4), develop proposals for action (Sec. 219.6), or for other 
purposes.
    (ii) Identification of needs for additional research to develop new 
information or address conflicting interpretations of existing 
information.
    (2) Station Directors and Regional Foresters must have joint 
responsibility for Forest Service participation in broad-scale 
assessments. Each broad-scale assessment should be designed and 
conducted with the assistance of scientists, resource professionals, 
governmental entities, and other individuals and organizations 
knowledgeable of the assessment area.
    (b) Local analyses. Local analyses provide ecological, social, or 
economic information as deemed appropriate by the responsible official. 
Local analyses may cover watersheds, ecological units, and social and 
economic units, and may tier to or provide information to update a 
broad-scale assessment. Local analyses should provide the following, as 
appropriate:
    (1) Characterization of the area of analysis;
    (2) Description of issues within the analysis area;
    (3) Description of current conditions;
    (4) Description of likely future conditions;
    (5) Synthesis and interpretation of information; and
    (6) Recommendations for proposals (Sec. 219.6(a)) or identification 
of other issues (Sec. 219.4).


<R05>
Sec. 219.6  Proposed actions.

    (a) Proposal. The responsible official may propose to amend or 
revise a plan, propose a site-specific action, or both.
    (b) NEPA requirements. Unless otherwise provided by law, the 
responsible official must analyze the effects of the proposal and 
alternative(s) in conformance with Forest Service NEPA procedures. The 
responsible official may use issues identified and information reviewed 
pursuant to Secs. 219.4-219.5 for scoping required in Forest Service 
NEPA procedures.

[[Page 44]]


<R05>
Sec. 219.7  Plan decisions.

    Plan decisions guide or limit uses of National Forest System 
resources and provide the basis for future agency action. Plan decisions 
link the requirements of laws, regulations, Executive Orders, policies, 
and the Forest Service national strategic plan to specific national 
forests and grasslands. While plan decisions generally do not commit 
resources to a site-specific action, plan decisions provide a framework 
for authorizing site-specific actions that may commit resources. In 
making decisions, the responsible official should seek to manage 
National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the 
public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land 
consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. Plan 
decisions may apply to all or part of a plan area. Paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section describe the decisions in a plan.
    (a) Desired resource conditions. These plan decisions define the 
resource conditions sought within all or portions of the plan area. 
Desired resource conditions may include, but are not limited to, the 
desired watershed and ecological conditions and aquatic and terrestrial 
habitat characteristics.
    (b) Objectives. These plan decisions are concise statements 
describing measurable results intended to contribute to sustainability 
(Sec. 219.19), including a desired level of uses, values, products, and 
services, assuming current or likely budgets and considering other 
spending levels as appropriate. Objectives include an estimate of the 
time and resources needed for their completion.
    (c) Standards. These plan decisions are the requirements and 
limitations for land uses and management actions necessary for the 
achievement of desired conditions and objectives and compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and policies. Standards 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Limitations on even-aged timber harvest methods;
    (2) Maximum size openings from timber harvest;
    (3) Methods for achieving aesthetic objectives by blending the 
boundaries of vegetation treatments; and
    (4) Other requirements to achieve multiple-use of the national 
forests and grasslands.
    (d) Designation of suitable land uses. These plan decisions identify 
lands within the National Forest System that are or are not suitable for 
specific uses (Sec. 219.26), including, but not limited to: the 
transportation system; livestock grazing; special designations as 
described in Sec. 219.27; and lands where timber production is an 
objective (Sec. 219.28).
    (e) Monitoring strategy. A monitoring strategy is required by each 
plan as described in Sec. 219.11(a).


<R05>
Sec. 219.8  Amendment.

    (a) Amending plans. A plan amendment may add, modify, or rescind one 
or more of the decisions of a plan (Sec. 219.7). An amendment decision 
must be based on the identification and consideration of issues 
(Sec. 219.4), applicable information (Sec. 219.5), and an analysis of 
the effects of the proposed amendment (Sec. 219.6). In developing an 
amendment, the responsible official must provide opportunities for 
collaboration consistent with Sec. 219.12 through Sec. 219.18.
    (b) Environmental review of a proposed plan amendment. For each 
proposal for a plan amendment, the responsible official must complete 
appropriate environmental analyses and public involvement in accordance 
with Forest Service NEPA procedures. A proposed amendment that may 
create a significant environmental effect and thus require preparation 
of an environmental impact statement is considered to be a significant 
change in the plan. If a proposal for amendment requires the preparation 
of an environmental impact statement, the responsible official must give 
public notice and an opportunity to comment on the draft environmental 
impact statement for at least 90 calendar days.


<R05>
Sec. 219.9  Revision.

    (a) Application of the revision process. Revision of a plan is 
required by 16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5). The revision process is a review of 
the overall management of a unit of the National Forest System and an 
opportunity to consider the likely results if plan decisions were to 
remain in effect.

[[Page 45]]

    (b) Initiating revision. To begin the revision process, the 
responsible official must:
    (1) Provide opportunities for collaboration consistent with 
Sec. 219.12 through Sec. 219.18;
    (2) Summarize those issues the responsible official determines to be 
appropriate for consideration (Sec. 219.4), any relevant inventories, 
new data, findings and conclusions from appropriate broad-scale 
assessments and local analyses, monitoring and evaluation results, new 
or revised Forest Service policies, relevant portions of the Forest 
Service national strategic plan, and changes in circumstances affecting 
the entire or significant portions of the plan area;
    (3) Develop the information and complete the analyses described in 
Sec. 219.20(a) and Sec. 219.21(a);
    (4) Evaluate the effectiveness of the current plan in contributing 
to sustainability (Secs. 219.19-219.21) based on the information, 
analyses, and requirements described in Sec. 219.20(a) and (b) and 
Sec. 219.21(a) and (b), and provide for an independent scientific peer 
review (Sec. 219.22) of the evaluation;
    (5) Identify new proposals for special areas, special designation, 
or for recommendation as wilderness (Sec. 219.27);
    (6) Identify specific watersheds in need of protective or 
restoration measures;
    (7) Identify lands classified as not suitable for timber production 
(Sec. 219.28);
    (8) Identify and evaluate inventoried roadless areas and unroaded 
areas based on the information, analyses, and requirements in 
Sec. 219.20(a) and Sec. 219.21(a). During the plan revision process or 
at other times as deemed appropriate, the responsible official must 
determine which inventoried roadless areas and unroaded areas warrant 
additional protection and the level of protection to be afforded; and
    (9) Develop an estimate of outcomes that would be anticipated, 
including uses, values, products, or services, for a 15-year period 
following initiation of the revision process, if the plan decisions in 
effect at the time the revision process began remain in effect.
    (c) Public notice of revision process and review of information. 
After the responsible official has compiled the information required 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the responsible official must give 
public notice of the plan revision process and make the information 
compiled under paragraph (b) of this section available for public 
comment for at least 45 calendar days.
    (d) Notice of Intent. Based upon the information compiled under 
paragraph (b) of this section and any comments received during the 
comment period required under paragraph (c) of this section, the 
responsible official must publish a Notice of Intent to prepare an 
environmental impact statement to add, modify, remove, or continue in 
effect the decisions embodied in a plan. The responsible official must 
give the public notice and an opportunity to comment on the draft 
environmental impact statement for at least 90 calendar days. Following 
public comment, the responsible official must oversee preparation of a 
final environmental impact statement in accordance with Forest Service 
NEPA procedures.
    (e) Final decision on plan revision. The revision process is 
completed when the responsible official signs a record of decision for a 
plan revision.


<R05>
Sec. 219.10  Site-specific decisions.

    To the extent appropriate and practicable and subject to valid 
existing rights and appropriate statutes, the responsible official must 
provide opportunities for collaboration consistent with Sec. 219.12 
through Sec. 219.18, follow the planning framework described in 
Secs. 219.4-219.6 and comply with Sec. 219.11 to make site-specific 
decisions. All site-specific decisions, including authorized uses of 
land, must be consistent with the applicable plan. If a proposed site-
specific decision is not consistent with the applicable plan, the 
responsible official may modify the proposed decision to make it 
consistent with the plan, reject the proposal; or amend the plan to 
authorize the action.


<R05>
Sec. 219.11  Monitoring and evaluation for adaptive management.

    (a) Plan monitoring strategy. Each plan must contain a practicable, 
effective, and efficient monitoring strategy to evaluate sustainability 
in the plan area (Secs. 219.19-219.21). The strategy must require 
monitoring of appropriate plan

[[Page 46]]

decisions and characteristics of sustainability.
    (1) Monitoring and evaluation of ecological sustainability. The plan 
monitoring strategy for the monitoring and evaluation of ecological 
sustainability must require monitoring of:
    (i) Ecosystem diversity. Monitoring must be used to evaluate the 
status and trend of selected physical and biological characteristics of 
ecosystem diversity (Sec. 219.20(a)(1)). The plan monitoring strategy 
must document the reasons for selection of characteristics to be 
monitored, monitoring objectives, methodology, and designate critical 
values that will prompt reviews of plan decisions.
    (ii) Species diversity. Monitoring must be used to evaluate focal 
species and species-at-risk as follows:
    (A) The status and trends of ecological conditions known or 
suspected to support focal species and selected species-at-risk must be 
monitored. The plan monitoring strategy must document the reasons for 
the selection of species-at-risk for which ecological conditions are to 
be monitored, including the degree of risk to the species, the factors 
that put the species at risk, and the strength of association between 
ecological conditions and population dynamics.
    (B) In addition to monitoring of ecological conditions, the plan 
monitoring strategy may require population monitoring for some focal 
species and some species-at-risk. This monitoring may be accomplished by 
a variety of methods including population occurrence and presence/
absence data, sampling population characteristics, using population 
indices to track relative population trends, or inferring population 
status from ecological conditions.
    (C) A decision by the responsible official to monitor populations 
and the responsible official's choice of methodologies for monitoring 
selected focal species and selected species-at-risk may be based upon 
factors that include, but are not limited to, the degree of risk to the 
species, the degree to which a species' life history characteristics 
lend themselves to monitoring, the reasons that a species is included in 
the list of focal species or species-at-risk, and the strength of 
association between ecological conditions and population dynamics. 
Monitoring of population trend is often appropriate in those cases where 
risk to species viability is high and population characteristics cannot 
be reliably inferred from ecological conditions. The reasons for 
selection of species, monitoring objectives, and methodologies must be 
documented as part of the plan monitoring strategy. Critical values that 
will prompt reviews of plan decisions must be designated in the 
monitoring strategy.
    (iii) Monitoring effectiveness. As a part of the plan monitoring 
strategy, the responsible official must evaluate the effectiveness of 
selected characteristics of ecosystem diversity and species diversity in 
providing reliable information regarding ecological sustainability.
    (2) Monitoring and evaluation of social and economic sustainability. 
The plan monitoring strategy for the monitoring and evaluation of social 
and economic sustainability should provide for periodic review of 
national, regional, and local supply and demand for products, services, 
and values. Special consideration should be given to those uses, values, 
products, and services that the National Forest System is uniquely 
poised to provide. Monitoring should improve the understanding of the 
National Forest System contributions to social and economic 
sustainability. The plan monitoring strategy must require the 
responsible official to evaluate the effectiveness of information and 
analyses described in Sec. 219.21(a) in providing reliable information 
regarding social and economic sustainability.
    (b) Monitoring of site-specific actions. The decision document 
authorizing a site-specific action should describe any required 
monitoring and evaluation for the site-specific action. The responsible 
official must determine that there is a reasonable expectation that 
anticipated funding is adequate to complete any required monitoring and 
evaluation prior to authorizing a site-specific action.
    (c) Monitoring methods. Unless required by the monitoring strategy, 
monitoring methods may be changed to reflect new information without 
plan amendment or revision.

[[Page 47]]

    (d) Use of monitoring information. Where monitoring and evaluation 
is required by the plan monitoring strategy, the responsible official 
must ensure that monitoring information is used to determine one or more 
of the following:
    (1) If site-specific actions are completed as specified in 
applicable decision documents;
    (2) If the aggregated outcomes and effects of completed and ongoing 
actions are achieving or contributing to the desired conditions;
    (3) If key assumptions identified for monitoring in plan decisions 
remain valid; and
    (4) If plan or site-specific decisions need to be modified.
    (e) Coordination of monitoring activities. To the extent 
practicable, monitoring and evaluation should be conducted jointly with 
other federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, scientific 
and academic communities, and others. In addition, the responsible 
official must provide appropriate opportunities for the public to be 
involved and utilize scientists as described in Sec. 219.23.
    (f) Annual monitoring and evaluation report. The responsible 
official must prepare a monitoring and evaluation report for the plan 
area within 6 months following the end of each fiscal year. The report 
must be maintained with the plan documents (Sec. 219.30(d)(5)), and 
include the following:
    (1) A list or reference to monitoring required by the plan; and
    (2) A summary of the results of monitoring and evaluation performed 
during the preceding fiscal year and appropriate results from previous 
years. The summary must include:
    (i) A description of the progress toward achievement of desired 
conditions within the plan area; and
    (ii) A description of the plan area's contribution to the 
achievement of applicable outcomes of the Forest Service national 
strategic plan.

                Collaborative Planning for Sustainability


<R05>
Sec. 219.12  Collaboration and cooperatively developed landscape goals.

    (a) Collaboration. To promote sustainability, the responsible 
official must actively engage the American public, interested 
organizations, private landowners, state, local, and Tribal governments, 
federal agencies, and others in the stewardship of National Forest 
System lands. To engage people in the stewardship of National Forest 
System lands, the responsible official may assume many roles, such as 
leader, organizer, facilitator, or participant. The responsible official 
must provide early and frequent opportunities for people to participate 
openly and meaningfully in planning taking into account the diverse 
roles, jurisdictions, and responsibilities of interested and affected 
organizations, groups, and individuals. The responsible official has the 
discretion to determine how to provide these opportunities in the 
planning process.
    (b) Cooperatively developed landscape goals. (1) The responsible 
official and other Forest Service employees involved in planning must 
invite and encourage others to engage in the collaborative development 
of landscape goals. Using information from broad-scale assessments or 
other available information, and subject to applicable laws, the 
responsible official may initiate or join ongoing collaborative efforts 
to develop or propose landscape goals for areas that include National 
Forest System lands.
    (2) During collaborative efforts, responsible officials and other 
Forest Service employees, must communicate and foster understanding of 
the nation's declaration of environmental policy as set forth in section 
101(b) of the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
4321-4347), which states that it is the continuing responsibility of the 
Federal Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other 
essential considerations of national policy, to improve and coordinate 
federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to the end that the 
Nation may--
    (i) Fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of 
the environment for succeeding generations;
    (ii) Assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and 
esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;
    (iii) Attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment 
without degradation, risk to health or safety,

[[Page 48]]

or other undesirable and unintended consequences;
    (iv) Preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of 
our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment 
which supports diversity, and variety of individual choice;
    (v) Achieve a balance between population and resource use which will 
permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities; 
and
    (vi) Enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the 
maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.
    (3) Cooperatively developed landscape goals, whether the result of 
efforts initiated by the Forest Service or others, must be deemed an 
issue for the purposes under Sec. 219.4.


<R05>
Sec. 219.13  Coordination among federal agencies.

    The responsible official must provide early and frequent 
coordination with appropriate federal agencies and may provide 
opportunities:
    (a) For interested or affected federal agencies to participate in 
the identification of issues and formulation of proposed actions;
    (b) For the streamlined coordination of federal agency policies, 
resource management plans, or programs; and
    (c) The development, where appropriate and practicable, of joint 
resource management plans.


<R05>
Sec. 219.14  Involvement of state and local governments.

    The responsible official must provide early and frequent 
opportunities for state and local governments to:
    (a) Participate in the planning process, including the 
identification of issues; and
    (b) Contribute to the streamlined coordination of resource 
management plans or programs.


<R05>
Sec. 219.15  Interaction with American Indian tribes and Alaska Natives.

    (a) The Forest Service shares in the federal government's overall 
trust responsibility for federally recognized American Indian tribes and 
Alaska Natives.
    (b) During planning, the responsible official must consider the 
government-to-government relationship between American Indian or Alaska 
Native tribal governments and the federal government.
    (c) The responsible official must consult with and invite American 
Indian tribes and Alaska Natives to participate in the planning process 
to assist in:
    (1) The early identification of treaty rights, treaty-protected 
resources, and American Indian tribe trust resources;
    (2) The consideration of tribal data and resource knowledge provided 
by tribal representatives; and
    (3) The consideration of tribal concerns and suggestions during 
decisionmaking.


<R05>
Sec. 219.16  Relationships with interested individuals and organizations.

    The responsible official must:
    (a) Make planning information available to the extent allowed by 
law;
    (b) Conduct planning processes that are fair, meaningful, and open 
to persons with diverse opinions;
    (c) Provide early and frequent opportunities for participation in 
the identification of issues;
    (d) Encourage interested individuals and organizations to work 
collaboratively with one another to improve understanding and develop 
cooperative landscape and other goals;
    (e) Consult with individuals and organizations who can provide 
information about current and historic public uses within an assessment 
or plan area, about the location of unique and sensitive resources and 
values and cultural practices related to issues in the plan area; and
    (f) Consult with scientific experts and other knowledgeable persons, 
as appropriate, during consideration of collaboratively developed 
landscape goals and other activities.


<R05>
Sec. 219.17  Interaction with private landowners.

    The responsible official must seek to collaborate with those who 
have control or authority over lands adjacent to or within the external 
boundaries of national forests or grasslands to identify:

[[Page 49]]

    (a) Local knowledge;
    (b) Potential actions and partnership activities;
    (c) Potential conditions and activities on the adjacent lands that 
may affect management of National Forest System lands, or vice versa; 
and
    (d) Issues (Sec. 219.4).


<R05>
Sec. 219.18  Role of advisory committees.

    (a) Advisory committees. Advisory committees can provide an 
immediate, representative, and predictable structure within which public 
dialogue can occur and the Forest Service can develop relationships with 
diverse communities of interests. The responsible official may seek the 
assistance or advice from a committee, consistent with the requirements 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app.) in determining 
whether there is a reasonable basis to propose an action to address an 
issue. Each Forest or Grassland Supervisor must have access to an 
advisory committee with knowledge of local conditions and issues, 
although an advisory committee is not required for each national forest 
or grassland. Responsible officials may request establishment of 
advisory committees and recommend members to the Secretary of 
Agriculture. Advisory committees used by other agencies may be utilized 
through proper agreements.
    (b) Participation in other types of community-based groups. When 
appropriate, the responsible official should consider participating in 
community-based groups organized for a variety of public purposes, 
particularly those groups organized to develop landscape goals 
(Sec. 219.12(b)).

             Ecological, Social, and Economic Sustainability


<R05>
Sec. 219.19  Ecological, social, and economic sustainability.

    Sustainability, composed of interdependent ecological, social, and 
economic elements, embodies the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 
(16 U.S.C. 528 et seq.) without impairment to the productivity of the 
land and is the overall goal of management of the National Forest 
System. The first priority for stewardship of the national forests and 
grasslands is to maintain or restore ecological sustainability to 
provide a sustainable flow of uses, values, products, and services from 
these lands.


<R05>
Sec. 219.20  Ecological sustainability.

    To achieve ecological sustainability, the responsible official must 
ensure that plans provide for maintenance or restoration of ecosystems 
at appropriate spatial and temporal scales determined by the responsible 
official.
    (a) Ecological information and analyses. Ecosystem diversity and 
species diversity are components of ecological sustainability. The 
planning process must include the development and analysis of 
information regarding these components at a variety of spatial and 
temporal scales. These scales include geographic areas such as 
bioregions and watersheds, scales of biological organization such as 
communities and species, and scales of time ranging from months to 
centuries. Information and analyses regarding the components of 
ecological sustainability may be identified, obtained, or developed 
through a variety of methods, including broad-scale assessments and 
local analyses (Sec. 219.5), and monitoring results (Sec. 219.11). For 
plan revisions, and to the extent the responsible official considers 
appropriate for plan amendments or site-specific decisions, the 
responsible official must develop or supplement the following 
information and analyses related to ecosystem and species diversity:
    (1) Characteristics of ecosystem and species diversity. 
Characteristics of ecosystem and species diversity must be identified 
for assessing and monitoring ecological sustainability. In general, 
these identified characteristics should be consistent at various scales 
of analyses.
    (i) Ecosystem diversity. Characteristics of ecosystem diversity 
include, but are not limited to:
    (A) Major vegetation types. The composition, distribution, and 
abundance of the major vegetation types and successional stages of 
forest and grassland systems; the prevalence of invasive or noxious 
plant or animal species.
    (B) Water resources. The diversity, abundance, and distribution of 
aquatic and riparian systems including

[[Page 50]]

streams, stream banks, coastal waters, estuaries, groundwater, lakes, 
wetlands, shorelines, riparian areas, and floodplains; stream channel 
morphology and condition, and flow regimes.
    (C) Soil resources. Soil productivity; physical, chemical and 
biological properties; soil loss; and compaction.
    (D) Air resources. Air quality, visibility, and other air resource 
values.
    (E) Focal species. Focal species that provide insights to the larger 
ecological systems with which they are associated.
    (ii) Species diversity. Characteristics of species diversity 
include, but are not limited to, the number, distribution, and 
geographic ranges of plant and animal species, including focal species 
and species-at-risk that serve as surrogate measures of species 
diversity. Species-at-risk and focal species must be identified for the 
plan area.
    (2) Evaluation of ecological sustainability. Evaluations of 
ecological sustainability must be conducted at the scope and scale 
determined by the responsible official to be appropriate to the planning 
decision. These evaluations must describe the current status of 
ecosystem diversity and species diversity, risks to ecological 
sustainability, cumulative effects of human and natural disturbances, 
and the contribution of National Forest System lands to the ecological 
sustainability of all lands within the area of analysis.
    (i) Evaluation of ecosystem diversity. Evaluations of ecosystem 
diversity must include, as appropriate, the following:
    (A) Information about focal species that provide insights to the 
integrity of the larger ecological system to which they belong.
    (B) A description of the biological and physical properties of the 
ecosystem using the characteristics identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section.
    (C) A description of the principal ecological processes occurring at 
the spatial and temporal scales that influence the characteristic 
structure and composition of ecosystems in the assessment or analysis 
area. These descriptions must include the distribution, intensity, 
frequency, and magnitude of natural disturbance regimes of the current 
climatic period, and should include other ecological processes important 
to ecological sustainability, such as nutrient cycling, migration, 
dispersal, food web dynamics, water flows, and the identification of the 
risks to maintaining these processes. These descriptions may also 
include an evaluation of the feasibility of maintaining natural 
ecological processes as a tool to contribute to ecological 
sustainability.
    (D) A description of the effects of human activities on ecosystem 
diversity. These descriptions must distinguish activities that had an 
integral role in the landscape's ecosystem diversity for a long period 
of time from activities that are of a type, size, or rate that were not 
typical of disturbances under which native plant and animal species and 
ecosystems developed.
    (E) An estimation of the range of variability of the characteristics 
of ecosystem diversity, identified in paragraph (a)(l)(i) of this 
section, that would be expected under the natural disturbance regimes of 
the current climatic period. The current values of these characteristics 
should be compared to the expected range of variability to develop 
insights about the current status of ecosystem diversity.
    (F) An evaluation of the effects of air quality on ecological 
systems including water.
    (G) An estimation of current and foreseeable future Forest Service 
consumptive and non-consumptive water uses and the quantity and quality 
of water needed to support those uses and contribute to ecological 
sustainability.
    (H) An identification of reference landscapes to provide for 
evaluation of the effects of actions.
    (ii) Evaluations of species diversity. Evaluations of species 
diversity must include, as appropriate, assessments of the risks to 
species viability and the identification of ecological conditions needed 
to maintain species viability over time based on the following:
    (A) The viability of each species listed under the Endangered 
Species Act as threatened, endangered, candidate, and proposed species 
must be assessed.

[[Page 51]]

Individual species assessments must be used for these species.
    (B) For all other species, including other species-at-risk and those 
species for which there is little information, a variety of approaches 
may be used, including individual species assessments and assessments of 
focal species or other indicators used as surrogates in the evaluation 
of ecological conditions needed to maintain species viability.
    (C) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, 
for species groups that contain many species, assessments of functional, 
taxonomic, or habitat groups rather than individual species may be 
appropriate.
    (D) In analyzing viability, the extent of information available 
about species, their habitats, the dynamic nature of ecosystems and the 
ecological conditions needed to support them must be identified. Species 
assessments may rely on general conservation principles and expert 
opinion. When detailed information on species habitat relationships, 
demographics, genetics, and risk factors is available, that information 
should be considered.
    (b) Plan decisions. When making plan decisions that will affect 
ecological sustainability, the responsible official must use the 
information developed under paragraph (a) of this section. The following 
requirements must apply at the spatial and temporal scales that the 
responsible official determines to be appropriate to the plan decision:
    (1) Ecosystem diversity. Plan decisions affecting ecosystem 
diversity must provide for maintenance or restoration of the 
characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure within the range 
of variability that would be expected to occur under natural disturbance 
regimes of the current climatic period in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, in 
situations where ecosystem composition and structure are currently 
within the expected range of variability, plan decisions must maintain 
the composition and structure within the range.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, 
where current ecosystem composition and structure are outside the 
expected range of variability, plan decisions must provide for 
measurable progress toward ecological conditions within the expected 
range of variability.
    (iii) Where the range of variability cannot be practicably defined, 
plan decisions must provide for measurable progress toward maintaining 
or restoring ecosystem diversity. The responsible official must use 
independently peer-reviewed scientific methods other than the expected 
range of variability to maintain or restore ecosystem diversity. The 
scientific basis for such alternative methods must be documented in 
accordance with (Secs. 219.22-219.25).
    (iv) Where the responsible official determines that ecological 
conditions are within the expected range of variability and that 
maintaining ecosystem composition and structure within that range is 
ecologically, socially or economically unacceptable, plan decisions may 
provide for ecosystem composition and structure outside the expected 
range of variability. In such circumstances, the responsible official 
must use independently peer-reviewed scientific methods other than the 
expected range of variability to provide for the maintenance or 
restoration of ecosystem diversity. The scientific basis for such 
alternative methods must be documented in accordance with (Secs. 219.22-
219.25).
    (v) Where the responsible official determines that ecological 
conditions are outside the expected range of variability and that it is 
not practicable to make measurable progress toward conditions within the 
expected range of variability, or that restoration would result in 
conditions that are ecologically, socially or economically unacceptable, 
plan decisions may provide for ecosystem composition and structure 
outside the expected range of variability. In such circumstances, the 
responsible official must use independently peer-reviewed scientific 
methods other than the expected range of variability to provide for the 
maintenance or restoration of ecosystem diversity. The scientific basis 
for such alternative methods must be documented (Secs. 219.22-219.25).
    (2) Species diversity. (i) Plan decisions affecting species 
diversity must provide for ecological conditions that the

[[Page 52]]

responsible official determines provide a high likelihood that those 
conditions are capable of supporting over time the viability of native 
and desired non-native species well distributed throughout their ranges 
within the plan area, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)-(iv) 
of this section. Methods described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section may be used to make the determinations of ecological conditions 
needed to maintain viability. A species is well distributed when 
individuals can interact with each other in the portion of the species 
range that occurs within the plan area. When a plan area occupies the 
entire range of a species, these decisions must provide for ecological 
conditions capable of supporting viability of the species and its 
component populations throughout that range. When a plan area 
encompasses one or more naturally disjunct and self-sustaining 
populations of a species, these decisions must provide ecological 
conditions capable of supporting over time viability of each population. 
When a plan area encompasses only a part of a population, these 
decisions must provide ecological conditions capable of supporting 
viability of that population well distributed throughout its range 
within the plan area.
    (ii) When conditions outside the authority of the agency prevent the 
agency from providing ecological conditions that provide a high 
likelihood of supporting over time the viability of native and desired 
non-native species well distributed throughout their ranges within the 
plan area, plan decisions must provide for ecological conditions well 
distributed throughout the species range within the plan area to 
contribute to viability of that species.
    (iii) Where species are inherently rare or not naturally well 
distributed in the plan area, plan decisions should not contribute to 
the extirpation of the species from the plan area and must provide for 
ecological conditions to maintain these species considering their 
natural distribution and abundance.
    (iv) Where environmental conditions needed to support a species have 
been so degraded that it is technically infeasible to restore ecological 
conditions that would provide a high likelihood of supporting viability, 
plan decisions must provide for ecological conditions to contribute to 
supporting over time viability to the degree practicable.
    (3) Federally listed threatened and endangered species. (i) Plan 
decisions must provide for implementing actions in conservation 
agreements with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National 
Marine Fisheries Service that provide a basis for not needing to list a 
species. In some situations, conditions or events beyond the control or 
authority of the agency may limit the Forest Service's ability to 
prevent the need for federal listing. Plan decisions should reflect the 
unique opportunities that National Forest System lands provide to 
contribute to recovery of listed species.
    (ii) Plan decisions involving species listed under the Endangered 
Species Act must include, at the scale determined by the responsible 
official to be appropriate to the plan decision, reasonable and prudent 
measures and associated terms and conditions contained in final 
biological opinions issued under 50 CFR part 402. The plan decision 
documents must provide a rationale for adoption or rejection of 
discretionary conservation recommendations contained in final biological 
opinions.


<R05>
Sec. 219.21  Social and economic sustainability.

    To contribute to economic and social sustainability, the responsible 
official involves interested and affected people in planning for 
National Forest System lands (Secs. 219.12-219.18), provides for the 
development and consideration of relevant social and economic 
information and analyses, and a range of uses, values, products, and 
services.
    (a) Social and economic information and analyses. To understand the 
contribution national forests and grasslands make to the economic and 
social sustainability of local communities, regions, and the nation, the 
planning process must include the analysis of economic and social 
information at

[[Page 53]]

variable scales, including national, regional, and local scales. Social 
analyses address human life-styles, cultures, attitudes, beliefs, 
values, demographics, and land-use patterns, and the capacity of human 
communities to adapt to changing conditions. Economic analyses address 
economic trends, the effect of national forest and grassland management 
on the well-being of communities and regions, and the net benefit of 
uses, values, products, or services provided by national forests and 
grasslands. Social and economic analyses should recognize that the uses, 
values, products, and services from national forests and grasslands 
change with time and the capacity of communities to accommodate shifts 
in land uses change. Social and economic analyses may rely on 
quantitative, qualitative, and participatory methods for gathering and 
analyzing data. Social and economic information may be developed and 
analyzed through broad-scale assessments and local analyses 
(Sec. 219.5), monitoring results (Sec. 219.11), or other means. For plan 
revisions, and to the extent the responsible official considers to be 
appropriate for plan amendments or site-specific decisions, the 
responsible official must develop or supplement the information and 
analyses related to the following:
    (1) Describe and analyze, as appropriate, the following:
    (i) Demographic trends; life-style preferences; public values; land-
use patterns; related conservation and land use policies at the state 
and local level; cultural and American Indian tribe and Alaska Native 
land settlement patterns; social and cultural history; social and 
cultural opportunities provided by national forest system lands; the 
organization and leadership of local communities; community assistance 
needs; community health; and other appropriate social and cultural 
information;
    (ii) Employment, income, and other economic trends; the range and 
estimated long-term value of market and non-market goods, uses, 
services, and amenities that can be provided by national forest system 
lands consistent with the requirements of ecological sustainability, the 
estimated cost of providing them, and the estimated effect of providing 
them on regional and community well-being, employment, and wages; and 
other appropriate economic information. Special attention should be paid 
to the uses, values, products, or services that the Forest Service is 
uniquely poised to provide;
    (iii) Opportunities to provide social and economic benefits to 
communities through natural resource restoration strategies;
    (iv) Other social or economic information, if appropriate, to 
address issues being considered by the responsible official 
(Sec. 219.4).
    (2) Analyze community or region risk and vulnerability. Risk and 
vulnerability analyses assess the vulnerability of communities from 
changes in ecological systems as a result of natural succession or 
potential management actions. Risk may be considered for geographic, 
relevant occupational, or other related communities of interest. 
Resiliency and community capacity should be considered in a risk and 
vulnerability analysis. Risk and vulnerability analysis may also address 
potential consequences to communities and regions from land management 
changes in terms of capital availability, employment opportunities, wage 
levels, local tax bases, federal revenue sharing, the ability to support 
public infrastructure and social services, human health and safety, and 
other factors as necessary and appropriate.
    (b) Plan decisions. When making plan decisions that will affect 
social or economic sustainability, the responsible official must use the 
information analyses developed in paragraph (a) of this section. Plan 
decisions contribute to social and economic sustainability by providing 
for a range of uses, values, products, and services, consistent with 
ecological sustainability.

                       The Contribution of Science


<R05>
Sec. 219.22  The overall role of science in planning.

    (a) The responsible official must ensure that the best available 
science is considered in planning. The responsible official, when 
appropriate, should acknowledge incomplete or unavailable information, 
scientific uncertainty,

[[Page 54]]

and the variability inherent in complex systems.
    (b) When appropriate and practicable and consistent with applicable 
law, the responsible official should provide for independent, scientific 
peer reviews of the use of science in planning. Independent, scientific 
peer reviews are conducted using generally accepted scientific practices 
that do not allow individuals to participate in the peer reviews of 
documents they authored or co-authored.


<R05>
Sec. 219.23  The role of science in assessments, analyses, and monitoring.

    (a) Broad-scale assessments. If the Forest Service is leading a 
broad-scale assessment, the assessment must be led by a Chief Scientist 
selected by the Deputy Chief of Research and Development. When 
appropriate and practicable, a responsible official may provide for 
independent, scientific peer review of the findings and conclusions 
originating from a broad-scale assessment. Independent, scientific peer 
review may be provided by scientists from the Forest Service, other 
federal, state, or tribal agencies, or other institutions.
    (b) Local analyses. Though not required, a responsible official may 
include scientists in the development or technical reviews of local 
analyses and field reviews of the design and selection of subsequent 
site-specific actions.
    (c) Monitoring. (1) The responsible official must include scientists 
in the design and evaluation of monitoring strategies. Additionally, the 
responsible official must provide for an independent, scientific peer 
review of plan monitoring on at least a biennial basis to validate 
adherence to appropriate protocols and methods in collecting and 
processing of monitoring samples and to validate that data are 
summarized and interpreted properly.
    (2) When appropriate and practicable, the responsible official 
should include scientists in the review of monitoring data and 
analytical results to determine trends relative to ecological, economic, 
or social sustainability.


<R05>
Sec. 219.24  Science consistency evaluations.

    (a) The responsible official must ensure that plan amendments and 
revisions are consistent with the best available science. The 
responsible official may use a science advisory board (Sec. 219.25) to 
assist in determining whether information gathered, evaluations 
conducted, or analyses and conclusions reached in the planning process 
are consistent with the best available science. If the responsible 
official decides to use a science advisory board, the board and the 
responsible official are to jointly establish criteria for the science 
advisory board and the responsible official to use in reviewing the 
consistency of proposed plan amendments and revisions with the best 
available science.
    (b) The science advisory board is responsible for organizing and 
conducting a scientific consistency evaluation to determine the 
following:
    (1) If relevant scientific (ecological, social, or economic) 
information has been considered by the responsible official in a manner 
consistent with current scientific understanding at the appropriate 
scales;
    (2) If uncertainty of knowledge has been recognized, acknowledged, 
and adequately documented; and
    (3) If the level of risk in achievement of sustainability is 
acknowledged and adequately documented by the responsible official.
    (c) If substantial disagreement among members of the science 
advisory board or between the science advisory board and the responsible 
official is identified during a science consistency evaluation, a 
summary of such disagreement should be noted in the appropriate 
environmental documentation within Forest Service NEPA procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 219.25  Science advisory boards.

    (a) National science advisory board. The Forest Service Deputy Chief 
for Research and Development must establish, convene, and chair a 
science advisory board to provide scientific advice on issues identified 
by the Chief of the Forest Service. Board membership

[[Page 55]]

must represent a broad range of scientific disciplines including, but 
not limited to, the physical, biological, economic, and social sciences.
    (b) Regional science advisory boards. Based upon needs identified by 
Regional Forester(s) or Research Station Director(s), the Forest Service 
Research Station Director(s), should establish and convene science 
advisory boards consistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 
U.S.C. app.) to provide advice to one or more Regional Foresters 
regarding the application of science in planning and decisionmaking for 
National Forest System lands. At least one regional science advisory 
board must be available for each national forest and grassland. The 
Station Director(s) must chair the board or appoint a chair of such 
boards. The geographical boundaries of the boards need not align with 
National Forest System Regional boundaries. Board membership must 
represent a broad range of science disciplines including, but not 
limited to, the physical, biological, economic, and social sciences. 
Regional science advisory board tasks may include, but are not limited, 
to:
    (1) Evaluating significance and relevance of new information related 
to current plan decisions, including the results of monitoring and 
evaluation; and
    (2) Evaluating science consistency as described in Sec. 219.24.
    (c) Work groups. With the concurrence of the appropriate chair and 
subject to available funding, the national or regional science advisory 
boards may convene work groups to study issues and provide 
recommendations.

                         Special Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 219.26  Identifying and designating suitable uses.

    National forests and grasslands are suitable for a wide variety of 
public uses, such as outdoor recreation, livestock grazing, timber 
harvest, off-road vehicle travel, or other uses except where lands are 
determined to be unsuited for a particular use. Lands are not suited for 
a particular use if that use: is prohibited by law, regulation, or 
Executive Order; is incompatible with the mission or policies of the 
National Forest System; or would result in substantial and permanent 
impairment of the productivity of the land. Through a plan amendment or 
revision, the responsible official may determine whether specific uses 
may begin, continue, or terminate within the plan area. Planning 
documents should describe or display lands suitable for various uses in 
areas large enough to provide sufficient latitude for periodic 
adjustments in use to conform to changing needs and conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 219.27  Special designations.

    The Forest Service may recommend special designations to higher 
authorities or, to the extent permitted by law, adopt special 
designations through plan amendment or revision. Special designations 
are areas within the National Forest System that are identified for 
their unique or special characteristics and include the following:
    (a) Congressionally designated areas. Congressionally designated 
areas may include, but are not limited to, wilderness, wild and scenic 
rivers, national trails, scenic areas, recreation areas, and monuments. 
These nationally significant areas must be managed as required by 
Congress and may have specific requirements for their management.
    (b) Wilderness area reviews. Unless federal statute directs 
otherwise, all undeveloped areas that are of sufficient size as to make 
practicable their preservation and use in an unimpaired condition must 
be evaluated for recommended wilderness designation during the plan 
revision process. These areas may be evaluated at other times as 
determined by the responsible official.
    (c) Administratively designated areas. Administratively designated 
areas may include, but are not limited to, critical watersheds, research 
natural areas, national monuments, geological areas, inventoried 
roadless areas, unroaded areas, motorized and non-motorized recreation 
areas, botanical areas, and scenic byways.


<R05>
Sec. 219.28  Determination of land suitable for timber harvest.

    (a) Lands where timber may not be harvested. The plan must identify 
lands

[[Page 56]]

within the plan area where timber may not be harvested. These lands 
include:
    (1) Lands where timber harvest would violate statute, Executive 
Order, or regulation and those lands that have been withdrawn from 
timber harvest by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief of the 
Forest Service;
    (2) Lands where technology is not available for conducting timber 
harvesting without causing irreversible damage to soil, slope, or other 
watershed conditions or produce substantial and permanent impairment of 
the productivity of the land; and
    (3) Lands where there are no assurances that such lands can be 
adequately restocked within 5 years after harvest;
    (b) Lands where timber may be harvested for timber production. The 
responsible official may establish timber production as a multiple-use 
plan objective for lands not identified in paragraph (a) of this section 
if the costs of timber production are justified by the ecological, 
social, or economic benefits considering physical, economic, and other 
pertinent factors to the extent feasible. Lands where timber production 
is not established as a plan objective are deemed not suited for timber 
production. These lands must be reviewed by the responsible official at 
least once every 10 years, or as prescribed by law, to determine their 
suitability for timber production considering physical, economic, and 
other pertinent factors to the extent feasible. Based on this review, 
timber production may be established as a plan objective for these lands 
through amendment or revision of the plan.
    (c) Lands where timber may be harvested for other multiple-use 
values. Except for lands identified in paragraph (a) of this section, 
timber may be harvested from land where timber production is not 
established as a plan objective if, based on a site-specific analysis, 
the responsible official determines and documents that such timber 
harvest would contribute to achievement of desired conditions and 
ecological sustainability, and is necessary to protect multiple-use 
values other than timber production.


<R05>
Sec. 219.29  Limitation on timber harvest.

    (a) Estimate of the limitation of timber harvest. The responsible 
official must estimate the amount of timber that can be sold annually in 
perpetuity on a sustained-yield basis from National Forest System lands 
other than those identified in Sec. 219.28(a). This estimate must be 
based on the yield of timber that can be removed consistent with 
achievement of objectives or desired conditions in the applicable plan. 
In those cases where a national forest has less than 200,000 acres of 
forested land identified in lands other than those in Sec. 219.28(a), 
two or more national forests may be combined for the purpose of 
estimating amount of timber that can be sold annually on a sustained-
yield basis. Estimations for lands where timber production is 
established as a plan objective Sec. 219.28(b) and estimations for lands 
identified in Sec. 219.28(c) cannot be combined.
    (b) Limitation of timber harvest. The responsible official must 
limit the sale of timber from the lands where timber production is an 
objective and from other lands to a quantity equal to or less than that 
estimated in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions to limitations of timber harvest. For purposes of 
limiting the sale of timber, the responsible official may sell timber 
from areas that are substantially affected by fire, wind, or other 
events, or for which there is an imminent threat from insects or 
disease, and may either substitute such timber for timber that would 
otherwise be sold or, if not feasible, sell such timber over and above 
the plan limit established in paragraph (b) of this section. If 
departure from the quantity of timber removal established in paragraph 
(b) of this section is necessary to meet overall multiple-use 
objectives, the requirements in 16 U.S.C. 1611 must be followed.

                         Planning Documentation


<R05>
Sec. 219.30  Plan documentation.

    A plan is a repository of documents that integrates and displays the 
desired conditions, objectives, standards, and other plan decisions that 
apply to a unit of the National Forest System.

[[Page 57]]

The plan also contains maps, monitoring and evaluation results, the 
annual monitoring and evaluation report, and other information relevant 
to how the plan area is to be managed. Planning documents should be 
clear, understandable, and readily available for public review. Plan 
documents should be updated through amendments, revision, and routine 
maintenance (Sec. 219.31). Plan documents include, at a minimum, the 
following:
    (a) A summary of the plan. The summary is a concise description of 
the plan that includes a summary of the plan decisions and a description 
of the plan area and appropriate planning units. The summary should 
include a brief description of the ecological, social, and economic 
environments within the plan area and the overall strategy for 
maintenance or restoration of sustainability, including desired 
conditions and objectives for their achievement. The summary also 
includes appropriate maps, a description of the transportation system, 
utility corridors, land ownership patterns and proposed land ownership 
adjustments, charts, figures, photographs, and other information to 
enhance understanding.
    (b) Display of public uses. The plan documents must identify the 
suitability of the plan area for various uses (Sec. 219.26) such as 
recreation uses, livestock grazing, timber harvest, and mineral 
developments. The plan documents must identify land where timber may not 
be harvested and where timber production is an objective (Sec. 219.28). 
The plan documents also must describe the limitations on the removal of 
timber (Sec. 219.29) and the standards for timber harvest and 
regeneration methods (Sec. 219.7(c)).
    (c) Plan decisions. The plan documents must display or describe the 
plan decisions (Sec. 219.7).
    (d) Display of actions and outcomes. The plan documents must also 
contain:
    (1) An annually updated list or other display of proposed, 
authorized, and completed actions to achieve desired conditions and 
objectives within the plan area;
    (2) A 2-year schedule, updated annually, of anticipated outcomes 
which may include anticipated uses, values, products, or services based 
on an estimate of Forest Service budget and capacity to perform the 
identified program of work. The estimate of Forest Service budget and 
capacity should be based on recent funding levels;
    (3) A 2-year summary, updated annually, of the actual outcomes which 
may include specific uses, values, products, or services provided as a 
result of completed site-specific actions;
    (4) A projected range of outcomes which may include anticipated 
uses, values, products, and services for the next 15 years, assuming 
current or likely budgets while considering other spending levels as 
appropriate. These projections are estimates and as such often contain a 
high degree of uncertainty; they are intended to describe expected 
progress in achieving desired conditions and objectives within the plan 
area. The projections are to be updated during revision of each plan;
    (5) A description of the monitoring strategy to occur in the plan 
area and the annual monitoring and evaluation report; and
    (6) A summary of the projected program of work, updated annually, 
including costs for inventories, assessments, proposed and authorized 
actions, and monitoring. The projected program of work must be based on 
reasonably anticipated funding levels. Reasonably anticipated funding 
levels should be based on recent funding levels. The plan documents must 
also include a description of the total current-year budget, funded 
actions, projections for future budgets over the next 2 years; and a 
display of the budget trends over at least the past 5 years.
    (e) Other components. A plan must contain or reference a list of 
materials, Forest Service policies, and decisions used in forming plan 
decisions. The information should include, but is not limited to, lists 
of previous decision and environmental documents, assessments, 
conservation agreements and strategies, biological opinions, 
inventories, administrative studies, monitoring results, and research 
relevant to adoption of plan decisions.

[[Page 58]]


<R05>
Sec. 219.31  Maintenance of the plan and planning records.

    (a) Each National Forest or Grassland Supervisor must maintain a 
complete set of the planning documents required under Sec. 219.30 that 
constitute the plan for the unit. The set of documents must be readily 
available to the public using appropriate and relevant technology.
    (b) The following administrative corrections and additions may be 
made at any time, are not plan amendments or revisions, and do not 
require public notice or the preparation of an environmental document 
under Forest Service NEPA procedures:
    (1) Corrections and updates of data and maps;
    (2) Updates to activity lists and schedules as required by 
Sec. 219.30(d)(1)-(6);
    (3) Corrections of typographical errors or other non-substantive 
changes; and
    (4) Changes in monitoring methods other than those required in a 
monitoring strategy (Sec. 219.11(c)).

                         Objections and Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 219.32  Objections to amendments or revisions.

    (a) Any person may object to a proposed amendment or revision 
prepared under the provisions of this subpart, except for an amendment 
or revision proposed by the Chief. The objection must be filed within 30 
calendar days from the date that the Environmental Protection Agency 
publishes the notice of availability of a final environmental impact 
statement regarding a proposed amendment or revision in the Federal 
Register, or within 30 calendar days of the publication of a public 
notice of a proposed amendment not requiring preparation of an 
environmental impact statement. Within ten days after the close of the 
objection period, the Responsible Official shall publish notice of all 
objections in the local newspaper of record. An objection must be filed 
with the reviewing officer identified in the notice and contain:
    (1) The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the person 
filing the objection;
    (2) A specific statement of the basis for each objection; and
    (3) A description of the objector's participation in the planning 
process for the proposed amendment or revision, including a copy of any 
relevant documents submitted during the planning process.
    (b) Objectors may request meetings with the reviewing officer and 
the responsible official to discuss the objection, to narrow the issues, 
agree on facts, and explore opportunities for resolution. The reviewing 
officer must allow other interested persons to participate in such 
meetings. An interested person must file a request to participate in an 
objection within ten days after publication of the notice of objection 
as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The reviewing officer must respond, in writing, to an objection 
within a reasonable period of time and may respond to all objections in 
one response. The reviewing officer's response regarding an objection is 
the final decision of the Department of Agriculture.
    (d) The responsible official may not approve a proposed amendment or 
revision until the reviewing officer has responded to all objections. A 
decision by the responsible official approving an amendment or revision 
must be consistent with the reviewing officer's response to objections 
to the proposed amendment or revision.
    (e) Where the Forest Service is a participant in a multi-agency 
decision subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible 
official and reviewing officer may waive the objection procedures of 
this subpart to adopt the administrative review procedure of another 
participating federal agency, if the responsible official and the 
responsible official of the other agencies agree to provide a joint 
response to those who have filed for administrative review of the multi-
agency decision.
    (f) The information collection requirements of this section have 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned 
control number 0596-0158.

[[Page 59]]


<R05>
Sec. 219.33  Appeals of site-specific decisions.

    If a site-specific decision is proposed in conjunction with a plan 
amendment or revision, a person may object to the proposed plan 
amendment or revision as described in (Sec. 219.32). If a decision is 
made to authorize a site-specific action, a person may request 
administrative review of that decision as described in 36 CFR part 215.

                      Applicability and Transition


<R05>
Sec. 219.34  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all units of the 
National Forest System as defined by 16 U.S.C. 1609.


<R05>
Sec. 219.35  Transition.

    (a) The transition period begins on November 9, 2000 and ends upon 
the completion of the revision process (Sec. 219.9) for each unit of the 
National Forest System. During the transition period, the responsible 
official must consider the best available science in implementing and, 
if appropriate, amending the current plan.
    (b) Until the Department promulgates the revised final planning 
regulations announced in the December 3, 2001, Semiannual Unified Agenda 
of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, a responsible official 
may elect to continue or to initiate new plan amendments or revisions 
under the 1982 planning regulations in effect prior to November 9, 2000 
(See 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, Revised as of July 1, 2001), or the 
responsible official may conduct the amendment or revision process in 
conformance with the provisions of this subpart. For the purposes of 
this paragraph, the reference to initiation of a plan amendment or 
revision means that the agency has issued a Notice of Intent or other 
public notification announcing the commencement of a plan amendment or 
revision as provided for in the Council on Environmental Quality 
regulations at 40 CFR 1501.7 or in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, 
Environmental Policy and Procedures Handbook, section 11.
    (c) If a review of lands not suited for timber production is 
required before the completion of the revision process, the review must 
take place as described by the provisions of Sec. 219.28, except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Site-specific decisions made by the responsible official 3 years 
from November 9, 2000 and afterward must be in conformance with the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (e) Within 1 year of November 9, 2000, the Regional Forester must 
withdraw the regional guide. When a regional guide is withdrawn, the 
Regional Forester must identify the decisions in the regional guide that 
are to be transferred to a regional supplement of the Forest Service 
directive system (36 CFR 200.4) or to one or more plans and give notice 
in the Federal Register of these actions. The transfer of direction from 
a regional guide to a regional supplement of the Forest Service 
directive system or to one or more plans does not constitute an 
amendment, revision, or site-specific action subject to Forest Service 
NEPA procedures.
    (f) Within 3 years after completion of the revision process for a 
unit, the responsible official must complete the first monitoring and 
evaluation report as required in Sec. 219.11(f).
    (g) Within 1 year of November 9, 2000, the Chief of the Forest 
Service must establish a schedule for completion of the revision process 
for each unit of the National Forest System.

                        Appendix A to Sec. 219.35

            Interpretive Rule Related to Paragraph 219.35(b)

    The Department is making explicit its preexisting understanding of 
paragraph (b) of this section with regard to the appeal or objection 
procedures that may be applied to amendments or revisions of land and 
resource management plans during the transition from the appeal 
procedures of 36 CFR part 217 in effect prior to November 9, 2000 (See 
CFR 36 parts 200 to 299, Revised as of July 1, 2000), to the objection 
procedures of Sec. 219.32 as follows:
    1. The option to proceed under the 1982 regulations or under the 
provisions of this subpart specifically includes the option to select 
either the administrative appeal and review procedures of 36 CFR part 
217 in effect prior to November 9, 2000, or the objection procedures of 
36 CFR 219.32.
    2. The Department interprets the term ``initiated,'' as used in 
paragraph (b) of this section, to indicate that the agency has

[[Page 60]]

issued a Notice of Intent or other public notification announcing the 
commencement of a plan revision or amendment as provided for in the 
Council on Environmental Quality regulations at 40 CFR 1501.7 or in 
Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, Environmental Policy and Procedures 
Handbook, section 11.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 219.36  Definitions.

    Definitions of the special terms used in this subpart are set out in 
alphabetical order in this section as follows:
    Adaptive management: An approach to natural resource management 
wherein the effects of policies, plans, and actions are monitored for 
the purpose of learning and adjusting future management actions. 
Successive iteration of the adaptive process is essential in 
contributing to sustainability.
    Assessment or analysis area: The geographic area included within the 
scope of a broad-scale assessment or local analysis.
    Candidate species: Species identified by the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service 
(NMFS), which are considered to be candidates for listing under the 
Endangered Species Act as published in the Federal Register.
    Conservation agreement: A formal agreement between the Forest 
Service and the USFWS and/or NMFS identifying management actions 
necessary to prevent the need to list species under the Endangered 
Species Act.
    Current climatic period: The period of time since establishment of 
the modern major vegetation types, which typically encompass the late 
Holocene Epoch including the present, including likely climatic 
conditions within the planning period. The climatic period is typically 
centuries to millennia in length, a period of time that is long enough 
to encompass the variability that species and ecosystems have 
experienced.
    Desired condition: A statement describing a common vision for a 
specific area of land or type of land within the plan area. Statements 
of desired conditions should include the estimated time required for 
their achievement.
    Desired non-native species: Those species of plants or animals which 
are not indigenous to an area but valued for their contribution to 
species diversity or their high social, cultural or economic value.
    Disturbance regime: Actions, functions, or events that influence or 
maintain the structure, composition, or function of terrestrial or 
aquatic ecosystems. Natural disturbances include, among others, drought, 
floods, wind, fires, insects, and pathogens. Human-caused disturbances 
include actions such as recreational use, livestock grazing, mining, 
road construction, timber harvest, and the introduction of exotic 
species.
    Diversity of plant and animal communities: The distribution and 
relative abundance of plant and animal communities and their component 
species occurring within an area.
    Ecological conditions: Components of the biological and physical 
environment that can affect the diversity of plant and animal 
communities, including species viability, and the productive capacity of 
ecological systems. These could include the abundance and distribution 
of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, roads and other structural 
developments, human uses, and invasive and exotic species.
    Ecological sustainability: The maintenance or restoration of the 
composition, structure, and processes of ecosystems including the 
diversity of plant and animal communities and the productive capacity of 
ecological systems.
    Ecosystem composition: The plant and animal species and communities 
in the plan area.
    Ecosystem processes: Ecological functions such as photosynthesis, 
energy flow, nutrient cycling, water movement, disturbance, and 
succession.
    Ecosystem structure: The biological and physical attributes that 
characterize ecological systems.
    Focal species: Focal species are surrogate measures used in the 
evaluation of ecological sustainability, including species and ecosystem 
diversity. The key characteristic of a focal species is

[[Page 61]]

that its status and trend provide insights to the integrity of the 
larger ecological system to which it belongs. Individual species, or 
groups of species that use habitat in similar ways or which perform 
similar ecological functions, may be identified as focal species. Focal 
species serve an umbrella function in terms of encompassing habitats 
needed for many other species, play a key role in maintaining community 
structure or processes, are sensitive to the changes likely to occur in 
the area, or otherwise serve as an indicator of ecological 
sustainability. Certain focal species may be used as surrogates to 
represent ecological conditions that provide for viability of some other 
species, rather than directly representing the population dynamics of 
those other species.
    Forest Service NEPA procedures: The Forest Service policy and 
procedures for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
and the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR chapter V) 
as described in Chapter 1950 of the Forest Service Manual and Forest 
Service Handbook 1909.15, Environmental Policy and Procedures Handbook 
(See 36 CFR 200.4 for availability).
    Inherently rare species: A species is inherently rare if it occurs 
in only a limited number of locations, has low population numbers, or 
has both limited occurrences and low population numbers, and those 
conditions are natural characteristics of the life history and ecology 
of the species and not primarily the result of human disturbance.
    Inventoried roadless areas: Areas are identified in a set of 
inventoried roadless area maps, contained in Forest Service Roadless 
Area Conservation, Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Volume 2, dated 
May 2000, which are held at the National headquarters office of the 
Forest Service, or any subsequent update or revision of those maps.
    Major vegetation types: Plant communities, which are typically named 
after dominant plant species that are characteristic of the macroclimate 
and geology of the region or sub-region.
    Native species: Species of the plant and animal kingdom indigenous 
to the plan area or assessment area.
    Plan area: The geographic area of National Forest System lands 
covered by an individual land and resource management plan. The area may 
include one or more administrative units.
    Productive capacity of ecological systems: The ability of an 
ecosystem to maintain primary productivity including its ability to 
sustain desirable conditions such as clean water, fertile soil, riparian 
habitat, and the diversity of plant and animal species; to sustain 
desirable human uses; and to renew itself following disturbance.
    Range of variability: The expected range of variation in ecosystem 
composition, and structure that would be expected under natural 
disturbance regimes in the current climatic period. These regimes 
include the type, frequency, severity, and magnitude of disturbance in 
the absence of fire suppression and extensive commodity extraction.
    Reference landscapes: Places identified in the plan area where the 
conditions and trends of ecosystem composition, structure, and processes 
are deemed useful for setting objectives for desired conditions and for 
judging the effectiveness of plan decisions.
    Responsible official: The officer with the authority and 
responsibility to oversee the planning process and make decisions on 
proposed actions.
    Reviewing officer: The supervisor of the responsible official.
    Social and economic sustainability: Meeting the economic, social, 
aesthetic, and cultural needs and desires of current generations without 
reducing the capacity of the environment to provide for the needs and 
desires of future generations, considering both local communities and 
the nation as a whole. It also involves the capacity of citizens to 
communicate effectively with each other and to make sound choices about 
their environment.
    Species: Any member of the animal or plant kingdom that is described 
as a species in a peer-reviewed scientific publication and is identified 
as a species by the responsible official pursuant to a plan decision, 
and must include all species listed under the Endangered Species Act as 
threatened, endangered, candidate, or proposed for listing by the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife

[[Page 62]]

Service or National Marine Fisheries Service.
    Species-at-risk: Federally listed endangered, threatened, candidate, 
and proposed species and other species for which loss of viability, 
including reduction in distribution or abundance, is a concern within 
the plan area. Other species-at-risk may include sensitive species and 
state listed species. A species-at-risk also may be selected as a focal 
species.
    Species viability: A species consisting of self-sustaining and 
interacting populations that are well distributed through the species' 
range. Self-sustaining populations are those that are sufficiently 
abundant and have sufficient diversity to display the array of life 
history strategies and forms to provide for their long-term persistence 
and adaptability over time.
    Successional stages: The different structural and compositional 
phases of vegetation development of forests and grasslands that occur 
over time following disturbances that kill, remove, or reduce vegetation 
and include the major developmental or seral stages that occur within a 
particular environment.
    Timber production: The sustained long-term and periodic harvest of 
wood fiber from National Forest System lands undertaken in support of 
social and economic objectives identified in one or more land and 
resource management plans. For purposes of this regulation, the term 
timber production includes fuel wood.
    Undeveloped areas: Areas, including but not limited to inventoried 
roadless areas and unroaded areas, within national forests or grasslands 
that are of sufficient size and generally untrammeled by human 
activities such that they are appropriate for consideration for 
wilderness designation in the planning process.
    Unroaded areas: Any area, without the presence of a classified road, 
of a size and configuration sufficient to protect the inherent 
characteristics associated with its roadless condition. Unroaded areas 
do not overlap with inventoried roadless areas.

grazing and livestock use on National Forest System lands and on other 
lands under Forest Service control must be authorized by a grazing or 
livestock use permit.
    (b) Grazing permits and livestock use permits convey no right, 
title, or interest held by the United States in any lands or resources.
    (c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to issue permits for 
livestock grazing and other use by livestock of the National Forest 
System and on other lands under Forest Service control as follows:
    (1) Grazing permits with priority for renewal may be issued as 
follows: On National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States 10-year 
term permits will be issued unless the land is pending disposal, or will 
be devoted to other uses prior to the end of ten years, or it will be in 
the best interest of sound land management to specify a shorter term. On 
National Forest System lands other than National Forests in the 16 
contiguous western States, the permit term shall be for periods of 10 
years or less. Term grazing permits for periods of 10 years or less in 
the form of grazing agreements may be issued to cooperative grazing 
associations or similar organizations incorporated or otherwise 
established pursuant to State law. Such an agreement will make National 
Forest System lands and improvements available to the association for 
grazing in accordance with provisions of the grazing agreement and 
Forest Service policies. Term permits authorized in this paragraph may 
be in the form of private land or on-and-off grazing permits where the 
person is qualified to hold such permits under provisions the Chief may 
require. Permits issued under this paragraph are subject to the 
following:
    (i) Except as provided for by the Chief, Forest Service, paid term 
permits will be issued to persons who own livestock to be grazed and 
such base property as may be required, provided the land is determined 
to be available for grazing purposes by the Chief, Forest Service, and 
the capacity exists to graze specified numbers of animals.
    (ii) A term permit holder has first priority for receipt of a new 
permit at the end of the term period provided he has fully complied with 
the terms and conditions of the expiring permit.

[[Page 66]]

    (iii) In order to update terms and conditions, term permits may be 
cancelled at the end of the calendar year of the midyear of the decade 
(1985, 1995, etc.), provided they are reissued to the existing permit 
holder for a new term of 10 years.
    (iv) New term permits may be issued to the purchaser of a 
permittee's permitted livestock and/or base property, provided the 
permittee waives his term permit to the United States and provided the 
purchaser is otherwise eligible and qualified.
    (v) If the permittee chooses to dispose of all or part of his base 
property or permitted livestock (not under approved nonuse) but does not 
choose to waive his term permit, the Forest Supervisor will give written 
notice that he no longer is qualified to hold a permit, provided he is 
given up to one year to reestablish his qualifications before 
cancellation action is final.
    (vi) The Chief, Forest Service, shall prescribe provisions and 
requirements under which term permits will be issued, renewed, and 
administered, including:
    (A) The amount and character of base property and livestock the

and on a charge basis, may be issued:
    (A) To allow for use of range while a term grazing permit is held in 
suspension.
    (B) To use forage created by unusually favorable climatic 
conditions.
    (C) To use the forage available when the permit of the normal user's 
livestock is in nonuse status for reasons of personal convenience.
    (D) To allow a person to continue to graze livestock for the 
remainder of the grazing season where base property has been sold, the 
permit waived, and a new term permit issued.
    (E) To allow grazing use in the event of drought or other emergency 
of National or Regional scope where such use would not result in 
permanent resource damage.
    (ii) Livestock use permits for not to exceed one year may be issued 
under terms and conditions prescribed by the Chief, Forest Service, as

for failing to comply with Federal laws or regulations or State laws 
relating to protection of air, water, soil and vegetation, fish and 
wildlife, and other environmental values when exercising the grazing use 
authorized by the permit.
    (7) Modify the terms and conditions of a permit to conform to 
current situations brought about by changes in law, regulation, 
executive order, development or revision of an allotment management 
plan, or other management needs.
    (8) Modify the seasons of use, numbers, kind, and class of livestock 
allowed or the allotment to be used under the permit, because of 
resource condition, or permittee request. One year's notice will be 
given of such modification, except in cases of emergency.
    (b) Association permits or grazing agreements may be canceled for 
noncompliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and

Sec. 222.6  Compensation for permittees' interest in authorized permanent improvements.

    (a) Whenever a term permit for grazing livestock on National Forest 
land in the 16 contiguous western States is canceled in whole or in part 
to devote the lands covered by the permit to another public purpose, 
including disposal, the permittee shall receive from the United States a 
reasonable compensation for the adjusted value of his interest in 
authorized permanent improvements placed or constructed by him on the 
lands covered by the canceled permit. The adjusted value is to be 
determined by the Chief, Forest Service. Compensation received shall not 
exceed the fair market value of the terminated portion of the 
permittee's interest therein.
    (b) In the event a permittee waives his grazing permit in connection 
with sale of his base property or permitted

[[Page 68]]

livestock, he is not entitled to compensation.

Sec. 222.7  Cooperation in management.

    (a) Cooperation with local livestock associations--(1) Authority. 
The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to recognize, cooperate with, 
and assist local livestock associations in the management of the 
livestock and range resources on a single range allotment, associated 
groups of allotments, or other association-controlled lands on which the 
members' livestock are permitted to graze.
    (2) Purposes. These associations will provide the means for the 
members to:
    (i) Manage their permitted livestock and the range resources.
    (ii) Meet jointly with Forest officers to discuss and formulate 
programs for management of their livestock and the range resources.
    (iii) Express their wishes through their designated officers or 
committees.
    (iv) Share costs for handling of livestock, construction and 
maintenance of range improvements or other accepted programs deemed 
needed for proper management of the permitted livestock and range 
resources.
    (v) Formulate association special rules needed to ensure proper 
resource management.
    (3) Requirements for recognition. The requirements for receiving 
recognition by the Forest Supervisor are:
    (i) The members of the association must constitute a majority of the 
grazing permittees on the range allotment or allotments involved.
    (ii) The officers of the association must be elected by a majority 
of the association members or of a quorum as specified by the 
association's constitution and bylaws.
    (iii) The officers other than the Secretary and Treasurer must be 
grazing permittees on the range allotment or allotments involved.
    (iv) The association's activities must be governed by a constitution 
and bylaws acceptable to the Forest Supervisor and approved by him.

recognition of the association whenever:
    (i) The majority of the grazing permittees request that the 
association be dissolved.
    (ii) The association becomes inactive, and does not meet in annual 
or special meetings during a consecutive 2-year period.
    (b) Cooperation with national, State, and county livestock 
organizations. The policies and programs of national, State, and county 
livestock organizations give direction to, and reflect in, the practices 
of their members. Good working relationships with these groups is 
conducive to the betterment of range management on both public and 
private lands. The Chief, Forest Service, will endeavor to establish and 
maintain close working relationships with National livestock 
organizations who have an interest in the administration of National 
Forest System lands, and direct Forest officers to work cooperatively 
with State and county livestock organizations having similar interests.
    (c) Interagency cooperation. The Chief, Forest Service, will 
cooperate with other Federal agencies which have interest in improving 
range management on public and private lands.
    (d) Cooperation with others. The Chief, Forest Service, will 
cooperate with other agencies, institutions, organizations, and 
individuals who have interest in improvement of range management on 
public and private lands.

or State agencies and institutions in surveillance of pesticides spray 
programs; and
    (3) State cattle and sheep sanitary or brand boards in control of 
estray and unbranded livestock to the extent it does not conflict with 
the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of December 15, 1971.
    (b) The Chief, Forest Service, will cooperate with county or other 
local weed control districts in analyzing noxious farm weed problems and 
developing control programs in areas of which the National Forests and 
National Grasslands are a part.

    (2) Relocate animals to other National Forest System lands which 
were identified as 1971 wild horse or burro territory, providing 
suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize 
vegetation condition;
    (3) Relocate animals to other federally-owned lands which were 
identified as 1971 wild horse or burro occupied lands, providing 
suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize 
vegetation condition and animals are requested by the appropriate land 
manager having jurisdiction;
    (4) Place animals under private maintenance and care agreements 
where there is an adoption demand by qualified individuals, groups, or 
Government agency, and for which there is assurance of humane treatment 
and care, provided not more than four animals are placed under private 
maintenance and care agreements per year to any individual, 
organization, or government agency unless there is a determination 
expressed otherwise in writing, by an authorized Forest Service Officer; 
and
    (5) Excess animals, for which an adoption demand by qualified 
applicants does not exist, shall be destroyed in the most humane manner 
possible, and if several methods are equally humane, select the most 
cost efficient.
    (d) Where excess animals have been placed under private maintenance 
and care agreements after December 15, 1971, as provided for in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and animals have been provided humane 
conditions, treatment, and care, for a period of one year, the Chief, 
Forest Service, may grant title to not more than four animals per year 
to each individual, organization, or government agency.
    (e) The applicants must make written application for title and/or 
adoption, must be of legal age in the State in which they reside, and 
must pay fees for adoption and transportation as follows:
    (1) The application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable advance 
payment of $25 by guaranteed remittance. If custody of a wild, free-
roaming horse or burro is granted by the authorized Forest Service 
officer, the advance payment shall be applied against the adoption fee 
required to be paid at the time the maintenance and care agreement 
Sec. 222.29(c)(4) is executed.
    (2) The Forest Service shall charge an adoption fee of $125 for each 
horse and $75 for each burro, except that there shall be no adoption fee 
for an unweaned offspring under 6 months of age accompanying its mother.
    (3) Any transportation costs incurred for the transportation of the 
animal(s) to the point of pickup must be paid before an approved 
individual, group, or government agency takes custody of the animal(s).
    (f) Humane conditions, treatment, and care must have been provided 
for no less that one year preceding the filing of the application for 
title. The conveyance of title shall include a written statement by an 
authorized officer attesting that the animal is in good condition.

<R05>
Sec. 222.50  General procedures.

    (a) Fees shall be charged for all livestock grazing or livestock use 
of National Forest system lands, or other lands under Forest Service 
control. An

[[Page 77]]

exception is livestock authorized free of charge under provisions of 
Sec. 222.3(c)(2)(ii) (B) through (G).
    (b) Guiding establishment of fees are the law and general 
governmental policy as established by Bureau of the Budget (now, Office 
of Management and Budget) Circular A-25 of September 23, 1959, which 
directs that a fair market value be obtained for all services and 
resources provided the public through establishment of a system of 
reasonable fee charges, and that the users be afford equitable 
treatment. This policy precludes a monetary consideration in the fee 
structure for any permit value that may be capitalized into the permit 
holder's private ranching operation.
    (c) A grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock 
grazing or use. A head month is a month's use and occupancy of range by 
one animal, except for sheep or goats. A full head month's fee is 
charged for a month of grazing by adult animals; if the grazing animal 
is weaned or 6 months of age or older at the time of entering National 
Forest System lands; or will become 12 months of age during the 
permitted period of use. For fee purposes 5 sheep or goats, weaned or 
adult, are equivalent to one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, or mule.
    (d) No additional charge will be made for the privilege of lambing 
upon National Forest System lands, or other lands under Forest Service 
control.
    (e) Transportation livestock may be charged for at a special rate, 
and at a minimum established for such use. Fees for horses, mules, or 
burros associated with management of permitted livestock on an 
allotment, or for research purposes and administrative studies, and 
authorized on a charge basis, are determined under provisions of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) The fees for trailing livestock across National Forest System 
lands will conform with the rates established for other livestock. Where 
practicable, fees for trailing permitted livestock will be covered in 
the regular grazing fee and the crossing period covered in the regular 
grazing period.
    (g) All fees for livestock grazing or livestock use of National 
Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control are 
payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, entry, or 
livestock use unless otherwise authorized by the Chief, Forest Service.
    (h) Unauthorized grazing use rate will be determined by establishing 
a base value without giving consideration for those contributions 
normally made by the permittee under terms of the grazing permit. The 
base will be adjusted annually by the same indexes used to adjust the 
regular fee. This rate will also apply to excess number of livestock 
grazing by permittees; to livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing 
season; or to livestock grazed under an unvalidated permit.
    (i) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions 
and circumstances as the Chief, Forest Service, may specify.
    (j) The fee year for the purpose of charging grazing fees will be 
March 1 through the following February.
    (k) The data year for the purpose of collecting beef cattle price 
data for computing indexes will be November 1 through the following 
October and apply to the following fee year.

<R05>
Sec. 222.51  National Forests in 16 Western States.

    (a) Grazing fees are established on lands designated National 
Forests and Land Utilization Projects in the 16 contiguous Western 
States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South 
Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. (National Grasslands are 
excluded, see Sec. 222.52.)
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 222.50, paragraph (b), 
the calculated grazing fee for 1988 and subsequent grazing fee years 
represents the economic value of the use of the land to the user and is 
the product of multiplying the base fair market value of $1.23 by the 
result of the annual Forage Value Index, added to the sum of the Beef 
Cattle Price Index minus the Prices Paid Index and divided by 100; 
provided, that the annual increase or decrease in such fee for any given 
year

[[Page 78]]

shall be limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the 
previous year's fee, and provided further, that the fee shall not be 
less than $1.35 per head per month. The indexes used in this formula are 
as follows:
    (1) Forage Value Index means the weighted average estimate of the 
annual rental charge per head per month for pasturing cattle on private 
rangelands in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and 
Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) from 
the June Enumerative Survey) divided by $3.65 per head month and 
multiplied by 100;
    (2) Beef Cattle Price Index means the weighted average annual 
selling price for beef cattle (excluding calves) in the 11 Western 
States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, 
Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National 
Agricultural Statistics Service) for November through October (computed 
by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) divided by $22.04 per 
hundred weight and multiplied by 100; and
    (3) Prices Paid Index means the following selected components from 
the National Agricultural Statistics Service ``Annual National Index of 
Prices Paid by Farmers for Goods and Services'' adjusted by the weights 
indicated in parentheses to reflect livestock production costs in the 
Western States:

1. Fuels and Energy (14.5);
2. Farm and Motor Supplies (12.0);
3. Autos and Trucks (4.5);
4. Tractors and Self-Propelled Machinery (4.5);
5. Other Machinery (12.0);
6. Building and Fencing Materials (14.5);
7. Interest (6.0);
8. Farm Wage Rates (14.0);
9. Farm Services (18.0).

<R05>
Sec. 222.53  Grazing fees in the East--noncompetitive procedures.

    (a) Scope. Except as provided in Sec. 222.54 of this subpart, the 
fee charged for commercial livestock grazing use and occupancy on 
National Forest System (NFS) lands in the States of New York, Missouri, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and in the Southern Region shall be determined 
through noncompetitive, fair market value procedures. These rules do not 
apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or 
National Grasslands in Texas. Grazing permits under the noncompetitive 
fee method in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit 
administration in Subpart A of this part.
    (b) Applicability. The rules of this section apply to the 
establishment of grazing fees for existing permittees in the Eastern and 
Southern Regions on National Forest System lands, including grazing 
associations in New York and Missouri as of March 1, 1990, to any 
livestock on-and-off permits defined in Subpart A of this part; and to 
any allotments advertised for competitive bidding which were not bid on 
(Sec. 222.54(h)). Noncompetitive permits vacated or terminated by an 
existing permittee and any new allotments created after the effective 
date of this rule shall be offered on a competitive bid basis as 
specified in Sec. 222.54 of this subpart. As provided in subpart A of 
this part, holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a 
new permit.
    (c) Fee System. The grazing fee charged under this section shall be 
based on fair market value, as determined by: Using comparable private 
grazing lease rates, adjusted for the difference in the costs of grazing 
comparable private leased lands and National Forest System lands, or by 
reference to prevailing prices in competitive markets for other Federal 
or State leased grazing lands that are the same or substantially similar 
to grazing lands offered or administered by the Forest Service in the 
East with comparability adjustments as appropriate. Comparable grazing 
lease rates shall be adjusted for the difference between the total costs 
of operating on leased grazing lands and the total costs (other

[[Page 79]]

than grazing fee costs) of operating on National Forest System lands.
    (1) Establishing Base Grazing Value. (i) The Chief of the Forest 
Service, or an authorized officer to whom such authority has been 
delegated, shall determine an estimated base market value of grazing use 
and occupancy on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States for 
the following designated subregions:
    (A) Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio);
    (B) Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);
    (C) Northeast (Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and 
Vermont);
    (D) Appalachia (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and 
West Virginia);
    (E) Southeast/Delta (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); and
    (F) Florida.
    (ii) The Chief or authorized officer shall revise or update 
estimated market values of grazing use and occupancy, as necessary to 
respond to significant changes in the agricultural economy in the East, 
and to ensure that fees represent fair market value.
    (iii) The Chief, or an authorized officer to whom authority has been 
delegated, where sufficient market data exist, may establish the base 
grazing value for grazing allotments using comparable, local lease rates 
for private grazing lands.
    (2) Annual Adjustment of Base Grazing Value. To maintain currency 
with the private grazing lease market, the respective base grazing 
value(s) established for grazing permits under this section shall be 
annually adjusted through a hay price index, by respective subregion. 
The hay price index means the weighted average selling price of ``other 
baled hay,'' computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by designated State and subregion. 
This index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually 
reflect the percentage change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
    (3) Computation of Annual Grazing Fee--(i) Annual Fee Basis. The 
annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the 
current period's hay price index, less the value of any agency required 
range improvements.
    (ii) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements 
for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be 
identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing 
permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the 
annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range 
improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee 
to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management 
direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource 
management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must 
involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the 
grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance 
management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, 
riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, 
or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements 
specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing 
permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course 
of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
    (4) Implementation. The grazing fee formula provided by this section 
shall be used to calculate fees for the 1990 grazing fee year. Where 
implementation would raise fees, the increase shall be phased in over a 
5-year period. Full fair market value will be reached in 5 years, 
beginning in 1990.

[55 FR 2650, Jan. 26, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 222.54  Grazing fees in the East--competitive bidding.

    (a) General Procedures--(1) Applicability. The rules of this section 
apply to grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on 
National Forest System lands in the Eastern or Southern Regions, as of 
February 26, 1990 as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments for 
such lands that have already been established under competitive 
procedures as of the date of this rule. Permits offered for competitive

[[Page 80]]

bidding in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit 
administration in subpart A of this part. The rules of this section do 
not apply to negotiated livestock use permits or permits with on-and-off 
grazing provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. Holders of 
term permits have first priority for receipt of a new term grazing 
permit in accordance with subpart A of this part. These rules also do 
not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or 
National Grasslands in Texas.
    (2) Allowable Bidders. Bids for grazing permits shall be accepted 
from individuals, partnerships, grazing associations (formed after 
February 26, 1990), joint ventures, corporations, and organizations.
    (b) Establishment of Minimum Bid Price. Authorized officers shall 
establish a minimum bid price for each available allotment as described 
in Sec. 222.53 of this subpart.
    (c) Prospectus. (1) At such time as allotments are vacated, as new 
allotments are established, or as existing competitively bid permits 
expire, the authorized officer shall prepare and advertise a prospectus 
for those allotments on which grazing will be permitted.
    (2) The prospectus shall include the terms and conditions of 
occupancy and use under the grazing permit to be issued, as well as 
document existing improvements and their condition. The prospectus shall 
also disclose the following:
    (i) Estimated market value of the forage per head month of grazing 
use;
    (ii) The minimum bid price the agency will accept;
    (iii) Any required range improvements; and
    (iv) The minimum qualifications that applicants must meet to be 
eligible for a permit.
    (3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, allotment management 
planning documents and allotment maintenance requirements, and the 
latest annual permittee instructions shall be made available to all 
prospective bidders upon request.
    (d) Submission of bid. Each applicant shall submit an application 
for the grazing permit, along with a sealed bid for the grazing fee, and 
a bid deposit of 10 percent of the total amount of the bid.
    (e) Qualifications and Deposit Refunds. Upon opening applicants 
bids, the authorized officer shall determine whether each bidder meets 
the qualifications to hold a permit as set forth in Subpart A of this 
part; and shall refund the deposit to any applicant who is not qualified 
or who does not offer the high bid.
    (f) Permit Issuance. The authorized officer shall issue the grazing 
permit to the qualified high bidder, except as provided in paragraphs 
(f)(1) and (2) of this section. The successful bidder receives the 
privilege of obtaining or renewing a grazing permit and is billed for 
the occupancy offered and forage sold.
    (1) Priority for Reissuance. On allotments where a current permit is 
expiring and competition has been held on a new grazing permit, the 
current grazing permittee shall have priority for retaining the permit. 
Accordingly, an applicant who holds the permit on the allotment under 
bid, who has a satisfactory record of performance under that permit, and 
who is not the higher bidder for the future grazing privileges in the 
specified allotment shall be offered the opportunity to match the high 
bid and thereby retain the permit. Should there be more than one 
existing permittee in the allotment under bid, each shall be offered the 
option of meeting the high bid; if only one current permittee opts to 
meet the high bid, the remaining allowable grazing use, if any, shall be 
awarded to the initial high bidder.
    (2) Identical Bids. In cases of identical bids, the selection of the 
successful applicant shall be made through a drawing.
    (g) Computation of Successful Bidder's Annual Fee--(1) Annual Fee 
Basis. The highest bid received shall establish the base grazing value 
in the initial year of the grazing permit for each allotment offered. 
The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by 
the current period's hay price index for the relevant subregion as 
described in Sec. 222.53(c)(1), and (c)(3), less the value of any agency 
required range improvements. This hay price index shall be based on 3-
year average hay prices and

[[Page 81]]

annually reflect the percent change in the cost of alternative livestock 
feed.
    (2) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for 
permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be 
identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing 
permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the 
annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range 
improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee 
to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management 
direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource 
management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must 
involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the 
grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance 
management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, 
riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, 
or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements 
specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing 
permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course 
of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
    (h) No Bids Received. If qualified sealed bids are not received, the 
authorized officer reserves the right to conduct an oral auction using 
the minimum bid price established under paragraph (b) of this section or 
to establish grazing fees through noncompetitive grazing fee procedures 
specified in Sec. 222.53 of this subpart.

    Trees, portions of trees, or other forest products in any amount on 
National Forest System lands may be disposed of for administrative use, 
by sale or without charge, as may be most advantageous to the United 
States, subject to the maximum cut fixed in accordance with established 
policies for management of the National Forests. Such administrative use 
shall be limited to the following conditions and purposes:
    (a) For construction, maintenance or repair of roads, bridges, 
trails, telephone lines, fences, recreation areas or other improvements 
of value for the protection or the administration of Federal lands.
    (b) For fuel in Federal camps, buildings and recreation areas.
    (c) For research and demonstration projects.

subsequent to July 23, 1955, or of a mining claim which is otherwise 
subject to Section 4 of the Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367), if at 
any time said claim owner requires more timber for his mining 
operations, in connection with that claim, than is available on that 
claim because of Forest Service timber disposal therefrom subsequent to 
location of that claim. He will be granted, free of charge, timber from 
the nearest National Forest land which is ready for harvesting under the 
applicable management plan, substantially equivalent in kind and 
quantity to that estimated by the Forest Service to have been cut under 
Forest Service authorization from the claim subsequent to its location, 
Forest officers may be delegated authority to grant amounts of timber 
not in excess of those which these officers are authorized to sell in 
commercial sales.

the conditions prescribed in Sec. 223.30. The permittee may be required 
to report to the supervisor the amount of timber, by species, actually 
cut or may be required to furnish scalers for work under the direction 
of the forest officers in charge or, if authorized, to provide funds for 
the employment by the Forest Service of scalers to scale or measure the 
timber cut. The permittee may be required to dispose of the slash as 
cutting proceeds, or to employee people to work under the direction of a 
forest officer in disposing of the slash, or, if authorized, to provide

<R05>
Sec. 223.14  Where timber may be cut.

    (a) The cutting of trees, portions of trees or other forest products 
may be authorized on any National Forest System lands, except for:
    (1) Timber reserved by a grantor of land, during the life of such 
reservation.
    (2) Timber reserved from cutting under other regulations.
    (3) Timber on unpatented mining claims located prior to July 23, 
1955, unless the claimant has executed a waiver pursuant to section 6 of 
the Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367), or unless pursuant to a 
proceeding under Section 5 of that Act, the claimant has failed to file 
a verified statement or has failed to establish the validity and 
effectiveness of his asserted rights.
    (4) Timber on lands identified in land management plans as not 
suited for timber production, except that salvage sales or sales 
necessitated to protect other multiple-use values may be made.
    (b) The cutting of timber on mining claims shall be conducted in 
such manner as not to endanger or materially interfere with prospecting, 
mining or processing operations.
    (c) Timber on an unpatented claim to which the United States does 
not otherwise have disposal rights may be disposed of with the written 
consent of the claimant, or, in emergencies without the consent of the 
claimant.
    (d) Timber on an unpatented claim may be cut by the claimant only 
for the actual development of the claim or for uses consistent with the 
purposes for which the claim was entered. Any severance or removal of 
timber, other than severance or removal to provide clearance, shall be 
in accordance with plan of operations required by Part 252 of this 
chapter, and with sound principles of forest management.
    (e) With prior approval by the Regional Forester, timber on lands 
under option by the United States or on offered lands included in an 
approved land exchange agreement may be sold. Before the sale is made, a 
cooperative agreement must be made with the owner of the land 
authorizing the Forest Service to conduct the sale and providing for 
return of stumpage receipts to the owner if title to the land is not 
accepted by the United States.
    (f) With prior approval by the Regional Forester, cutting of 
exchange timber described in Sec. 223.4 may be authorized in advance of 
the acceptance of title to the non-Federal land offered in exchange.

the various forest resources (consistent with the provisions of the 
Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960) will result.


<R05>
Sec. 223.32  Timber sale operating plan.

    Sale contracts with a term of 2 years or more shall provide for the 
filing of an operating plan as soon as practicable after execution of 
the contract, such plan shall be a part of the contract. The plan of 
operation shall be general in nature, outlining the expected timing and 
order of sale development, including such major operations as road 
construction, felling and removal of timber, distribution of timber, and 
contractual requirements for erosion prevention and slash disposal. The 
plan of operation and revisions thereto shall be subject to concurrence 
by the Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 223.33  Redetermination of stumpage rates and deposits.

    Sale contracts exceeding 7 years in duration, and those of shorter 
duration to the extent found desirable by the approving officer, will

<R05>
Sec. 223.36  Volume determination.

    (a) Timber sale contracts may provide for volume determination by 
scaling, measuring, weighing, or counting the logs or other products, or 
by measuring the trees before cutting. If the contract or permit 
provides for the determination of volume by tree measurement and the 
timber has been paid for, the marking or otherwise designating of the 
tree authorizes cutting and removal. Otherwise no timber cut under any 
contract shall be removed from the place designated until it has been 
scaled, measured or counted as provided in the timber sale contract, 
unless such removal is specifically authorized in the contract.
    (b) National Forest timber sold on board foot scale shall be scaled

vegetative cover on the roadway and areas where the vegetative cover was 
disturbed by the construction or use of the road, as necessary to 
minimize erosion from the disturbed area. Such treatment shall be 
designed to reestablish vegetative cover as soon as practicable, but at 
least within 10 years after the termination of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 223.38  Standards for road design and construction.

    Road construction authorized under timber sale contracts, permits 
and other documents authorizing the cutting or removal of timber or 
forest products shall be designed to standards appropriate for the 
intended uses, considering safety, cost of transportation, and impacts 
on land and resources. If the sale contract provides for road design 
standards in excess of those needed for the harvest and removal of 
timber from that sale, including measures to protect adjacent resource 
values, provision shall be made in the contract for compensating the 
purchaser for the additional costs, unless the purchaser elects 
Government construction under section 14(i) of the National Forest 
Management Act of 1976.


<R05>
Sec. 223.39  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 223.40  Cancellation for environmental protection or inconsistency 
with plans.

    Timber sale contracts, permits, and other such instruments,

estimated road construction cost and base rate value, as defined in 
Sec. 223.61.


<R05>
Sec. 223.42  Transfer of effective purchaser credits.

    The Forest Service may permit transfer of unused effective purchaser 
credit earned after December 16, 1975, from one timber sale account to 
another timber sale account of the same purchaser within the same 
National Forest, provided the sale contracts provide procedures for the 
use of purchaser credit. Approval for transfer shall not be granted for 
amounts needed to satisfy unfulfilled payment obligations or claims for 
damages due the United States. Purchaser credit transferred under this 
paragraph is subject to such additional restrictions as may be necessary 
for its orderly use.

between remaining current contract value and the total of:
    (1) Remaining base rate value needs,
    (2) Salvage sale fund needs plus sale area improvement needs in 
excess of base rate value needs, and
    (3) Total purchaser credit limit on the given sale.
    (b) This calculation shall be made as of the date of sale award for 
sales made on or after January 1, 1978. For sales made prior to January 
1, 1978, the calculation shall be made as of December 31, 1977, except 
that if the amount actually transferred in as of December 31, 1977, 
exceeds the calculated limit, the actual transfers as of that date shall 
be the established limit. Purchaser credit earned on a sale and 
subsequently transferred out may be replaced without regard to the 
transfer in limit. Sale area improvement needs shall be based on the 
original sale area betterment plan or revisions thereto approved prior 
to July 1, 1976. Salvage sale fund needs shall be based on the original 
salvage sale fund plan.

Sec. 223.44  Collection rights on contracts involved in transfer of purchase 
credit.

    To assure protection of the United States in connection with the 
implementation of this regulation, contract provisions shall not prevent 
the Forest Service from carrying out collection rights, authorized by

Sec. 223.45  Definitions applicable to transfer of purchaser credit.

    As used in Secs. 223.42 and 223.43, the term Purchaser includes any 
single individual, corporation, company, firm, partnership, joint 
venture, or other business entity or the successor in interest of any of 
the foregoing business entities having timber sale contracts on the same 
National Forest. The term National Forest shall be considered as a unit 
of the National Forest System, regardless of how it was established, 
which maintains a separate identity with respect to the distribution of 
receipts earned thereon to the States and counties. The term Effective 
Purchaser Credit means unused purchaser credit which does not exceed 
current contract value minus base rate value. The term base rate value 
is the sum of the products of base rates and estimated remaining 
unscaled (unreported on tree measurement contracts) volumes by species 
of timber included in a timber sale contract.

needed, under guidelines provided by the Chief, Forest Service, 
including but not limited to (1) default of contractors or (2) design 
changes, physical changes, or catastrophic damages which necessitate 
modification of specified road construction work.

[[Page 89]]

    (e) If Forest Service failure to perform results in delay in road 
completion, the termination date shall be adjusted in accordance with 
the contract term adjustment provisions of the timber sale contract. If 
there is substantial delay in performance by the Forest Service, the 
contract shall provide that rates of payment may be redetermined, at the 
request of the purchaser, in accordance with guidelines established by 
the Chief, Forest Service.
    (f) If the purchaser retains responsibility for road construction, 
the date of completion for permanent roads may be modified to conform to 
the approved plan of operation.

Forest System lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 
48 States and Alaska, awarded before August 20, 1990, shall include 
provisions implementing the Secretary's timber export and substitution 
regulations at subpart D of this part in effect prior to that data. Such 
contracts shall also require purchasers to:
    (1) Submit annually, until all unprocessed timber is accounted for, 
a certified report on the disposition of any unprocessed timber 
harvested from the sale including a description of unprocessed timber 
which is sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of to another person and 
a description of the relationship with the other person;
    (2) Submit annually, until all unprocessed timber from the sale is 
accounted for, a certified report on the sale of any unprocessed timber 
from private lands in the tributary area which is exported or sold for 
export; and
    (3) Maintain records of all such transactions involving unprocessed 
timber and to make such records available for inspection and 
verification by the Forest Service for up to three (3) years after the 
sale is terminated.
    (b) Contracts for the sale of unprocessed timber from National 
Forest System lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 
48 States, awarded on or after August 20, 1990, shall include provisions 
implementing the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 et seq.).
    (c) The reporting and recordkeeping procedures in this section 
constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 
1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0021.

<R05>
Sec. 223.49  Downpayment.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, the terms listed in this 
paragraph shall have the following meaning:
    (1) Total bid value is the sum of the products obtained by 
multiplying the rate the purchaser bid for each species by the estimated 
volume listed in the contract.
    (2) Ineffective purchaser credit is that portion of the credit 
earned, pursuant to a specific Forest Service timber sale contract for 
construction of specified roads, or for other purposes in such contract, 
that exceeds the current contract value, minus base rate value as 
defined in that contract and, thus, is an amount that cannot be applied 
toward stumpage charges.
    (3) Bid premium is the amount in excess of the advertised value that 
a purchaser bids for timber offered.
    (4) Lump sum timber sales are premeasured sales where the entire 
value of the sale is paid in one payment at time of release for cutting.
    (5) Affiliate. Concerns or individuals are affiliates if directly or 
indirectly, either one controls or has the power to control the other, 
or a third party controls or has the power to control both. In 
determining whether or not affiliation exists, the Forest Service shall 
consider all appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, common 
ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.
    (b) Timber sale contracts shall include provisions that require 
purchasers to make a downpayment in cash or by application of earned 
effective purchaser credit at the time a timber sale contract is 
executed.
    (c) The minimum downpayment shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the 
total advertised value of each sale, plus 20 percent of the bid premium, 
except in those geographic areas where the Chief

[[Page 90]]

of the Forest Service determines that it is necessary to increase the 
amount of the downpayment in order to deter speculation. To determine 
the amount of the downpayment due on a sale where the timber is measured 
in units other than board feet, the Forest Service shall convert the 
measure to board feet, using appropriate conversion factors with any 
necessary adjustment.
    (d) On scaled sales, a purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited 
as a downpayment to cover other obligations due on that sale until 
stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the 
sale has been charged and paid for. On tree measurement sales, a 
purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to cover 
other obligations due on that sale until stumpage value representing 25 
percent of the total bid value of the sale is shown on the timber sale 
statement of account to have been cut, removed, and paid for. For lump 
sum sales, the downpayment amount may be applied to payment for release 
of the single payment unit.
    (e) A purchaser or any affiliate of that purchaser, awarded a Forest 
Service timber sale contract must meet the additional downpayment 
requirements of paragraph (g) of this section under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) The purchaser or its affiliate after September 29, 1988 has 
failed to perform in accordance with the terms of a Forest Service or 
Bureau of Land Management timber sale contract which results in 
notification by a Contracting Officer that a contract has expired 
uncompleted or is terminated for cause; and
    (2) The estimated value of the unscaled timber on scaled sales, or 
the estimated value of the timber outstanding on tree measurement sales, 
included in those terminated or expired contracts exceeds $100,000, and
    (3) Unpaid damages claimed by the Government remain outstanding 
prior to award of the new sale at issue and corrective action has not 
been taken to avoid future deficient performance.
    (f) A subsequent final determination by the Contracting Officer or 
by a court of competent jurisdiction that a contract was improperly 
classified under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will 
result in the refund or credit of any unobligated portion of the amount 
of downpayment exceeding that required by paragraphs (c) and (d) and the 
limitations of paragraph (h) on application of downpayment shall no 
longer apply.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, a purchaser meeting the criteria of paragraph (e) of this 
section must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total 
advertised value of that sale, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. 
This higher downpayment requirement applies throughout the National 
Forest System, except in those areas where the Chief of the Forest 
Service determines, before advertisement of the sale, that another 
downpayment rate is necessary to achieve the management objectives of 
the National Forest System.
    (1) In calculating bid premiums for the downpayment requirement, the 
Forest Service shall not include the portion of the bid premium that 
offsets ineffective purchaser credit.
    (2) To determine the amount of the downpayment due on a sale where 
the timber is measured in units other than board feet, the Forest 
Service shall convert the measure to board feet, using appropriate 
conversion factors with any necessary adjustments.
    (h) A purchaser subject to the additional downpayment requirements 
of paragraph (g) of this section cannot apply the amount deposited as a 
downpayment to other uses until:
    (1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is 
equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or
    (2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value remaining to be 
cut and removed as shown on the timber sale statement of account is 
equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment.
    (i) For the purpose of releasing funds deposited as downpayment by a 
purchaser subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the Forest Service 
shall compute the estimated value of timber as follows:
    (1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is 
the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract 
rate for

[[Page 91]]

each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the 
volume that has been scaled of that species.
    (2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value of the timber 
outstanding (that not shown on the timber sale statement of account as 
cut and removed) is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the 
current contract rate for each species by the difference between the 
advertised volume and the volume that has been shown on the timber sale 
statement to have been cut and removed of the species. The current 
contract rate for each species is that specified in each Forest Service 
timber sale contract.
    (j) In order to deter speculation, the Chief of the Forest Service 
may increase the period for retention of the downpayment for future 
contracts subject to such criteria as the Chief may adopt after giving 
the public notice and opportunity to comment.

<R05>
Sec. 223.50  Periodic payments.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the 
meaning given:
    (1) Total contract value is the product of the estimated volume of 
the sale multiplied by the rates bid by the purchaser. Total contract 
value excludes required deposits and is determined at bid date.
    (2) Current contract value is the sum of the products of the current 
contract rates and, in a scaled sale, estimated remaining unscaled 
volume or, in a tree measurement sale, the estimated remaining 
quantities by species of included timber meeting utilization standards.
    (3) Normal operating season is the period so specified in a timber 
sale contract.
    (4) Periodic payment(s) is/are amount(s) specified in a timber sale 
contract that a purchaser must pay by the periodic payment determination 
date(s) unless reduced by amounts paid as stumpage for volume removed.
    (5) A periodic payment determination date is a date specified in a 
timber sale contract upon which the Forest Service will compare the 
payments made by the timber sale purchaser for timber charges 
(stumpage), exclusive of required deposits, with the periodic payment 
amount required as of that date in the contract.
    (b) Except for lump sum sales, each timber sale contract of more 
than one full normal operating season shall provide for periodic 
payments. The number of periodic payments required will be dependent 
upon the number of normal operating seasons within the contract, but 
shall not exceed two such payments during the course of the contract. 
Periodic payments must be made by the periodic payment determination 
date, except that the amount of the periodic payment shall be reduced to 
the extent that timber has been removed and paid for by the periodic 
payment determination date. Should the payment fall due on a date other 
than normal billing dates, the contract shall provide that the payment 
date will be extended to coincide with the next timber sale statement of 
account billing date.
    (1) At a minimum, each such contract shall require an initial 
periodic payment at the midpoint between the specified road completion 
date and the termination date. If there is no road construction 
requirement, payment shall be due at the midpoint between award date and 
the termination date.
    (2) Contracts exceeding 2 full operating seasons shall require an 
additional periodic payment to be due no later than the midpoint of the 
last normal operating season or 12 months from the initial periodic 
payment whichever date is first.
    (c) Each timber sale contract shall require the initial periodic 
payment to equal 35 percent of the total contract value or 50 percent of 
the bid premium, whichever is greater. The amount of this periodic 
payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's 
credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
    (d) Where an additional periodic payment is required by the timber 
sale contract, this payment will equal 75 percent of the total contract 
value. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the 
payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance

[[Page 92]]

for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
    (e) Dates for determining future periodic payments shall be adjusted 
as follows:
    (1) When contract term adjustments are granted under Sec. 223.46,
    (2) When market-related contract term additions are granted under 
Sec. 223.52,
    (3) When urgent removal extensions are granted under Sec. 223.53, or
    (4) When extensions in the substantial overriding public interest 
are granted under Sec. 223.115(b). Periodic payment determination dates 
shall not be adjusted when a contract term extension is granted under 
the general authority of Sec. 223.115(a).
    (f) In accordance with 36 CFR 223.52(a), no contract executed before 
July 31, 1991, shall be modified to allow for market-related contract 
term additions unless the purchaser makes a written request to the 
Contracting Officer by December 1, 1991, for a simultaneous modification 
implementing the periodic payment requirements of this section. The 
midpoint payment clause in contracts executed before July 31, 1991, is 
not the ``periodic payment requirement'' mandated by 36 CFR 223.52(a).

<R05>
Sec. 223.51  Bid monitoring.

    Each Regional Forester shall monitor bidding patterns on timber 
sales to determine if speculative bidding is occurring or if Purchasers 
are bidding in such a way that they would be unable to perform their 
obligations under the timber sale contract. A Regional Forester shall 
propose to the Chief changes in servicewide timber sale procedures, as 
they appear necessary, to discourage speculative bidding.

<R05>
Sec. 223.52  Market-related contract term additions.

    (a) Contract provision. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section, each timber sale contract exceeding 1 year in length 
shall contain a provision for the addition of time to the contract term, 
under the following conditions:
    (i) The Chief of the Forest Service has determined that adverse wood 
products market conditions have resulted in a drastic reduction in wood 
product prices applicable to the sale; and
    (ii) The purchaser makes a written request for additional time to 
perform the contract.
    (2) The contract term addition provision of the contract must 
specify the index to be applied to each sale. The Forest Supervisor 
shall determine, and select from paragraph (b) of this section, the 
index to be used for each sale based on the species and product 
characteristics, by volume, being harvested on the sale. The index 
specified shall represent more than one-half of the advertised volume.
    (3) A market-related contract term addition provision shall not be 
included in contracts where the sale has a primary objective of 
harvesting timber subject to rapid deterioration.
    (b) Determination of drastic wood product price reductions. (1) The 
Forest Service shall monitor and use Producer Price Indices, as prepared 
by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), adjusted 
to a constant dollar base, to determine if market-related contract term 
additions are warranted.
    (i) The Forest Service shall monitor and use only the following 
indices:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Preliminary index values will be revised when final index 
values become available, however, determination of a qualifying quarter 
will not be revised when final index values become available.
    (2) The Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic 
reduction in wood product prices has occurred when, for 2 or more 
consecutive quarters, the applicable adjusted price index is less than 
85 percent of the average of such adjusted index for the 4

[[Page 93]]

highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying 
quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter where the applicable adjusted 
index is more than 15 percent below the average of such index for the 4 
highest of the previous 8 calendar quarters. Qualifying quarter 
determinations will be made using the Producer Price Indices for the 
months of March, June, September, and December.
    (3) A determination, made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, 
shall constitute a finding that the substantial overriding public 
interest justifies the contract term addition.
    (c) Granting market-related contract term additions. When the Chief 
of the Forest Service determines, pursuant to this section, that a 
drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, the Forest 
Service is to notify affected timber sale purchasers. For any contract 
which has been awarded and has not been terminated, the Forest Service, 
upon a purchaser's written request, will add 1 year to the contract's 
terms, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this 
section. This 1-year addition includes time outside of the normal 
operating season.
    (1) Additional contract time may not be granted for those portions 
of the contract which have a required completion date or for those 
portions of the contract where the Forest Service determines that the 
timber is in need of urgent removal or that timber deterioration or 
resource damage will result from delay.
    (2) For each additional consecutive quarter, in which a contract 
qualifies for a market-related contract term addition, the Forest 
Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 
months during the normal operating season to the contract.
    (3) No more than twice the original contract length or 3 years, 
whichever is less, shall be added to a contract's term by market-related 
contract term addition.
    (4) In no event shall a revised contract term exceed 10 years as a 
result of market-related contract term additions.
    (d) Recalculation of periodic payments. Where a contract is 
lengthened as a result of market conditions, any subsequent periodic 
payment dates shall be delayed 1 month for each month added to the 
contract's term.

<R05>
Sec. 223.53  Urgent removal contract extensions.

    (a) Finding. There is substantial, overriding public interest in 
extending National Forest System timber sale contracts for undamaged 
(green) timber not requiring expeditious removal in order to facilitate 
the rapid harvest of catastrophically damaged timber requiring 
expeditious removal on private or other non-National Forest System 
lands. Such an extension may be granted when a specific catastrophic 
event beyond the control of the landowner occurs on non-National Forest 
System lands that poses a threat to general forest health, public 
safety, and property. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited 
to, severe wildfire, wind, floods, insects and disease infestation, and 
drought.
    (b) Regional Forester determination. If the Regional Forester 
determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, 
Contracting Officers may extend a National Forest System timber sale 
contract, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time 
required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National 
Forest System lands. The Contracting Officer may grant an urgent removal 
extension only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that:
    (1) A specific catastrophe occurred on the particular geographic 
area for which urgent removal extensions may be granted;
    (2) There is a high risk that substantial timber quantities or 
values of the damaged non-National Forest System timber in the affected 
geographic area would deteriorate unless expeditiously removed;
    (3) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity 
available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid 
harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of 
expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged

[[Page 94]]

(green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and
    (4) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber 
promptly could result in the following:
    (i) Significant private or other public resource loss,
    (ii) Pose a threat to public safety, or
    (iii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National 
Forest System or other lands or resources.
    (c) Purchaser request. In order to obtain an urgent removal 
extension on a National Forest System timber sale contract, a purchaser 
must make a written request to the Contracting Officer, which includes 
the following:
    (1) An explanation of why the harvest of the damaged non-National 
Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal will prevent or 
otherwise impede the removal of undamaged (green) National Forest System 
timber within the term of the existing National Forest System 
contract(s);
    (2) Documentation that the manufacturing facilities or logging 
equipment capacity available to a purchaser would be insufficient to 
provide for both the rapid salvage of damaged non-National Forest System 
timber in need of expeditious removal and continued harvest of undamaged 
(green) National Forest System timber under contract with the Forest 
Service; and
    (3) A notarized statement that the purchaser will not hold the 
Forest Service liable for any damages or lost time incurred on the non-
National Forest System and National Forest System contracts in the event 
that a request for an extension is delayed or denied, or for any damages 
under National Forest System contracts due to delay, suspension, 
modification, or cancellation (in whole or in part) subsequent to or 
during the extension.
    (d) Contracting Officer determination. In order to grant an urgent 
removal extension, the timber sale Contracting Officer must verify the 
following:
    (1) That it is likely that the undamaged (green) timber from 
National Forest System land would be delivered to the same manufacturing 
facilities as are needed to process the damaged non-National Forest 
System timber or the National Forest System timber sale contract would 
require the use of the same logging equipment as is needed to remove the 
damaged non-National Forest System timber from the area affected by the 
catastrophe;
    (2) That extension of the National Forest System contract will not 
be injurious to the United States and will protect, to the extent 
possible, the health of the National Forest System lands;
    (3) That the urgent removal extension does not adversely affect 
other resource management objectives to be implemented by the National 
Forest System timber sale being extended;
    (4) That the National Forest System timber sale contract to be 
extended is not a sale containing damaged, dead, or dying timber subject 
to rapid deterioration;
    (5) That the National Forest System timber sale contract at issue 
has not been granted a previous urgent removal extension;
    (6) That the revised National Forest System timber sale contract 
term will not exceed 10 years from the date the National Forest System 
contract was awarded;
    (7) That the National Forest System contract is not in breach, and 
all work items, payments, and deposits are current; and
    (8) That the purchaser has signed and had notarized the following 
statement:

    By submission of this request, I release, waive, and abandon any and 
all claims against the United States for delay in the processing or 
denial of this request for an urgent removal extension of my National 
Forest System timber sale(s), contract number(s) ------, including, but 
not limited to, all claims for costs, expenses, attorney fees, 
compensatory damages, and exemplary damages arising out of or related to 
any non-National Forest System timber sale contract(s) and the National 
Forest System timber sale(s) contract(s) identified above. Should my 
request be granted, I release, waive, and abandon any and all claims 
against the United States due to delay, suspension, modification, or 
cancellation (in whole or in part) of the extended National Forest 
System timber sale contract(s), including, but not limited to, all 
claims for costs, expenses, attorney fees, compensatory damages, and 
exemplary damages. This liability limitation supersedes any other 
compensation or liability provisions set forth in the timber sale 
contract, Federal regulation, or the common law.


[[Page 95]]


    (e) Execution of contract extension. An urgent removal extension of 
a National Forest System timber sale contract is executed through a 
mutual agreement contract modification pursuant to Sec. 223.112, which 
must include specific contract provisions. An agreement to modify a 
contract must identify the specific provision(s) of the contract being 
modified and must include the following terms and conditions:
    (1) Purchasers must make cash payment to the Forest Service at the 
time of modification granting an urgent removal extension in 
consideration for the additional contract term. Such payment (P) shall 
be equal to interest on the difference between current contract value 
(CCV) at the time of the modification and the credit balance of any 
deposits (D). The interest rate (i) shall be the prevailing U.S. 
Department of the Treasury current value of funds rate in effect at time 
of modification. The time period (t) to be used in the calculation of 
interest shall be the number of months of contract extension granted. 
Payments so made shall not be refunded as excess cash deposits. This 
calculation is expressed by the following formula:

    P=i(CCV-D)(t/12)

    (2) Purchasers must make cash payment to cover the costs of 
remarking timber on the sale area or reestablishing cutting unit 
boundaries if the Contracting Officer determines such work is necessary.
    (3) For sales subject to stumpage rate adjustment, future adjustment 
of tentative rates will not result in rates less than the current 
contract rates at the time of the extension.
    (f) Information collection. The information required of a purchaser 
to request an extension of an National Forest System timber sale 
contract, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section, to facilitate 
expeditious removal of timber from non-National Forest System lands 
constitutes an information collection requirement as defined in 5 CFR 
Part 1320 and has been assigned Office of Management and Budget control 
number 0596-0167.

                          Appraisal and Pricing


<R05>
Sec. 223.60  Determining fair market value.

    The objective of Forest Service timber appraisals is to determine 
fair market value. Fair market value is estimated by such methods as are 
authorized by the Chief, Forest Service, through issuance of agency 
directives (36 CFR 200.4). Valid methods to determine fair market value 
include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, 
analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates 
based on average investments. Pertinent factors affecting market value 
also considered include, but are not limited to, prices paid and 
valuations established for comparable timber, selling value of products 
produced, estimated operating costs, operating difficulties, and quality 
of timber. Considerations and valuations may recognize and adjust for 
factors which are not normal market influences.

[61 FR 5685, Feb. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 223.61  Establishing minimum stumpage rates.

    The Chief, Forest Service, shall establish minimum stumpage rates, 
i.e., ``base rates,'' for species and products on individual National 
Forests, or groups of National Forests. Timber shall be sold for 
appraised value or minimum stumpage rates, whichever is higher. No 
timber may be sold or cut under timber sale contracts for less than 
minimum stumpage rates except to provide for the removal of insect-
infested, diseased, dead or distressed timber or in accordance with 
contract provisions specifically providing for catastrophically-affected 
timber and incidental amounts of material not meeting utilization 
standards of the timber sale contract. For any timber sale offering 
where deposits are to be required for reforestation under the Act of 
June 9, 1930, as amended (46 Stat. 527; 16 U.S.C. 576-576b) which exceed 
the value of the established minimum stumpage rates, the minimum rates 
may be increased by the approving officer as necessary to the amount of 
such required reforestation deposits and a minimum deposit to the 
Treasury. Minimum rates in timber sale contracts will not

[[Page 96]]

be set higher than established minimum rates for purposes other than 
assuring adequate funds for reforestation.


<R05>
Sec. 223.62  Timber purchaser road construction credit.

    Appraisal may also establish stumpage value as if unconstructed 
roads or other developments needed by the purchaser for removal of the 
timber were in place. When timber is appraised and sold on such basis, 
purchaser credit for road construction, not to exceed the estimated 
construction cost of such roads or other developments specified in the 
timber sale contract, shall, when such construction is accomplished by 
purchaser, be deducted from stumpage payments made by or due from 
purchaser under the timber sale contract for other than minimum stumpage 
rates and required deposits for slash disposal and road maintenance. As 
used in this section estimated construction costs means the total cost 
of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale 
contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by an 
independent contractor who is not the timber purchaser. In determining 
the purchaser credit amount applicable against timber payments, the 
estimated construction cost may be reduced for the effect of differences

contract and as therein specified in accordance with formulas or other 
equivalent specifications for the following reasons:
    (a) Variations in lumber or other product value indices between the 
price index base specified in the contract and the price index actually 
experienced during the cutting of the timber;
    (b) Variance between advertised rates and rates redetermined by 
appraisal at dates specified in the contract;
    (c) Variance between redetermined rates and rates appropriate for 
changes in costs or selling values subsequent to the rate 
redetermination which reduce conversion value to less than such

    (d) Substantial loss of value due to physical deterioration of green 
timber or other physical damage to the sale area or access to the 
timber.


<R05>
Sec. 223.65  Appraisal of timber for land exchange; right-of-way, or other 
authorized use.

    The value of timber in land exchange or the value of timber required

area by the termination date, unless acceptance of such bid is 
determined to be in the public interest.
    (b) The no bid restriction in the preceding paragraph:
    (1) Shall only apply when 50 percent or more of the timber included 
in the resale is timber remaining from the uncompleted contract and the 
resale is advertised within 3 years of the date the uncompleted contract 
terminated;
    (2) When imposed because of failure to cut designated timber on 
portions of the sale area by the termination date, shall not apply to 
resales of timber for which the original contract was awarded prior to 
April 30, 1972, unless the contract is extended thereafter; and
    (3) Shall not apply to:
    (i) Resales of timber within a sustained yield unit unless 
competition may be invited under the policy statement for the unit,
    (ii) Resales of timber on contract which would ordinarily have been 
awarded prior to April 30, 1972, if award was delayed through no fault 
of the purchaser, and

market value for the public resource,
    (3) Consider the economic stability of communities whose economies 
are dependent upon National Forest timber, and

acceptable bid prices specified in the prospectus. No price subsequently 
bid at oral auction shall be accepted if it is less than the written 
sealed bid.
    (c) The Chief, Forest Service, shall specify the use of sealed bids 
or a mix of bidding methods in areas where he has reasonable belief that 
collusive bidding may be occurring or where he determines that less than 
normal competitive bidding is occurring.
    (d) Sealed bids shall be used for sales within Federal Sustained 
Yield Units, except where the policy statement for the Unit restricts 
purchasers of timber within the Unit from buying National

Forest timber outside the Unit and the Chief determines that oral 
bidding will protect individual communities within the Unit.
    (e) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize departures from the 
requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section when he 
determines that departures are necessary to protect the public interest.

    The sale of advertised timber shall be awarded to the responsible 
bidder submitting the highest bid that conforms to the conditions of the 
sale as stated in the prospectus unless:
    (a) Determination is made to reject all bids.
    (b) Two or more bidders, all of whom meet the requirements, submit 
equal bids which are the highest bids, in which case award may be by the 
drawing of lots. Equal bids from parties having direct or indirect 
common control or association in logging, processing or marketing may be 
consolidated to the extent deemed necessary by the awarding officer in 
order to give to any others who have bid the same amount an equitable 
opportunity in the drawing of lots.
    (c) The highest bidder is notoriously or habitually careless with 
fire.
    (d) Monopoly, injurious to the public welfare, would result from the 
control of large amounts of public or of public and private timber.
    (e) The high bidder has elected Forest Service road construction in 
response to an advertisement extending such an option, the Forest 
Service cannot perform the construction and in response to solicitation 
has not received a satisfactory bid for such construction within the 
period stated in the prospectus and the high timber sale bidder is 
unwilling to perform the construction.

Sec. 223.101  Determination of purchaser responsibility.

    (a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a timber sale contract 
unless that officer makes an affirmative determination of purchaser 
responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that 
the prospective purchaser is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall 
conclude that the prospective purchaser does not qualify as a 
responsible purchaser.
    (b) To determine a purchaser to be responsible, a Contracting 
Officer must find that:
    (1) The purchaser has adequate financial resources to perform the 
contract or the ability to obtain them;
    (2) The purchaser is able to perform the contract within the 
contract term taking into consideration all existing commercial and 
governmental business commitments;
    (3) The purchaser has a satisfactory performance record on timber 
sale contracts. A prospective purchaser that is or recently has been 
seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed not to be 
responsible, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the 
circumstances were beyond the purchaser's control and were not created 
through improper actions by the purchaser or affiliate, or that the 
purchaser has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply 
sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably under a 
contract is strong evidence that a purchaser is not

[[Page 101]]

a responsible contractor. The Contracting Officer shall consider the 
number of contracts involved and extent of deficiency of each in making 
this evaluation;
    (4) The purchaser has a satisfactory record of integrity and 
business ethics;
    (5) The purchaser has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies 
suitable for logging the timber and for meeting the resource protection 
provisions of the contract;
    (6) The purchaser is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an 
award under applicable laws and regulations.
    (c) If the prospective purchaser is a small business concern and the 
Contracting Officer determines that the purchaser does not qualify as a 
responsible purchaser on an otherwise acceptable bid, the Contracting 
Officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration 
which will decide whether or not to issue a Certificate of Competency.
    (d) Affiliated concerns, as defined in Sec. 223.49(a)(5) of this 
subpart are normally considered separate entities in determining whether 
the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable 
standards for responsibility. However, the Contracting Officer shall 
consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may 
adversely affect the prospective purchaser's responsibility.

Sec. 223.102  Procedures when sale is not awarded to highest bidder.

    If the highest bid is not accepted and the sale is still deemed 
desirable, all bids may be rejected and the timber readvertised; or, if 
the highest bidder cannot meet the requirements under which the timber 
was advertised or the withholding of award to him is based on one or 
more of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of Sec. 223.100, award at the 
highest price bid may be offered to the next highest qualified bidder or 
to the other qualified bidders in order of their bids until the award is 
accepted by one or refused by all of the qualified bidders.

the Small Business Administration to be ineligible for preferential 
award of set-aside sales. If there are no qualified small business 
bidders any readvertisement shall be without restriction on the size of 
bidders.

areas damaged by major disaster as designated by the President pursuant 
to the Act.
    (a) Where an existing contract for the sale of National Forest 
timber does not provide relief from major physical change not due to 
purchaser's negligence prior to approval of construction of any section 
of specified road or other specified development facility and, as a 
result of a major disaster in a designated area a major physical change 
results in additional construction work by the purchaser in connection 
with such a road or facility, the United States shall bear such 
increased construction cost if, as determined by the Chief, Forest 
Service, the estimated cost is--
    (1) More than $1,000 for sales under 1 million board feet, or

[[Page 102]]

    (2) More than $1 per thousand board feet for sales of 1 to 3 million 
board feet, or
    (3) More than $3,000 for sales over 3 million board feet.
    (b) Where the Chief, Forest Service, determines that damages are so 
great that restoration, reconstruction, or construction is not practical 
under the cost-sharing arrangement in paragraph (a) of this section, he 
may allow cancellation of the contract notwithstanding provisions 
therein or in Sec. 223.116.
    (c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to reduce to 7 days the 
minimum time to advertise the sale of National Forest timber whenever he 
determines that--
    (1) The sale of such timber will assist in the construction of any 
area of a State damaged by a major disaster,
    (2) The sale of such timber will assist in sustaining the economy of 
such area, or
    (3) The sale of such timber is necessary to salvage the value of 
timber damaged in such major disaster or to protect undamaged timber.
    (d) Any request for relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section shall be made in writing to the Forest Supervisor having 
administrative responsibility for the land involved.

    Timber sale contracts may be modified only when the modification 
will apply to unexecuted portions of the contract and will not be 
injurious to the United States. Modifications may be made by the officer 
approving the sale, by his successor, or by his superior, except as 
provided in Sec. 223.110.


<R05>
Sec. 223.113  Modification of contracts to prevent environmental damage

modified to prevent environmental damage or to make them consistent with 
amendments or revisions of land and resource management plans adopted 
subsequent to award or issuance of a timber sale contract, permit, or 
other such instrument. Compensation to the purchaser, if any, for 
modifications to a contract shall be made in accordance with provisions 
set forth in the timber sale contract. When determining compensation 
under a contract, timber payment rates shall be redetermined in 
accordance with appraisal methods in Sec. 223.60 of this subpart.

Sec. 223.114  Acquisition by third party.

    No agreement permitting a third party to acquire the rights of a 
purchaser under a timber sale contract may be recognized and approved by 
the Forest Service except in writing, signed by the officer approving 
the sale, his successor, or superior officer. Such approval shall not 
relieve the purchaser of his responsibilities or liabilities under the 
timber sale contract and may be given only if--
    (a) The third party is acceptable to the Forest Service as a 
purchaser of timber under the conditions and requirements then in effect 
for similar timber sales and assumes in writing all of the obligations 
to the Forest Service under the terms of the timber sale contract as to 
the uncompleted portion thereof, or
    (b) The rights are acquired in trust as security and subject to such 
conditions as may be necessary for the protection of the public 
interests.


<R05>
Sec. 223.115  Contract extensions.

    The term of any contract or permit shall not be extended unless the 
approving officer finds:

contract provisions and an approved plan of operation; or
    (b) That the substantial overriding public interest justifies the 
extension.


<R05>
Sec. 223.116  Cancellation.

    (a) Timber sale contracts and permits may be canceled:
    (1) For serious or continued violation of their terms.
    (2) Upon application, or with the consent of the purchaser, when 
such action is of advantage to the United States or not prejudicial to 
its interests.
    (3) Upon application of the purchaser if the value of the timber 
remaining to

[[Page 103]]

be cut is diminished materially because of catastrophic damage caused by 
forces beyond the control of the purchaser resulting in (i) physical 
change in the sale area or access to it, or (ii) damage to timber 
remaining to be cut.
    (4) For conviction of violation of criminal statutes or, following 
final agency or judicial determination, of violation of civil standards, 
orders, permits, or others regulations for the protection of 
environmental quality issued by a Federal agency, State agency, or 
political subdivision thereof, in the conduct of operations thereunder, 
on National Forest System land, unless compliance with such laws or 
regulations would preclude performance of other contractual 
requirements.
    (5) Upon determination by the Chief, Forest Service, that operations 
thereunder would result in serious environmental degradation or resource 
damage and with reasonable compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered 
costs incurred under the contract and the difference between the current 
contract value and the average value of comparable National Forest 
timber sold during the preceding 6-month period.
    (b) Cancellation will be by the Chief, Forest Service. Authority to 
cancel contracts under paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section may 
be delegated to Regional Foresters for sales within their authorization. 
All contract cancellations under paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall

Sec. 223.117  Administration of cooperative or Federal sustained yield units.

    With respect to sustained yield units established pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act of March 29, 1944 (58 Stat. 132; 16 U.S.C. 583-
583l), the Chief, Forest Service, with authority to delegate to other 
officers and employees of the Forest Service:
    (a) Shall provide that National Forest timber in any sustained yield 
unit shall be available in sufficient amounts to meet the needs of bona 
fide farmers, settlers, miners, residents and prospectors for minerals 
for personal and domestic use as provided by law and by regulation.
    (b) May offer for sale to cooperators, without competition but at 
not less than appraised value, timber on National Forest lands within an 
approved cooperative sustained yield unit; or, if the approved sustained 
yield unit consists entirely of federally owned or administered forest 
land and if necessary for the maintenance of a stable community or 
communities, may offer National Forest timber for sale to responsible 
operators within such community or communities, at not less than 
appraised value but without competition or with competition restricted 
to responsible operators who will manufacture the timber to at least a 
stated degree within the community or communities to be maintained. Each 
such sale which involves more than $500 in stumpage value may be made 
only after notice has been given in advance by such means as may be 
deemed effective in informing the public of the proposed action, 
including in any event, publication, once weekly for four consecutive 
weeks and with additional insertions if needed, in one or more 
newspapers of general circulation in the vicinity of the place where the 
timber is located, of a notice of the proposed sale stating at least:
    (1) The location, estimated quantity and appraised value of the 
timber to be cut;
    (2) The name and address of the proposed purchaser or those of the 
operators among whom bidding is to be restricted;
    (3) The time and place of a public advisory hearing on the proposed 
sale, to be held not earlier than 30 days after the first publication of 
said notice, if requested by the State or county where the timber is 
located or by any other person deemed to have a reasonable interest in 
the proposed sale or in its terms; and
    (4) The title and address of the officer of the Forest Service to 
whom any request for such hearing should be made.

Such requests need be considered only if received at the place 
designated in the notice not later than 15 days after the first 
publication of such notice. If a

[[Page 104]]

public advisory hearing is to be held, notice of it shall be published 
in the same newspaper or newspapers as the original notice, stating the 
place where it will be held and the time, which shall not be earlier 
than 10 days after the first publication of the said notice of hearing, 
and shall appear once each week, but not for more than four successive 
weeks in any event, until the date set for the hearing. Any such hearing 
shall be conducted by the Chief or by any officer designated by him as 
his representative, except that if the amount of the proposed sale is 
not in excess of that which the Regional Forester has been authorized to 
sell without prior approval of the Chief the hearing may be held by the 
Regional Forester concerned or by his representative and decision may be 
by the Regional Forester. At any such hearing, opportunity shall be 
given to those having a reasonable interest to make oral statements or 
to file written statements discussing the advantages and disadvantages 
of the proposed sale; and the officer holding the hearing may, in his 
discretion, permit the filing of such statements within a reasonable 
period after the close of the hearing to become part of the record for 
consideration before a decision is made.
    (c) Shall keep available for public inspection,
    (1) During the life of any sustained yield unit, the minutes or 
other record of the hearing held on the establishment thereof, and the 
determination of action taken following the hearing including any 
modification of the proposals as submitted at the hearing; and
    (2) During the life of any cooperative agreement for coordinated 
management the similar record of the hearings and actions determined 
upon; and
    (3) During the life of any sustained yield unit the similar record 
of any public hearing which may be held on a sale made without 
competition or with restricted competition and the action determined 
upon. Such records of any case may be kept in any office of the Forest 
Service designated by the Chief as being suitable and convenient of 
access for probably interested persons.
    (d) Shall make provision, in any contract for the purchase of timber 
without competition or with restricted competition, if that contract is 
of more than 7 years' duration and in his discretion in any case of 
shorter duration, for the redetermination of rates for stumpage and for 
required deposits to be paid by the purchasers, such redetermination to 
be effective at intervals or dates stated in the contract; but the sum 
of such redetermined rates for stumpage and sale area betterment shall 
not be less than the base rates in the published notice of the proposed 
sale.
    (e) May modify and revise existing cooperative agreements entered 
into under said act after taking appropriate action.

Sec. 223.118  Appeal process for small business timber sale set-aside 
program share recomputation decisions.

    (a) Decisions subject to appeal. The rules of this section govern 
appeal of recomputation decisions related to structural, special, or 
market changes or the scheduled 5-year recomputations of the small 
business share of National Forest System timber sales. Certain decisions 
related to recomputation of shares, such as structural change and 
carryover volume, may require two decisions, one to determine that a 
recomputation is needed and the other to recompute the shares. Decisions 
made both at the earlier stage as well as the later stage are 
appealable.
    (b) Manner of giving notice. (1) Predecisional notice and comment. 
The Responsible Official shall provide qualifying timber sale 
purchasers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 30 days for 
predecisional review and comment on any draft decision to reallocate 
shares, including the data used in making the proposed recomputation 
decision.
    (2) Notice of decision. Upon close of the 30-day predecisional 
review period, the Responsible Official shall consider any comments 
received. Within 15 days of the end of the comment period, the 
Responsible Official shall make a decision on the small business shares 
and shall give prompt written notice to all parties on the national 
forest timber sale bidders list for the affected area. The notice of 
decision must identify

[[Page 105]]

the name of the Appeal Deciding Officer, the address, the date by which 
an appeal must be filed, and a source for obtaining the appeal 
procedures information.
    (c) Who may appeal or file written comments as an interested party. 
(1) Only timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are 
affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales 
as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have submitted 
predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may 
appeal recomputation decisions under this section or may file written 
comments as an interested party.
    (2) Interested parties are defined as the Small Business 
Administration and those timber sale purchasers, or their 
representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small 
business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section and who have individually, or through an association to which 
they belong, submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (i) A timber sale purchaser may submit comments on an appeal as an 
interested party if an association to which the purchaser belongs filed 
predecisional comment but later decides not to appeal or not to file 
comments as an interested party.
    (ii) A timber sale purchaser, who is a member of an association that 
appeals a decision, may not file a separate appeal unless that purchaser 
filed separate predecisional comment under paragraph (b)(1).
    (3) Interested parties who submit written comments on an appeal 
filed by another party may not continue an appeal if the appellant 
withdraws the appeal.
    (d) Level of appeal. Only one level of review is available for 
appeal of decisions pertaining to recomputations under the Small 
Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program. The Appeal Deciding Officer is 
the official one level above the level of the Responsible Official who 
made the recomputation of shares decision. The Responsible Official is 
normally the Forest Supervisor; thus, the Appeal Deciding Officer is 
normally the Regional Forester. However, when the Regional Forester 
makes recomputation decisions, the Appeal Deciding Officer is the Chief 
or such officer at the National headquarters level as the Chief may 
designate.
    (e) Filing procedures. In order to file an appeal under this 
section, an appellant must file a notice of appeal, as specified in the 
notice of decision, with the Appeal Deciding Officer within 20 days of 
the date on the notice of the decision. This date must be specified in 
the notice of decision given pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Written comments filed by an interested party in response to an 
appeal must be filed within 15 days after the close of the appeal filing 
period.
    (f) Content of notice of appeal. (1) It is the responsibility of the 
appellant to provide sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show 
why a recomputation decision by the Responsible Official should be 
reversed or changed.
    (2) An appellant must include the following information in a notice 
of appeal:
    (i) The appellant's name, mailing address, and daytime telephone 
number;
    (ii) The title or type of recomputation decision involved, the date 
of the decision, and the name of the Responsible Official;
    (iii) A brief description and date of the decision being appealed:
    (iv) A statement of how the appellant is adversely affected by the 
decision being appealed;
    (v) A statement of the facts in dispute regarding the issue(s) 
raised by the appeal;
    (vi) If relevant, any specific references to any law, regulation, or 
policy that the appellant believes to have been violated and the basis 
for such an allegation;
    (vii) A statement as to whether and how the appellant has tried to 
resolve with the Responsible Official the issue(s) being appealed, 
including evidence of submission of written comments at the 
predecisional stage as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the 
date of any discussion, and the outcome of that meeting or contact; and
    (viii) A statement of the relief the appellant seeks.

[[Page 106]]

    (g) Time periods and timeliness. (1) All time periods applicable to 
this section will begin on the first day following a decision or action 
related to the appeal.
    (2) Time periods applicable to this section are computed using 
calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays are included in 
computing the time allowed for filing an appeal; however, when the 
filing period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, 
the filing time is automatically extended to the end of the next Federal 
working day.
    (3) It is the responsibility of those filing an appeal to file the 
notice of appeal by the end of the filing period. In the event of 
questions, legible postmarks on a mailed appeal or the time and date 
imprint on a facsimile appeal will be considered evidence of timely 
filing. Where postmarks or facsimile imprints are illegible, the Appeal 
Deciding Officer shall rule on the timeliness of the notice of appeal.
    (4) The time period for filing a notice of appeal is not extendable.
    (h) Dismissal without decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall 
dismiss an appeal and close the record without a decision in any of the 
following circumstances:
    (1) The appellant is not on the timber sale bidders list for the 
area affected by the recomputation decision;
    (2) The appellant's notice of appeal is not filed within the 
required time period;
    (3) The appellant's notice of appeal does not contain responses 
required by paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(viii) of this section; 
or
    (4) The appellant did not submit written comments on the proposed 
decision of the new recomputed shares as described in paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (i) Appeal record. The appeal record consists of the written 
decision being appealed, any predecisional comments received, any 
written comments submitted by interested parties, any other supporting 
data used to make the decision, the notice of appeal, and, if prepared, 
a responsive statement by the Responsible Official which addresses the 
issues raised in the notice of appeal. The Responsible Official must 
forward the record to the Appeal Deciding Officer within 7 days of the 
date the notice of appeal is received. A copy of the appeal record must 
be sent to the appellant at the same time.
    (j) Appeal decision. (1) Responsive statement for appeal decision. 
The Appeal Deciding Officer may request the Responsible Official to 
prepare a responsive statement. However, if the information in the files 
clearly demonstrates the rationale for the Responsible Official's 
decision, then a responsive statement addressing the points of the 
appeal is not necessary.
    (2) Appeal issue clarification. For clarification of issues raised 
in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer may request additional 
information from either the Responsible Official, the appellant, or an 
interested party who has submitted comments on the appeal. At the 
discretion of the Appeal Deciding Officer, an appellant or interested 
party may be invited to discuss data relevant to the appeal. Information 
provided to clarify issues or facts in the appeal must be based upon 
information previously documented in the file or appeal. Any information 
provided as a result of the Appeal Deciding Officer's request for more 
information must be made available to all parties, that is, to the 
Responsible Official, the appellant, and interested parties who have 
submitted comments on the appeal. All parties will have 5 days after the 
Appeal Deciding Officer receives the additional information to review 
and comment on the information, and the appeal decision period will be 
extended 5 additional days.
    (3) Issuance of final decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall 
review the decision and appeal record and issue a written appeal 
decision to the parties within 30 days of the close of the appeal period 
except that this period must be extended to 35 days when additional 
information is requested by the Appeal Deciding Officer. The Appeal 
Officer may affirm or reverse the Responsible Official's decision, in 
whole or in part. There is no extension of the time period for rendering 
an appeal decision.
    (k) Implementation of decisions during pendency of appeal. 
Recomputation of shares arising from a scheduled 5-year recomputation 
are effective on April 1

[[Page 107]]

following the end of the 5-year period being considered. If an appeal 
that may affect the shares for the next 5-year period is not resolved by 
the April 1 date, the share decision announced by the Responsible 
Official must be implemented. If an appeal decision results in a change 
in the shares, the revised total share of the Small Business Timber Sale 
Set-aside Program must be accomplished during the remaining portion of 
the 5-year period.
    (l) Timber sale set-aside policy changes. Timber purchasers shall 
receive an opportunity, in accordance with all applicable laws and 
regulations, to review and comment on significant changes in the Small 
Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program or policy prior to adoption and 
implementation.
    (m) Information collection requirements. The provisions of paragraph 
(f) of this section specify the information that appellants must provide 
when appealing decisions pertaining to recomputation of shares. As such, 
these rules contain information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 
1320. These information requirements have been approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0141.

debarring official may in the public interest, debar a purchaser for any 
of the causes listed in Sec. 223.137. However, the existence of a cause

debarred. In making any debarment decision, the debarring official shall 
consider the seriousness of the purchaser's acts or omissions and any 
mitigating factors.
    (b) Effect of proposed debarment. (1) Upon issuance of a notice of

upon a written determination identifying compelling reasons to continue 
doing business with that purchaser pending completion of debarment 
proceedings.
    (2) In addition to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, issuance of a 
notice of proposed debarment under Sec. 223.137(g)

Sec. 223.138  Procedures for debarment.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information which may be sufficient 
cause for debarment of a timber sale purchaser and affiliates shall be 
reported to the Forest Service Debarring Official. Generally, such 
information should be referred through the Forest Supervisor and the 
Regional Forester. The referral shall be accompanied by a complete 
statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits and a 
recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates a 
possible criminal offense, except possible antitrust violations, the 
debarring official shall notify the Office of Inspector General, USDA. 
Where the statement of facts indicates a possible antitrust violation, 
the debarring official shall notify the Antitrust Division, Department 
of Justice.

[[Page 111]]

    (b) Decisionmaking process--(1) Notice of proposal to debar. The 
debarring official shall initiate debarment by advising the purchaser 
and any specifically named affiliate, by certified mail, return receipt 
requested. The notice document shall include the following information:
    (i) That debarment is being considered.
    (ii) The reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the recipient on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based.
    (iii) The cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 223.137 for proposing 
debarment.
    (iv) The specific procedures governing debarment decisionmaking in 
Sec. 223.138 (b)(1) through (b)(8).
    (v) The effect of the issuance of the notice of proposed debarment 
pending a final debarment decision (see Sec. 223.136(b)).
    (vi) The potential effect of a debarment.
    (2) Submission in opposition. Within 30 calendar days after receipt 
of the notice of proposed debarment, the respondent my submit, in 
person, in writing, or through a representative, information and 
argument in opposition to and/or in mitigation of the proposed 
debarment, including any additional specific information that raises a 
genuine dispute over the material facts.
    (3) Informal hearing. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
a respondent may request an informal hearing with the debarring offical. 
The informal hearing shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date 
the request is received. The debarring official may postpone the date of 
the hearing if the respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the 
hearing, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or 
other authorized representative, may informally present and explain 
evidence that causes for debarment do not exist, evidence of any 
mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, 
duration or effects of proposed debarment or debarment. A transcript of 
the informal hearing shall not be required.
    (4) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. In actions 
not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring official 
finds that and gives notice that the submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) may request a fact-finding conference on those disputed 
material facts. Such a conference shall be held within 20 calendar days 
from the date the request is received unless mutually agreed otherwise. 
The fact-finding conference shall conform with the following 
requirements:
    (i) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the 
debarring official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in 
the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected 
to by the Department of Justice.
    (ii) At the conference, the respondent shall have the opportunity to 
appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any person the Forest Service presents.
    (iii) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
made available at cost to the respondent upon request, unless the 
respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.
    (5) Debarring official's decision--(i) No additional proceedings 
necessary. In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgement or in 
which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the debarring 
official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in 
the administrative record, including any submission made by the 
purchaser or any specifically named affiliate. The decision shall be 
made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted, unless the debarring official extends this period 
for good cause.
    (ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, the debarring official shall promptly prepare written findings of 
fact. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as 
found, together with any information and argument submitted by the 
purchaser or any specifically named affiliate and any other information 
in the administrative record.

[[Page 112]]

    (B) The debarring official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (C) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (6) Standard of evidence. In any action in which the proposed 
debarment is not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the cause 
for debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. In 
any action in which the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or 
civil judgment, the standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (7) Notice of debarring official's decision. (i) The purchaser and 
any affiliates involved shall be given prompt notice of the debarring 
official's decision by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the 
debarring official decides to impose debarment, the notice shall:
    (A) Refer to the notice of proposed debarment:
    (B) Specify the reasons for debarment;
    (C) State the period of debarment, including effective dates (see 
Sec. 223.139);
    (D) Specify any limitations on the terms of the debarment; and
    (E) State that any decision to debar is appealable to the 
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals pursuant to paragraph (b)(8) of 
this section.
    (ii) The debarring official shall also promptly notify Regional 
Foresters and Forest Supervisors of the decision.
    (8) Review of debarring official's decision. The purchaser and any 
affiliates involved may appeal a Forest Service debarring official's 
decision to debar within 30 days from receipt of the decision. To 
appeal, a purchaser and any affiliates involved must furnish a written 
notice to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals, 
Washington, DC 20250, and a copy of the appeal to the debarring official 
from whose decision the appeal is taken. The rules and procedures of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals set forth in 7 
CFR part 24, govern debarment appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 223.139  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s):
    (1) The debarring official shall consider any suspension period or 
period since issuance of the notice of proposed debarment in determining 
the debarment period.

(a)-(f) of this subpart should not exceed three (3) years, except as 
otherwise provided by law.
    (3) A debarment for the causes listed at Sec. 223.137(g) shall not 
exceed five (5) years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend the debarment for those causes 
listed at Sec. 223.137 (a)-(f) of this subpart for an additional period 
if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect 
the Government's interest. However:
    (1) A debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts 
and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based;
    (2) If debarment for an additional period is necessary, the 
debarring official shall initiate and follow the procedures in 
Sec. 223.138 to extend the debarment.
    (c) The debarring official may consider terminating the debarment or 
reducing the period or extent of debarment, upon the purchaser's 
request, supported by documentation, for reasons such as:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or judgment upon which the debarment 
was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.
    (d) The debarring official shall make final disposition of a 
reconsideration request under paragraph (c) of this section in writing 
within 30 working days of receipt of the reconsideration request and 
supporting documentation, unless the debarring official extends

[[Page 113]]

this period for good cause. The notice of the decision shall set forth 
the reasons for granting or denying the request.

<R05>
Sec. 223.140  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a purchaser constitutes 
debarment of all divisions or other organizational elements of the 
purchaser, unless the debarment decision is limited by its terms to 
specific divisions, organizational elements, or classes of sales.
    (2) The debarring official may extend a debarment decision to 
include any affiliates of the purchaser, if they are--
    (i) Specifically named and
    (ii) Given written notice of the proposed debarment and provided an 
opportunity to respond (see Sec. 223.138(b)).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determinig the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of 
any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other 
individual associated with a purchaser may be imputed to a purchaser 
when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's 
performance of duties for or on behalf of the purchaser, or with the 
purchaser's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The purchaser's 
acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of 
such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
    (2) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of 
a purchaser may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the purchaser who

conduct.
    (3) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of 
one purchaser participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement 
may be imputed to other participating purchasers if the conduct occurred 
for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement or with the 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of those purchasers. Acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence.


<R05>
Sec. 223.141  Suspension.

    (a) The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a 
purchaser on the basis of adequate evidence for any of the causes in 
Sec. 223.142, using the procedures in Sec. 223.143. However, the 
existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that 
the purchaser be suspended. In making any suspension decision, the 
suspending official shall consider the seriousness of the purchaser's 
acts or omissions and any mitigating factors.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed, pending the 
completion of investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been 
determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the 
Government's interest. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, 
consideration shall be given to how much information is available, how 
credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important 
allegations are corroborated and what inferences can reasonably be drawn 
as a result. This assessment shall include an examination of basic 
documents such as contracts, bids, awards, inspection reports, and 
correspondence, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 223.142  Causes for suspension.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a purchaser suspected, upon 
adequate evidence, of the following:
    (1) Commission of:
    (i) Theft, forgery, bribery, embezzlement, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property;
    (ii) Fraud, a criminal offense, or violation of Federal or State 
antitrust laws, any of which occurred in connection with obtaining, 
attempting to obtain; or performing a public contract or subcontract; or
    (iii) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or 
business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present 
responsibility of a purchase of Government timber.
    (2) Indictment for any of the causes listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section constitutes adequate evidence for suspension.

[[Page 114]]

    (3) A purchaser's suspension from the purchaser of timber by another 
Federal agency which sells timber.
    (b) The suspending official may, upon adequate evidence, also 
suspend a purchaser for any other cause so serious or compelling that it 
affects the present responsibility or a purchaser of Government timber.

Service Suspending Official. Generally, such information should be 
referred through the Forest Supervisor and the Regional Forester. The 
referral shall be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts 
supported by appropriate exhibits and a recommendation for action. Where 
the statement of facts indicates a possible criminal offense, except 
possible antitrust violations, the suspending official shall notify the 
Office of Inspector General, USDA. Where the statement of facts 
indicates a possible antitrust violation, the suspending official shall 
notify the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice.
    (b) Decisionmaking process--(1) Notice of suspension. When a 
purchaser and any specifically named affiliates are suspended, the

Such notice shall specify:
    (i) That they have been suspended as of the date of the notice;
    (ii) That the suspension is based on an indictment or other adequate 
evidence that the purchaser has committed irregularities,
    (A) Of a serious nature in business dealings with the Government, or
    (B) Seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Government 
dealings with the recipient;
    (iii) Any such irregularities shall be described in terms sufficient 
to place the recipient on notice without disclosing the Government's 
evidence;
    (iv) That the suspension is for a temporary period of time pending 
the completion of an investigation and such legal proceedings as may 
ensue;
    (v) The cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 223.142 for imposing 
suspension;
    (vi) The effect of the suspension (see Sec. 223.135);
    (vii) The specific procedures governing suspension decisionmaking in 
Sec. 223.143 (b)(1) through (b)(6).
    (2) Submission in opposition. Within 30 calendar days after receipt

suspending official finds that there exists a genuine dispute over facts 
material to the suspension, respondent(s) shall be afforded an 
opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present 
witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents, unless--
    (A) The action is based on an indictment; or
    (B) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or 
contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension 
would be prejudiced.
    (ii) If appropriate, the respondent may request a fact-finding 
conference

[[Page 115]]

on disputed material facts. Such a conference shall be held within 20 
calendar days from the date the request is received unless mutually 
agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall conform with the 
following requirements:
    (A) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the 
suspending official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in 
the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected

unless the respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive 
the requirement for a transcript.
    (5) Suspending official's decision. The suspending official may 
modify or terminate the suspension or leave it in force for the same 
reasons as for terminating or reducing the period or extent of debarment 
(see Sec. 223.139(c)). The decision shall be made in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (i) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based on an 
indictment, in which the respondent's submission does not raise a 
genuine dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings 
to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official's decision shall 
be based on all the information in the administrative record, including 
any submissions and argument made by the respondent. The decision shall 
be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, 
written findings of fact shall be promptly prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (B) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (C) The suspending official's decision shall be made only after the 
conclusion of any proceedings with respect to disputed facts.

    The rules of this subpart apply to all timber sale contracts awarded 
before August 20, 1990, the date of enactment of the Forest Resources 
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.). 
The rules at Sec. 223.162 shall remain in effect for all contracts

September 8, 1995 are governed in full by subpart F.

[60 FR 46922, Sept. 8, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 223.160  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to the provisions of this section:
    (a) Export means either direct or indirect export to a foreign 
country and occurs on the date that a person enters into a contract or 
other binding transaction for the export of unprocessed timber or, if 
that date cannot be established, when unprocessed timber is found in an 
export yard or pond, bundled or otherwise prepared for shipment, or 
aboard an ocean-going vessel. An export yard or pond is an area where 
sorting and/or bundling of logs for shipment outside the United States 
is accomplished. Unprocessed timber, whether from National Forest System 
or private lands, is exported directly when exported by the National 
Forest timber purchaser. Timber is exported indirectly when export 
occurs as a result of a sale to another person or as a consequence of 
any subsequent transaction.
    (b) Historic level means the average annual volume of unprocessed 
timber purchased or exported in calendar years 1971, 1972, and 1973.
    (c) Private lands mean lands held or owned by a private person. 
Nonprivate lands include, but are not limited to, lands held or owned by 
the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or any 
other public agency, or lands held in trust by the United States for 
Indians.
    (d) Substitution means the purchase of unprocessed timber from 
National Forest System lands to be used as replacement for unprocessed 
timber from private lands which is exported by the purchaser. 
Substitution occurs when (1) a person increases purchases of National 
Forest timber in any Calendar year more than 10 percent above their 
historic level and in the same calendar year exports unprocessed timber 
from private land in the tributary area; or (2) a person increases 
exports of unprocessed timber from private land in any tributary area 
more than 10 percent above their historic level in any calendar year 
while they have National Forest timber under contract.
    (e) Tributary area means the geographic area from which unprocessed 
timber is delivered to a specific processing facility or complex. A 
tributary area is expanded when timber outside an established tributary 
area is hauled to the processing facility or complex.
    (f) Unprocessed timber, except western red cedar in the contiguous 
48 States, means trees or portions of trees having a net scale content 
not less than 33\1/3\ percent of the gross volume, or the minimum piece 
specification set forth in the timber sale contract, in material meeting 
the peeler and sawmill log grade requirements published in the January 
1, 1980--Official Log Scaling and Grading Rules used by Log Scaling and 
Grading Bureaus on the West Coast; cants to be subsequently 
remanufactured exceeding 8\3/4\ inches in thickness; cants of any 
thickness reassembled into logs; and split or round bolts, except for 
aspen, or other roundwood not processed to standards and specifications 
suitable for end-product use. Unprocessed timber shall not mean pulp 
(utility) grade logs and Douglas-fir special cull logs or timber 
processed into the following:
    (1) Lumber and construction timbers, regardless of size, sawn on 
four sides;
    (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
    (3) Green veneer and plywood;
    (4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated for use as such;
    (5) Cants cut for remanufacture, 8\3/4\ inches in thickness or less;
    (6) Aspen bolts, not exceeding 4 feet in length.

[[Page 117]]

    (g) Unprocessed western red cedar timber in the contiguous 48 States 
means trees or portions of trees of that species which have not been 
processed into--
    (1) Lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3 dimension 
or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of 
Number 3 Common or better;
    (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
    (3) Veneer and plywood;
    (4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated with preservatives for 
use as such and not intended to be further processed; or
    (5) Shakes and shingles; provided that lumber from private lands 
manufactured to the standards established in the lumber grading rules of 
the American Lumber Standards Association or the Pacific Lumber 
Inspection Bureau and manufactured lumber authorized to be exported 
under license by the Department of Commerce shall be considered 
processed.
    (h) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, 
association, or other legal entity and includes any subsidiary, 
subcontractor, parent company, or other affiliate. Business entities are 
considered affiliates for the entire calendar year when one controls or 
has the power to control the other or when both are controlled directly 
or indirectly by a third person during any part of the calendar year.
    (i) Purchase occurs when a person is awarded a contract to cut 
National Forest timber or through the approval of a third party 
agreement by the Forest Service.
    (j) Purchaser means a person that has purchased a National Forest 
timber sale.

Sec. 223.185  Scope and applicability.

    This subpart implements provisions of the Forest Resources 
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) 
that became effective upon enactment or as otherwise specified in the 
Act. As of September 8, 1995, this subpart applies to unprocessed timber 
originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the 
contiguous 48 States that requires domestic processing. Except as 
provided later in this paragraph, this subpart applies to all 
unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands west of 
the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States acquired from timber sale 
contracts awarded on or after August 20, 1990. The rules regarding 
substitution at Sec. 223.162 of subpart D apply to unprocessed timber 
acquired from timber sale contracts awarded between August 20, 1990, and 
September 8, 1995, as provided in Sec. 490(a)(2)(A) of the Act. The 
rules regarding reporting the acquisition and disposition of unprocessed 
Federal timber at Sec. 223.193 of this subpart apply to all transfers of 
unprocessed Federal timber originating from National Forest System lands 
west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States regardless of 
timber sale contract award date.

may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber in 
violation of the Act.
    Disregard means to ignore, overlook, or fail to observe any 
provision of the Act or a regulation issued under this Act, even though 
such violation may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal 
timber in violation of the Act.
    Should have known means committing an act that a reasonable person 
in the timber industry would have known violates a provision of the Act 
or regulations issued under the Act, even though the violation may not

unprocessed timber to supply such manufacturing facility; a sourcing 
area must be geographically and economically separate from any area from 
which that person harvests for export any unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands.
    Substitution occurs when:
    (1) A person acquires, directly or indirectly, unprocessed timber 
from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 
States and engages in exporting or selling for export, unprocessed 
timber originating from private lands within the same geographic and

timber originating from private lands; or
    (3) A person exports or sells for export, unprocessed timber 
originating from private lands within the same geographic and economic 
area in the same calendar year that the person has unprocessed timber 
originating from Federal lands in the person's possession or under 
contract; or
    (4) A person purchases, directly or indirectly, unprocessed timber 
originating from Federal lands if such person sells or otherwise 
transfers unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of 
the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires 
domestic processing, to a third party if that third party or successive 
parties export that unprocessed private timber. A third party or 
successive parties who acquire such unprocessed timber that originates 
from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 
States and that requires domestic processing may not export such timber.
    Transaction means an arrangement involving the transfer of

Sec. 223.187  Determinations of unprocessed timber.

    (a) All species except western red cedar. Unprocessed timber, as 
defined in Sec. 223.186 of this Subpart, does not include timber 
processed into any one of the following:
    (1) Lumber or construction timbers, except western red cedar, 
meeting current American Lumber Standards Grades or Pacific Lumber 
Inspection Bureau Export R or N list grades, sawn on 4 sides, not 
intended for remanufacture. To determine whether such lumber or 
construction timbers meet this grade and intended use standard, the 
shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment or 
order, and available for inspection upon the request of the Forest 
Service:
    (i) A legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a 
lumber inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the 
industry as setting a selling standard; and,
    (ii) A statement by the manufacturer certifying under the penalties 
provided in section 492 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the products in the shipment or 
order are intended to be used as shipped, are manufactured into 
products, or processed into pulp, and are not to be manufactured into 
other products. The certification statements shall be made in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section. The certification statements in 
paragraph (b) of this section are not required if the lumber or 
construction timbers described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or 
the pulpwood bolts described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section 
otherwise may be exported without regard to an intent to remanufacture 
or process into pulp. For instance, because the timber originates from 
private land from which timber may be exported.
    (2) Lumber, construction timbers, or cants for remanufacture, except 
western red cedar, meeting current American Lumber Standards Grades or 
Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R or N list clear grades, sawn 
on 4 sides, not to exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick. To determine 
whether such lumber, timbers, or cants meet this grading standard, the 
shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment or order 
and available for inspection, upon the request of the Forest Service, a 
legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a lumber 
inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the industry as 
setting a selling standard.
    (3) Lumber, construction timbers, or cants for remanufacture, except 
western red cedar, that do not meet the grades referred to in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section and are sawn on 4 sides, with wane less than \1/
4\ of any face, not exceeding 8\3/4\ inches (22.2 cm) thick.
    (4) Chips, pulp, or pulp products.
    (5) Veneer or plywood.
    (6) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated with preservatives for

understanding of the export and substitution restrictions of the Forest 
Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 et 
seq.)

[[Page 122]]

(Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully understand that 
exporting unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands or 
unprocessed timber from private lands which is required to be processed 
domestically is a violation of this Act, its implementing regulations, 
and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the 
penalties and remedies provided for such violations.''
    (3) Pulpwood bolts. ``I certify that the pulpwood bolts in the 
shipment identified by my shipping order number -------- dated --------, 
are manufactured in accordance with the attached order from (buyer) of 
(address), numbered -------- and dated --------, are intended to be 
processed into pulp and are not to be remanufactured into other 
products. I make this certification with full knowledge and 
understanding of the export and substitution restrictions of the Forest 
Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully understand that 
exporting unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands or 
unprocessed timber from private lands which is required to be processed 
domestically is a violation of this Act, its implementing regulations, 
and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the 
penalties and remedies provided for such violations.''
    (4) Signatory procedures. Certificates shall be on company

on behalf of (name of corporation). I make this authorization with full 
knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions 
of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 
U.S.C. 620 et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully 
understand that exporting unprocessed timber originating from Federal 
lands or unprocessed timber originating from private lands which is 
required to be processed domestically is a violation of this Act, its 
implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), 
and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such 
violation.''

    (6) Exporters of other timber products originating from Federal 
lands not specifically listed in Sec. 223.187 which may develop export 
markets in the future may also require similar certification statements. 
Such statements will be provided by the Forest Service.
    (c) Western red cedar. Unprocessed western red cedar timber does not 
include manufactured lumber authorized for export under license by the 
Department of Commerce, and lumber from private lands processed to 
standards established in the lumber grading rules of the American Lumber 
Standards Association or the Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau, or timber 
processed into any of the following products:
    (1) Lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3 dimension 
or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of 
Number 3 common or better, with a maximum cross section of 2,000 square 
centimeters (310 square inches) for any individual piece of processed 
western red cedar, regardless of grade. To determine whether such lumber 
meets these established standards, grades and size restrictions, the 
shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment, and 
available for inspection upon the request of the Forest Service, a 
legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a lumber 
inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the industry as 
setting a selling standard. Export restrictions governing western red 
cedar timber harvested from Federal, State or other public lands are 
found in 7(i) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 as amended (50 
U.S.C. appendix 2406(i)), and implementing regulations at 15 CFR 777.7.
    (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
    (3) Veneer and plywood;
    (4) Poles, posts, pilings cut or treated with preservatives for use 
as such and not intended to be further processed; and

from unprocessed western red cedar originating from Federal lands, 
acquired by the manufacturer under the exemption from the prohibition 
against indirect substitution at Sec. 223.189(e)(1), must have in their 
possession for each shipment a certificate from the manufacturer that 
such products are finished products as defined in Sec. 223.186 of this 
subpart. The certification statement shall read as follows:
    (1) ``I certify that the products in the shipment identified by my 
shipping order number ------, dated ------, are manufactured in 
accordance with the attached order from ---- (buyer) ---- of ------ 
(address) ------, numbered ---- and dated ------, are intended for end 
product use. I understand that only western red cedar products that are 
finished products are exempt from the prohibition against indirect 
substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief 
Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620b(b)(1)) and its implementing regulations. I 
make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the 
export and substitution restrictions of the Forest Resources 
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) 
(Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully acknowledge and 
understand that to acquire western red cedar under the indirect 
substitution exemption in 16 U.S.C. 620b(b)(1) for purposes other than 
domestic processing into finished products will be a violation of this 
Act, its implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 
U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided 
for such violation.''
    (2) Signatory procedures. Certificates shall be on company 
letterhead, and signed by the person manufacturing the shipment. In the 
case of a corporation, the certificate must be signed by a person 
authorized, in writing, by the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to 36

authorization with full knowledge and understanding of the export and 
substitution restrictions of the Forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its 
implementing regulations. I fully understand that exporting unprocessed 
timber originating from Federal lands or unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands which is required to be processed domestically is a 
violation of this Act, its implementing regulations, and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies provided for such violation.''

    (2) A signed certification which reads as follows:

    ``I have purchased, under an historic export quota approved by the 
Secretary of Agriculture, unprocessed timber originating from Federal 
lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States 
during the preceding 24 months in direct substitution for exported 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands. I desire to purchase 
directly from a Department or agency of the United States, unprocessed 
timber originating from Federal lands located in such area of the United 
States. I make this certification for the exemption from the prohibition 
against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing 
Federal timber required by the Forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990, (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 
U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all 
exporting of such unprocessed private timber from lands west of the 
100th meridian in the 48 contiguous States of the United States by 
February 20, 1991. I make this certification with full knowledge and 
understanding of the requirements of this Act and do fully understand 
that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of 
this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), 
and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided from such 
violation.''

    (3) The certification must have been signed by the person making 
such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief 
Executive Officer.
    (e) Indirect substitution prohibition. No person may purchase from 
any other person unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west 
of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States if such person would 
be prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section from purchasing such 
timber directly from a Department or agency of the United States, 
pursuant to Sec. 490(b) of the Forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.). The prohibition in 
this paragraph does not apply to the following:
    (1) To the acquisition of western red cedar, which is domestically 
processed into finished products.
    (2) To a person who acquires unprocessed timber originating from 
Federal lands within an approved sourcing area, does not export 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved 
sourcing area while the approval is in effect, and, if applicable, 
receives a waiver of the prohibition against exporting unprocessed 
timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area during 
the preceding 24 months in accordance with Sec. 223.189 (f) and (g) of 
this subpart.
    (3) To the limited amount of unprocessed National Forest System 
timber within Washington State that is exempt from the prohibition 
against indirect substitution, pursuant to Sec. 223.203.
    (f) Waiver within a sourcing area. The prohibitions in 
Sec. 223.189(a) (1) and (2) against direct and indirect acquisition of 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands do not apply if:
    (1) A person acquires such timber from within an approved sourcing 
area located west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous States;
    (2) Has not exported unprocessed timber originating from private 
lands located within the approved sourcing area during the preceding 24 
months;
    (3) Does not export such private timber from within the approved 
sourcing area during the period the sourcing area is in effect; and
    (4) Does not export such private timber during any calendar year in 
the same geographic and economic area that unprocessed timber 
originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the 
contiguous 48 States is under contract or in possession, if the sourcing 
area is no longer in effect, pursuant to the definition of substitution 
in 36 CFR 223.186.
    (5) The appropriate Regional Forester could waive, in writing, the 
prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for any 
person who certified in writing, on or before November 20, 1990, that on 
or before February 20, 1991, that person would cease exporting 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved 
sourcing area for a period of not less than three (3) years. Signatories 
of this certificate who received an approved sourcing area, like all 
holders of sourcing areas, are subject to the prohibition against 
exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the 
sourcing area boundaries, pursuant to this paragraph.
    (g) Application for waiver within a sourcing area. To obtain a 
waiver of the

[[Page 126]]

prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for 
purchasing Federal timber described in paragraph (f) of this section, a 
person must have submitted a request for waiver, in writing, to the 
Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility 
being sourced is located, which must have been received by the Regional 
Forester on or before November 20, 1990, and which must have been signed 
by the person making such request or, in the case of a corporation, by 
its Chief Executive Officer. The request for waiver must be notarized 
and, in the case of a corporation, with its corporate seal affixed. The 
request shall be on company letterhead with its corporate seal affixed 
and must include:
    (1) An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving 
acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and 
Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the waiver request, for a 
period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such 
records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional 
Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.
    (2) A signed certification statement which reads as follows:

    ``I have engaged in exporting of unprocessed timber originating from 
private land located within the sourcing area for which I am applying. I 
desire to purchase directly from a department or agency of the United 
States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located within 
the desired sourcing area. I hereby request waiver of the prohibition 
against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing 
Federal timber required by the forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 
U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all 
exporting of such unprocessed private timber from within the desired 
sourcing area by February 20, 1991, and will not resume such exporting 
for a period of not less than three (3) years. I make this certification 
with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of this Act 
and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as 
certified will be a violation of Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 
620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me 
to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.''


<R05>
Sec. 223.190  Sourcing area application procedures.

    (a) Subject to the restrictions described in Sec. 223.189 of this 
subpart and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
person who owns or operates a manufacturing facility and who exports 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands may apply for a 
sourcing area in accordance with the procedures of this section. 
However, an owner/operator of a manufacturing facility who exports 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands may not possess or 
acquire unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands unless the 
acquisition is within an approved sourcing area. A person who intends to 
acquire or become affiliated with a manufacturing facility that 
processes Federal timber and who is an exporter may apply for a sourcing 
area. Written proof of the intent to acquire or affiliate must be 
included in the sourcing area application, signed by the applicant and 
the person or, in the case of a corporation, the Chief Executive 
Officer, whose company the applicant intends to acquire or affiliate 
with. This certification must be on letterhead and must be notarized. A 
sourcing area application that the Secretary determines would be 
approved will be granted tentative approval pending final notification 
by the applicant of acquisition of or affiliation with the manufacturing 
facility. The tentative approval of the sourcing area will lapse unless 
the acquisition or affiliation occurs within 30 days of the tentative 
approval of the sourcing area. A sourcing area is not valid until final 
approval of the sourcing area. The direct substitution prohibition did 
not apply to a person who applied for a sourcing area on or before 
December 20, 1990. A request for modification of an existing sourcing 
area shall trigger a review pursuant to the procedures and restrictions 
in Sec. 223.191(e).
    (b) As provided in the Act, a person who has requested an exemption 
or waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-
month period, pursuant to Sec. 223.189 of this subpart, must have 
applied for the desired sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990.

[[Page 127]]

    (c) Applications. Sourcing area applications shall include:
    (1) A map of sufficient scale and detail to clearly show:
    (i) The applicant's desired sourcing area boundary. This boundary 
will include both the private and Federal lands from which the applicant 
intends to acquire unprocessed timber for sourcing its manufacturing 
facilities;
    (ii) The location of the timber manufacturing facilities owned or 
operated by the applicant within the proposed sourcing area where the 
person intends to process timber originating from Federal land;
    (iii) The location of private lands within and outside the desired 
sourcing area where the person has, within the 24 months immediately 
preceding the date of the application, acquired unprocessed timber 
originating from private land which was exported, sold, traded, 
exchanged, or otherwise conveyed to another person for the purpose of 
exporting such timber;
    (2) A list of other persons with timber manufacturing facilities 
located within the same general vicinity as the applicant's facilities;
    (3) Any other information the applicant may believe is appropriate 
to support approval of the requested sourcing area; and
    (4) A statement signed by the person certifying under the penalties 
provided in Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information provided in support 
of the application is true, complete, and accurate to the best of the 
applicant's knowledge. The statement shall read as follows:

    ``I certify under penalties of 16 U.S.C. 620d and 18 U.S.C. 1001, 
that the information provided in support of this application, is true, 
complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge concerning my timber 
purchasing and export patterns. I certify that the information provided 
concerning my timber purchasing and export patterns fully and accurately 
reflects, to the best of my knowledge, the boundaries of the sourcing 
area for which I am applying. I make this certification with full 
knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions 
of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 
U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I certify 
that I have not exported unprocessed timber originating from private 
lands within the boundaries of the sourcing area that is the subject of 
this application in the previous 24 months. I fully understand that, if 
this application is approved, exporting unprocessed private timber 
originating from within the approved sourcing area will be a violation 
of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) its implementing regulations, and 
the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the 
penalties and remedies provided for such violation.''

    (d) Confidential information. Applications are not considered 
confidential. However, if a person does submit confidential information 
as part of an application, the information should be marked 
confidential. Information so marked will be afforded the rights and 
protection provided under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (e) Where to submit the application. A sourcing area applicant shall 
send the application to the Office of Administrative Law Judges and 
shall, simultaneously, send a copy of the sourcing area application to 
the Forest Service Regional Forester of the region in which the 
manufacturing facility being sourced is located. Where the sourcing area 
application will cover purchases from more than one agency, application 
is to be made to the agency from which the applicant expects to purchase 
the preponderance of its Federal timber. The sourcing area applicant 
must also send a complete copy of the application to each agency 
concerned. The lead agency shall make the decision in consultation with, 
and upon co-signature of, the other agencies concerned.
    (f) Signatory procedures. Sourcing area applications must be signed 
by the person making the request, or in the case of a corporation, by 
its Chief Executive Officer, and must be notarized. The application 
shall be on company letterhead.
    (g) The sourcing area application and review process will be 
conducted pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication 
of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas 
Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 
1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M.
    (h) A final decision on a sourcing area application or a formal 
sourcing area review will be issued within four

[[Page 128]]

(4) months of the receipt of the application or initiation of the 
review.
    (i) The following criteria must be met for sourcing area approval:
    (1) The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial 
Officer must find that the proposed sourcing area is geographically and 
economically separate from any area that the applicant harvests or 
expects to harvest for export any unprocessed timber originating from 
private lands. In making such a finding, the Administrative Law Judge, 
or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall consider the timber purchasing 
patterns of the applicant on private and Federal lands equally with 
those of other persons in the same local vicinity and the relative 
similarity of such purchasing patterns.
    (2) The ``same local vicinity'' will normally be manufacturing 
facilities located within 30 miles of the community where the 
applicant's manufacturing facility is located, but may include more 
distant communities if manufacturing facilities in those communities 
depend on the same source of timber and have similar purchasing 
patterns.
    (3) The relative similarity of purchasing patterns of other mills 
shall be determined by considering the location and similarity of 
unprocessed timber being acquired by those facilities.
    (4) Lines defining the geographic area shall be based on major 
natural and cultural features, including, but not limited to, prominent 
ridge systems, main roads or highways, rivers, political subdivisions, 
and not characterized by random lines.
    (j) Comments. Persons may submit comments on sourcing area 
applications pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the 
Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing 
Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief 
Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. 
Persons submitting a comment must certify at the end of the comment, but 
before the signature, to the following: ``I certify that the information 
provided by me is true and accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and I 
understand that failure to provide true and accurate information could 
be violation of the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).''
    (k) Transporting or causing to be transported unprocessed private 
timber from outside of a sourcing area into a sourcing area by the 
holder of the sourcing area is prohibited as a violation of the sourcing 
area boundary. Such violation will cause a review of the sourcing area, 
and could subject the sourcing area holder to the penalties and remedies 
for violations of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief 
Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq., and its implementing regulations.
    (l) A person with an approved sourcing area may relinquish the 
sourcing area at any time provided the person certifies to the 
following:

    ``I am relinquishing the approved sourcing area, described in the 
Secretary's determination in FSAA -------- on --------, 19----. I 
understand that I may not export unprocessed timber originating from 
private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States 
during the fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating 
from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 
States in my possession or under contract, pursuant to the prohibition 
against substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage 
Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (``Act'') and its 
implementing regulations. I also understand that I may not purchase 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States, pursuant to the prohibitions 
against substitution in the Act and its implementing regulations. I make 
this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the Act and 
its implementing regulations and do fully understand that exporting 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States during a fiscal year in which I 
have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States in possession or under contract, or 
purchasing unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 
100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having 
exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 
100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is a violation of the 
substitution provisions of the Act and the False Statements Act (18 
U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided 
for such violation.''


[[Page 129]]


    The certificate must be signed by the person making such 
certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive 
Officer; must be on company letterhead; and must be notarized.
    (m) A sourcing area is in effect until it is relinquished by the 
sourcing area holder, or is disapproved upon review of the sourcing 
area.

Sec. 223.191  Sourcing area disapproval and review procedures.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an applicant whose 
sourcing area application was submitted by December 20, 1990, and was 
disapproved could either phase out of purchasing Federal timber or phase 
out of exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands 
within the sourcing area that would have been approved, as follows:
    (1) Phase-out of Federal timber purchasing. The applicant could 
purchase, in the 9-month period after receiving the application 
disapproval, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the 
disapproved sourcing area, in an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the 
annual average of such person's purchases of unprocessed Federal timber 
in such area during the 5 full fiscal years immediately prior to the 
date of submission of the application. In the 6-month period immediately 
following the 9-month period, such person could purchase not more than 
25 percent of such annual average, after which time the prohibitions 
against direct substitution, set forth in Sec. 223.189 of this subpart, 
shall apply; or
    (2) Phase-out of private timber exporting. The applicant could 
continue to purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands 
within the disapproved sourcing area without being subject to the phase-
out of Federal timber purchasing procedures described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, if the following requirements were met:
    (i) The applicant certified to the Regional Forester or the 
approving official to whom such authority has been delegated, within 90 
days after receiving the disapproval decision, as follows:
    (A) An applicant that has exported unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands from the geographic area that would have been 
approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:

    ``I have engaged in the exporting of unprocessed private timber 
originating from private lands located within the geographic area the 
approving official would have approved as a sourcing area for my 
manufacturing facility. I desire to continue purchasing unprocessed 
Federal timber from within such area. I hereby certify that I will cease 
all exporting of unprocessed timber from private lands located within 
the area that would have been approved by [the applicant shall insert 
date 15 months from date of receipt of the disapproval decision]. I 
agree to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and 
disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands 
within the area involved in the certification, for a period of three (3) 
years beginning on the date of receipt of the disapproval notification, 
and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of 
the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been 
delegated. I make this certification with full knowledge and 
understanding of the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation 
and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and do 
fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will 
be a violation of the Act and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies for such violation. Further, I fully understand that such 
violation may subject me to the penalty of perjury pursuant to the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001). I certify that the information in this 
certificate is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge 
and belief.'';


or,

    (B) An applicant who has not exported unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands from the geographic area that the Secretary would 
have approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:

    ``I have not exported timber originating from private lands within 
both the sourcing area that the Secretary would have approved and the 
disapproved sourcing area in the past 24 months, pursuant to the Forest 
Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.), and I am accepting the area that the Secretary would have 
approved as my sourcing area. I certify that the information in this 
certificate is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge 
and belief.''

    (ii) Each certification statement set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this section must have been signed by the person making such 
certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive 
Officer; must have been on company letterhead; must have been notarized; 
and must have had a corporate seal attached.
    (iii) The person signing such certification set forth in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i)(A) of this section must have provided to the Regional Forester 
the annual volume of timber exported by that person during the five (5) 
full fiscal years immediately preceding submission of the application, 
originating from private lands in the geographic area for which the 
application would have been approved.
    (iv) When the applicant submitted the certificate, the area the 
Secretary would have approved, as shown on the sourcing area map 
provided by the Secretary, became an approved sourcing area. If the 
certificate was not submitted, the sourcing area that would have been 
approved did not become an approved sourcing area.
    (3) The phase-out of Federal timber purchasing and the phase-out of 
private timber exporting procedures provided by paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section do not apply to persons submitting sourcing area 
applications after December 20, 1990, or to persons requesting review of 
disapproved sourcing areas.
    (b) Limits on purchases and exports. (1) During the 15-month period 
following disapproval of a sourcing area, a person who elects to phase-
out of private timber exporting as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, may not:
    (i) Purchase more than 125 percent of the person's annual average 
purchases of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within 
the person's disapproved sourcing area during the five (5) full fiscal 
years immediately prior to submission of the application; and,
    (ii) Export unprocessed timber originating from private lands in the 
geographic area determined by the approving official for which the 
application would have been approved, in amounts that exceed 125 percent 
of the annual average of that person's exports of unprocessed timber 
from such private land during the five (5) full years immediately prior 
to submission of the application.
    (2) At the conclusion of the 15-month export phase-out period, the 
prohibition against exporting private timber originating from within the 
area shall be in full force and effect as long as the sourcing area 
remains approved, pursuant to this subpart F of this part 223.
    (c) Presentation of map to applicant whose sourcing area is 
disapproved. The area determined by the deciding official that would 
have been approved shall be drawn on a map and presented to the 
applicant by the deciding official with the notice of disapproval of the 
application.
    (d) Effect of prior certification to cease exporting. An applicant's 
previous certification to cease exporting beginning February 20, 1991, 
for a period of three (3) years from within the disapproved sourcing 
area pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) in Sec. 223.189 of this subpart 
shall remain in full force and effect for persons with approved and 
disapproved sourcing areas.
    (e) Review process and frequency. (1) Approved sourcing areas shall 
be reviewed not less often than every five (5) years. A tentative date 
for a review shall be included in the Administrative Law Judge's, or, on 
appeal, the Judicial Officer's determination or stated in writing by the 
Regional Forester following the determination. At least 60 days prior to 
the tentative review date, the Regional Forester or other such reviewing 
official shall notify the person holding the sourcing area of the 
pending review, publish notice of such review in newspapers of general 
circulation within the sourcing area, and invite comments, to be 
received no later than 30 days from the date of the notice, from all 
interested persons, including the person holding the sourcing area. For 
10 working days following the comment period, any person submitting a 
written comment and the person with the sourcing area may review the 
comments. If there is disagreement among the persons who submitted 
written comments regarding the proper sourcing area, the reviewing 
official

[[Page 131]]

shall convene an informal meeting convenient to the persons that all 
interested persons may attend. If an agreement cannot be reached among 
the persons, formal administrative adjudication shall occur. The 
Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall, on 
the record and after opportunity for a hearing, approve or disapprove 
the sourcing area being reviewed, pursuant to the Rules of Practice 
Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal 
Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation 
and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR 
part 1, subpart M.
    (2) Disapproved sourcing areas shall be reviewed using the process 
described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon resubmission of an 
application, provided the applicant has accepted the area the Secretary 
would have approved as a sourcing area pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (3) The Department reserves the right to schedule a review, at the 
request of the Forest Service or the person holding the sourcing area, 
at any time prior to the scheduled tentative review date, with 60 days 
notice.
    (4) Sourcing areas being reviewed shall continue in full force and 
effect pending the final review determination.
    (f) Reporting and record keeping procedures. The reporting and 
record keeping procedures in this section constitute information 
collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. These 
requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
and assigned clearance number 0596-0115.

Sec. 223.192  Procedures for a non-manufacturer.

    (a) Persons who do not own or operate a manufacturing facility (non-
manufacturer) are not eligible to apply for or be granted a sourcing 
area.
    (b) The prohibition against the purchase of Federal timber for a 
person who has exported unprocessed timber originating from private 
lands within the preceding 24-month period shall not apply, if the 
person certified in writing to the Regional Forester of the region(s) in 
which the person purchases National Forest System timber by November 20, 
1990, that the person would cease exporting unprocessed timber 
originating from private lands by February 20, 1991, for a period of 
three (3) years, and the exporting did cease in accordance with such 
certification.
    (c) To obtain an exemption from the prohibition against export 
within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber 
described in Sec. 223.189 (a) and (b) of this subpart, a person must 
have applied in writing to the applicable Regional Forester on or before 
November 20, 1990. The application was required to be on company 
letterhead and, in the case of a corporation, with its corporate seal 
affixed, and must have included:
    (1) An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving 
acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and 
Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the certification, for a 
period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such 
records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional 
Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.
    (2) A signed certification which reads as follows:

    ``I have engaged in the exporting of unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 
48 States during the preceding 24 months. I desire to purchase directly 
from a department or agency of the United States, unprocessed timber 
originating from Federal lands located in such area of the United 
States. I make this certification for the exemption from the prohibition 
against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing 
Federal timber required by the Forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 
U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all 
exporting of such unprocessed private timber from west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States of the United States by February 
20, 1991. I make this certification with full knowledge and 
understanding of the requirements of this Act and do fully understand 
that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of 
this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), 
and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such 
violation.''

U.S.C. 1001); and
    (ix) Certify that the form has been read and understood.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided by law, a person who transfers 
unprocessed private timber to another person and meets all notice, 
certification, acknowledgement, distribution, reporting and record 
keeping requirements contained in this section shall be relieved from 
further liability for such timber with regard to the export and 
substitution restrictions pursuant to the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 223.195  Procedures for identifying and marking unprocessed timber.

    (a) Highway yellow paint. The use of highway yellow paint on 
unprocessed logs west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States 
shall be reserved for identifying logs requiring domestic manufacturing.
    (b) Preserving identification. All identifying marks placed on an 
unprocessed log to identify the National Forest System origin of that 
log and/or to identify the log as requiring domestic processing shall be 
retained on the log until the log is domestically processed. If the 
identifying marks are lost, removed, or become unreadable, they shall be 
replaced. If the log is cut into two or more segments, each segment 
shall be identified in the same manner as the original log.
    (1) A generic log hammer brand, known as a ``catch brand'', used to 
identify ownership, may be used to replace lost, removed, unreadable or 
otherwise missing brands where such use is authorized by the Regional 
Forester and approved by the Contracting Officer. Use of such a catch 
brand on a log or log segment will signify Federal origin.
    (2) The requirement to preserve identification of log pieces shall 
not apply to logs cut into two or more segments as a part of the mill 
in-feed process immediately before processing. Log segments that are 
returned to or placed in storage must be marked on both ends with yellow 
paint.
    (c) National Forest System logs. Except as otherwise provided in 
this subsection, all unprocessed logs originating from National Forest 
System timber sales west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 
States shall, before being removed from the timber sale area, be marked 
on each end as follows:
    (1) Painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less 
than three square inches in size; and,
    (2) Branded on each end with a hammer brand approved for use by the 
Forest Supervisor of the National Forest from which the logs originate. 
The brand pattern may not be used to mark logs from any other source for 
a period of 24 months after all logs have been removed from the sale 
area and until such brand pattern is released in writing by the Forest 
Supervisor.
    (d) Private logs. All unprocessed logs originating from private 
lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States that 
require domestic manufacturing pursuant to Sec. 223.194 of this subpart, 
shall be painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not 
less than three (3) square inches in size before removal from the 
harvest area. If private logs are acquired by a person who may not 
export such logs, the logs must be marked by the person acquiring the 
logs at the time of the acquisition.
    (e) Waiver of painting requirements. The log painting requirements 
pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section may be waived if 
the Chief of the Forest Service determines that alternate methods for 
identifying logs required to be domestically processed are equal to or 
better than the procedures required herein.
    (f) Waiver of branding requirements. Regional Foresters may waive 
the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
as follows:
    (1) Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4. On an individual timber sale basis, all 
or a portion of the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section may be waived, if:
    (i) Unprocessed logs from any origin are not known to have been 
exported

[[Page 136]]

by any person from the person's area of operations within the previous 
5; years.
    (ii) The person certifies as follows:

    ``I hereby request waiver of the requirements to brand each end of 
individual logs originating from the -------- timber sale, Forest 
Service contract number -------- pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195. I certify 
that I have not exported or sold for export unprocessed timber from 
private lands within my area of operations in five years. I certify that 
I understand, that if granted, the waiver applies only to unprocessed 
logs being processed within my area of operations. I certify that any 
unprocessed logs to which this waiver applies that are transferred, or 
sold for transfer, outside my area of operations will be branded on both 
ends in full compliance with 36 CFR 223.195. I make this certification 
with full knowledge and understanding of the requirement of the Forest 
Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 223. I 
fully understand that failure to abide by the terms of the waiver will 
be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies provided for such violation.'' ;


and,

    (iii) The person otherwise complies with the regulations relating to 
transfers of logs between persons.
    (iv) If the Regional Forester determines that unprocessed logs from 
my origin are being exported, or are known to have been exported within 
the previous 5 years, by any person from the person's area of 
operations, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
    (2) Regions 5 and 6. On an individual timber sale basis, the 
branding requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be 
waived for logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the 
large end may be waived if:
    (i) One end of each log is branded;
    (ii) The person certifies as follows:

    ``I hereby request waiver of the requirement to brand each end of 
individual logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the 
large end, originating from the -------- timber sale, U.S. contract 
number -------- pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195. I certify that I understand, 
if granted, that the waiver applies only to unprocessed logs being 
processed at --------, and further certify that any and all unprocessed 
logs to which waiver would apply that are transferred, or sold for 
transfer, will be branded on both ends in full compliance 36 CFR 
223.195. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding 
of the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage 
Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990; 16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 223. I 
fully understand that failure to abide by the terms of the waiver will 
be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies provided for such violation.'';


and,

    (iii) The purchaser otherwise complies with the regulations relating 
to transfers of logs between persons.
    (iv) If the Regional Forester determines that logs ten (10) inches 
or less in diameter inside bark on the large end are being exported in 
the Region, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
    (3) The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the testing of 
alternative methods of branding for consideration in future amendment of 
these regulations. Such alternative methods and logs marked under those 
methods shall be closely monitored.


<R05>
Sec. 223.196  Civil penalties for violation

    (a) Exporting Federal timber. If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, 
on the record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a 
person, with willful disregard for the prohibition in the Act exporting 
unprocessed Federal timber, exported or caused to be exported 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in violation of the 
Act, the Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty of not 
more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3 times the gross value of the 
unprocessed timber involved in the violation, whichever amount is 
greater.
    (b) Other violations. If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, on the 
record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a person 
has violated any provision of the Act, or any regulation issued under 
the Act relating to National Forest System lands, even though that the 
violation may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber 
in violation of such Act, the Secretary may:
    (1) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than 
$500,000, if the

[[Page 137]]

Secretary determines that the person committed such violation willfully;
    (2) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than 
$75,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person 
committeed such violation in disregard of such provision or regulation; 
or
    (3) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than 
$50,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person 
should have known that the action constituted a violation.
    (c) Penalties not exclusive and judicial review. A penalty assessed 
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall not be exclusive of any 
other penalty provided by law, and shall be subject to review in an 
appropriate United States district court.


<R05>
Sec. 223.197  Civil penalty assessment procedures.

    Adjudicatory procedures for hearing alleged violations of this Act 
and its implementing regulations and assessing penalties shall be 
conducted under the rules of practice governing formal adjudicatory 
proceedings instituted by the Secretary. Such procedures are found at 7 
CFR 1.130, et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 223.198  Administrative remedies.

    In addition to possible debarment action provided under subpart C of 
this part, the Chief of the Forest Service, or other official to whom 
such authority is delegated, may cancel any timber sale contract entered 
into with a person found to have violated the Act or regulations issued 
under the Act. Such a finding shall constitute a serious violation of 
contract terms pursuant to Sec. 223.116(a)(1) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 223.199  Procedures for cooperating with other agencies.

    The Regional Foresters may enter into agreements to cooperate with 
the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defense, and other 
Federal, State and local agencies for monitoring, surveillance and 
enforcing the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 223.200  Determinations of surplus species.

    (a) Determinations that specific quantities of grades and species 
are surplus to domestic manufacturing needs and withdrawals of such 
determinations shall be made in accordance with title 5, United States 
Code, section 553.
    (b) Review of a determination shall be made at least once in every 
3-year period. Notice of such review shall be published in the Federal 
Register. The public shall have no less than 30 days to submit comments 
on the review.
    (c) Alaska yellow cedar and Port Orford cedar, which the Secretary 
of Agriculture found to be surplus to domestic processing needs pursuant

continue in that status until new determinations are published.


<R05>
Sec. 223.201  Limitations on unprocessed timber harvested in Alaska.

    Unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands in Alaska may 
not be exported from the United States or shipped to other States 
without prior approval of the Regional Forester. This requirement is 
necessary to ensure the development and continued existence of adequate 
wood processing capacity in Alaska for the sustained utilization of 
timber from the National Forests which are geographically isolated from 
other processing facilities. In determining whether consent will be 
given for the export of timber, consideration will be given to, among 
other things, whether such export will:
    (a) Permit more complete utilization on areas being logged primarily 
for local manufacture,
    (b) Prevent loss or serious deterioration of logs unsalable locally 
because of an unforeseen loss of market,
    (c) Permit the salvage of timber damaged by wind, insects, fire or 
other catastrophe,
    (d) Bring into use a minor species of little importance to local 
industrial development, or

[[Page 138]]

    (e) Provide material required to meet urgent and unusual needs of 
the Nation. (16 U.S.C. 472a; 16 U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 616)


<R05>
Sec. 223.202  Information requirements.

    (a) The procedures in Sec. Sec. 223.189 and 223.192, and some of the 
procedures in Sec. 223.190 were approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) and assigned Control Number 0596-0114 upon issuance of the 
interim rule. Control Number 0596-0114 has been reapproved by OMB for 
use through May 31, 1997. OMB approved the information collection 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 223.191 and 223.203 for use through August 31, 
1995, and assigned them Control Number 0596-0115. OMB approved the 
information collection requirements in Sec. Sec. 223.48 and 223.87 for 
use through March 31, 1997 and assigned them Control Number 0596-0021; 
the information collection requirements in Sec. Sec. 223.48 and 223.87 
have been revised. OMB Control Numbers 0596-0114, 0596-0115, and 0596-
0021 have been consolidated under OMB Control Number 0596-0114.
    (b) The application and reporting procedures in Sec. Sec. 223.187, 
223.193, 223.194, 223.195, and some of the procedures in Sec. 223.190 of 
this final rule contain new record keeping and reporting requirements as 
defined in 5 CFR part 1320 and, therefore, impose additional paperwork 
burdens on the affected public. The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has approved these requirements, and assigned them Control Number 
0596-0114.

1992. Applicants were notified of the approving official's decision by 
letter. If approved, the amount of the exception becomes effective upon 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (5) Prospective applicants could review Department records upon 
request prior to the deadline for submitting applications. An applicant 
could voluntarily submit information documenting the amount of purchases 
of unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands 
within Washington State. The Department then determined which amount is 
higher, verified by either the Department's records or the applicant's 
records. The Department then determined the applicant's portion of the 
50 million board feet by determining the lesser of the amount verified 
by the records or 15 million board feet. Applicants could submit the 
information documenting the amount of purchases in the following manner:
    (i) Actual receipts for purchasing unprocessed timber from National 
Forest System lands within Washington State; or
    (ii) A statement by a certified public accountant of:
    (A) A summary by fiscal year for 1988, 1989 and 1990 of the 
applicant's acquisitions of timber originating from National Forest 
System lands in the State of Washington, listing total volume for each 
of the three fiscal years; and
    (B) The average volume for the three fiscal years. The volumes to be 
reported were the harvest volumes, except in the case of open sales. 
Advertised volumes had to be reported for open sales.
    (C) The certified public accountant must have certified to the 
following:

    ``I certify that under the penalties and remedies provided in 
Sec. 492 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the penalty of perjury provided 
in the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information 
provided in support of this application is, to the best of my knowledge 
and belief, a true, accurate, current, and complete statement of 
[applicant's company's name] National Forest System timber acquisitions 
originating from within the State of Washington for fiscal years 1988, 
1989 and/or 1990.''

    (D) The certified public accountant's statement and certification 
must have been on the accountant's company letterhead, must have been 
notarized, and must have accompanied the applicant's application.
    (c) Selling and trading rights. The purchase limit right obtained 
under this rule may be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged with any 
other person subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Such rights may not be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged to 
persons already in possession of such rights:
    (2) Any person selling, trading, or exchanging any or all of the 
rights obtained under this rule shall advise the Regional Forester of 
the amount being traded and the name(s) of the person(s) acquiring such 
rights within 15 days of the transaction; and
    (3) No person may have or acquire more than 15 million board feet in 
one fiscal year.
    (d) Information collection. The application procedures in this 
section constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 
CFR part 1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0114.
    (e) Persons with approved shares. The application period for shares 
of the indirect substitution exception for acquiring unprocessed timber 
originating from National Forest Systems lands within the State of 
Washington closed on January 8, 1992. Persons with approved shares are 
responsible for monitoring and controlling their acquisitions of 
National Forest System timber originating from within the State of 
Washington to assure approved share amounts are not exceeded in any 
Federal fiscal year. Unused portions of annual shares may not be 
``banked'' for use in future fiscal years. The acquisition of such 
National Forest System timber must be reported to the Forest Service in 
accordance with Sec. 223.193 of this subpart. The following shares are 
approved as of September 8, 1995:

<R04>
                      Subpart A--Locatable Minerals


<R05>
Sec. 228.1  Purpose.

    It is the purpose of these regulations to set forth rules and 
procedures through which use of the surface of National Forest System 
lands in connection with operations authorized by the United States 
mining laws (30 U.S.C. 21-54), which confer a statutory right to enter 
upon the public lands to search for minerals, shall be conducted so as 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest System 
surface resources. It is not the purpose of these regulations to provide 
for the management of mineral resources; the responsibility for managing 
such resources is in the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 228.2  Scope.

    These regulations apply to operations hereafter conducted under the 
United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et 
seq.), as they affect surface resources on all National Forest System 
lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture to which 
such laws are applicable: Provided, however, That any area of National 
Forest lands covered by a special Act of Congress (16 U.S.C. 482a-482q) 
is subject to the provisions of this part and the provisions of the 
special act, and in the case of conflict the provisions of the special 
act shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 228.3  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part the following terms, respectively, 
shall mean:
    (a) Operations. All functions, work, and activities in connection 
with prospecting, exploration, development, mining or processing of 
mineral resources and all uses reasonably incident thereto, including 
roads and other means of access on lands subject to the regulations in 
this part, regardless of whether said operations take place on or off 
mining claims.
    (b) Operator. A person conducting or proposing to conduct 
operations.
    (c) Person. Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, 
or other legal entity.
    (d) Mining claim. Any unpatented mining claim or unpatented millsite 
authorized by the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended 
(30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.).
    (e) Authorized officer. The Forest Service officer to whom authority 
to review and approve operating plans has been delegated.


<R05>
Sec. 228.4  Plan of operations--notice of intent--requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a notice 
of intention to operate is required from any person proposing to conduct 
operations which might cause disturbance of surface resources. Such 
notice of intention shall be submitted to the District Ranger having 
jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted. If 
the District Ranger determines that such operations will likely cause 
significant disturbance of surface resources, the operator shall submit 
a proposed plan of operations to the District Ranger.
    (1) The requirements to submit a plan of operations shall not apply:
    (i) To operations which will be limited to the use of vehicles on 
existing public roads or roads used and maintained for National Forest 
purposes,
    (ii) To individuals desiring to search for and occasionally remove 
small mineral samples or specimens,
    (iii) To prospecting and sampling which will not cause significant 
surface resource disturbance and will not involve removal of more than a 
reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study,
    (iv) tT marking and monumenting a mining claim and
    (v) To subsurface operations which will not cause significant 
surface resource disturbance.
    (2) A notice of intent need not be filed:
    (i) Where a plan of operations is submitted for approval in lieu 
thereof,
    (ii) For operations excepted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
from the requirement to file a plan of operations,
    (iii) For operations which will not involve the use of mechanized 
earthmoving equipment such as bulldozers or backhoes and will not 
involve

[[Page 142]]

the cutting of trees. Each notice of intent to operate shall provide 
information sufficient to identify the area involved, the nature of the 
proposed operations, the route of access to the area of operations and 
the method of transport. If a notice of intent is filed, the District 
Ranger will, within 15 days of receipt thereof, notify the operator 
whether a plan of operations is required.
    (b) Any person conducting operations on the effective date of these 
regulations, who would have been required to submit a plan of operations 
under Sec. 228.4(a), may continue operations but shall within 120 days 
thereafter submit a plan of operations to the District Ranger having 
jurisdiction over the area within which operations are being conducted: 
Provided, however, That upon a showing of good cause the authorized 
officer will grant an extension of time for submission of a plan of 
operations, not to exceed an additional 6 months. Operations may 
continue according to the submitted plan during its review, unless the 
authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing irreparable damage to surface resources and advises 
the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. Upon 
approval of a plan of operations, operations shall be conducted in 
accordance with the approved plan. The requirement to submit a plan of 
operations shall not apply: (1) To operations excepted in Sec. 228.4(a) 
or (2) to operations concluded prior to the effective date of the 
regulations in this part.
    (c) The plan of operations shall include:
    (1) The name and legal mailing address of the operators (and 
claimants if they are not the operators) and their lessees, assigns, or 
designees.
    (2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the 
proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed 
roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations as 
set forth in Sec. 228.12 and the approximate location and size of areas 
where surface resources will be disturbed.
    (3) Information sufficient to describe or identify the type of 
operations proposed and how they would be conducted, the type and 
standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of 
transportation used or to be used as set forth in Sec. 228.12, the 
period during which the proposed activity will take place, and measures 
to be taken to meet the requirements for environmental protection in 
Sec. 228.8.
    (d) The plan of operations shall cover the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section, as foreseen for the entire operation for 
the full estimated period of activity: Provided, however, That if the 
development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible at the 
time of preparation of a plan, the operator shall file an initial plan 
setting forth his proposed operation to the degree reasonably 
foreseeable at that time, and shall thereafter file a supplemental plan 
or plans whenever it is proposed to undertake any significant surface 
disturbance not covered by the initial plan.
    (e) At any time during operations under an approved plan of 
operations, the authorized officer may ask the operator to furnish a 
proposed modification of the plan detailing the means of minimizing 
unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources. If the operator 
does not furnish a proposed modification within a time deemed reasonable 
by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to his 
immediate superior that the operator be required to submit a proposed 
modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer 
shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the 
supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon 
such recommendation, the immediate superior of the authorized officer 
shall determine:
    (1) Whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized 
officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations 
prior to approving the operating plan,
    (2) Whether the disturbance is or probably will become of such 
significance as to require modification of the operating plan in order 
to meet the requirements for environmental protection specified in 
Sec. 228.8 and

[[Page 143]]

    (3) Whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. 
Lacking such determination that unforeseen significant disturbance of 
surface resources is occurring or probable and that the disturbance can 
be minimized using reasonable means, no operator shall be required to 
submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. 
Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan until a 
modified plan is approved, unless the immediate superior of the 
authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing irreparable injury, loss or damage to surface 
resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid 
such damage.
    (f) Upon completion of an environmental analysis in connection with 
each proposed operating plan, the authorized officer will determine 
whether an environmental statement is required. Not every plan of 
operations, supplemental plan or modification will involve the 
preparation of an environmental statement. Environmental impacts will 
vary substantially depending on whether the nature of operations is 
prospecting, exploration, development, or processing, and on the scope 
of operations (such as size of operations, construction required, length 
of operations and equipment required), resulting in varying degrees of 
disturbance to vegetative resources, soil, water, air, or wildlife. The 
Forest Service will prepare any environmental statements that may be 
required.
    (g) The information required to be included in a notice of intent or 
a plan of operations, or supplement or modification thereto, has been 
assigned Office of Management and Budget Control <greek-i>0596-0022. The 
public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated 
to vary from a few minutes for an activity involving little or no 
surface disturbance to several months for activities involving heavy 
capital investments and significant surface disturbance, with an average 
of 2 hours per individual response. This includes time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other 
aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for 
reducing this burden, to Chief (2800), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 
96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090 and to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 
20503.

and amended at 54 FR 6893, Feb. 15, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 228.5  Plan of operations--approval.

    (a) Operations shall be conducted in accordance with an approved 
plan of operations, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section 
and in Sec. 228.4 (a), (b), and (e). A proposed plan of operation shall 
be submitted to the District Ranger, who shall promptly acknowledge 
receipt thereof to the operator. The authorized officer shall, within 
thirty (30) days of such receipt, analyze the proposal, considering the 
economics of the operation along with the other factors in determining 
the reasonableness of the requirements for surface resource protection, 
and;
    (1) Notify the operator that he has approved the plan of operations; 
or
    (2) Notify the operator that the proposed operations are such as not 
to require an operating plan; or
    (3) Notify the operator of any changes in, or additions to, the plan 
of operations deemed necessary to meet the purpose of the regulations in 
this part; or
    (4) Notify the operator that the plan is being reviewed, but that 
more time, not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days, is necessary to 
complete such review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is 
needed: Provided, however, That days during which the area of operations 
is inaccessible for inspection shall not be included when computing the 
sixty (60) day period; or
    (5) Notify the operator that the plan cannot be approved until a 
final environmental statement has been prepared and filed with the 
Council on Environmental Quality as provided in Sec. 228.4(f).
    (b) Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized 
officer will approve such operations as may be necessary for timely 
compliance with

[[Page 144]]

the requirements of Federal and State laws, so long as such operations 
are conducted so as to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by 
the authorized officer in accordance with the standards contained in 
Sec. 228.8.
    (c) A supplemental plan or plans of operations provided for in 
Sec. 228.4(d) and a modification of an approved operating plan as 
provided for in Sec. 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the 
authorized officer in the same manner as the initial plan of operations: 
Provided, however, That a modification of an approved plan of operations 
under Sec. 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the immediate 
superior of the authorized officer in cases where it has been determined 
that a modification is required.
    (d) In the provisions for review of operating plans, the Forest 
Service will arrange for consultation with appropriate agencies of the 
Department of the Interior with respect to significant technical 
questions concerning the character of unique geologic conditions and 
special exploration and development systems, techniques, and equipment, 
and with respect to mineral values, mineral resources, and mineral 
reserves. Further, the operator may request the Forest Service to 
arrange for similar consultations with appropriate agencies of the U.S. 
Department of the Interior for a review of operating plans.


<R05>
Sec. 228.6  Availability of information to the public.

    Except as provided herein, all information and data submitted by an 
operator pursuant to the regulations in this part shall be available for 
examination by the public at the Office of the District Ranger in 
accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR 1.1-1.6 and 36 CFR 200.5-200.10. 
Specifically identified information and data submitted by the operator 
as confidential concerning trade secrets or privileged commercial or 
financial information will not be available for public examination. 
Information and data to be withheld from public examination may include, 
but is not limited to, known or estimated outline of the mineral 
deposits and their location, attitude, extent, outcrops, and content, 
and the known or planned location of exploration pits, drill holes, 
excavations pertaining to location and entry pursuant to the United 
States mining laws, and other commercial information which relates to 
competitive rights of the operator.


<R05>
Sec. 228.7  Inspection, noncompliance.

    (a) Forest Officers shall periodically inspect operations to 
determine if the operator is complying with the regulations in this part 
and an approved plan of operations.
    (b) If an operator fails to comply with the regulations or his 
approved plan of operations and the noncompliance is unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing injury, loss or damage to surface resources the 
authorized officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the 
operator or his agent in person or by certified mail. Such notice shall 
describe the noncompliance and shall specify the action to comply and 
the time within which such action is to be completed, generally not to 
exceed thirty (30) days: Provided, however, That days during which the 
area of operations is inaccessible shall not be included when computing 
the number of days allowed for compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 228.8  Requirements for environmental protection.

    All operations shall be conducted so as, where feasible, to minimize

laws and regulations and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent 
and suppress fires on the area of operations and shall require his 
employees, contractors and subcontractors to do likewise.


<R05>
Sec. 228.12  Access.

    An operator is entitled to access in connection with operations, but 
no

[[Page 146]]

road, trail, bridge, landing area for aircraft, or the like, shall be 
constructed or improved, nor shall any other means of access, including 
but not limited to off-road vehicles, be used until the operator has 
received approval of an operating plan in writing from the authorized

Sec. 228.15  Operations within National Forest Wilderness.

    (a) The United States mining laws shall extend to each National 
Forest Wilderness for the period specified in the Wilderness Act and 
subsequent establishing legislation to the same extent they were 
applicable prior to the date the Wilderness was designated by Congress 
as a part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Subject to 
valid existing rights, no person shall have any right or interest in or 
to any mineral deposits which may be discovered through prospecting or 
other information-gathering activity after the legal date on which the 
United States mining laws cease to apply to the specific Wilderness.
    (b) Holders of unpatented mining claims validly established on any 
National Forest Wilderness prior to inclusion of such unit in the 
National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights 
provided by the United States mining laws as then applicable to the 
National Forest land involved. Persons locating mining claims in any 
National Forest Wilderness on or after the date on which said Wilderness 
was included in the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be 
accorded the rights provided by the

[[Page 147]]

United States mining laws as applicable to the National Forest land 
involved and subject to provisions specified in the establishing 
legislation. Persons conducting operations as defined in Sec. 228.3 in 
National Forest Wilderness shall comply with the regulations in this 
part. Operations shall be conducted so as to protect National Forest 
surface resources in accordance with the general purposes of maintaining 
the National Wilderness Preservation System unimpaired for future use 
and enjoyment as wilderness and to preserve its wilderness character, 
consistent with the use of the land for mineral location, exploration, 
development, drilling, and production and for transmission lines, water 
lines, telephone lines, and processing operations, including, where 
essential, the use of mechanized transport, aircraft or motorized 
equipment.
    (c) Persons with valid mining claims wholly within National Forest 
Wilderness shall be permitted access to such surrounded claims by means 
consistent with the preservation of National Forest Wilderness which 
have been or are being customarily used with respect to other such 
claims surrounded by National Forest Wilderness. No operator shall 
construct roads across National Forest Wilderness unless authorized in 
writing by the Forest Supervisor in accordance with Sec. 228.12.
    (d) On all mining claims validly established on lands within the 
National Wilderness Preservation System, the operator shall take all 
reasonable measures to remove any structures, equipment and other 
facilities no longer needed for mining purposes in accordance with the 
provisions in Sec. 228.10 and restore the surface in accordance with the 
requirements in Sec. 228.8(g).
    (e) The title to timber on patented claims validly established after 
the land was included within the National Wilderness Preservation System 
remains in the United States, subject to a right to cut and use timber 
for mining purposes. So much of the mature timber may be cut and used as 
is needed in the extraction, removal, and beneficiation of the mineral 
deposits, if needed timber is not otherwise reasonably available. The 
cutting shall comply with the requirements for sound principles of 
forest management as defined by the National Forest rules and 
regulations and set forth in stipulations to be included in the plan of 
operations, which as a minimum incorporate the following basic 
principles of forest management:
    (1) Harvesting operations shall be so conducted as to minimize soil 
movement and damage from water runoff; and
    (2) Slash shall be disposed of and other precautions shall be taken 
to minimize damage from forest insects, disease, and fire.
    (f) The Chief, Forest Service, shall allow any activity, including 
prospecting, for the purpose of gathering information about minerals in 
National Forest Wilderness except that any such activity for gathering 
information shall be carried on in a manner compatible with the 
preservation of the wilderness environment as specified in the plan of

<R05>
Sec. 228.41  Scope.

    (a) Lands to which this subpart applies. This subpart applies to all 
National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain of the 
United States, including public domain lands being administered under 
the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010); to 
all National Forest System lands acquired pursuant to the Weeks Act of 
March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961); to all National Forest System lands with 
Weeks Act status as provided in the Act of September 2, 1958 (16 U.S.C. 
521a); and to public lands within the Copper River addition to the 
Chugach National Forest (16 U.S.C. 539a). For ease of reference and 
convenience to the reader, these lands are referred to, throughout this 
subpart, as National Forest lands.
    (b) Restrictions. Disposal of mineral materials from the following 
National Forest lands is subject to certain restrictions as described 
below:
    (1) Segregation or withdrawals in aid of other agencies. Disposal of 
mineral materials from lands segregated or withdrawn in aid of a 
function of another Federal agency, State, territory, county, 
municipality, water district, or other governmental subdivision or 
agency may be made only with the written consent of the governmental 
entity.
    (2) Segregated or withdrawn National Forest lands. Mineral materials 
may not be removed from segregated or withdrawn lands where removal is 
specifically prohibited by statute or by public land order. Where not 
specifically prohibited, removal of mineral materials may be allowed if 
the authorized officer determines that the removal is not detrimental to 
the values for which the segregation or withdrawal was made, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Where operations have been 
established prior to the effective date of this Subpart and where not 
prohibited by statute, they may be permitted to continue. Nothing in 
this subparagraph is intended to prohibit the exercise of valid existing 
rights.
    (3) Unpatented mining claims. Provided that claimants are given 
prior notice and it has been determined that removal will neither 
endanger nor materially interfere with prospecting, mining, or 
processing operations or uses reasonably incident thereto on the claims, 
disposal of mineral materials may be allowed from:
    (i) Unpatented mining claims located after July 23, 1955; and/or
    (ii) Unpatented mining claims located before July 23, 1955, and on 
which the United States has established the right to manage the 
vegetative and other surface resources in accordance with the Multiple 
Use Mining Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 601, 603, 611-615).
    (4) Acquired Bankhead-Jones lands. Mineral materials on lands which 
were acquired under the authority of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act 
of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010-1012), and which lie outside the 
exterior boundaries of National Forests, or on acquired lands which are 
being administered under the Act and which also lie outside the exterior 
boundaries of National Forests, may be disposed of under these 
regulations only to public authorities and agencies, and only on 
condition that the mineral materials are used for public purposes (7 
U.S.C. 1011(c)).
    (c) Mineral materials to which this subpart applies. This subpart 
applies to mineral materials which consist of petrified wood and common 
varieties of sand, gravel, stone, pumice, pumicite, cinders, clay, and 
other similar materials. Such mineral materials include deposits which, 
although they have economic value, are used for agriculture, animal 
husbandry, building, abrasion, construction, landscaping, and similar 
uses. This subpart also applies to other materials which may not be 
minerals but are produced using mining methods, such as peat. The 
categories of these materials, including representative examples, are:
    (1) Agricultural supply and animal husbandry materials. This 
category includes, but is not limited to, minerals and vegetative 
materials used as or for: Soil conditioners or amendments applied to 
physically alter soil properties

[[Page 149]]

such as direct applications to the soil of carbonate rocks, soil 
containing ``trace elements'' and peat; animal feed supplements; and 
other animal care products.
    (2) Building materials. Except for minerals identified as Uncommon 
Varieties, this category includes, but is not limited to, minerals used 
as or for: Paint fillers or extenders; flagstone, ashlar, rubble, 
mortar, brick, tile, pipe, pottery, earthenware, stoneware, terrazzo, 
and other nonstructural components in floors, walls, roofs, fireplaces, 
and the like; and similar building uses.
    (3) Abrasive materials. This category includes, but is not limited 
to, minerals used for: Filing; scouring; polishing; sanding; and 
sandblasting.
    (4) Construction materials. This category includes, but is not 
limited to, minerals such as sand, gravel, clay, crushed rock and 
cinders used as or for fill; borrow; rip-rap; ballast (including all 
ballast for railroad use); road base; road surfacing; concrete 
aggregate; clay sealants; and similar construction uses.
    (5) Landscaping materials: This category includes, but is not 
limited to minerals and peat used as or for: Chips, granules, sand, 
pebbles, scoria, cinders, cobbles, boulders, slabs, and other components 
in retaining walls, walkways, patios, yards, gardens, and the like; and 
similar landscaping uses.
    (d) Minerals not covered by this subpart. Mineral materials do not 
include any mineral used in manufacturing, industrial processing, or 
chemical operations for which no other mineral can be substituted due to 
unique properties giving the particular mineral a distinct and special 
value; nor do they include block pumice which in nature occurs in pieces 
having one dimension of two inches or more which is valuable and used 
for some application that requires such dimensions. Disposal of minerals 
not covered by this subpart is subject to the terms of the United States 
Mining Laws, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), on those portions of the 
National Forest System where those laws apply. Such minerals may 
include:
    (1) Mineral suitable and used as soil amendment because of a 
constituent element other than calcium or magnesium carbonate that 
chemically alters the soil;
    (2) Limestone suitable and used, without substantial admixtures, for 
cement manufacture, metallurgy, production of quicklime, sugar refining, 
whiting, fillers, paper manufacture, and desulfurization of stack gases;
    (3) Silica suitable and used for glass manufacture, production of 
metallic silicon, flux, and rock wool;
    (4) Alumino-silicates or clays having exceptional qualities suitable 
and used for production of aluminum, ceramics, drilling mud, taconite 
binder, foundry castings, and other purposes for which common clays 
cannot be used;
    (5) Gypsum suitable and used for wallboard, plaster, or cement.
    (6) Block pumice which occurs in nature in pieces having one 
dimension of two inches or more and which is valuable and used for some 
application that requires such dimensions; and
    (7) Stone recognized through marketing factors for its special and 
distinct properties of strength and durability making it suitable for 
structural support and used for that purpose.
    (e) Limitations on applicability. (1) The provisions of paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to any mining claims for 
which a Mineral Entry Final Certificate was issued on or before January 
16, 1991. Nor shall these provisions apply to any mining claim located 
on or before July 23, 1955, which has satisfied the marketability test 
for locatable minerals from on or before July 23, 1955, until the 
present date.
    (2) A use which qualifies a mineral as an uncommon variety under 
paragraph (d) overrides classification of that mineral as a common 
variety under paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 228.48  Appraisal and measurement.

    (a) Appraisal. All mineral materials for sale must be appraised to 
determine fair market value. Appraisals must be

[[Page 152]]

based on knowledge of the extent of the deposit, quality of material, 
and economic value. A sale must not be made at less than the appraised 
value which may be expressed as either price per cubic yard or weight 
equivalent. In all cases the units of measurement must correspond to the 
units used in the appraisal. The authorized officer must estimate and 
record the amount and value of minerals to be disposed of by free-use 
permit.
    (b) Measurement. The amount of mineral material actually removed may 
be measured by volume, weight, truck tally, by combination of these 
methods, or by such other form of measurement as the authorized officer 
determines to be appropriate and in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 228.49  Reappraisal.

    If an extension of time is granted as provided in Sec. 228.53(b), 
the authorized officer must reappraise or reestimate the mineral 
materials covered by the contract or permit and which remain unexcavated 
at the time of extension. The recalculated unit value becomes the new 
unit value for the remaining unexcavated material; excavated and 
stockpiled material is not subject to reappraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 228.50  Production records.

    At least annually, the purchaser or permittee must furnish a record 
of the volume extracted, in cubic yards or weight equivalent, to the 
authorized officer. The units of measurement must correspond to the 
units used in the appraisal or estimate.


<R05>
Sec. 228.51  Bonding.

    (a) Bond requirements. Before operations may begin under any 
contract or permit, a bond must be furnished to the authorized officer 
to ensure performance of payment (as necessary), reclamation, and other 
conditions of the contract or permit, except as noted in paragraphs (a) 
(1) and (3) of this section, where the authorized officer may waive such 
bonding. If an extension of time is granted as provided in 
Sec. 228.53(b), the bond requirements must be recalculated and changed 
accordingly.
    (1) For advance payment contracts for 10,000 cubic yards or more in 
volume (or weight equivalent), a bond of not less than 10 percent of the 
total contract price or the value of the estimated annual production 
(whichever is less), plus the reclamation cost for the area covered by 
annual mining, is required. When the total volume is less than 10,000 
cubic yards, bond requirements, if any, are at the discretion of the 
authorized officer.
    (2) For any defered payment contract, a bond equalling the value of 
the estimated annual production plus the reclamation cost for the area 
covered by annual mining is required.
    (3) For free use, the authorized officer may require a reclamation 
bond which must be sufficient to cover the cost of reclamation of the 
anticipated annual work.
    (b) Types of bonding. A bond must be one of the following:
    (1) A bond of a corporate surety shown on the latest approved list 
issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and executed on an approved 
standard form;
    (2) A cash bond;
    (3) Negotiable securities of the United States;
    (4) An irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the Forest 
Service;
    (5) A performance bond required by other Forest Service contracts or 
permits, provided the bond covers the performance and reclamation 
requirements related to the removal of mineral material from a 
designated pit or area for use in the performance of the contract or 
permit; or
    (6) Any other types of bond specified in the Forest Service Manual.


<R05>
Sec. 228.52  Assignments.

    (a) Limitations. A purchaser or permittee may not assign the 
contract or permit, or any interest therein, without the written 
approval of the authorized officer.
    (b) Requirements of assignee. The authorized officer will not 
approve any proposed assignment involving contract or permit performance 
unless the assignee:

[[Page 153]]

    (1) Submits information necessary to assure the authorized officer 
of the assignee's ability to meet the same requirements as the original 
purchaser or permittee (assignor); and
    (2) Furnishes a bond or obtains a commitment from the previous 
surety to be bound by the assignment when approved.
    (c) Rights and obligations. Once the authorized officer approves an 
assignment, the assignee is entitled to all the rights and is subject to 
all of the obligations under the contract or permit, and the original 
purchaser or permittee may be released from any further responsiblity 
under the contract or permit.


<R05>
Sec. 228.53  Term.

    (a) Time allowed. Except as provided in Sec. 228.61(f), 
Sec. 228.62(b), and elsewhere in this paragraph, a contract or permit 
may not exceed 1 year from the effective date of the contract or permit 
unless a written extension is obtained. For those mineral materials sold 
under a duration of production contract or under a contract for the sale 
of all mineral material within a specified area, or under a construction 
contract where removal cannot reasonably take place before completion of 
other work under the same contract, the authorized officer will 
establish a reasonable time period for removal.
    (b) Extension of time. If it is shown that a delay in removal was 
due to causes beyond the control of the purchaser or permittee, the 
authorized officer may grant an extension, not to exceed 1 year, upon 
written request. Written requests for extensions of contracts must be 
received between 30 and 90 days before the expiration date of the 
contract. Written requests for extensions of permits must be received 
between 15 and 90 days before the permit expiration date. The authorized 
officer may grant a total of two extensions for contracts and permits.


<R05>
Sec. 228.54  Single entry sales or permits.

    The purchaser or permittee is required to reclaim a single entry 
source in accordance with an approved operating plan which describes 
operating procedures and reclamation measures, unless the requirement is 
waived by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 228.55  Cancellation or suspension.

    The authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or 
prospecting permit if the purchaser or permitte fails to comply with its 
terms and conditions. If the noncompliance is unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing injury, loss, or damage to surface resources, the 
authorized officer may cancel or suspend the contract, permit, or 
prospecting permit immediately. In cases where noncompliance is of a 
less serious nature, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend a 
contract, permit, or prospecting permit it such noncompliance continues 
for 30 days after service of written notice by the authorized officer. 
If the noncompliance is not corrected, the authorized officer may attach 
the bond to ensure compliance with the provisions of the contract, 
permit, or prospecting permit.


<R05>
Sec. 228.56  Operating plans.

    Any surface-disturbing operation under a contract, permit, or 
prospecting permit is subject to prior approval by the authorized 
officer of an operating plan and to reasonable conditions as may be 
required to ensure proper protection of the environment and 
improvements, including timely reclamation of disturbed lands. 
Significant changes to operations require prior approval of an amended 
operating plan. The operating plan must include, as a minimum, a map and 
explanation of the nature of the access, anticipated activity, surface 
disturbance, and intended reclamation including removal or retention of 
structures and facilities. Operating plans must be submitted by the 
purchaser, permittee, or prospecting permittee, except as noted in 
Sec. 228.64(b).

                      Types and Methods of Disposal


<R05>
Sec. 228.57  Types of disposal.

    Except as provided in Sec. 228.41(b), disposal of mineral materials 
may be made by:
    (a) Competitive sale to the highest qualified bidder after formal 
advertising and other appropriate public notice;

[[Page 154]]

    (b) Sale by negotiated contract. (1) For removal of materials to be 
used in connection with a public works improvement program on behalf of 
a Federal, State, or local government agency if the public exigency will 
not permit delays incident to advertising, or
    (2) For the removal of mineral materials for which it is 
impracticable to obtain competition;
    (c) Preference right negotiated sale to the holder of a Forest 
Service-issued prospecting permit under which a suitable mineral 
material deposit has been demonstrated on acquired National Forest 
lands;
    (d) Free use when a permit is issued to any nonprofit association, 
corporation, individual, or others listed in Sec. 228.62(d), for other 
than commercial purposes, resale, or barter, or to any Federal, State, 
county, local unit, subdivision, municipality, or county road district 
for use in public projects; or
    (e) Forest Service force account or by contract where the material 
is to be used to carry out various Forest Service programs involving 
construction and maintenance of physical improvements.


<R05>
Sec. 228.58  Competitive sales.

    (a) Invitation for bid. Sales must be conducted as described below 
after inviting competitive bids through publication and posting. The 
authorized officer may not offer a competitive sale unless there is a 
right-of-way or other access to the sale area which is available to 
anyone qualified to bid.
    (b) Advertising--(1) Sales over 25,000 cubic yards. Mineral material 
sales offered by competitive bidding and which exceed 25,000 cubic yards 
must be advertised on the same day once a week for two consecutive weeks 
in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the material is 
located, and in a trade or industrial newspaper when considered 
appropriate. Notice of the sale must be posted in a conspicuous place in 
the office where bids are to be submitted. In addition, the authorized 
officer may send the advertisement directly to known interested persons. 
Bids may be received but not evaluated before the end of the advertising 
period, which may be extended at the discretion of the authorized 
officer.
    (2) Content of advertising. The advertisement of sale must specify 
the location by legal description of the tract or tracts or by any other 
means identify the location of the mineral material deposit being 
offered, the kind of material, estimated quantities, the unit of 
measurement, appraised price (which sets the minimum acceptable bid), 
time and place for receiving and opening of bids, minimum deposit 
required, major special constraints due to environmental considerations, 
available access, maintenance required over haul routes, traffic 
controls, required use permits, required qualifications of bidders, the 
method of bidding, bonding requirement, notice of the right to reject 
any or all bids, the office where a copy of the contract and additional 
information may be obtained, and additional information the authorized 
officer deems necessary.
    (3) Advertising smaller sales. Advertisement of mineral materials 
amounting to 25,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) or less 
must be published and/or posted. The methods of advertisement are at the 
discretion of the authorized officer.
    (c) Conduct of sales. (1) Bidding at competitive sales may be 
conducted by the submission of written sealed bids, oral bids, or a 
combination of both as directed by the authorized officer. In the event 
of a tie in high sealed bids, the highest bidder will be determined by 
oral auction among those tied bidders; when no oral bid is higher that 
the sealed bids, the selected bidder will be determined by lot, the 
purchase price being the amount of the tied bid. For all oral auctions, 
including those used to break sealed-bid ties, the high bidder must 
confirm the bid in writing immediately upon being declared the high 
bidder. The authorized officer must mail notification of the bidding 
results to all bidders within 10 days.
    (2) The authorized officer may require bidders to furnish evidence 
of qualification at the time of award or, if such evidence has already 
been furnished and is still valid, make appropriate reference to the 
record containing it.
    (3) When it is in the interest of the United States to do so, the 
authorized officer may reject any or all bids.

[[Page 155]]

    (d) Bid deposits and award of contract. Sealed bids must be 
accompanied by a deposit. For mineral materials offered at oral auction, 
bidders must make the deposit before opening of the bidding.
    (1) Bid deposits must be equal to 10 percent of the appraised value 
but not less than $100.00.
    (2) Bid deposits must be in the form of cash, money order, bank 
drafts, cashier's or certified checks made payable to the Forest 
Service, or bonds acceptable to the Forest Service (Sec. 228.51(b)).
    (3) Upon conclusion of the bidding, the authorized officer will 
return the deposits of all unsuccessful bidders. The successful bidder's 
deposit will be applied toward the purchase price. If the contract is 
not awarded to the high bidder due to an inability to perform the 
obligations of the contract, the deposit, less expenses and damages 
incurred by the United States, may be returned. The return of a deposit 
does not prejudice any other rights or remedies of the United States. 
The contract may be offered and awarded to the next successive qualified 
high bidder, or, at the discretion of the authorized officer, the sale 
may be either readvertised or negotiated if it is determined that a 
competitive sale is impracticable.
    (4) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the successful 
bidder must sign and return the contract, together with any required 
bond, unless the authorized officer has granted an extension for an 
additional 30 days. The bidder must apply for the extension in writing 
within the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to return 
the contract within the first 30-day period or within an approved 
extension, the bid deposit, less the costs of readvertising and damages, 
may be returned without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the 
United States.
    (5) All sales must be processed on Forest Service-approved contract 
forms. The authorized officer may add provisions to the contract to 
cover conditions peculiar to the sale area. Such additional provisions 
must be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the 
advertising period.


<R05>
Sec. 228.59  Negotiated or noncompetitive sales.

    (a) Volume limitations. When it is determined by the authorized 
officer to be in the public interest and when it is impracticable to 
obtain competition, mineral materials not exceeding 100,000 cubic yards 
in volume (or weight equivalent) may be sold in any one sale at not less 
than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, 
except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The 
authorized officer may not approve noncompetitive sales that exceed the 
total of 200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) made in any one 
State for the benefit of any applicant in any period of 12 consecutive 
months.
    (b) Government programs. In connection with a public works 
improvement project on behalf of a Federal, State, or local governmental 
agency, the authorized officer may sell to an applicant, at not less 
than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, a 
volume of mineral materials not to exceed 200,000 cubic yards (or weight 
equivalent) when the public exigency will not permit delays incident to 
advertising (30 U.S.C. 602).
    (c) Appropriation for highway purposes. For interstate and/or 
Federal aid highways, the Secretary of Transportation may appropriate 
any volume in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 107 and 317.
    (d) Use in development of Federal mineral leases. When it is 
determined to be impracticable to obtain competition and the mineral 
materials are to be used in connection with the development of mineral 
leases issued by the United States (Sec. 228.44), the authorized officer 
may sell to a leaseholder a volume of mineral material not to exceed 
200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) in one State in any period of 
12 consecutive months. No charge will be made for materials which must 
be moved in the process of extracting the mineral under lease, as long 
as the materials remain stockpiled within the boundaries of the leased 
area.
    (e) Exceptions. (1) The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize 
the noncompetitive sale of mineral materials in excess of the volume 
limitations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section when 
necessary to:

[[Page 156]]

    (i) Respond to an emergency affecting public health, safety or 
property;
    (ii) Prevent the curtailment of operations conducted under the 
United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et 
seq.) which generate large volumes of mineral materials as a by-product; 
or
    (iii) Respond to a critical public need for the prompt development 
of a mineral lease issued by the United States or a mining claim located 
under the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 
U.S.C. 22 et seq.).
    (2) Any noncompetitive sale of mineral materials in excess of the 
volume limitations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) shall be subject to 
such restrictions as the Chief of the Forest Service determines to be in 
the public interest.
    (3) Nothing in this paragraph shall otherwise alter the requirements 
of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

[49 FR 29784, July 24, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 10565, Apr. 2, 1987; 53 
FR 43691, Oct. 28, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 228.60  Prospecting permits.

    (a) Right conferred. On acquired National Forest lands, prospecting 
permits may be issued which grant the permittee the exclusive right to 
explore for and to demonstrate the existence of a suitable mineral 
material deposit when existing information is insufficient. After the 
demonstration of a suitable deposit and confirmation of this by the 
authorized officer, the permittee will have a preference right to apply 
for a negotiated sale.
    (b) Limitations. Mineral material may be removed from lands under a 
prospecting permit only to the extent necessary for testing and analysis 
or for the demonstration of the existence of a suitable deposit.
    (c) Environmental analysis. Prospecting permits will be issued only 
after submission by applicant and approval by the authorized officer of 
a detailed operating plan. The authorized officer may require a bond in 
accordance with Sec. 228.51. The authorized officer must ensure 
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.).
    (d) Acreage and permit limitations. A prospecting permit may not 
cover more than 640 acres. No individual or group may have an interest 
at any one time in more than three prospecting permits on Forest Service 
lands administered by one Forest Supervisor.
    (e) Duration and extension of permits. Prospecting permits may be 
issued for a period not to exceed 24 months, but they may be extended 
once for up to an additional 24 months if necessary to complete 
prospecting. Any application for extension must be submitted no later 
than 30 days before the expiration of the permit. The application for 
extension must provide evidence of diligence and state the reasons why 
additional time is considered necessary to complete prospecting work.
    (f) Refusal to extend permits. The authorized officer may reject 
applications for extension of prospecting permits for the following 
reasons:
    (1) Failure to perform. Failure of the permittee to perform 
prospecting or exploration work without adequate justification may 
result in the denial of an extension; or
    (2) Failure to apply. If an application for extension is not 
submitted within the specified period, the permit may expire without 
notice to the permittee.
    (3) Public interest. If the authorized officer determines that an 
extension may not be in the public interest, the application may be 
rejected.


<R05>
Sec. 228.61  Preference right negotiated sales.

    (a) Qualification for sale. When applying for a preference right 
negotiated sale, the permittee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the authorized officer that a suitable deposit of mineral material has 
been discovered within the area covered by the prospecting permit. 
Information concerning trade secrets and financial matters submitted by 
the permittee and identified as confidential will not be available for 
public examination except as otherwise agreed upon by the permittee.
    (b) Application for sale. The application must be submitted to the 
District Ranger's office on or before the expiration date of the 
prospecting permit or its extension. The authorized officer may grant 30 
additional days for submitting the application if requested in

[[Page 157]]

writing by the permittee before expiration of the prospecting permit or 
its extension.
    (c) Terms and conditions of contract. The terms and conditions will 
be evaluated on an individual case basis. Only those mineral materials 
specified in the contract may be removed by the purchaser. Before a 
preference right negotiated contract is awarded, the authorized officer 
must ensure that an environmental analysis is conducted. All contracts 
are subject to the conditions under Secs. 228.47 through 228.56.
    (d) Acreage limitations. The authorized officer will determine the 
amount of acreage in the preference right negotiated sale based on a 
presentation of the permittee's needs. The maximum acreage allowable to 
any individual or group must not exceed 320 acres on National Forest 
lands administered by one Forest Supervisor. The allowable acreage may 
be in one or more units which are not necessarily contiguous.
    (e) Volume limitations. Preference right negotiated sales are exempt 
from volume limitations.
    (f) Contract time allowable. A contract or a renewal must not exceed 
5 years; however, the purchaser may have renewal options at the end of 
each contract or renewal period. The authorized officer may renew a 
contract if it is determined that the renewal is not detrimental to the 
public interest and that the purchaser has demonstrated diligence in 
conducting operations. The authorized officer may cancel the contract, 
or the purchaser may forfeit the contract, if no substantial commercial 
production occurs during any continuous 2-year period after the award of 
the contract or if the contract terms and conditions are breached. 
However, if a delay is caused by conditions beyond the purchaser's 
control, the authorized officer may grant an extension equal to the lost 
time.
    (g) Contract renewal reappraisal. At the time of contract renewal, 
the authorized officer will reappraise the mineral material deposit in 
accordance with Sec. 228.49.


<R05>
Sec. 228.62  Free use.

    (a) Application. An application for a free-use permit must be made 
with the appropriate District Ranger's office.
    (b) Term. Permits may be issued for periods not to exceed 1 year and 
will terminate on the expiration date unless extended by the authorized 
officer as in Sec. 228.53(b). However, the authorized officer may issue 
permits to any local, State, Federal, or Territorial agency, unit or 
subdivision, including municipalities and county road districts, for 
periods up to 10 years.
    (c) Removal by agent. A free-use permittee may extract the mineral 
materials through a designated agent provided that the conditions of the 
permit are not violated. No part of the material may be used as payment 
for the services of an agent in obtaining or processing the material. A 
permit may be issued in the name of a designated agent for those 
entities listed in Sec. 228.62(d)(1), at the discretion of the 
authorized officer, provided there is binding agreement in which the 
entity retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 
conditions of the permit.
    (d) Conditions. Free-use permits may be issued for mineral materials 
to settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors for uses other than 
commercial purposes, resale, or barter (16 U.S.C. 477). Free-use permits 
may be issued to local, State, Federal, or Territorial agencies, units, 
or subdivisions, including municipalities, or any association or 
corporation not organized for profit, for other than commercial or 
industrial purposes or resale (30 U.S.C. 601). Free-use permits may not 
be issued when, in the judgment of the authorized officer, the applicant 
owns or controls an adequate supply of mineral material in the area of 
demand. The free-use permit, issued on a Forest Service-approved form, 
must include the basis for the free-use as well as the provisions 
governing the selection, removal, and use of the mineral materials. No 
mineral material may be removed until the permit is issued. The 
permittee must notify the authorized officer upon completion of mineral 
material removal. The permittee must complete the reclamation prescibed 
in the operating plan (Sec. 228.56).
    (1) A free-use permit may be issued to any local, State, Federal, or 
Territorial agency, unit, or subdivision, including

[[Page 158]]

municipalities and county road districts, without limitation on the 
number of permits or on the value of the mineral materials to be 
extracted or removed.
    (2) A free-use permit issued to a nonprofit association, 
corporation, or individual may not provide for the removal of mineral 
materials having a volume exceeding 5,000 cubic yards (or weight 
equivalent) during any period of 12 consecutive months.
    (e) Petrified wood. A free-use permit may be issued to amateur 
collectors and scientists to take limited quantities of petrified wood 
for personal use. The material taken may not be bartered or sold. Free-
use areas may be designated within which a permit may not be required. 
Removal of material from such areas must be in accord with rules issued 
by the authorized officer and posted on the area. Such rules must also 
be posted in the District Ranger's and Forest Supervisor's offices and 
be available upon request. The rules may vary by area depending on the 
quantity, quality, and accessibility of the material and the demand for 
it.


<R05>
Sec. 228.63  Removal under terms of a timber sale or other Forest Service 
contract.

    In carrying out programs such as timber sales that involve 
construction and maintenance of various physical improvements, the 
Forest Service may specify that mineral materials be mined, 
manufactured, and/or processed for incorporation into the improvement. 
Where the mineral material is located on National Forest lands and is 
designated in the contract calling for its use, no permit is required as 
long as an operating plan as described in Sec. 228.56 is required by the 
contract provisions. Title to any excavated material in excess of that 
needed to fulfill contract requirements revests in the United States 
without reimbursement to the contract holder or to agents or 
representatives of the contract holder. Such excess material may be 
disposed of under Secs. 228.58, 228.59, or 228.62.


<R05>
Sec. 228.64  Community sites and common-use areas.

    (a) Designation. Nonexclusive disposals may be made from the same 
deposit or areas designated by the authorized officer; the designation 
of such an area and any reclamation requirements must be based on an 
environmental analysis.
    (b) Pit plans. The Forest Service must prepare operating plans 
(Sec. 228.56) for the efficient removal of the material and for 
appropriate reclamation of community sites and common-use areas.
    (c) Reclamation. The Forest Service is responsible for reclamation 
of community sites and common-use areas.


<R05>
Sec. 228.65  Payment for sales.

    (a) Conditions. Mineral materials may not be removed from the sale 
area until all conditions of payment in the contract have been met.
    (b) Advance payment. (1) For negotiated and competitive sales the 
full amount may be paid before removal is begun under the contract or by 
installment at the discretion of the authorized officer. Installment 
payments must be based on the estimated removal rate specified in the 
operating plan and must be, as a minimum, the value of 1 month's 
removal. The first installment must be paid before removal operations 
are begun; remaining installments must be paid in advance of removal of 
the remaining materials as billed by the authorized officer. The total 
amount of the purchase price must be paid at least 60 days before the 
expiration date of the contract.
    (2) All advance payment contracts must provide for reappraisal of 
the mineral material at the time of contract renewal or extension.
    (3) Minimum annual production must be sufficient to return a payment 
to the United States equal to the first installment. In lieu of minimum 
production, there must be an annual payment in the amount of the first 
installment which will not be credited to future years' production. 
Payments for or in lieu of minimum annual production must be received by 
the authorized officer on or before the anniversary of the effective 
date of the contract.

[[Page 159]]

    (4) If the purchaser fails to make payments when due, the contract 
will be considered breached; the authorized officer will terminate the 
contract, and all previous payments will be forfeited without prejudice 
to any other rights and remedies of the United States. Forfeiture will 
not result when the purchaser is unable to meet the minimum annual 
production (volume or value) for reasons beyond the purchaser's control.
    (5) In order to determine payment amount, the purchaser must make a 
report of operations. The report must include the amount of mineral 
material removed, which must be verified by the authorized officer.
    (c) Deferred payments. The authorized officer may approve deferred 
payments for sales.
    (1) The purchaser may make payments monthly or quarterly which must 
be based on the in-place value (volume or weight equivalent) of material 
removed during the contract period. The units of measurement must 
correspond to the units used in the appraisal. The purchaser must make 
all payments before contract renewal.
    (2) The purchaser must deliver a bond which conforms to the 
provisions of Sec. 228.51(a)(2) to the authorized officer before 
operations are begun under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 228.66  Refunds.

    Upon termination of any contract, payments in excess of $10 may be 
refunded, less the costs incurred by the United States, under any of the 
following conditions:
    (a) Payment in excess of value. If the total payment exceeds the 
value of the mineral material removed, unless it is the minimum annual 
payment in lieu of production;
    (b) Insufficiency of material. If insufficient mineral material 
existed in the sale area to provide the quantity of material estimated 
to have been available;
    (c) Termination. (1) If the contract is terminated by the authorized 
officer for reasons which are beyond the purchaser's control; or
    (2) If the contract is terminated by mutual agreement. This refund 
provision is not a warranty that a specific quantity of material exists 
in the sale area.


<R05>
Sec. 228.67  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The following sections of this subpart contain information 
collection requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of

<R05>
Sec. 228.80  Operations within Misty Fjords and Admiralty Island National 
Monuments, Alaska.

    (a) Mineral activities on valid mining claims in the Misty Fjords 
and Admiralty Island National Monuments must be conducted in accordance 
with regulations in subpart A of this part and with the provisions of 
this section.
    (b) Prior to approving a plan of operations, the authorized officer 
must consider:

[[Page 160]]

    (1) The resources of ecological, cultural, geological, historical, 
prehistorical, and scientific interest likely to be affected by the 
proposed operations, including access; and
    (2) The potential adverse impacts on the identified resource values 
resulting from the proposed operations.
    (c) A plan of operations will be approved if, in the judgment of the 
authorized officer, proposed operations are compatible, to the maximum 
extent feasible, with the protection of the resource values identified 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (1) The authorized officer will deem operations to be compatible if 
the plan of operations includes all feasible measures which are 
necessary to prevent or minimize potential adverse impacts on the 
resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
and if the operations are conducted in accordance with the plan.
    (2) In evaluating the feasibility of mitigating measures, the 
authorized officer shall, at a minimum, consider the following:
    (i) The effectiveness and practicality of measures utilizing the 
best available technology for preventing or minimizing adverse impacts 
on the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The long- and short-term costs to the operator of utilizing 
such measures and the effect of these costs on the long- and short-term 
economic viability of the operations.
    (3) The authorized officer shall not require implementation of 
mitigating measures which would prevent the evaluation or development of 
any valid claim for which operations are proposed.
    (d) In accordance with the procedures described in subpart A and 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the authorized officer 
may approve modifications of an existing plan of operations:

Sec. 228.102  Leasing analyses and decisions.

    (a) Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
In analyzing lands for leasing, the authorized Forest officer shall 
comply with the

[[Page 162]]

National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, implementing regulations at 
43 CFR parts 1500-1508, and Forest Service implementing policies and 
procedures set forth in Forest Service Manual chapter 1950 and Forest 
Service Handbook 1909.15.
    (b) Scheduling analysis of available lands. Within 6 months of April 
20, 1990, Forest Supervisors shall develop, in cooperation with the 
Bureau of Land Management and with public input, a schedule for 
analyzing lands under their jurisdiction that have not been already 
analyzed for leasing. The Forest Supervisors shall revise or make 
additions to the schedule at least annually. In scheduling lands for 
analysis, the authorized Forest officer shall identify and exclude from 
further review the following lands which are legally unavailable for 
leasing:
    (1) Lands withdrawn from mineral leasing by an act of Congress or by 
an order of the Secretary of the Interior;
    (2) Lands recommended for wilderness allocation by the Secretary of 
Agriculture;
    (3) Lands designated by statute as wilderness study areas, unless 
oil and gas leasing is specifically allowed by the statute designating 
the study area; and
    (4) Lands within areas allocated for wilderness or further planning 
in Executive Communication 1504, Ninety-Sixth Congress (House Document 
No. 96-119), unless such lands subsequently have been allocated to uses 
other than wilderness by an approved Forest land and resource management 
plan or have been released to uses other than wilderness by an act of 
Congress.
    (c) Leasing analyses. The leasing analysis shall be conducted by the 
authorized Forest officer in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR 
part 219 (Forest land and resource management planning) and/or, as 
appropriate, through preparation of NEPA documents. As part of the 
analysis, the authorized Forest oficer shall:
    (1) Identify on maps those areas that will be:
    (i) Open to development subject to the terms and conditions of the 
standard oil and gas lease form (including an explanation of the typical 
standards and objectives to be enforced under the standard lease terms);
    (ii) Open to development but subject to constraints that will 
require the use of lease stipulations such as those prohibiting surface 
use on areas larger than 40 acres or such other standards as may be 
developed in the plan for stipulation use (with discussion as to why the 
constraints are necessary and justifiable); and
    (iii) Closed to leasing, distinguishing between those areas that are 
being closed through exercise of management direction, and those closed 
by law, regulation, etc.
    (2) Identify alternatives to the areas listed in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, including that of not allowing leasing.
    (3) Project the type/amount of post-leasing activity that is 
reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of conducting a leasing program 
consistent with that described in the proposal and for each alternative.
    (4) Analyze the reasonable foreseeable impacts of post-leasing 
activity projected under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (d) Area or Forest-wide leasing decisions (lands administratively 
available for leasing). Upon completion of the leasing analysis, the 
Regional Forest shall promptly notify the Bureau of Land Management as 
to the area or Forest-wide leasing decisions that have been made, that 
is, identify lands which have been found administratively available for 
leasing.
    (e) Leasing decisions for specific lands. At such time as specific 
lands are being considered for leasing, the Regional Forester shall 
review the area or Forest-wide leasing decision and shall authorize the 
Bureau of Land Management to offer specific lands for lease subject to:
    (1) Verifying that oil and gas leasing of the specific lands has 
been adequately addressed in a NEPA document, and is consistent with the 
Forest land and resource management plan. If NEPA has not been 
adequately addressed, or if there is significant new information or 
circumstances as defined by 40 CFR 1502.9 requiring further 
environmental analysis, additional environment analysis shall be done 
before

[[Page 163]]

a leasing decision for specific lands will be made. If there is 
inconsistency with the Forest land and resource management plan, no 
authorization for leasing shall be given unless the plan is amended or 
revised.
    (2) Ensuring that conditions of surface occupancy identified in 
Sec. 228.102(c)(1) are properly included as stipulations in resulting 
leases.
    (3) Determining that operations and development could be allowed 
somewhere on each proposed lease, except where stipulations will 
prohibit all surface occupancy.

the authorized Forest officer shall ensure compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.) and any other 
applicable laws, and shall ensure preparation of any appropriate 
environmental documents.
    (2) The authorized Forest officer may authorize the Bureau of Land 
Management to modify, waive, or grant an exception to a stipulation if:
    (i) The action would be consistent with applicable Federal laws;
    (ii) The action would be consistent with the current forest land and 
resource management plan;
    (iii) The management objectives which led the Forest Service to 
require the inclusion of the stipulation in the lease can be met without 
restricting operations in the manner provided for by the stipulation 
given the change in the present condition of the surface resources 
involved, or given the nature, location, timing, or design of the 
proposed operations; and
    (iv) The action is acceptable to the authorized Forest officer based 
upon a review of the environmental consequences.
    (c) Other agency stipulations. If a stipulation was included in a 
lease by the Forest Service at the request of another agency, the 
authorized Forest officer shall consult with that agency prior to 
authorizing modification, waiver, or exception.
    (d) Notice of decision. (1) When the review of a stipulation 
modification, waiver, or exception request has been completed and the 
authorized Forest officer has reached a decision, the authorized Forest 
officer shall promptly notify the operator and the appropriate Bureau of 
Land Management office, in writing, of the decision to grant, or grant 
with additional conditions, or deny the request.
    (2) Any decision to modify, waive, or grant an exception to a lease 
stipulation shall be subject to administrative appeal only in 
conjunction with an appeal of a decision on a surface use plan of 
operation or supplemental surface use plan of operation.

<R05>
Sec. 228.106  Operator's submission of surface use plan of operations.

    (a) General. No permit to drill on a Federal oil and gas lease for 
National Forest System lands may be granted without the analysis and 
approval of a surface use plan of operations covering proposed surface 
disturbing activities. An operator must obtain an approved surface use 
plan of operations before conducting operations that will cause surface 
disturbance. The operator shall submit a proposed surface use plan of 
operations as part of an Application for a Permit to Drill to the 
appropriate Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the 
Forest Service, unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas 
Order in effect when the proposed plan of operations is submitted.
    (b) Preparation of plan. In preparing a surface use plan of 
operations, the operator is encouraged to contact the local Forest 
Service office to make use of such information as is available from the 
Forest Service concerning surface resources and uses, environmental 
considerations, and local reclamation procedures.
    (c) Content of plan. The type, size, and intensity of the proposed 
operations and the sensitivity of the surface resources that will be 
affected by the proposed operations determine the level of detail and 
the amount of information which the operator includes in a proposed plan 
of operations. However, any surface use plan of operations submitted by 
an operator shall contain the information specified by the Onshore Oil 
and Gas Order in effect when the surface use plan of operations is 
submitted.
    (d) Supplemental plan. An operator must obtain an approved 
supplemental surface use plan of operations before conducting any 
surface disturbing operations that are not authorized by a current 
approved surface use plan of operations. The operator shall submit a 
proposed supplemental surface use plan of operations to the appropriate 
Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the Forest Service, 
unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect 
when the proposed supplemental plan of operations is submitted. The 
supplemental plan of operations need only address those operations that 
differ from the operations authorized by the current approved surface 
use plan of operations. A supplemental plan is otherwise subject to the 
same requirements under this subpart as an initial surface use plan of 
operations.


<R05>
Sec. 228.107  Review of surface use plan of operations.

    (a) Review. The authorized Forest officer shall review a surface use 
plan of operations as promptly as practicable given the nature and scope 
of the proposed plan. As part of the review, the authorized Forest 
officer shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 
implementing regulations at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and the Forest 
Service implementing policies

[[Page 165]]

be consistent with, the applicable current approved forest land and 
resource management plan;
    (3) The surface use plan of operations meets or exceeds the surface 
use requirements of Sec. 228.108 of this subpart; and
    (4) The surface use plan of operations is acceptable, or is modified 
to be acceptable, to the authorized Forest officer based upon a review 
of the environmental consequences of the operations.
    (b) Decision. The authorized Forest officer shall make a decision on 
the approval of a surface use plan of operations as follows:
    (1) If the authorized Forest officer will not be able to make a 
decision on the proposed plan within 3 working days after the conclusion 
of the 30-day notice period provided for by 30 U.S.C. 226(f), the 
authorized Forest officer shall advise the appropriate Bureau of Land 
Managemnt office and the operator as soon as such delay becomes 
apparent, either in writing or orally with subsequent written 
confirmation, that additional time will be needed to process the plan. 
The authorized Forest officer shall explain the reason why additional 
time is needed and project the date by which a decision on the plan will 
likely be made.

    (e) Inspection. Forest Service officers shall periodically inspect 
the area of operations to determine and document whether operations are 
being conducted in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, the 
stipulations included in the lease at the direction of the Forest 
Service, the approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable 
Onshore Oil and Gas Order, and applicable Notices to Lessees, 
Transferees, and Operators.


<R05>
Sec. 228.113  Notice of noncompliance.

    (a) Issuance. When an authorized Forest officer finds that the 
operator is not in compliance with a reclamation or other standard, a 
stipulation included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, 
an approved surface use plan of operation, the regulations in this 
subpart, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable 
notice to lessees, transferees, and operators, the authorized Forest 
officer shall issue a notice of noncompliance.
    (1) Content. The notice of noncompliance shall include the 
following:
    (i) Identification of the reclamation requirements or other 
standard(s) with which the operator is not in compliance;
    (ii) Description of the measures which are required to correct the 
noncompliance;
    (iii) Specification of a reasonable period of time within which the 
noncompliance must be corrected;
    (iv) If the noncompliance appears to be material, identification of 
the possible consequences of continued noncompliance of the 
requirement(s) or standard(s) as described in 30 U.S.C. 226(g);
    (v) If the noncompliance appears to be in violation of the 
prohibitions set forth in 36 CFR part 261, identification of the 
possible consequences of continued noncompliance of the requirement(s) 
or standard(s) as described in 36 CFR 261.1b; and
    (vi) Notification that the authorized Forest officer remains willing 
and desirous of working cooperatively with the operator to resolve or 
remedy the noncompliance.
    (2) Extension of deadlines. The operator may request an extension of 
a deadline specified in a notice of noncompliance if the operator is 
unable to come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or 
standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance by the deadline 
because of conditions beyond the operator's control. The authorized 
Forest officer shall not extend a deadline specified in a notice of 
noncompliance unless the operator requested an extension and the 
authorized Forest officer finds that there was a condition beyond the 
operator's control, that such condition prevented the operator from 
complying with the notice of noncompliance by the specified deadline, 
and that the extension will not adversely affect the interests of the 
United States. Conditions which may be beyond the operator's control 
include, but are not limited to, closure of an area in accordance with 
36 CFR part 261, subparts B or C, or inaccessibility of an area of 
operations due to such conditions as fire, flooding, or snowpack.
    (3) Manner of service. The authorized Forest officer shall serve a 
notice of noncompliance or a decision on a request for extension of a 
deadline specified in a notice upon the operator in person, by certified 
mail or by telephone. However, if notice is initially provided in person 
or by telephone, the authorized Forest officer shall send the

[[Page 169]]

operator written confirmation of the notice or decision by certified 
mail.
    (b) Failure to come into compliance. If the operator fails to come 
into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) 
identified in a notice of noncompliance by the deadline specified in the 
notice, or an approved extension, the authorized Forest officer shall 
decide whether: The noncompliance appears to be material given the 
reclamation requirements and other standards applicable to the lease 
established by 30 U.S.C. 226(g), the regulations in this subpart, the 
stipulations included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, 
an approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable Onshore Oil 
and Gas Order, or an applicable Notice to lessees, transferees, and 
operators; the noncompliance is likely to result in danger to public 
health or safety or irreparable resource damage; and the noncompliance 
is resulting in an emergency.
    (1) Referral to compliance officer. When the operations appear to be 
in material noncompliance, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly 
refer the matter to the compliance officer. The referral shall be 
accompanied by a complete statement of the facts supported by 
appropriate exhibits. Apparent material noncompliance includes, but is 
not limited to, operating without an approved surface use plan of 
operations, conducting operations that have been suspended, failure to 
timely complete reclamation in accordance with an approved surface use 
plan of operations, failure to maintain an additional bond in the amount 
required by the authorized Forest officer during the period of 
operation, failure to timely reimburse the Forest Service for the cost 
of abating an emergency, and failing to comply with any term included in 
a lease, stipulation, or approved surface use plan of operations, the 
applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable Notice to 
lessees, transferees, and operators, relating to the protection of a 
threatened or endangered species.
    (2) Suspension of operations. When the noncompliance is likely to 
result in danger to public health or safety or in irreparable resource 
damage, the authorized Forest officer shall suspend the operations, in 
whole or in part.
    (i) A suspension of operations shall remain in effect until the 
authorized Forest officer determines that the operations are in 
compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified 
in the notice of noncompliance.
    (ii) The authorized Forest officer shall serve decisions suspending 
operations upon the operator in person, by certified mail, or by 
telephone. If notice is initially provided in person or by telephone, 
the authorized Forest officer shall send the operator written 
confirmation of the decision by certified mail.
    (iii) The authorized Forest officer shall immediately notify the 
appropriate Bureau of Land Management office when an operator has been 
given notice to suspend operations.
    (3) Abatement of emergencies. When the noncompliance is resulting in 
an emergency, the authorized Forest officer may take action as necessary 
to abate the emergency. The total cost to the Forest Service of taking 
actions to abate an emergency becomes an obligation of the operator.
    (i) Emergency situations include, but are not limited to, imminent 
dangers to public health or safety or irreparable resource damage.
    (ii) The authorized Forest officer shall promptly serve a bill for 
such costs upon the operator by certified mail.

evaluate a referral made by the authorized Forest officer pursuant to 
Sec. 228.113(b)(1) of this subpart.
    (b) Dismissal of referral. The compliance officer shall dismiss the 
referral if the compliance officer determines that there is not adequate 
evidence to support a reasonable belief that:
    (1) The operator was not in compliance with the applicable 
requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in a notice of noncompliance by 
the deadline specified in the notice, or an extension approved by the 
authorized Forest officer; or

[[Page 170]]

    (2) The noncompliance with the applicable requirement(s) or 
standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance may be material.
    (c) Initiation of proceedings. The compliance officer shall initiate 
a material noncompliance proceeding if the compliance officer agrees 
that there is adequate evidence to support a reasonable belief that an 
operator has failed to come into compliance with the applicable 
requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in a notice of noncompliance by 
the deadline specified in the notice, or extension approved by the 
authorized Forest officer, and that the noncompliance may be material.
    (1) Notice of proceedings. The compliance officer shall inform the 
lessee and operator of the material noncompliance proceedings by 
certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (2) Content of notice. The notice of the material noncompliance 
proceeding shall include the following:
    (i) The specific reclamation requirement(s) or other standard(s) of 
which the operator may be in material noncompliance;
    (ii) A description of the measures that are required to correct the 
violation;
    (iii) A statement that if the compliance officer finds that the 
operator is in material noncompliance with a reclamation requirement or 
other standard applicable to the lease, the Secretary of the Interior 
will not be able to issue new leases or approve new transfers of leases 
to the operator, any subsidiary or affiliate of the operator, or any 
person controlled by or under common control with the operator until the 
compliance officer finds that the operator has come into compliance with 
such requirement or standard; and
    (iv) A recitation of the specific procedures governing the material 
noncompliance proceeding set forth in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this 
section.
    (d) Answer. Within 30 calendar days after receiving the notice of 
the proceeding, the operator may submit, in person, in writing, or 
through a representative, an answer containing information and argument 
in opposition to the proposed material noncompliance finding, including 
information that raises a genuine dispute over the material facts. In 
that submission, the operator also may:
    (1) Request an informal hearing with the compliance officer; and
    (2) Identify pending administrative or judicial appeal(s) which are 
relevant to the proposed material noncompliance finding and provide 
information which shows the relevance of such appeal(s).
    (e) Informal hearing. If the operator requests an informal hearing, 
it shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date that the 
compliance officer receives the operator's request.
    (1) The compliance officer may postpone the date of the informal 
hearing if the operator requests a postponement in writing.
    (2) At the hearing, the operator, appearing personally or through an 
attorney or another authorized representative, may informally present 
and explain evidence and argument in opposition to the proposed material 
noncompliance finding.
    (3) A transcript of the informal hearing shall not be required.
    (f) Additional procedures as to disputed facts. If the compliance 
officer finds that the answer raises a genuine dispute over facts 
essential to the proposed material noncompliance finding, the compliance 
officer shall so inform the operator by certified mail, return receipt 
requested. Within 10 days of receiving this notice, the operator may 
request a fact-finding conference on those disputed facts.
    (1) The fact-finding conference shall be scheduled within 20 
calendar days from the date the compliance officer receives the 
operator's request, unless the operator and compliance officer agree 
otherwise.
    (2) At the fact-finding conference, the operator shall have the 
opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present 
witnesses, and confront the person(s) the Forest Service presents.
    (3) A transcribed record of the fact-finding conference shall be 
made, unless the operator and the compliance officer by mutual agreement 
waive the requirement for a transcript. The transcript will be made 
available to the operator at cost upon request.

[[Page 171]]

    (4) The compliance officer may preside over the fact-finding 
conference or designate another authorized Forest officer to preside 
over the fact-finding conference.
    (5) Following the fact-finding conference, the authorized Forest 
officer who presided over the conference shall promptly prepare written 
findings of fact based upon the preponderance of the evidence. The 
compliance officer may reject findings of fact prepared by another 
authorized Forest officer, in whole or in part, if the compliance 
officer specifically determines that such findings are arbitrary and 
capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (g) Dismissal of proceedings. The compliance officer shall dismiss 
the material noncompliance proceeding if, before the compliance officer 
renders a decision pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the 
authorized Forest officer who made the referral finds that the operator 
has come into compliance with the applicable requirements or standards 
identified in the notice of proceeding.
    (h) Compliance officer's decision. The compliance officer shall base 
the decision on the entire record, which shall consist of the authorized 
Forest officer's referral and its accompanying statement of facts and 
exhibits, information and argument that the operator provided in an 
answer, any information and argument that the operator provided in an 
informal hearing if one was held, and the findings of fact if a fact-
finding conference was held.
    (1) Content. The compliance officer's decision shall state whether 
the operator has violated the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified 
in the notice of proceeding and, if so, whether that noncompliance is 
material given the requirements of 30 U.S.C. 226(g), the stipulations 
included in the lease at the direction of the Forest Service, the 
regulations in this subpart or an approved surface use plan of 
operations, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable 
notice to lessees, transferees, and operators. If the compliance officer 
finds that the operator is in material noncompliance, the decision also 
shall:
    (i) Describe the measures that are required to correct the 
violation;
    (ii) Apprise the operator that the Secretary of the Interior is 
being notified that the operator has been found to be in material 
noncompliance with a reclamation requirement or other standard 
applicable to the lease; and
    (iii) State that the decision is the final administrative 
determination of the Department of Agriculture.
    (2) Service. The compliance officer shall serve the decision upon 
the operator by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the 
operator is found to be in material noncompliance, the compliance 
officer also shall immediately send a copy of the decision to the 
appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and to the Secretary of the 
Interior.
    (i) Petition for withdrawal of finding. If an operator who has been 
found to be in material noncompliance under the provisions of this 
section believes that the operations have subsequently come into 
compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified 
in the compliance officer's decision, the operator may submit a written 
petition requesting that the material noncompliance finding be 
withdrawn. The petition shall be submitted to the authorized Forest 
officer who issued the operator the notice of noncompliance under 
Sec. 228.113(a) of this subpart and shall include information or 
exhibits which shows that the operator has come into compliance with the 
requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's 
decision.
    (1) Response to petition. Within 30 calendar days after receiving 
the operator's petition for withdrawal, the authorized Forest officer 
shall submit a written statement to the compliance officer as to whether 
the authorized Forest officer agrees that the operator has come into 
compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the 
compliance officer's decision. If the authorized Forest officer 
disagrees with the operator, the written statement shall be accompanied 
by a complete statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits.
    (2) Additional procedures as to disputed material facts. If the 
compliance officer finds that the authorized Forest officer's response 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the decision as

[[Page 172]]

to whether the operator has come into compliance with the requirement(s) 
or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision, the 
compliance officer shall so notify the operator and authorized Forest 
officer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall 
also advise the operator that the fact finding procedures specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section apply to the compliance officer's decision 
on the petition for withdrawal.
    (3) Compliance officer's decision. The compliance officer shall base 
the decision on the petition on the entire record, which shall consist 
of the operator's petition for withdrawal and its accompanying exhibits, 
the authorized Forest officer's response to the petition and, if 
applicable, its accompanying statement of facts and exhibits, and if a 
fact-finding conference was held, the findings of fact. The compliance 
officer shall serve the decision on the operator by certified mail.
    (i) If the compliance officer finds that the operator remains in 
violation of requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the decision 
finding that the operator was in material noncompliance, the decision on 
the petition for withdrawal shall identify such requirement(s) or 
standard(s) and describe the measures that are required to correct the 
violation(s).
    (ii) If the compliance officer finds that the operator has 
subsequently come into compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) 
identified in the compliance officer's decision finding that the 
operator was in material noncompliance, the compliance officer also 
shall immediately send a copy of the decision on the petition for 
withdrawal to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and 
notify the Secretary of the Interior that the operator has come into 
compliance.
    (j) List of operators found to be in material noncompliance. The 
Deputy Chief, National Forest System, shall compile and maintain a list 
of operators who have been found to be in material noncompliance with 
reclamation requirements and other standards as provided in 30 U.S.C. 
226(g), the regulations in this subpart, a stipulation included in a

 Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 228--Guidelines for Preparing Surface 
                   Use Plans of Operation for Drilling

       I. Components of a Complete Application for Permit to Drill

    (a) Guidelines for Preparing Surface Use Program. In preparing this 
program, the lessee or operator shall submit maps, plats, and narrative 
descriptions which adhere closely to the following (maps and plats 
should be of a scale no smaller than 1:24,000 unless otherwise stated 
below):
    (1) Existing Roads. A legible map (USGS topographic, county road, 
Alaska Borough, or other such map), labeled and showing the access route 
to the location, shall be used for locating the proposed well site in 
relation to a town (village) or other locatable point, such as a highway 
or county road, which handles the majority of the through traffic to the 
general area. The proposed route to the location, including appropriate 
distances from the point where the access route exits established roads, 
shall be shown. All access roads shall be appropriately labeled. Any 
plans for improvement and/or a statement that existing roads will be 
maintained in the same or better condition shall be provided. Existing 
roads and newly constructed roads on surface under the jurisdiction of a 
Surface Management Agency shall be maintained in accordance with the 
standards of the Surface Management Agency.
    Information required by items (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of 
this subsection also may be shown on this map if appropriately labeled 
or on a separate plat or map.
    (2) Access Roads to Be Constructed and Reconstructed. All permanent 
and temporary access roads that are to be constructed, or reconstructed, 
in connection with the drilling of the proposed well shall be 
appropriately identified and submitted on a map or plat. Width, maximum 
grade, major cuts and fills, turnouts, drainage design, location and 
size of culverts and/or bridges, fence cuts and/or cattleguards, and 
type of surfacing material, if any, shall be stated for all 
construction. In addition, where permafrost exists, the methods for 
protection from thawing must be indicated. Modification of proposed road 
design may be required during the onsite inspection.
    Information also should be furnished to indicate where existing 
facilities may be altered or modified. Such facilities include gates, 
cattleguards, culverts, and bridges which, if installed or replaced, 
shall be designed to adequately carry anticipated loads.
    (3) Location of Existing Wells. It is recommended that this 
information be submitted on a map or plat and include all wells (water, 
injection or disposal, producing, and drilling) within a 1-mile radius 
of the proposed location.
    (4) Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities if Well is 
Productive.
    (i) On well pad--A map or plat shall be included showing, to the 
extent known or anticipated, the location of all production facilities 
and lines to be installed if the well is successfully completed for 
production.
    (ii) Off well pad--A map or plat shall be included showing to the 
extent known or anticipated, the existing or new production facilities 
to be utilized and the lines to be installed if the well is successfully 
completed

[[Page 174]]

for production. If new construction, the dimensions of the facility 
layout are to be shown.
    If the information required under (a) or (b) above is not known and 
cannot be accurately presented and the well subsequently is completed 
for production, the operator shall then comply with section IV of this 
Order.
    (5) Location and Type of Water Supply (Rivers, Creeks, Springs, 
Lakes, Ponds, and Wells). This information may be shown by quarter-
quarter section on a map or plat, or may be a written description. The 
source and transportation method for all water to be used in drilling 
the proposed well shall be noted if the source is located on Federal or 
Indian lands or if water is to be used from a Federal or Indian project. 
If the water is obtained from other than Federal or Indian lands, only 
the location need be identified. Any access roads crossing Federal or 
Indian lands that are needed to haul the water shall be described in 
items G.4.b. (1) and (2), as appropriate. If a water supply well is to 
be drilled on the lease, it shall be so stated under this item, and the 
authorized officer of the BLM may require the filing of a separate APD.
    (6) Construction Materials. The lessee or operator shall state the 
character and intended use of all construction materials such as sand, 
gravel, stone and soil material. If the materials to be used are 
Federally-owned, the proposed source shall be shown by either quarter-
quarter section on a map or plat, or a written description. The use of 
materials under BLM jurisdiction is governed by 43 CFR 3610.2-3. The 
authorized officer shall inform the lessee or operator if the materials 
may be used free of charge or if an application for sale is required. If 
the materials to be used are Indian owned or under the jurisdiction of 
any Surface Management Agency other than BLM, the specific tribe and or 
Area Superintendent of BIA, or the appropriate Surface Management Agency 
office shall be contacted to determine the appropriate procedure for use 
of the materials.
    (7) Methods for Handling Waste Disposal. A written description shall 
be given of the methods and locations proposed for safe containment and 
disposal of each type of waste material (e.g., cuttings, garbage, salts, 
chemicals, sewage, etc.) that results from the drilling of the proposed 
well. Likewise, the narrative shall include plans for the eventual 
disposal of drilling fluids and any produced oil or water recovered 
during testing operations.
    (8) Ancillary Facilities. The plans, or subsequent amendments to 
such plans, shall identify all ancillary facilities such as camps and 
airstrips as to their location, land area required, and the methods and 
standards to be employed in their construction. Such facilities shall be 
shown on a map or plat. The approximate center of proposed camps and the 
center line of airstrips shall be staked on the ground.
    (9) Well Site Layout. A plat of suitable scale (not less than 1 
inch=50 feet) showing the proposed drill pad and its location with 
respect to topographic features is required. Cross section diagrams of 
the drill pad showing any cuts and fills and the relation to topography 
are also required. The plat shall also include the approximate proposed 
location of the reserve and burn pits, access roads onto the pad, 
turnaround areas, parking area, living facilities, soil material 
stockpiles, and the orientation of the rig with respect to the pad and 
other facilities. Plans, if any to line the reserve pit should be 
detailed.
    (10) Plans for Reclamation of the Surface. The program for surface 
reclamation upon completion of the operation, such as configuration of 
the reshaped topography, drainage system, segregation of spoil 
materials, surface manipulations, waste disposal, revegetation methods, 
and soil treatments, plus other practices necessary to reclaim all 
disturbed areas, including any access roads or portions of well pads 
when no longer needed, shall be stated. An estimate of the time for 
commencement and completion of reclamation operations, dependent on 
weather conditions and other local uses of the area, shall be provided.
    (11) Surface Ownership. The surface ownership (Federal, Indian, 
State or private) at the well location, and for all lands crossed by 
roads which are to be constructed or upgraded, shall be indicated. Where 
the surface of the well site is privately owned, the operator shall 
provide the name, address, and telephone number of the surface owner, 
unless previously provided.
    (12) Other Information. The lessee or operator is encouraged to 
submit any additional information that may be helpful in processing the 
application.
    (13) Lessee's or Operator's Representative and Certification. The 
name, address, and telephone number of the lessee's or operator's field 
representative shall be included. The lessee or operator submitting the 
APD shall certify as follows:
    I hereby certify that I, or persons under my direct supervision, 
have inspected the proposed drill site and access route; that I am 
familiar with the conditions which currently exist; that the statements 
made in this plan are, to the best of my knowledge, true and correct; 
and that the work associated with operations proposed herein will be 
performed by ---------- and its contractors and subcontractors in 
conformity with this plan and the terms and conditions under which it is 
approved. This statement is subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001 
for the filing of a false statement.

notified of approved practices in writing. Such notice shall state that 
the landowner can begin implementing approved practices.


<R05>
Sec. 230.9  Payment to landowners.

    (a) To be eligible for cost-share payments, a landowner must 
complete each practice within eighteen months of approval. However, if 
practice(s) are not completed in eighteen months due to conditions 
beyond the landowner's control, a six month extension period may be 
granted by the Service Representative.
    (b) Upon certification by the Service Representative that a practice 
has been completed in accordance with specifications, the federal cost-
share payment will be calculated and disbursed to the landowner. Service 
Representatives shall have the right of access to the landowner's 
property to inspect practices for the duration of the practice 
maintenance period.
    (c) The amount of payment under the Program to any one landowner 
shall not exceed $10,000 in any given fiscal year. For each landowner 
participating in the Program, the payment limitation shall apply as 
follows:
    (1) Where husband and wife hold joint ownership, they shall be 
considered as a single landowner.
    (2) Where any number of individuals hold common ownership, they 
shall be considered as a single landowner.
    (3) Where the individual is a partner, corporate shareholder, or has 
an ownership interest in another private legal entity, the amount of 
payment to the individual shall be equivalent to the percentage of 
ownership the individual holds in such partnership, corporation or other 
private legal entity times the payment made to such partnership, 
corporation or other legal entity.
    (d) Levels of federal cost-share funds to be paid to landowners 
shall be set by the State Forester, but shall not exceed 75 percent of 
the actual costs incurred by a participating landowner. Non-Federal 
program funds and other donated assistance may be used to supplement 
cost-share assistance under the Program; however, the total of all funds 
and assistance shall not exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of 
practice implementation.
    (e) A practice may consist of one or more component activities. A 
landowner may receive partial payment for completed components on the 
condition that the landowner agrees to complete the remaining 
component(s) of the practice within the time period specified by the 
Service Representative, not to exceed eighteen months following approval 
to implement the practice, unless an extension is justified as provided 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Where performance actually rendered does not meet the minimum 
specifications of a practice due to factors beyond the landowner's 
control, the State Forester or designee may approve cost-share payment 
under one of the following conditions:
    (1) The landowner repeats applications of components previously 
implemented or establishes additional eligible components under such 
terms and conditions as the Service Representative may require, in which 
case, the State Forester shall approve additional cost-sharing for 
additional or repeated components to the extent such measures are needed 
to meet the objectives of the landowner forest stewardship plan; or

[[Page 181]]

    (2) The landowner establishes to the satisfaction of the Service 
Representative that:
    (i) A reasonable effort was made to meet the minimum requirements; 
and
    (ii) The practice, as performed, adequately meets the objectives of 
the landowner forest stewardship plan.
    (g) Where the landowner has received cost-share assistance for site 
preparation and the establishment of trees has been unsuccessful due to 
factors beyond the landowner's control, the Service Representative shall 
require that trees be re-established and shall approve cost-share 
assistance for such activity.
    (h) If a landowner sells, conveys, or otherwise loses control of 
lands upon which there is a continuing obligation to maintain a practice 
and the new landowner does not agree to assume the responsibility for 
maintaining the practice, the landowner who was originally obligated to 
maintain the practice shall be liable to reimburse the United States for 
all cost-share payments on such practices.
    (i) In case of death or incompetency of any landowner, the State 
Forester shall approve cost-share payments to the successor if the 
successor agrees to maintain the practices for the duration of the 
required maintenance period.
    (j) Any landowner who may be entitled to any cost-share payment 
under this subpart may assign the right thereto, in whole or in part, 
under the following terms:
    (1) Payments may be assigned only for performance of a Program 
practice.
    (2) A payment which is made to a landowner may not be assigned to 
pay or secure any preexisting debt.
    (3) Neither the United States, the Forest Service, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, nor any disbursing agent shall be liable in any suit if 
payment is made to an assignor rather than to an assignee, and nothing 
in this section shall be construed to authorize any suit against the 
United States, the Forest Service, the Secretary or any disbursing agent 
if payment is not made to the assignee, or if payment is made to only 
one of several assignees.
    (k) No cost-share payment or portion thereof due and owing any 
landowner shall be subject to any claim arising under State law by any 
creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.


<R05>
Sec. 230.10  Prohibitions.

    (a) No cost-share funds shall be paid for the following:
    (1) Costs incurred before an application for cost-share assistance 
is approved;
    (2) The implementation of any practice(s) already required by law, 
regulation, or other authority; and
    (3) Repairs or normal upkeep or maintenance of any practice.
    (b) No cost-share assistance shall be paid for repeating practices 
on the same site by the same landowner which have been implemented under 
the Forestry Incentives Program (16 U.S.C. 2104) or any other Federal, 
State, or local government programs, or private sector programs, except 
where such practices are repeated due to a failure of a prior practice 
without fault of the landowner.


<R05>
Sec. 230.11  Recapture of payment.

    (a) If any landowner, successor, or assignee uses any scheme or 
device to unjustly benefit from this program, the cost-share funds shall 
be withheld or a refund of all or part of any Program payments otherwise 
due or paid that person shall be secured. A scheme or device includes, 
but is not limited to, coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, false 
claims, or any business dissolution, reorganization, revival, or other 
legal mechanism designed for or having the effect of evading the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (b) If any landowner or successor takes any action or fails to take 
action which results in the destruction or impairment of a prescribed 
practice for the duration of the practice, cost-share funds shall be 
withheld or a recapture of all or part of any Program payments otherwise 
due or paid shall be secured based on the extent and effect of 
destruction and impairment.
    (c) Nothing in this section requiring the withholding or refunding 
of cost-share funds shall preclude any penalty or liability otherwise 
imposed by law.

    Source: 65 FR 57549, Sept. 25, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 230.20  Scope and authority.

    The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is authorized by 
Section 9 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, as amended 
(16 U.S.C. 2105). The scope of this authority includes the provision of 
technical, financial, and related assistance to State and local 
governments, non-profits, and other members of the public to: maintain, 
expand, and preserve forest and tree cover; expand research and 
education efforts related to trees and forest cover; enhance technical 
skills and understanding of tree maintenance and practices involving 
cultivation of trees, shrubs and complementary ground covers; and 
implementing a tree planting program to complement urban tree 
maintenance and open space programs. The Secretary has delegated the 
authority for implementing the program to the Chief of the Forest 
Service under 7 CFR 2.60(a)(16).


<R05>
Sec. 230.21  Implementation of the program.

    (a) The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is 
implemented through the Forest Service Grants, Cooperative Agreements, 
and Other Agreements Program (FSM 1580) and the Grants, Cooperative 
Agreements, and Other Agreements Handbook (FSH 1509.11). The Forest 
Service Manual and Handbook are available from the Forest Service 
internet homepage or at National Forest offices.
    (b) The Forest Service, under the authority of the Cooperative 
Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 and through the Urban and Community 
Forestry Assistance Program, coordinates financial, technical, and 
related assistance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service for 
the Urban Resources Partnership initiative. The Natural Resources 
Conservation Service provides similar assistance through the Urban 
Resources Partnership initiative under the authority of the Soil 
Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a-590f). The Urban 
Resources Partnership is an initiative in which Federal agencies, in 
cooperation with State and local agencies, community groups, and non-
governmental organizations endeavor to be more effective, responsive, 
and efficient in working together to protect, improve, and rehabilitate 
the environment in urban areas of the Nation. The Forest Service and 
Natural Resources Conservation Service implement the Urban Resources 
Partnership initiative under the ``Urban Resources Partnership National 
Guidance for U.S. Department of Agriculture Personnel'' and applicable 
agency and departmental procedures for Federal grants and cooperative 
agreements. Copies of the Guidance may be obtained from the Cooperative 
Forestry Staff, Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 
20090-6090.

Sec. 230.40  Eligible practices for cost-share assistance.

    (a) The State priority plan must document and describe which of the 
following eleven categories will be made available to landowners for 
cost-share funding:
    (1) Management Plan Development--Development or revision of a 
management plan that must meet the minimum standards of a Forest 
Stewardship Plan (16 U.S.C. 2103a(f)(i)). The plan applies to those 
portions of the landowner's property on which any practice or activity 
funded under FLEP shall be carried out, as well as any property of the 
owner that may be affected by the activity or practice. Management plans 
are not subject to any acreage limits, and therefore cost-sharing such a 
plan under FLEP is exempt from the 1,000-acre (or 5,000-acre) limit

[[Page 188]]

unless restricted as described in the State priority plan.
    (2) Afforestation and Reforestation--Site preparation, planting, 
seeding, or other practices to encourage natural regeneration or to 
ensure forest establishment and carbon sequestration.
    (3) Forest Stand Improvement--Practices to enhance growth and 
quality of wood fiber, special forest products, and carbon 
sequestration.
    (4) Agroforestry Implementation--Establishment, maintenance, and 
renovation of windbreaks, riparian forest buffers, silvopasture, alley 
cropping, or other agroforestry practices, including purposes for energy 
conservation and carbon sequestration in conjunction with agriculture, 
forest, and other land uses.
    (5) Water Quality Improvement and Watershed Protection--
Establishment, maintenance, renovation, and restoration practices, 
including any necessary design and engineering to improve and protect 
water quality, riparian areas, and forest wetlands and watersheds.
    (6) Fish and Wildlife Habitat Improvement--Establishment, 
maintenance, and restoration practices to create, protect, or improve 
fish and wildlife habitat, including any necessary design and 
engineering.
    (7) Forest Health and Protection--Establishment of practices 
primarily to detect, monitor, assess, protect, improve, or restore 
forest health, including detection and control of insects, diseases, and 
animal damage to established stands.
    (8) Invasive Species Control--Establishment, maintenance and 
restoration practices primarily to detect, monitor, eradicate, or 
control the spread of invasive species.
    (9) Wildfire and Catastrophic Risk Reduction--Establishment of 
practices primarily to reduce the risk from wildfire and other 
catastrophic natural events.
    (10) Wildfire and Catastrophic Event Rehabilitation--Establishment 
of practices primarily to restore and rehabilitate forests following 
wildfire and other catastrophic natural events.
    (11) Special Practices--Establishment, maintenance, and restoration 
practices addressing other conservation concerns on nonindustrial 
private forest lands as proposed by the State Forester and the 
Committee, which must have concurrence by the responsible official.
    (b) A practice may consist of one or more components.


<R05>
Sec. 230.41  Eligibility requirements for cost-share assistance.

    (a) All landowners of nonindustrial private forest land as defined 
in Sec. 230.31 of this subpart, including those who engage in primary 
processing of raw wood products on a part-time or intermittent basis and 
who otherwise meet the requirements of this section, are eligible to 
apply for and receive assistance under FLEP without regard to race, 
color, religion, national origin, age, sex, disability, political 
affiliation, sexual orientation, or marital or family status.
    (b) A landowner is eligible to receive funds under the cost-share 
element of FLEP for treatment of not more than a total of 1,000 acres of 
land annually, except where a State Forester, with the concurrence of a 
responsible official, determines that significant public benefits would 
accrue from approval of a landowner's treating up to 5,000 acres 
annually. In making a determination of significant public benefits, the 
State Forester and the responsible official shall consider, at a 
minimum, whether landowners who treat more than 1,000 acres annually can 
achieve cost-effective resource management objectives without unduly 
excluding FLEP participation of other eligible landowners.
    (c) In order to meet the following minimum requirements to be 
eligible to receive cost-share through FLEP for all practices except 
development of a management plan, a landowner must:
    (1) Own the minimum acreage as established in the State priority 
plan; however, in no case shall the minimum acreage requirement be 
higher than 25 acres;
    (2) Agree to conduct land treatment(s) according to the landowner's 
practice plan and to maintain FLEP practices for a minimum of 10 years, 
unless the State Forester specifies a shorter duration. The 10-year 
lifespan does not apply to recurring practices such as prescribed 
burning, light

[[Page 189]]

disking in openings, herbicide application, and other practices that are 
identified as needed in the management plan and practice plan; and
    (3) Have a management plan submitted to the State Forester in which 
the lands are located that meets any requirements established by the 
State in its priority plan. Existing landowner management plans such as 
Tree Farm management plans, Forest Stewardship management plans, or 
similar plans may either meet, or can be amended to meet this 
requirement.
    (d) A leaseholder who has a long-term lease on the land to be 
treated through FLEP must provide a copy of the lease to the State 
Forester in order to be eligible to receive cost-share assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 230.42  Cost-share assistance application and payment procedures.

    (a) Landowner applications for cost-share payments shall not be 
approved unless cost-share funds are available. The obligation of funds 
upon approval of an application constitutes an agreement by the State 
and the landowner to cost-share a completed practice on a reimbursable 
basis when the service representative verifies that the practice has 
been implemented.
    (b) Upon receiving an application for an eligible FLEP practice and 
making a determination that funds are available, a service 
representative shall prepare a practice plan that identifies the needed 
practices, specifications, and performance period for the implementation 
of the practice(s) to achieve the objectives of the landowner. The 
requirements of a practice plan may be contained in a management plan. 
The practice plan is the basis for determining acceptable performance 
upon completion of the practice.
    (c) Upon approval of a FLEP application, the State Forester shall 
notify the landowner in writing. Such notice shall state that the 
landowner can begin implementing the approved practice(s) and that funds 
have been obligated for reimbursement of a specified amount of the total 
cost. Practice costs incurred before approval are not eligible unless 
authorized by the State Forester. The notice shall also state that 
payment shall be made upon the service representative's verification 
that the practice has been implemented in accordance with the 
specifications of the practice plan and activities described in the 
management plan.
    (d) Any landowner who carries out practices under FLEP shall be 
responsible for obtaining the authorities, rights, easements, or other 
approvals necessary to the performance and maintenance of the practices 
in keeping with applicable laws and regulations.
    (e) To be eligible for cost-share reimbursement payment, a landowner 
must complete each practice within the performance period specified in 
the State priority plan, not to exceed 24 months. However, if 
practice(s) are not completed within the performance period specified, 
due to conditions beyond the landowner's control, the State Forester may 
grant an extension for a time period specified in the State priority 
plan, not to exceed 12 months.
    (f) Upon certification by the service representative that a practice 
has been completed in accordance with the practice plan, the cost-share 
payment shall be calculated and disbursed to the landowner. Landowners 
must provide to service representatives the right of access to the 
landowner's property to inspect practices for the duration of the 
maintenance period for the practices.
    (g) The maximum aggregate amount of cost-share payment under FLEP to 
any one landowner shall not exceed $100,000 through 2007, with the 
following exception for Alaska Indian Tribes. The Alaska State Forester, 
in consultation with the State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee 
and the Responsible Official, shall establish the maximum aggregate 
payment to any one Alaska Indian Tribe, however, the 1,000- and 5,000-
acre limits shall apply.
    (h) The State priority plan shall set the levels of cost-share 
assistance to be paid to landowners, not to exceed 75 percent of the 
total costs incurred by a participating landowner. Non-Federal program 
funds and other donated assistance may be used to supplement cost-share 
through FLEP; however, the total of all funds and assistance shall not 
exceed 100 percent of the total cost

[[Page 190]]

of practice implementation, and the Federal share of the total cost 
shall be reduced by any gross revenue from any material sold as a result 
of the cost-share practice.
    (i) States may use the cost-share rate to define priority practices 
and priority areas by reserving the maximum rate of 75 percent of the 
total costs for the practices and areas having the highest priority.
    (j) State priorities for cost-share shall reflect the national 
priorities as listed in the Forest Service Manual Chapter 3310.
    (k) Other priorities may be developed by the State Forester in 
consultation with the State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee.
    (l) A landowner may receive partial payment, if allowed in the State 
priority plan, for completed components on the condition that the 
landowner agrees to complete the remaining components of the practice 
within the performance period specified in the practice plan.
    (m) Where performance actually rendered does not meet the minimum 
specifications of a practice due to factors beyond the landowner's 
control, the State Forester may approve cost-share payments under one of 
the following conditions:
    (1) The landowner repeats application of practices previously 
implemented or establishes additional eligible practices under such 
terms and conditions as the service representative may require, in which 
case the State Forester may approve cost-share payments for additional 
or repeated practices to the extent such measures are needed to meet the 
objectives of the management plan; or
    (2) The landowner establishes, to the satisfaction of the service 
representative that:
    (i) A reasonable effort was made to meet the minimum requirements; 
and
    (ii) The practice, as performed, adequately meets the objectives of 
the practice plan.
    (n) In case of death or incompetence of any landowner, the State 
Forester shall approve cost-share payments to the successor in title or 
other persons or entities in control of the landowner property if they 
agree to maintain the practices for the duration of the required 
maintenance period.
    (o) Any landowner who may be entitled to a cost-share payment under 
this subpart may assign the right thereto, in whole or in part, under 
the following terms:
    (1) Payments may be assigned only for performance of a FLEP 
practice;
    (2) A payment that is made to a landowner may not be assigned to pay 
or secure any preexisting debt; and
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize suit 
against the United States, the Department of Agriculture, the Forest 
Service, any State or any disbursing agent acting on their behalf, if 
payment is made to an assignor rather than to an assignee or if payment 
is made to only one of several assignees.
    (p) No financial assistance or portion thereof due and owing to any 
landowner shall be subject to any claim arising under State or other law 
by any creditor, except for claims of agencies of the United States 
Government.
    (q) Prior to receiving approval to implement any FLEP practice 
identified in the State priority plan, except for management plan 
development, eligible landowners shall have an approved practice plan 
providing appropriate technical standards concerning the performance of 
the requested practice(s). A service representative shall approve the 
plan. In reviewing and approving plans, to the extent deemed applicable 
by the service representative, existing landowner management plans such 
as Tree Farm management plans, Forest Stewardship management plans, or 
similar plans may either meet, or can be amended to meet, the practice 
plan requirements under FLEP.


<R05>
Sec. 230.43  Cost-share assistance--prohibited practices.

    (a) Cost-share payments for the following are prohibited:

<R05>
Sec. 242.5  Eligibility for subsistence use.

    (a) You may take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence 
uses only if you are an Alaska resident of a rural area or rural 
community. The regulations in this part may further limit your 
qualifications to harvest fish or wildlife resources for subsistence 
uses. If you are not an Alaska resident or are a resident of a non-rural 
area or community listed in Sec. 242.23, you may not take fish or 
wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in 
this part.
    (b) Where the Board has made a customary and traditional use 
determination regarding subsistence use of a specific fish stock or 
wildlife population, in accordance with, and as listed in, Sec. 242.24, 
only those Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities 
designated by the Board are eligible for subsistence taking of that 
population or stock on public lands for subsistence uses under the 
regulations in this part. If you do not live in one of those areas or 
communities, you may not take fish or wildlife from that population or 
stock, on public lands under the regulations in this part.
    (c) Where customary and traditional use determinations for a fish 
stock or wildlife population within a specific area have not yet been 
made by the Board (e.g., ``no determination''), all Alaskans who are 
residents of rural areas or communities may harvest for subsistence from 
that stock or population under the regulations in this part.
    (d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility 
of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National 
Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and 
National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.


<R05>
Sec. 242.6  Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports.

    (a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for 
subsistence uses, you must be an eligible rural Alaska resident and:
    (1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping 
licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish, but you must be 
an Alaska resident) unless Federal licenses are required or unless 
otherwise provided for in subpart D of this part;
    (2) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent Federal 
permits (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated 
Harvester Permit) required by subpart D of this part; and

[[Page 199]]

    (3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, 
harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these 
documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the 
requirements in subpart D of this part.
    (b) In order to receive a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or 
Federal Designated Harvester Permit or designate someone to harvest fish 
or wildlife for you under a Federal Designated Harvester Permit, you 
must be old enough to reasonably harvest that species yourself (or under 
the guidance of an adult).
    (c) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you 
must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must 
comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this 
section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in 
subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and 
transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal 
law enforcement agent, you must also produce any licenses, permits, 
harvest tickets, tags, or other documents required by this section. If 
you are engaged in taking fish and wildlife under the regulations in 
this part, you must allow State or Federal law enforcement agents to 
inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or capable of being used to 
take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife in your possession.
    (d) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other 
required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You 
must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D 
of this part.
    (e) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, 
you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations 
specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required 
by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for 
particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a 
specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is 
a violation of the regulations in this part. Community harvests are 
reviewed annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.
    (f) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State 
licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an 
incorrect harvest report.

<R05>
Sec. 242.7  Restriction on use.

    (a) You may not use fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant 
to the regulations in this part, unless provided for in this part.
    (b) You may not exchange in customary trade or sell fish or wildlife 
or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless 
provided for in this part.
    (c) You may barter fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant 
to the regulations in this part, unless restricted in Secs. 242.25, 
242.26, 242.27, or 242.28.


<R05>
Sec. 242.8  Penalties.

    If you are convicted of violating any provision of 50 CFR Part 100 
or 36 CFR Part 242, you may be punished by a fine or by imprisonment in 
accordance with the penalty provisions applicable to the public land 
where the violation occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 242.9  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The rules in this part contain information collection 
requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval 
under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest 
activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be 
required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid 
OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.
    (1) Section 242.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and 
reports. The information collection requirements contained in Sec. 242.6 
(Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester 
Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not 
authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. Identity 
and location of residence are required to determine if you are eligible 
for a permit and a report of success

[[Page 200]]

is required after a harvest attempt. These requirements are not 
duplicative with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
The regulations in Sec. 242.6 require this information before a rural 
Alaska resident may engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The 
Department estimates that the average time necessary to obtain and 
comply with this permit information collection requirement is 0.25 
hours.
    (2) Section 242.20, Request for reconsideration. The information 
collection requirements contained in Sec. 242.20 provide a standardized 
process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the 
Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but 
required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a 
request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.
    (3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in 
this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State 
regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of 
Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible, and 
information gained from these reports is systematically available to 
Federal managers by routine computer access requiring less than 1 hour.
    (b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other 
aspect of the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, N.W., MS 222 ARLSQ, 
Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, 
Paperwork Reduction Project (Subsistence), Washington, D.C. 20503. 
Additional information requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory 
Committees or additional Regional Councils, subject to the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B of this 
part. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to 
their implementation.

each Regional Council.
    (e) Relationship to Regional Councils. (1) The Board shall consider 
the reports and recommendations of the Regional Councils concerning the 
taking of fish and wildlife on public lands within their respective 
regions for subsistence uses. The Board may choose not to follow any 
Regional Council recommendation which it determines is not supported by 
substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and 
wildlife conservation, would be detrimental to the satisfaction of 
subsistence needs, or in closure situations, for reasons of public 
safety or administration or to assure the continued viability of a 
particular fish or wildlife population. If a recommendation is not 
adopted, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for 
the decision, in writing, in a timely fashion.
    (2) The Board shall provide available and appropriate technical

Sec. 242.15  Rural determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine if an area or community in Alaska is 
rural. In determining whether a specific area of Alaska is rural, the 
Board shall use the following guidelines:
    (1) A community or area with a population of 2,500 or less shall be 
deemed to be rural unless such a community or area possesses significant 
characteristics of a non-rural nature, or is considered to be socially 
and economically a part of an urbanized area.
    (2) Communities or areas with populations above 2,500 but not more 
than 7,000 will be determined to be rural or non-rural.
    (3) A community with a population of more than 7,000 shall be 
presumed non-rural, unless such a community or area possesses 
significant characteristics of a rural nature.
    (4) Population data from the most recent census conducted by the 
United States Bureau of Census as updated by the Alaska Department of 
Labor shall be utilized in this process.
    (5) Community or area characteristics shall be considered in 
evaluating a community's rural or non-rural status. The characteristics 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Use of fish and wildlife;
    (ii) Development and diversity of the economy;
    (iii) Community infrastructure;
    (iv) Transportation; and
    (v) Educational institutions.
    (6) Communities or areas which are economically, socially, and 
communally integrated shall be considered in the aggregate.
    (b) The Board shall periodically review rural determinations. Rural 
determinations shall be reviewed on a 10-year cycle, commencing with the 
publication of the year 2000 U.S. census. Rural determinations may be 
reviewed out-of-cycle in special circumstances. Once the Board makes a 
determination that a community has changed from rural to non-rural, a 
waiting period of 5 years shall be required before the

[[Page 205]]

non-rural determination becomes effective.
    (c) Current determinations are listed at Sec. 242.23.


<R05>
Sec. 242.16  Customary and traditional use determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine which fish stocks and wildlife 
populations have been customarily and traditionally used for 
subsistence. These determinations shall identify the specific 
community's or area's use of specific fish stocks and wildlife 
populations. For areas managed by the National Park Service, where 
subsistence uses are allowed, the determinations may be made on an 
individual basis.
    (b) A community or area shall generally exhibit the following 
factors, which exemplify customary and traditional use. The Board shall 
make customary and traditional use determinations based on application 
of the following factors:
    (1) A long-term consistent pattern of use, excluding interruptions 
beyond the control of the community or area;
    (2) A pattern of use recurring in specific seasons for many years;
    (3) A pattern of use consisting of methods and means of harvest 
which are characterized by efficiency and economy of effort and cost, 
conditioned by local characteristics;
    (4) The consistent harvest and use of fish or wildlife as related to 
past methods and means of taking; near, or reasonably accessible from, 
the community or area;
    (5) A means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing fish or 
wildlife which has been traditionally used by past generations, 
including consideration of alteration of past practices due to recent 
technological advances, where appropriate;
    (6) A pattern of use which includes the handing down of knowledge of 
fishing and hunting skills, values, and lore from generation to 
generation;
    (7) A pattern of use in which the harvest is shared or distributed 
within a definable community of persons; and
    (8) A pattern of use which relates to reliance upon a wide diversity 
of fish and wildlife resources of the area and which provides 
substantial cultural, economic, social, and nutritional elements to the 
community or area.
    (c) The Board shall take into consideration the reports and 
recommendations of any appropriate Regional Council regarding customary 
and traditional uses of subsistence resources.
    (d) Current determinations are listed in Sec. 242.24.


<R05>
Sec. 242.17  Determining priorities for subsistence uses among rural 
Alaska residents.

    (a) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the subsistence taking of 
fish and wildlife on public lands in order to protect the continued 
viability of such populations, or to continue subsistence uses, the 
Board shall establish a priority among the rural Alaska residents after 
considering any recommendation submitted by an appropriate Regional 
Council.
    (b) The priority shall be implemented through appropriate 
limitations based on the application of the following criteria to each 
area, community, or individual determined to have customary and 
traditional use, as necessary:
    (1) Customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the 
mainstay of livelihood;
    (2) Local residency; and
    (3) The availability of alternative resources.
    (c) If allocation on an area or community basis is not achievable, 
then the Board shall allocate subsistence opportunity on an individual 
basis through application of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(3) of this section.
    (d) In addressing a situation where prioritized allocation becomes 
necessary, the Board shall solicit recommendations from the Regional 
Council in the area affected.


<R05>
Sec. 242.18  Regulation adoption process.

    (a) Proposals for changes to the Federal subsistence regulations in 
subparts C or D of this part shall be accepted by the Board according to 
a published schedule. The Board may establish a rotating schedule for 
accepting proposals on various sections of subpart C or subpart D 
regulations over a period of years. The Board shall develop and publish 
proposed regulations

[[Page 206]]

in the Federal Register and publish notice in local newspapers. Comments 
on the proposed regulations in the form of proposals shall be 
distributed for public review.
    (1) Proposals shall be made available for at least a thirty (30) day 
review by the Regional Councils. Regional Councils shall forward their 
recommendations on proposals to the Board. Such proposals with 
recommendations may be submitted in the time period as specified by the 
Board or as a part of the Regional Council's annual report described in 
Sec. 242.11, whichever is earlier.
    (2) The Board shall publish notice throughout Alaska of the 
availability of proposals received.
    (3) The public shall have at least thirty (30) days to review and 
comment on proposals.
    (4) After the comment period the Board shall meet to receive public 
testimony and consider the proposals. The Board shall consider 
traditional use patterns when establishing harvest levels and seasons, 
and methods and means. The Board may choose not to follow any 
recommendation which the Board determines is not supported by 
substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and 
wildlife conservation, or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of 
subsistence needs. If a recommendation approved by a Regional Council is 
not adopted by the Board, the Board shall set forth the factual basis 
and the reasons for its decision in writing to the Regional Council.
    (5) Following consideration of the proposals the Board shall publish 
final regulations pertaining to subparts C and D of this part in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) Proposals for changes to subparts A and B of this part shall be 
accepted by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 
14.


<R05>
Sec. 242.19  Special actions.

    (a) The Board may restrict, close, or reopen the taking of fish and 
wildlife for non-subsistence uses on public lands when necessary to 
assure the continued viability of a particular fish or wildlife 
population, to continue subsistence uses of a fish or wildlife 
population, or for reasons of public safety or administration.
    (b) The Board may open, close, or restrict subsistence uses of a 
particular fish or wildlife population on public lands to assure the 
continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, to continue 
subsistence uses of a fish or wildlife population, or for reasons of 
public safety or administration.
    (c) The Board will accept a request for a change in seasons, methods 
and means, harvest limits and/or restrictions on harvest under this 
Sec. 242.19 only if there are extenuating circumstances necessitating a 
regulatory change before the next annual subpart D proposal cycle. 
Extenuating circumstances include unusual and significant changes in 
resource abundance or unusual conditions affecting harvest opportunities 
that could not reasonably have been anticipated and that potentially 
could have significant adverse effects on the health of fish and 
wildlife populations or subsistence uses. Requests for Special Action 
that do not meet these conditions will be rejected; however, a rejected 
Special Action request will be deferred, if appropriate, to the next 
annual regulatory proposal cycle for consideration, after coordination 
with the submitter. In general, changes to Customary and Traditional Use 
Determinations will only be considered through the annual subpart C 
proposal cycle.
    (d) In an emergency situation, the Board may immediately open, 
close, liberalize, or restrict subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on 
public lands, or close or restrict non-subsistence uses of fish and 
wildlife on public lands, if necessary to assure the continued viability 
of a fish or wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of fish 
or wildlife, or for public safety reasons. Prior to implementing an 
emergency action, the Board shall consult with the State. The emergency 
action shall be effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 
days, and may not be extended unless it is determined by the Board, 
after notice and public hearing, that such action should be extended. 
The Board shall, in a timely manner, provide notice via radio 
announcement or personal contact of the emergency action and shall

[[Page 207]]

publish notice and reasons justifying the emergency action in newspapers 
of any area affected, and in the Federal Register thereafter.
    (e) After consultation with the State, the appropriate Regional 
Advisory Council(s), and adequate notice and public hearing, the Board 
may make or direct a temporary change to close, open, or adjust the 
seasons, to modify the harvest limits, or to modify the methods and 
means of harvest for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife populations 
on public lands. An affected rural resident, community, Regional 
Council, or administrative agency may request a temporary change in 
seasons, harvest limits, or methods or means of harvest. In addition, a 
temporary change may be made only after the Board determines that the 
proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of 
healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the 
long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an 
unnecessary restriction on non-subsistence users. The decision of the 
Board shall be the final administrative action. The temporary change 
shall be effective when directed by the Board following notice in the 
affected area(s). This notice may include publication in newspapers or 
announcement on local radio stations. The Board shall publish notice and 
reasons justifying the temporary action in the Federal Register 
thereafter. The length of any temporary change shall be confined to the 
minimum time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be 
necessary to satisfy subsistence uses. A temporary opening or closure 
will not extend beyond the regulatory year for which it is promulgated.
    (f) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to direct 
temporary or emergency closures on public lands managed by the agency 
remain unaffected by the regulations in this part, which authorize the 
Board to make or direct restrictions, closures, or temporary changes for 
subsistence uses on public lands.
    (g) You may not take fish and wildlife in violation of a 
restriction, closure, opening, or temporary change authorized by the 
Board.

Sec. 242.20  Request for reconsideration.

    (a) Regulations in subparts C and D of this part published in the 
Federal Register are subject to requests for reconsideration.
    (b) Any aggrieved person may file a request for reconsideration with 
the Board.
    (c) To file a request for reconsideration, you must notify the Board 
in writing within sixty (60) days of the effective date or date of 
publication of the notice, whichever is earlier, for which 
reconsideration is requested.
    (d) It is your responsibility to provide the Board with sufficient 
narrative evidence and argument to show why the action by the Board 
should be reconsidered. The Board will accept a request for 
reconsideration only if it is based upon information not previously 
considered by the Board, demonstrates that the existing information used 
by the Board is incorrect, or demonstrates that the Board's 
interpretation of information, applicable law, or regulation is in error 
or contrary to existing law. You must include the following information 
in your request for reconsideration:
    (1) Your name, and mailing address;
    (2) The action which you request be reconsidered and the date of 
Federal Register publication of that action;
    (3) A detailed statement of how you are adversely affected by the 
action;
    (4) A detailed statement of the facts of the dispute, the issues 
raised by the request, and specific references to any law, regulation, 
or policy that you believe to be violated and your reason for such 
allegation;
    (5) A statement of how you would like the action changed.
    (e) Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Board shall 
transmit a copy of such request to any appropriate Regional Council and 
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) for review and 
recommendation. The Board shall consider any Regional Council and ADFG 
recommendations in making a final decision.
    (f) If the request is justified, the Board shall implement a final 
decision on a request for reconsideration after compliance with 5 U.S.C. 
551-559 (APA).

    (g) If the request is denied, the decision of the Board represents 
the final administrative action.

Sec. 242.24  Customary and traditional use determinations.

    (a) The Federal Subsistence Board has determined that rural Alaska 
residents of the listed communities, areas, and individuals have 
customary and traditional use of the specified species on Federal public 
land in the specified areas. Persons granted individual customary and 
traditional use determinations will be notified in writing by the Board. 
The Fish & Wildlife Service and the local NPS Superintendent will 
maintain the list of individuals having customary and traditional use on 
National Parks and Monuments. A copy of the list is available upon 
request. When there is a determination for specific communities or areas 
of residence in a Unit, all other communities not listed for that 
species in that Unit have no Federal subsistence priority for that 
species in that Unit. If no determination has been made for a species in 
a Unit, all rural Alaska residents are eligible to harvest fish or 
wildlife under this part.
    (1) Wildlife determinations. The rural Alaska residents of the 
listed communities and areas have a customary and traditional use of the 
specified species on Federal public lands within the listed areas:

[[Page 229]]

    (c) Wildlife taken in defense of life or property is not a 
subsistence use; wildlife so taken is subject to State regulations.

subsistence uses pursuant to the requirements of a trapping license are 
prohibited, in addition to the prohibitions listed at paragraph (b) of 
this section:

    (e) Possession and transportation of wildlife. (1) Except as 
specified in paragraph (e)(2) or (f)(1) of this section, or as otherwise 
provided, you may not take a species of wildlife in any Unit, or portion 
of a Unit, if your total take of that species already obtained anywhere 
in the State under Federal and State regulations equals or exceeds the 
harvest limit in that Unit.
    (2) An animal taken under Federal or State regulations by any member 
of a community with an established community harvest limit for that

regulations.
    (f) Harvest limits. (1) The harvest limit specified for a trapping 
season for a species and the harvest limit set for a hunting season for

you may take additional animals under the harvest limit specified for a 
hunting season or vice versa.

restricted to one sex in the local area, you may not possess or 
transport the carcass of an animal taken in that area unless sufficient 
portions of the external sex organs remain attached to indicate 
conclusively the sex of the animal, except in Units 11, 13, 19, 21, and 
24 where you may possess either sufficient portions of the external sex 
organs (still attached to a portion of the carcass) or the head (with or 
without antlers attached; however, the antler stumps must remain 
attached), to indicate the sex of the harvested moose; however, this 
paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has 
been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for 
consumption upon arrival at the location where it is to be consumed.
    (3) If a moose harvest limit requires an antlered bull, an antler 
size, or configuration restriction, you may not possess or transport the 
moose carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or 
its parts. If you possess a set of antlers with less than the required 
number of brow tines on one antler, you must leave the antlers naturally 
attached to the unbroken, uncut skull plate; however, this paragraph 
(g)(3) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have been

[[Page 230]]

butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption 
after arrival at the place where it is to be stored or consumed.

quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 
24 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or 
process it for human consumption. Meat of the front quarters, hind 
quarters, or ribs from a harvested moose or caribou may be processed for 
human consumption and consumed in the field; however, meat may not be 
removed from the bones for purposes of transport out of the field.
    (i) If you take an animal that has been marked or tagged for 
scientific studies, you must, within a reasonable time, notify the ADF&G 
or the agency identified on the collar or marker, when and where the 
animal was taken. You also must retain any ear tag, collar, radio, 
tattoo, or other identification with the hide until it is sealed, if

Brown Bear Management Area is removed from the area, you must first have 
it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Bethel, Dillingham, or McGrath; 
at the time of sealing, the ADF&G representative shall remove and retain 
the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.
    (iii) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in the 
Northwestern Alaska Brown Bear Management Area from the area or present 
it for commercial tanning within the Management Area, you must first

    (l) If you take a species listed in paragraph (k) of this section 
but are unable to present the skin in person, you must complete and sign 
a temporary sealing form and ensure that the completed temporary sealing 
form and skin are presented to an authorized representative of ADF&G for 
sealing consistent with requirements listed in paragraph (k) of this 
section.
    (m) You may take wildlife, outside of established season or harvest 
limits, for food in traditional religious ceremonies, that are part of a 
funerary or mortuary cycle, including memorial potlatches, under the 
following provisions:
    (1) The harvest does not violate recognized principles of wildlife 
conservation and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular 
species published in the applicable Federal regulations. The appropriate 
Federal land manager will establish the number, species, sex, or 
location of harvest, if necessary, for conservation purposes. Other 
regulations relating to ceremonial harvest may be found in the unit-
specific regulations in Sec. 242.26(n).

must include the species, harvest location, and number of animals 
expected to be taken.
    (ii) Immediately after the wildlife is taken, the tribal chief, 
village council president or designee, or other Federally qualified

maintain these records including the name of the decedent for whom the 
ceremony will be held. If requested, this information must be available 
to an authorized representative of the Federal land manager.
    (iii) The tribal chief, village council president or designee, or 
other Federally qualified subsistence user outside of the village in

[68 FR 38479, June 27, 2003]

    Effective Date Note: At 68 FR 38479, June 27, 2003, Sec. 242.26 was 
added, effective July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004.


<R05>
Sec. 242.27  Subsistence taking of fish.

    (a) Applicability. (1) Regulations in this section apply to the 
taking of fish or their parts for subsistence uses.
    (2) You may take fish for subsistence uses at any time by any method 
unless you are restricted by the subsistence

[[Page 272]]

fishing regulations found in this section. The harvest limit specified 
in this section for a subsistence season for a species and the State 
harvest limit set for a State season for the same species are not 
cumulative. This means that if you have taken the harvest limit for a 
particular species under a subsistence season specified in this section, 
you may not, after that, take any additional fish of that species under 
any other harvest limit specified for a State season.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Methods, means, and general restrictions. (1) Unless otherwise 
specified in this section or under terms of a required subsistence 
fishing permit (as may be modified by this section), you may use the 
following legal types of gear for subsistence fishing:
    (i) A set gillnet;
    (ii) A drift gillnet;
    (iii) A purse seine;
    (iv) A hand purse seine;
    (v) A beach seine;
    (vi) Troll gear;
    (vii) A fish wheel;
    (viii) A trawl;
    (ix) A pot;
    (x) A longline;
    (xi) A fyke net;
    (xii) A lead;
    (xiii) A herring pound;
    (xiv) A dip net;
    (xv) Jigging gear;
    (xvi) A mechanical jigging machine;
    (xvii) A handline;
    (xviii) A cast net;
    (xix) A rod and reel; and
    (xx) A spear.
    (2) You must include an escape mechanism on all pots used to take 
fish or shellfish. The escape mechanisms are as follows:
    (i) A sidewall, which may include the tunnel, of all shellfish and 
bottomfish pots must contain an opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches 
in length, except that in shrimp pots the opening must be a minimum of 6 
inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together 
by a single length of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine, no larger 
than 30 thread. The cotton twine may be knotted at each end only. The 
opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be 
parallel with it. The cotton twine may not be tied or looped around the 
web bars. Dungeness crab pots may have the pot lid tie-down straps 
secured to the pot at one end by a single loop of untreated, 100 percent 
cotton twine no larger than 60 thread, or the pot lid must be secured so 
that, when the twine degrades, the lid will no longer be securely 
closed;
    (ii) All king crab, Tanner crab, shrimp, miscellaneous shellfish and 
bottomfish pots may, instead of complying with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section, satisfy the following: a sidewall, which may include the 
tunnel, must contain an opening at least 18 inches in length, except 
that shrimp pots must contain an opening at least 6 inches in length. 
The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length 
of treated or untreated twine, no larger than 36 thread. A galvanic 
timed release device, designed to release in no more than 30 days in 
salt water, must be integral to the length of twine so that, when the 
device releases, the twine will no longer secure or obstruct the opening 
of the pot. The twine may be knotted only at each end and at the 
attachment points on the galvanic timed release device. The opening must 
be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with 
it. The twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars.
    (3) For subsistence fishing for salmon, you may not use a gillnet 
exceeding 50 fathoms in length, unless otherwise specified in this 
section. The gillnet web must contain at least 30 filaments of equal 
diameter or at least 6 filaments, each of which must be at least 0.20 
millimeter in diameter.
    (4) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, you may not 
obstruct more than one-half the width of any stream with any gear used 
to take fish for subsistence uses.
    (5) You may not use live non-indigenous fish as bait.
    (6) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly 
and legibly inscribed on the side of your fishwheel facing midstream of 
the river.
    (7) You may use kegs or buoys of any color but red on any permitted 
gear.

[[Page 273]]

    (8) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly 
and legibly inscribed on each keg, buoy, stakes attached to gillnets, 
stakes identifying gear fished under the ice, and any other unattended 
fishing gear which you use to take fish for subsistence uses.
    (9) You may not use explosives or chemicals to take fish for 
subsistence uses.
    (10) You may not take fish for subsistence uses within 300 feet of 
any dam, fish ladder, weir, culvert or other artificial obstruction, 
unless otherwise indicated.
    (11) Transactions between rural residents. Rural residents may 
exchange in customary trade subsistence-harvested fish, their parts, or 
their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash 
from other rural residents. The Board may recognize regional differences 
and define customary trade differently for separate regions of the 
State.
    (12) Transactions between a rural resident and others. In customary 
trade, a rural resident may trade fish, their parts, or their eggs, 
legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from 
individuals other than rural residents if the individual who purchases 
the fish, their parts, or their eggs uses them for personal or family 
consumption. If you are not a rural resident, you may not sell fish, 
their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part. The 
Board may recognize regional differences and define customary trade 
differently for separate regions of the State.
    (13) No sale to, nor purchase by, fisheries businesses. (i) You may 
not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in 
this part to any individual, business, or organization required to be 
licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute, AS 43.75.011 or 
to any other business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1) as 
part of its business transactions.
    (ii) If you are required to be licensed as a fisheries business 
under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 or are a business as defined under 
Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1), you may not purchase, receive, or sell 
fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this 
part as part of your business transactions.
    (14) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, you may not take 
rainbow/steelhead trout.
    (15) You may not use fish taken for subsistence use or under 
subsistence regulations in this part as bait for commercial or sport 
fishing purposes.
    (16) You may not accumulate harvest limits authorized in this 
section or Sec. 242.28 with harvest limits authorized under State 
regulations.
    (17) Unless specified otherwise in this section, you may use a rod 
and reel to take fish without a subsistence fishing permit. Harvest 
limits applicable to the use of a rod and reel to take fish for 
subsistence uses shall be as follows:
    (i) If you are required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for 
an area, that permit is required to take fish for subsistence uses with 
rod and reel in that area. The harvest and possession limits for taking 
fish with a rod and reel in those areas are the same as indicated on the 
permit issued for subsistence fishing with other gear types;
    (ii) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, if you are 
not required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for an area, the 
harvest and possession limits for taking fish for subsistence uses with 
a rod and reel are the same as for taking fish under State of Alaska 
subsistence fishing regulations in those same areas. If the State does 
not have a specific subsistence season and/or harvest limit for that 
particular species, the limit shall be the same as for taking fish under 
State of Alaska sport fishing regulations.
    (18) Unless restricted in this section, or unless restricted under 
the terms of a subsistence fishing permit, you may take fish for 
subsistence uses at any time.
    (19) Provisions on ADF&G subsistence fishing permits that are more 
restrictive or in conflict with the provisions contained in this section 
do not apply to Federal subsistence users.
    (20) You may not intentionally waste or destroy any subsistence-
caught fish or shellfish; however, you may use for

[[Page 274]]

bait or other purposes, whitefish, herring, and species for which 
harvest limits, seasons, or other regulatory methods and means are not 
provided in this section, as well as the head, tail, fins, and viscera 
of legally-taken subsistence fish.
    (21) The taking of fish from Federal waters is authorized outside of 
published open seasons or harvest limits if the harvested fish will be 
used for food in traditional or religious ceremonies, that are part of 
funerary or mortuary cycles, including memorial potlatches, provided 
that:
    (i) Prior to attempting to take fish, the person (or designee) or 
Tribal Government organizing the ceremony contacts the appropriate 
Federal fisheries manager to provide the nature of the ceremony, the 
parties and/or clans involved, the species and the number of fish to be 
taken, and the Federal waters from which the harvest will occur;
    (ii) The taking does not violate recognized principles of fisheries 
conservation, and uses the methods and means allowable for the 
particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations (the 
Federal fisheries manager will establish the number, species, or place 
of taking if necessary for conservation purposes);
    (iii) Each person who takes fish under this section must, as soon as 
practical, and not more than 15 days after the harvest, submit a written 
report to the appropriate Federal fisheries manager, specifying the 
harvester's name and address, the number and species of fish taken, and 
the date and locations of the taking; and
    (iv) No permit is required for taking under this section; however, 
the harvester must be eligible to harvest the resource under Federal 
regulations.
    (d) Fishing by designated harvest permit. (1) Any species of fish 
that may be taken by subsistence fishing under this part may be taken 
under a designated harvest permit.
    (2) If you are a Federally-qualified subsistence user, you 
(beneficiary) may designate another Federally-qualified subsistence user 
to take fish on your behalf. The designated fisherman must obtain a 
designated harvest permit prior to attempting to harvest fish and must 
return a completed harvest report. The designated fisherman may fish for 
any number of beneficiaries but may have no more than two harvest limits 
in his/her possession at any one time.
    (3) The designated fisherman must have in possession a valid 
designated harvest permit when taking, attempting to take, or 
transporting fish taken under this section, on behalf of a beneficiary.
    (4) The designated fisherman may not fish with more than one legal 
limit of gear.
    (5) You may not designate more than one person to take or attempt to 
take fish on your behalf at one time. You may not personally take or 
attempt to take fish at the same time that a designated fisherman is 
taking or attempting to take fish on your behalf.
    (e) Fishing permits and reports. (1) You may take salmon only under 
the authority of a subsistence fishing permit, unless a permit is 
specifically not required in a particular area by the subsistence 
regulations in this part, or unless you are retaining salmon from your 
commercial catch consistent with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Subsistence 
Management may issue a permit to harvest fish for a qualifying cultural/
educational program to an organization that has been granted a Federal 
subsistence permit for a similar event within the previous 5 years. A 
qualifying program must have instructors, enrolled students, minimum 
attendance requirements, and standards for successful completion of the 
course. Applications must be submitted to the Office of Subsistence 
Management 60 days prior to the earliest desired date of harvest. 
Permits will be issued for no more than 25 fish per culture/education 
camp. Appeal of a rejected request can be made to the Federal 
Subsistence Board. Application for an initial permit for a qualifying 
cultural/educational program, for a permit when the circumstances have 
changed significantly, when no permit has been issued within the 
previous 5 years, or when there is a request for harvest in excess of 
that provided in this paragraph (e)(2), will be considered by the 
Federal Subsistence Board.

[[Page 275]]

    (3) If a subsistence fishing permit is required by this section, the 
following permit conditions apply unless otherwise specified in this 
section:
    (i) You may not take more fish for subsistence use than the limits 
set out in the permit;
    (ii) You must obtain the permit prior to fishing;

location and date of catch, and other such information as may be 
required for management or conservation purposes; and
    (v) If the return of catch information necessary for management and 
conservation purposes is required by a fishing permit and you fail to 
comply with such reporting requirements, you are ineligible to receive a 
subsistence permit for that activity during the following calendar year, 
unless you demonstrate that failure to report was due to loss in the 
mail, accident, sickness, or other unavoidable circumstances. You must 
also return any tags or transmitters that have been attached to fish for 
management and conservation purposes.
    (f) Relation to commercial fishing activities. (1) If you are a 
Federally-qualified subsistence user who also commercial fishes, you may 
retain fish for subsistence purposes from your lawfully-taken commercial 
catch.

Sec. 251.9  Management of Municipal Watersheds.

    (a) The Forest Service shall manage National Forest watersheds that 
supply municipal water under multiple use prescriptions in forest plans 
(36 CFR part 219). When a municipality desires protective actions or 
restrictions of use not specified in the forest plan, within agreements, 
and/or special use authorizations, the municipality must apply to the 
Forest Service for consideration of these needs.
    (b) When deemed appropriate by the Regional Forester, requested 
restrictions and/or requirements shall be incorporated in the forest 
plan without written agreements. Written agreements with municipalities 
to assure protection of water supplies are appropriate when requested by 
the municipality and deemed necessary by the Regional Forester. A 
special use authorization may be needed to effect these agreements.
    (c) In preparing any municipal watershed agreement for approval by 
the Regional Forester or issuing special use authorization to protect 
municipal water supplies, the authorized forest officer shall specify 
the types of uses, if any, to be restricted; the nature and extent of 
any restrictions; any special land management protective measures and/or 
any necesary standards and guidelines needed to protect water quality or 
quantity; and any resources that are to be provided by the municipality.
    (d) A special use authorization (36 CFR 251.54) is required if the 
municipality is to use the subject lands, restrict public access, or 
control resource uses within the watershed. Special use authorizations 
issued pursuant to this section are subject to the same fee waivers, 
conditions, and procedures applicable to all other special uses as set 
forth in subpart B of this part.
    (e) Any municipal wateshed management agreements, special use 
authorizations, requirements, and/or restrictions shall be consistent 
with forest plans, or amendments and revisions thereto.

Sec. 251.11  Governing mining locations under the mining laws of the 
United States within that portion of the Black Hills National Forest, 
State of South 
          Dakota, designated as the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve.

    (a) Whoever locates a mining claim within the Norbeck Wildlife 
Preserve must, within 10 days after posting the location notice upon 
such claim, file a true copy of such location notice with the Forest 
Supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest at Custer, South Dakota, 
and further, within 10 days after said location notice is filed for 
record pursuant to the State laws of South Dakota, a true copy of the 
recorded location certificate must be filed with said Forest Supervisor.
    (b) All mining locators shall in all developments and operations 
make all reasonable provisions for the disposal of tailings, dumpage, 
and other deleterious materials or substances in such manner as to 
prevent obstruction, pollution, or deterioration of the land, streams, 
ponds, lakes, or springs, as may be directed by the Forest Supervisor.
    (c) All slash resulting from cutting or destruction of forest growth 
incident and necessary to mining operations must be disposed of as 
directed by the Forest Supervisor.
    (d) The cutting and removal of timber, except where clearing is 
necessary in connection with mining operations or to provide space for 
buildings or structures used in connection with mining operations, shall 
be conducted in accordance with the marking rules and timber sale 
practices applicable to the Black Hills National Forest, and such 
cutting and removal of timber shall be as directed by the Forest 
Supervisor.
    (e) No use of the surface of a mining claim or the resources 
therefrom not reasonably required for carrying on mining and prospecting 
shall be allowed, except under the National Forest rules and 
regulations, nor shall the locator prevent or obstruct other occupancy 
of the surface or use of surface resources under authority of National 
Forest Regulations, or permits issued thereunder, if such occupancy or 
use is not in conflict with mineral developments.
    (f) When any road is to be built for mining purposes upon a mining 
claim, the locator must apply to the Forest Supervisor for the 
applicable rules and regulations governing the construction and 
maintenance of roads within the Black Hills National Forest, and such 
road will be built in accordance with such specifications and in such 
locations as the Forest Supervisor may direct.
    (g) In conducting mining operations the locator, his agents, 
representatives, or employees, or other persons whose presence in the 
area or in the vicinity thereof, is occasioned by such mining 
operations, shall use due diligence in the prevention and suppression of 
fires, and shall, when requested by the Forest Supervisor, or his 
authorized representative, be available for service in the 
extinguishment and suppression of all fires occurring within the 
Preserve: Provided, That if such fire does not originate through any 
negligence on the part of the locator, his agents, representatives, or 
employees, or other persons whose presence in the area or in the 
vicinity thereof, is occasioned by such mining operations and does not 
threaten the structures, improvements or property incident to the mining 
operation, such persons shall be paid for their services at the current 
rate of pay of fire fighters employed by the United States.
    (h) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to relieve 
the locator from complying with any requirements of the laws of the 
State of South Dakota, nor from compliance with or conformity to any 
requirements of any Federal law or regulation now existing or which 
later may be enacted or promulgated, and applicable to the subject 
involved in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 251.14  Conditions, rules and regulations to govern exercise of 
timber rights reserved in conveyance to the United States.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, in conveyance of lands to the United States under authorized 
programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter 
upon the conveyed lands and to cut and remove timber and timber 
products, said reservations shall be subject to the following 
conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in and made a 
part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such 
reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:
    (1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights, hereinafter 
called operator, shall give prior written notice to Forest Service and 
shall submit satisfactory evidence of authority to exercise such rights. 
Operator shall repair, replace, or restore any improvements owned by the 
United States or its permittees, damaged or destroyed by the timber 
operations and he shall restore the land to a condition safe and 
reasonably serviceable for authorized programs of Forest Service.
    (2) In cutting and removing timber and timber products and in 
locating, constructing and using mills, logging roads, railroads, 
chutes, landings, camps, or other improvements, no unnecessary damage 
shall be done to the air, water and soil resources, and to young growth 
or to trees left standing. All survey monuments and witness trees shall 
be preserved.
    (3) All trees, timber or timber products of species or sizes not 
specifically reserved which are unnecessarily cut, damaged, or destroyed 
by operator shall be paid for at double the usual rates charged in the 
locality for sales of similar National Forest timber and timber 
products.
    (4) Slash and debris resulting from the cutting, removal, or 
processing of timber or timber products, or from construction 
operations, shall be disposed of or otherwise treated by methods 
acceptable to the Forest Service. Such treatment or disposal shall 
comply with known air and water quality criteria and standards and 
include necessary preparatory work such as fireline constructing and 
snag falling. The timing of log removal and preparatory work shall not 
unnecessarily delay slash disposal or treatment.
    (5) Operator is authorized to construct and maintain buildings, 
facilities, and other improvements, including roads needed to log the 
reserved timber. Construction and maintenance plans, designs, and 
location shall be approved in writing by Forest Service before 
construction is started.
    (6) All buildings, camps, equipment, and other structures or 
improvements shall be removed from the lands within 6 months from date 
of completion or abandonment of the operation, unless relieved by Forest 
Service by issuance of a special-use permit. Otherwise such buildings, 
camps, equipment, and other structures or improvements shall become the 
property of the United States, but this does not relieve operator of 
liability for the cost of removal and restoration of the site.
    (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt operator 
from any requirements of the laws of the States in which situated; nor 
from compliance with or conformity to any requirement of any law which 
later may be enacted and which otherwise would be applicable.
    (8) While operations are in progress, operator, his employees, any 
subcontractors, and their employees, shall take all reasonable and 
practicable action in the prevention and suppression of fire, and shall 
be available for service in the suppression of all fires within the 
reserved area. On any fire not caused by negligence on the part of the 
operator, Forest Service shall pay operator at fire-fighting rates 
common in the area or at prior agreed rates for equipment or manpower 
furnished by operator.
    (9) Only one cutting shall be made on any portion of the area on 
which timber is reserved. Forest Service may permit the cutting of 
special products, or products the cutting of which is seasonal, on any 
portion of the area in advance of the cutting of the chief products of 
the reserved timber. Each reservation of timber shall include a specific 
period of time within which material may be removed.

[[Page 295]]

    (10) Forest Service shall have the right to use any road constructed 
under the authority of this timber reservation for any and all purposes 
in connection with the protection and administration of the National 
Forest.
    (11) Operator shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent 
pollution of the air, soil, and water, in operation hereunder.
    (12) All activities by operator in the reserved area shall be 
conducted in a safe, orderly, and workmanlike manner.
    (13) For the protection of streamcourses, the following measures 
shall be observed by operator: Culverts or bridges will be required on 
temporary roads at all points where it is necessary to cross 
streamcourses. Such facilities shall be of sufficient size and design to 
provide unobstructed flow of water. Equipment will not be operated in 
streamcourses except at designated crossings and as essential to 
construction or removal of culverts and bridges. Any stream that is 
temporarily diverted must be restored to the natural course as soon as 
practicable, and in any event prior to a major runoff season.
    (14) Operator shall perform currently as weather and soil conditions 
permit, the following erosion control work on portions of the reserved 
area where logging is in progress or has been completed: Construct 
cross-ditches and water-spreading ditches where staked or otherwise 
marked on the ground by Forest Service; after a temporary road has 
served operator's purpose, operator shall remove culverts and bridges, 
eliminate ditches, out-slope and cross-drain roadbed and remove ruts and 
berms to the extent necessary to stabilize fills and otherwise minimize 
erosion; operator shall avoid felling into, yarding in, or crossing 
natural meadows; and operations will not take place when soil and water 
conditions are such that excessive damage will result.
    (b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (14) of this section shall not apply to reservations 
contained in conveyances of land to the United States under the Act of 
March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82, 16 U.S.C. 555).
    (c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision 
thereof, reserves timber rights for the cutting and removal of timber 
and timber products, in the conveyance of land to the United States 
under authorized programs of the Forest Service and there are provisions 
in the laws of such State or in conditions, rules and regulations 
promulgated by such State, agency or political subdivision thereof, 
which the Chief, Forest Service, determines are adequate to protect the 
interest of the United States in the event of the exercise of such 
reservation, the Chief, Forest Service, is hereby authorized, in his 
discretion, to subject the exercise of the reservation to such statutory 
provisions or such conditions, rules, and regulations in lieu of the the 
conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (14) of this section. In that event, such statutory provisions 
or such conditions, rules and regulations shall be expressed in and made 
a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and the 
reservation shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto.

All regulations heretofore issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to 
govern the exercise of timber rights reserved in conveyance of lands to 
the United States under authorized programs of Forest Service shall 
continue to be effective in the cases to which they are applicable, but 
are hereby superseded as to timber rights hereafter reserved in 
conveyances under such programs.

programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter 
upon the conveyed lands and to prospect for, mine and remove minerals, 
oil, gas, or other inorganic substances, said reservations shall be 
subject to the following conditions, rules and regulations which shall 
be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United

[[Page 296]]

States and such reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in 
obedience thereto:
    (1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights shall give 
prior written notice to the Forest Service and shall submit satisfactory 
evidence of authority to exercise such rights. Only so much of the 
surface of the lands shall be occupied, used, or disturbed as is 
necessary in bona fide prospecting for, drilling, mining (including the 
milling or concentration of ores), and removal of the reserved minerals, 
oil, gas, or other inorganic substances.
    (2)(i) None of the lands in which minerals are reserved shall be so 
used, occupied, or disturbed as to preclude their full use for 
authorized programs of the Forest Service until the record owner of the 
reserved rights, or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, shall 
have applied for and received a permit authorizing such use, occupancy, 
or disturbance of those specifically described parts of the lands as may 
reasonably be necessary to exercise of the reserved rights.
    (ii) Said permit shall be issued upon agreement as to conditions 
necessary to protect the interest of the United States including such 
conditions deemed necessary to provide for the safety of the public and 
other users of the land, and upon initial payment of the annual fee, 
which shall be at the rate of $2 per acre or fraction of acre included 
in the permit.
    (iii) The permit shall also provide that the record owner of the 
reserved right or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, will 
repair or replace any improvements damaged or destroyed by the mining 
operations and restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably 
serviceable for authorized programs of the Forest Service, and shall 
provide for a bond in sufficient amount as determined necessary by the 
Forest Service to guarantee such repair, replacement or restoration.
    (iv) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
aforesaid permit shall be cause for termination of all rights to use, 
occupy, or disturb the surface of the lands covered thereby, but in 
event of such termination a new permit shall be issued upon application 
when the causes for termination of the preceding permit have been 
satisfactorily remedied and the United States reimbursed for any 
resultant damage to it.
    (3) All structures, other improvements, and materials shall be 
removed from the lands within one year after date of termination of the 
aforementioned permit. Should the holder of the permit fail to do so 
within the specified time, the Forest Service may remove, destroy or 
otherwise dispose of said structures, other improvements, and materials 
at the permittee's expense, or in lieu thereof, may upon written notice 
to the permittee, assume title thereto in the name of the United States.
    (4) Timber and/or young growth cut or destroyed in connection with 
exercise of the reserved right shall be paid for at rates determined by 
the Forest Service to be fair and equitable for comparable timber and/or 
young growth in the locality. All slash resulting from cutting or 
destruction of timber or young growth shall be disposed of as required 
by the Forest Service.
    (5) In the prospecting for, mining, and removal of reserved 
minerals, oil, gas, or other inorganic substances all reasonable 
provisions shall be made for the disposal of tailings, dumpage, and 
other deleterious materials or substances in such manner as to prevent 
obstruction, pollution, or deterioration of water resources.
    (6) Nothing herein contained shall be construed to exempt operators 
or the mining operations from any requirements of applicable State laws 
nor from compliance with or conformity to any requirement of any law 
which later may be enacted and which otherwise would be applicable.
    (7) While any activities and/or operations incident to the exercise 
of the reserved rights are in progress, the operators, contractors, 
subcontractors, and any employees thereof shall use due diligence in the 
prevention and suppression of fires, and shall comply with all rules and 
regulations applicable to the land.
    (b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (7) of this section shall not

[[Page 297]]

apply to reservations contained in conveyances of lands to the United 
States under the Act of March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 
Stat. 82; 16 U.S.C. 555).
    (c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision 
thereof, reserves minerals, oil, gas, or other inorganic substances, in 
the conveyance of land to the United States under authorized programs of 
the Forest Service and there are provisions in the laws of such State or 
in conditions, rules and regulations promulgated by such State, agency 
or political subdivision thereof, which the Chief, Forest Service, 
determines are adequate to protect the interest of the United States in 
the event of the exercise of such reservation, the Chief, Forest 
Service, is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to subject the 
exercise of the reservation to such statuatory provisions or such 
conditions, rules and regulations in lieu of the conditions, rules and 
regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (7) of this section. 
In that event, such statuatory provisions or such conditions, rules and 
regulations shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of 
conveyance to the United States and the reservation shall be exercised 
thereunder and in obedience thereto.

All regulations heretofore issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to 
govern the exercise of mineral rights reserved in conveyances of lands 
to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service 
shall continue to be effective in the cases to which they are 
applicable, but are hereby superseded as to mineral rights hereafter 
reserved in conveyances under such programs.

    (c) Rights of proponents. A proposal to obtain a special use 
authorization does not grant any right or privilege to use National 
Forest System lands. Rights or privileges to occupy and use National 
Forest System lands under this subpart are conveyed only through 
issuance of a special use authorization.
    (d) Proposal content--(1) Proponent identification. Any proponent 
for a special use authorization must provide the proponent's name and 
mailing address, and, if the proponent is not an individual, the name 
and address of the proponent's agent who is authorized to receive notice 
of actions pertaining to the proposal.
    (2) Required information--(i) Noncommercial group uses. Paragraphs

contained in paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this section. In 
addition, if requested by an authorized officer, a proponent in one of 
the following categories must furnish the information specified for that 
category:

number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that 
entity owned, either directly or indirectly by the affiliate; or
    (E) If the proponent is a partnership, association, or other 
unincorporated entity: a certified copy of the partnership agreement or 
other similar document, if any, creating the entity, or a certificate of 
good standing under the laws of the State.
    (3) Technical and financial capability. The proponent is required to 
provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the authorized officer that the 
proponent has, or prior to commencement of construction will have, the 
technical and financial capability to construct, operate, maintain, and 
terminate the project for which an authorization is requested, and the 
proponent is otherwise acceptable.
    (4) Project description. Except for requests for planning permits 
for a major development, a proponent must provide a project description, 
including maps and appropriate resource information, in sufficient 
detail to enable the authorized officer to determine the feasibility of 
a proposed project or activity, any benefits to be provided to the 
public, the safety of the proposal, the lands to be occupied or used, 
the terms and conditions to be included, and the proposal's compliance 
with applicable laws, regulations, and orders.
    (5) Additional information. The authorized officer may require any 
other information and data necessary to determine feasibility of a 
project or activity proposed; compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and orders; compliance with requirements for associated 
clearances, certificates, permits, or licenses; and suitable terms and 
conditions to be included in the authorization. The authorized officer 
shall make requests for any additional information in writing.
    (e) Pre-application actions. (1) Initial screening. Upon receipt of 
a request for any proposed use other than for noncommercial group use, 
the authorized officer shall screen the proposal to ensure that the use 
meets the following minimum requirements applicable to all special uses:
    (i) The proposed use is consistent with the laws, regulations, 
orders, and policies establishing or governing National Forest System 
lands, with other applicable Federal law, and with applicable State and 
local health and sanitation laws.
    (ii) The proposed use is consistent or can be made consistent with 
standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource 
management plan prepared under the National Forest Management Act and 36 
CFR part 219.
    (iii) The proposed use will not pose a serious or substantial risk 
to public health or safety.
    (iv) The proposed use will not create an exclusive or perpetual 
right of use or occupancy.
    (v) The proposed use will not unreasonably conflict or interfere 
with administrative use by the Forest Service, other scheduled or 
authorized existing uses of the National Forest System, or use of 
adjacent non-National Forest System lands.
    (vi) The proponent does not have any delinquent debt owed to the 
Forest Service under terms and conditions of

[[Page 305]]

a prior or existing authorization, unless such debt results from a 
decision on an administrative appeal or from a fee review and the 
proponent is current with the payment schedule.
    (vii) The proposed use does not involve gambling or providing of 
sexually oriented commercial services, even if permitted under State 
law.
    (viii) The proposed use does not involve military or paramilitary 
training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless 
such training or exercises are federally funded.
    (ix) The proposed use does not involve disposal of solid waste or 
disposal of radioactive or other hazardous substances.
    (2) Results of initial screening. Any proposed use other than a 
noncommercial group use that does not meet all of the minimum 
requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section shall not 
receive further evaluation and processing. In such event, the authorized 
officer shall advise the proponent that the use does not meet the 
minimum requirements. If the proposal was submitted orally, the 
authorized officer may respond orally. If the proposal was made in 
writing, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent in writing 
that the proposed use does not meet the minimum requirements and shall 
simultaneously return the request.
    (3) Guidance and information to proponents. For proposals for 
noncommercial group use as well as for those proposals that meet the 
minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix), the authorized 
officer, to the extent practicable, shall provide the proponent guidance 
and information on the following:
    (i) Possible land use conflicts as identified by review of forest 
land and resource management plans, landownership records, and other 
readily available sources;

requirements;
    (iii) Proponent qualifications;
    (iv) Applicable fees, charges, bonding, and/or security 
requirements;

    (vi) Environmental and management considerations;
    (vii) Special conditions; and
    (viii) identification of on-the-ground investigations which will 
require temporary use permits.
    (4) Confidentiality. If requested by the proponent, the authorized 
officer, or other Forest Service official, to the extent reasonable and 
authorized by law, shall hold confidential any project and program 
information revealed during pre-application contacts.
    (5) Second-level screening of proposed uses. A proposal which passes 
the initial screening set forth in paragraph (e)(1) and for which the 
proponent has submitted information as required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
of this section, proceeds to second-level screening and consideration. 
In order to complete this screening and consideration, the authorized 
officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a 
full description of the proposed use and its effects. An authorized 
officer shall reject any proposal, including a proposal for commercial 
group uses, if, upon further consideration, the officer determines that:
    (i) The proposed use would be inconsistent or incompatible with the 
purposes for which the lands are managed, or with other uses; or
    (ii) The proposed use would not be in the public interest; or
    (iii) The proponent is not qualified; or
    (iv) The proponent does not or cannot demonstrate technical or 
economic feasibility of the proposed use or the financial or technical 
capability to undertake the use and to fully comply with the terms and 
conditions of the authorization; or
    (v) There is no person or entity authorized to sign a special use 
authorization and/or there is no person or entity willing to accept 
responsibility for adherence to the terms and conditions of the 
authorization.
    (6) NEPA compliance for second-level screening process. A request 
for a special use authorization that does not meet the criteria 
established in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(v) of this section 
does not constitute an agency proposal as defined in 40 CFR 1508.23 and, 
therefore, does not require environmental analysis and documentation.

[[Page 306]]

    (f) Special requirements for certain proposals. (1) Oil and gas 
pipeline rights-of-way. These proposals must include the citizenship of 
the proponent(s) and disclose the identity of its participants as 
follows:
    (i) Citizens of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations 
of which deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of 
the United States, shall not own an appreciable interest in any oil and 
gas pipeline right-of-way or associated permit; and
    (ii) The authorized officer shall notify the House Committee on 
Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
promptly upon receipt of a proposal for a right-of-way for a pipeline 
twenty-four (24) inches or more in diameter, and no right-of-way for 
such a pipeline shall be granted until sixty (60) days (not counting 
days on which the House of Representatives or the Senate has adjourned 
for more than three (3) days) after a notice of intention to grant the 
right-of-way, together with the authorized officer's detailed findings 
as to terms and conditions the officer proposes to impose, has been 
submitted to such committees, unless each committee by resolution waives 
the waiting period.
    (2) Electric power transmission lines 66 KV or over. Any proposal 
for authority to construct and maintain a facility for the generation of 
electric power and energy or for the transmission or distribution of 
electric power and energy of 66 kilovolts or higher under this section 
must be referred to the Secretary of Energy for consultation.
    (3) Major development. Proponents of a major development may submit 
a request for a planning permit of up to 10 years in duration. Requests 
for a planning permit must include the information contained in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. Upon completion of a 
master development plan developed under a planning permit, proponents 
may then submit a request for a long-term authorization to construct and 
operate the development. At a minimum, a request for a long-term permit 
for a major development must include the information contained in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(5) of this section. 
Issuance of a planning permit does not prejudice approval or denial of a 
subsequent request for a special use permit for the development.
    (g) Application processing and response. (1) Acceptance of 
applications. Except for proposals for noncommercial group uses, if a 
request does not meet the criteria of both screening processes or is 
subsequently denied, the proponent must be notified with a written 
explanation of the rejection or denial and any written proposal returned 
to the proponent. If a request for a proposed use meets the criteria of 
both the initial and second-level screening processes as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the 
proponent that the agency is prepared to accept a written formal 
application for a special use authorization and shall, as appropriate or 
necessary, provide the proponent guidance and information of the type 
described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(viii) of this section.
    (2) Processing applications. (i) Upon acceptance of an application 
for a special use authorization other than a planning permit, the 
authorized officer shall evaluate the proposed use for the requested 
site, including effects on the environment. The authorized officer may 
request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full 
description of the proposed use and its effects.
    (ii) Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public 
shall receive adequate notice and an opportunity to comment upon a 
special use proposal accepted as a formal application in accordance with 
Forest Service NEPA procedures.
    (iii) The authorized officer shall give due deference to the 
findings of another agency such as a Public Utility Commission, the 
Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, or the Interstate Commerce 
Commission in lieu of another detailed finding. If this information is 
already on file with the Forest Service, it need not be refiled, if 
reference is made to the previous filing date, place, and case number.
    (iv) Applications for noncommercial group uses must be received at 
least 72 hours in advance of the proposed activity. Applications for 
noncommercial group uses shall be processed in order

[[Page 307]]

of receipt, and the use of a particular area shall be allocated in order 
of receipt of fully executed applications, subject to any relevant 
limitations set forth in this section.
    (v) For applications for planning permits, including those issued 
for a major development as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section, the authorized officer shall assess only the applicant's 
financial and technical qualifications and determine compliance with 
other applicable laws, regulations, and orders. Planning permits may be 
categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental assessment 
or environmental impact statement pursuant to Forest Service Handbook 
1909.15 (36 CFR 200.4).
    (3) Response to applications for noncommercial group uses. (i) All 
applications for noncommercial group uses shall be deemed granted and an 
authorization shall be issued for those uses pursuant to the 
determination as set forth below, unless applications are denied within 
48 hours of receipt. Where an application for a noncommercial group use 
has been granted or is deemed to have been granted and an authorization 
has been issued under this paragraph, an authorized officer may revoke 
that authorization only as provided under Sec. 251.60(a)(1)(i).
    (ii) An authorized officer shall grant an application for a special 
use authorization for a noncommercial group use upon a determination 
that:
    (A) Authorization of the proposed activity is not prohibited by the 
rules at 36 CFR part 261, subpart B, or by Federal, State, or local law 
unrelated to the content of expressive activity;
    (B) Authorization of the proposed activity is consistent or can be 
made consistent with the standards and guidelines in the applicable 
forest land and resource management plan required under the National 
Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219;
    (C) The proposed activity does not materially impact the 
characteristics or functions of the environmentally sensitive resources 
or lands identified in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, chapter 30;
    (D) The proposed activity will not delay, halt, or prevent 
administrative use of an area by the Forest Service or other scheduled 
or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands, 
including but not limited to uses and activities authorized under parts 
222, 223, 228, and 251 of this chapter;
    (E) The proposed activity does not violate State and local public 
health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site. Issues 
addressed by State and local public health laws and regulations as 
applied to the proposed site include but are not limited to:
    (1) The sufficiency of sanitation facilities;
    (2) The sufficiency of waste-disposal facilities;
    (3) The availability of sufficient potable drinking water;
    (4) The risk of disease from the physical characteristics of the 
proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site; 
and
    (5) The risk of contamination of the water supply;
    (F) The proposed activity will not pose a substantial danger to 
public safety. Considerations of public safety must not include concerns 
about possible reaction to the users' identity or beliefs from non-
members of the group that is seeking an authorization and shall be 
limited to the following:
    (1) The potential for physical injury to other forest users from the 
proposed activity;
    (2) The potential for physical injury to users from the physical 
characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated 
with the proposed site;
    (3) The potential for physical injury to users from scheduled or 
existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands; and
    (4) The adequacy of ingress and egress in case of an emergency;
    (G) The proposed activity does not involve military or paramilitary 
training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless 
such training or exercises are federally funded; and
    (H) A person or persons 21 years of age or older have been 
designated to sign and do sign a special use authorization on behalf of 
the applicant.
    (iii) If an authorized officer denies an application because it does 
not meet the criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A)

[[Page 308]]

through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this section, the authorized officer shall 
notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial. If an 
alternative time, place, or manner will allow the applicant to meet the 
eight evaluation criteria, an authorized officer shall offer that 
alternative. If an application is denied solely under paragraph 
(g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section and all alternatives suggested are 
unacceptable to the applicant, the authorized officer shall offer to 
have completed the requisite environmental and other analyses for the 
requested site. A decision to grant or deny the application for which an 
environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement is 
prepared is subject to the notice and appeal procedures at 36 CFR part 
215 and shall be made within 48 hours after the decision becomes final 
under that appeal process. A denial of an application under paragraphs 
(g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this section constitutes final 
agency action and is immediately subject to judicial review.
    (4) Response to all other applications. Based on evaluation of the 
information provided by the applicant and other relevant information 
such as environmental findings, the authorized officer shall decide 
whether to approve the proposed use, approve the proposed use with 
modifications, or deny the proposed use. A group of applications for 
similar uses having minor environmental impacts may be evaluated with 
one analysis and approved in one decision.
    (5) Authorization of a special use. Upon a decision to approve a 
special use or a group of similar special uses, the authorized officer 
may issue one or more special use authorizations as defined in 
Sec. 251.51 of this subpart.

[63 FR 65964, Nov. 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 251.55  Nature of interest.

    (a) A holder is authorized only to occupy such land and structures 
and conduct such activities as is specified in the special use 
authorization. The holder may sublet the use and occupancy of the 
premises and improvements authorized only with the prior written 
approval of the authorized officer, but the holder shall continue to be 
responsible for compliance with all conditions of the special use 
authorization.
    (b) All rights not expressly granted are retained by the United 
States, including but not limited to (1) continuing rights of access to 
all National Forest System land (including the subsurface and air 
space); (2) a continuing right of physical entry to any part of the 
authorized facilities for inspection, monitoring, or for any other 
purposes or reason consistent with any right or obligation of the United 
States under any law or regulation; and (3) the right to require common 
use of the land or to authorize the use by others in any way not 
inconsistent with a holder's existing rights and privileges after 
consultation with all parties and agencies involved. When costs can be 
feasibly allocated and have not been amortized, a new holder may be 
required to compensate existing holders for an equitable proportion of 
the original costs or other expense associated with the common use.
    (c) Special use authorizations are subject to all outstanding valid 
rights.
    (d) Each special use authorization will specify the lands to be used 
or occupied which shall be limited to that which the authorized officer 
determines: (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized; (2) to be 
necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, and full 
utilization of the authorized facilities or the conduct of authorized 
activities; and, (3) to be necessary to protect the public health and 
safety and the environment.
    (e) The holder will secure permission under applicable law, and pay 
in advance, the value as determined by the authorized officer for any 
mineral and vegetative materials (including timber) to be cut, removed, 
used, or destroyed by the holder from the authorized use area or other 
National Forest System land. The authorized officer may, in lieu of 
requiring an advance payment, require the holder to stockpile or stack 
the material at designated locations for later disposal by the United 
States.


<R05>
Sec. 251.56  Terms and conditions.

    (a) General. (1) Each special use authorization must contain:
    (i) Terms and conditions which will:

[[Page 309]]

    (A) Carry out the purposes of applicable statutes and rules and 
regulations issued thereunder;
    (B) Minimize damage to scenic and esthetic values and fish and 
wildlife habitat and otherwise protect the environment;
    (C) Require compliance with applicable air and water quality 
standards established by or pursuant to applicable Federal or State law; 
and
    (D) Require compliance with State standards for public health and 
safety, environmental protection, and siting, construction, operation, 
and maintenance if those standards are more stringent than applicable 
Federal standards.
    (ii) Such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems 
necessary to:
    (A) Protect Federal property and economic interests;
    (B) Manage efficiently the lands subject to the use and adjacent 
thereto;
    (C) Protect other lawful users of the lands adjacent to or occupied 
by such use;
    (D) Protect lives and property;
    (E) Protect the interests of individuals living in the general area 
of the use who rely on the fish, wildlife, and other biotic resources of 
the area for subsistence purposes;
    (F) Require siting to cause the least damage to the environment, 
taking into consideration feasibility and other relevant factors; and
    (G) Otherwise protect the public interest.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(G): The Department is making explicit 
its preexisting understanding of Sec. 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) of this 
subpart in the context of authorizing noncommercial group uses of 
National Forest System lands. Section 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) provides that 
each special use authorization shall contain such terms and conditions 
as the authorized officer deems necessary to otherwise protect the 
public interest. In the context of noncommercial group uses, the Forest 
Service interprets the term ``public interest'' found in 
Sec. 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) to refer to the three public interests 
identified by the Forest Service on August 30, 1995. These public 
interests include the protection of resources and improvements on 
National Forest System lands, the allocation of space among potential or 
existing uses and activities, and public health and safety concerns. 
Under this construction, Sec. 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) allows the Forest 
Service to impose terms and conditions that are not specifically 
addressed in Sec. 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(F) but only those that further 
these public interests. The Forest Service shall implement and enforce 
Sec. 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) in accordance with this interpretation.

    (2) Authorizations for use of National Forest System lands may be 
conditioned to require State, county, or other Federal agency licenses, 
permits, certificates, or other approval documents, such as a Federal 
Communication Commission license, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
license, a State water right, or a county building permit.
    (b) Duration and renewability--(1) Requirements. If appropriate, 
each special use authorization will specify its duration and 
renewability. The duration shall be no longer than the authorized 
officer determines to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of the 
authorization and to be reasonable in light of all circumstances 
concerning the use, including
    (i) Resource management direction contained in land management and 
other plans;
    (ii) Public benefits provided;
    (iii) Cost and life expectancy of the authorized facilities;
    (iv) Financial arrangements for the project; and
    (v) The life expectancy of associated facilities, licenses, etc. 
Except for special use authorizations issued under the National Forest 
Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, authorizations exceeding 30 years shall 
provide for revision of terms and conditions at specified intervals to 
reflect changing times and conditions.
    (2) Ski area permits. (i) For authorizations issued under the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer 
normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon 
consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized 
officer finds that the ski area development meets the following 
standards:
    (A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site 
investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 
years;
    (B) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing investment of 
capital is in ski-related facilities;

[[Page 310]]

    (C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of 
ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation 
and maintenance costs;
    (D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, 
located predominately on land authorized under a permit;
    (E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a 
Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or 
operation;
    (F) The United States is not the owner of the principal facilities 
within the authorized ski area.
    (ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area 
when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized 
officer's discretion:
    (A) Analysis of the information submitted by the applicant indicates 
that a shorter term is sufficient for financing of the ski area;
    (B) The ski area development, whether existing or proposed, does not 
meet the standards of paragraph (2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section; 
or
    (C) A 40-year authorization would be inconsistent with the approved 
forest land and resource management plan governing the area (36 CFR part 
219).
    (c) Preconstruction approvals. Forest Service approval of location, 
design and plans (or standards, if appropriate) of all developments 
within the authorized area will be required prior to construction.
    (d) Liability. Holders shall pay the United States for all injury, 
loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in accordance with 
existing Federal and State laws.
    (1) Holders shall also indemnify the United States for any and all 
injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, the United 
States may suffer as a result of claims, demands, losses, or judgments 
caused by the holder's use or occupancy.
    (2) Holders of special use authorizations for high risk use and 
occupancy, such as, but not limited to, powerlines and oil and gas 
pipelines, shall be held liable for all injury, loss, or damage, 
including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder's use or 
occupancy, without regard to the holder's negligence, provided that 
maximum liability shall be specified in the special use authorization as 
determined by a risk assessment, prepared in accordance with established 
agency procedures, but shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one 
occurrence. Liability for injury, loss, or damage, including fire 
suppression costs, in excess of the specified maximum shall be 
determined by the laws governing ordinary negligence of the jurisdiction 
in which the damage or injury occurred.
    (e) Bonding. An authorized officer may require the holder of a 
special use authorization for other than a noncommercial group use to 
furnish a bond or other security to secure all or any of the obligations 
imposed by the terms of the authorization or by any applicable law, 
regulation or order.
    (f) Special terms and conditions-- (1) Public service enterprises. 
Special use permits authorizing the operation of public service 
enterprises shall require that the permittee charge reasonable rates and 
furnish such services as may be necessary in the public interest, except 
where such rates and services are regulated by Federal, State or 
municipal agencies having jurisdiction.
    (2) Common carriers. Oil and gas pipelines and related facilities 
authorized under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 
449, as amended (30 U.S.C. 185), shall be constructed, operated and 
maintained as common carriers. The owners or operators of pipelines 
shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all 
oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without regard to whether such oil 
or gas was produced on Federal or nonfederal lands. In the case of oil 
or gas produced from Federal lands or from the resources on the Federal 
lands in the vicinity of the pipeline, the Secretary may, after a full 
hearing with due notice thereof to interested parties and a proper 
finding of facts, determine the proportionate amounts to be accepted, 
conveyed, transported, or purchased. The common carrier provisions of 
this section shall not apply to any natural gas pipeline operated (i) by 
any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 
821, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 717) or (ii) by any public utility

[[Page 311]]

subject to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having 
jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural 
gas to consumers within the State or municipality. Where natural gas not 
subject to State regulatory or conservation laws governing its purchase 
by pipeline companies is offered for sale, each pipeline company shall 
purchase, without discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the 
vicinity of the pipeline.
    (g) Conversion of Ski Area Authorizations. (1) The Forest Service 
shall request that all existing permit holders convert existing 
authorizations for ski areas to a new authorization issued pursuant to 
the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act.
    (2) Any current holder of a ski area permit who wishes to convert an 
existing permit to one issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area 
Permit Act must submit a written request for the new authorization to 
the authorized officer.
    (3) With the consent of the holder, the authorized officer shall 
convert the authorization if:
    (i) The holder is in compliance with the existing authorization;
    (ii) All fees currently due under the existing authorization are 
paid in full; and
    (iii) Any proposed modifications of terms and conditions of the 
existing authorization included in a request for conversion meet the 
standards of paragraphs (2)(i) (A) through (F) of this section and the 
relevant requirements of this subpart.
    (4) A holder retains the right to decline a new authorization 
offered pursuant to this paragraph and to continue to operate under the 
terms of the existing permit. However, pursuant to the rules at 
Sec. 251.61 of this subpart, major modifications of existing permits 
shall require conversion to a permit issued under the authority of the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act, unless the holder provides 
compelling justification for retaining the existing permit.

<R05>
Sec. 251.57  Rental fees.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part or when specifically 
authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture, special use authorizations 
shall require the payment in advance of an annual rental fee as 
determined by the authorized officer.
    (1) The fee shall be based on the fair market value of the rights 
and privileges authorized, as determined by appraisal or other sound 
business management principles.
    (2) Where annual fees of one hundred dollars ($100) or less are 
assessed, the authorized officer may require either annual payment or a 
payment covering more than one year at a time. If the annual fee is 
greater than one hundred dollars ($100), holders who are private 
individuals (that is, acting in an individual capacity), as opposed to 
those who are commercial, other corporate, or business or government 
entities, may, at their option, elect to make either annual payments or 
payments covering more than one year.
    (b) All or part of the fee may be waived by the authorized officer, 
when equitable and in the public interest, for the use and occupancy of 
National Forest System land in the following circumstances:
    (1) The holder is a State or local government or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof, excluding municipal utilities and cooperatives 
whose principal source of revenue from the authorized use is customer 
charges; or
    (2) The holder is a nonprofit association or nonprofit corporation, 
which is not controlled or owned by profit-making corporations or 
business enterprises, and which is engaged in public or semi-public 
activity to further public health, safety, or welfare, except that free 
use will not be authorized when funds derived by the holder through the 
authorization are used to increase the value of the authorized 
improvements owned by the holder, or are used to support other 
activities of the holder; or
    (3) The holder provides without charge, or at reduced charge, a 
valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary; or

[[Page 312]]

    (4) When the rental fee is included in the fees for an authorized 
use or occupancy for which the United States is already receiving 
compensation; or
    (5) When a right-of-way is authorized in reciprocation for a right-
of-way conveyed to the United States; or
    (6) For rights-of-way involving cost-share roads or reciprocal 
right-of-way agreements.
    (c) No rental fee will be charged when the holder is the Federal 
government.
    (d) No fee shall be charged when the authorization is for a 
noncommercial group use as defined in Sec. 251.51 of this subpart.
    (e) Special use authorizations issued under Sec. 251.53(g) of this 
part may require as all or a part of the consideration the 
reconditioning and maintenance of the government-owned or controlled 
structures, improvements, and land to a satisfactory standard. The total 
consideration will be based upon the fair market value of the rights and 
privileges authorized.
    (f) Special use authorizations involving government-owned or 
controlled buildings, structures, or other improvements which require 
caretakers' services, or the furnishing of special services such as 
water, electric lights, and clean-up, may require the payment of an 
additional fee or charge to cover the cost of such services.
    (g) Except where specified otherwise by terms of a special use 
authorization, rental fees may be initiated or adjusted whenever 
necessary: (1) As a result of fee review, reappraisal; or (2) upon a 
change in the holder's qualifications under paragraph (b) of this 
section; and (3) notice is given prior to initiating or adjusting rental 
fees.
    (h) Each ski area authorization issued under the authority of the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act shall include a clause that provides 
that the Forest Service may adjust and calculate future rental fees to 
reflect Agency revisions to the existing system for determining fees 
based on fair market value or to comply with any new fee system for 
determining fees based on fair market value that may be adopted after 
issuance of the authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 251.59  Transfer of authorized improvements.

    If the holder, through death, voluntary sale, transfer, or through 
enforcement of a valid legal proceeding or operation of law, ceases to 
be the owner of the authorized improvements, the authorization 
terminates upon change of ownership. Except for easements issued under 
authorities other than Sec. 251.53(e) and leases and easements under 
Sec. 251.53(l) of this subpart, the new owner of the authorized 
improvements must apply for and receive a new special use authorization. 
The new owner must meet requirements under applicable regulations of 
this subpart and agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
authorization and any new terms and conditions warranted by existing or 
prospective circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 251.60  Termination, revocation, and suspension.

    (a) Grounds for termination, revocation, and suspension. (1) 
Noncommercial group uses. (i) Revocation or suspension. An authorized 
officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for a 
noncommercial group use only under one of the following circumstances:
    (A) Under the criteria for which an application for a special use 
authorization may be denied under Sec. 251.54(h)(1);
    (B) For noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations or the 
terms and conditions of the authorization;
    (C) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges 
granted; or
    (D) With the consent of the holder.
    (ii) Administrative or judicial review. Revocation or suspension of 
a special use authorization under this paragraph constitutes final 
agency action and is immediately subject to judicial review.

[[Page 313]]

    (iii) Termination. A special use authorization for a noncommercial 
group use terminates when it expires by its own terms. Termination of a 
special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency 
action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
    (2) All other special uses. (i) Revocation or suspension. An 
authorized officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for 
all other special uses, except an easement issued pursuant to 
Sec. 251.53 (e) and (l):
    (A) For noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or the 
terms and conditions of the authorization;

with 36 CFR part 251, subpart C, of this chapter.
    (iii) Termination. For all special uses except noncommercial group 
uses, a special use authorization terminates when, by its terms, a fixed

to protect the public health or safety or the environment. In any such 
case, within 48 hours of a request of the holder, the superior of the 
authorized officer shall arrange for an on-site review of the adverse 
conditions with the holder. Following this review, the superior officer 
shall take prompt action to affirm, modify, or cancel the suspension.
    (g) The authorized officer may suspend or revoke easements issued 
pursuant to Sec. 251.53 (e) and (l) of this subpart under the Rules of 
Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings 
instituted by the Secretary under 7 CFR 1.130 through 1.151. No

improvements within a reasonable period, as determined by the authorized 
officer, they shall become the property of the United States, but holder 
shall remain liable for the costs of removal and site restoration.

use authorization to cover new, changed, or additional use(s) or area.
    (1) In approving or denying changes or modifications, the authorized

conditions of the existing authorization may be continued or revised, or 
a new authorization issued.
    (2) Changes during construction, or at any other time, from the 
approved plans or the location shown in the application or authorization 
shall be allowed only with the prior approval of the authorized officer.
    (b) A holder may be required to furnish as-built plans, map(s), or

Sec. 251.62  Acceptance.

effective when signed by both the applicant and the authorized officer. 
The authorization must be signed by the applicant and returned to the 
authorized officer within 60 days of its receipt by the applicant, 
unless extended by the authorized officer. Refusal of an applicant to 
sign and accept a special use authorization within the time allowed, and 
before its final approval and signature by an authorized officer, shall 
terminate an application and constitute denial of the requested use and 
occupancy.

Sec. 251.63  Reciprocity.

    If it is determined that a right-of-way shall be needed by the 
United States across nonfederal lands directly or indirectly owned or 
controlled by an applicant for a right-of-way across Federal lands, the 
authorized officer may condition a special use authorization to require 
the holder to grant the United States the needed right-of-way.


<R05>
Sec. 251.64  Renewals.

    (a) When a special use authorization provides for renewal, the 
authorized officer shall renew it where such renewal is authorized by 
law, if the project or facility is still being used for the purpose(s) 
previously authorized and is being operated and maintained in accordance 
with all the provisions of the authorization. In making such renewal, 
the authorized officer may modify the terms, conditions, and special 
stipulations to reflect any new requirements imposed by current Federal 
and State land use plans, laws, regulations or other management 
decisions. Special uses may be reauthorized upon expiration so long as 
such use remains consistent with the decision that approved the expiring 
special use or group of uses. If significant new information or 
circumstances have developed, appropriate environmental analysis must 
accompany the decision to reauthorize the special use.
    (b) When a special use authorization does not provide for renewal, 
it is discretionary with the authorized officer, upon request from the 
holder and prior to its expiration, whether or not the authorization 
shall be renewed. A renewal pursuant to this section shall comply with 
the same provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section.

request the first level file from the Forest Supervisor. The review 
shall be conducted on the existing record and no additional information 
shall be added to the file.
    (d) Discretionary review of dismissal decisions. Dismissal decisions 
rendered by Forest Service line officers pursuant to this part 
(Sec. 251.92) are subject to only one level of discretionary review 
(Sec. 251.100) as follows:

Forester has discretion to review.
    (2) If the Reviewing Officer was the Regional Forester, the Chief 
has discretion to review.
    (3) If the Reviewing Officer was the Chief, the Secretary of 
Agriculture has discretion to review.

file a responsive statement or replies thereto. The Reviewing Officer 
shall rule on requests for extensions within 10 days of receipt of the 
request and shall provide written notice of the extension ruling to all 
parties to the appeal.
    (2) Except for discretionary reviews of appeal decisions as provided 
in Sec. 251.100 of this subpart, a Reviewing Officer may extend the time 
period for issuance of the appeal decision, including for purposes of 
allowing additional time for the Deciding Officer to resolve disputed 
issues, as provided in Sec. 251.93 of this subpart.

notice of appeal: a request for oral presentation (Sec. 251.97); a 
request for stay of implementation of the decision pending decision on 
the appeal (Sec. 251.91); or, in those States with a Department of 
Agriculture certified mediation program, a request for mediation of 
grazing permit cancellation or suspensions pursuant to Sec. 251.103.

<R05>
Sec. 251.91  Stays.

    (a) A decision may be implemented during the appeal process, unless 
the Reviewing Officer grants a stay or unless a term grazing permit 
holder appeals a decision and simultaneously requests mediation pursuant 
to Sec. 251.103. In the case of mediation requests, a stay is granted 
automatically upon receipt of the notice of appeal for the duration of 
the mediation period as provided in Sec. 251.103.
    (b) An appellant or intervenor may request a stay of a decision at 
any time while an appeal is pending, if the harmful effects alleged 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section would occur during pendency 
of the appeal. The Reviewing Officer shall not accept any request to 
stay implementation of a decision that is not scheduled to begin during 
pendency of the appeal.
    (c) To request a stay of decision, an appellant or intervenor must--
    (1) File a written request with the Reviewing Officer;
    (2) Simultaneously send a copy of the stay request to any other 
appellant(s), to intervenor(s), and to the Deciding Officer.
    (3) Provide a written justification of the need for a stay, which at 
a minimum includes the following:
    (i) A description of the specific project(s), activity(ies), or 
action(s) to be stopped.
    (ii) Specific reasons why the stay should be granted in sufficient 
detail to permit the Reviewing Officer to evaluate and rule upon the 
stay request, including at a minimum:
    (A) The specific adverse effect(s) upon the requester;
    (B) Harmful site-specific impacts or effects on resources in the 
area affected by the activity(ies) to be stopped, and
    (C) How the cited effects and impacts would prevent a meaningful 
decision on the merits.
    (d) A Deciding Officer and other parties to an appeal may provide 
the Reviewing Officer with a written response to a stay request. A copy 
of any response must be sent to all parties to the appeal.
    (e) Timeframe. The Reviewing Officer must rule on a stay request no 
later than 10 calendar days from receipt.
    (f) Criteria to consider. In deciding a stay request, a Reviewing 
Officer shall consider:
    (1) Information provided by the requester pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section including the validity of any claim of adverse effect on 
the requester;
    (2) The effect that granting a stay would have on preserving a 
meaningful appeal on the merits;
    (3) Any information provided by the Deciding Officer or other party 
to the appeal in response to the stay request; and
    (4) Any other factors the Reviewing Officer considers relevant to 
the decision.
    (g) Notice of decision on a stay request. A Reviewing Officer must 
issue a written decision on a stay request.
    (1) If a stay is granted, the stay shall specify the specific 
activities to be stopped, duration of the stay, and reasons for granting 
the stay.
    (2) If a stay is denied in whole or in part, the decision shall 
specify the reasons for the denial.

[[Page 321]]

    (3) A copy of a decision on a stay request shall be sent to all 
parties to the appeal.
    (h) Duration. A stay shall remain in effect for the 15-day period 
for determining discretionary review (Sec. 251.100), unless changed by 
the Reviewing Officer in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) Change in a stay. A Reviewing Officer may change a stay decision 
in accordance with any terms established in the stay decision itself or 
at any time during pendency of an appeal that circumstances support a 
change of stay. In making any changes to a stay decision, the Reviewing 
Officer must issue a written notice to all parties to the appeal 
explaining the reason for making the changes and setting forth any terms 
or conditions that apply to the change.
    (j) Petitions to change a stay. An appellant or intervenor may 
petition a Reviewing Officer to change or lift a stay at any time during 
the pendency of an appeal. Such petitions must be in writing, must 
explain how circumstances have changed since the stay was imposed, and 
must state why the change in the stay is being requested. The petitioner 
must send a copy of the petition to all parties to the appeal.
    (k) Appeal of stay decision or changes in stay. A Reviewing 
Officer's decision to grant, deny, lift, or otherwise change a stay is 
not subject to further appeal and review, except when the first-level 
Reviewing Officer was the Forest Supervisor. In this instance, the 
Regional Forester has discretion to review.

Sec. 251.92  Dismissal.

    (a) The Reviewing Officer shall dismiss an appeal and close the 
record without a decision on the merits when:
    (1) The appellant is not eligible to appeal a decision under this 
subpart.
    (2) Appellant's notice of appeal is not filed within the required 
time period, or the notice of appeal fails to meet the minimum 
requirements of Sec. 251.90 of this subpart to such an extent that the 
Reviewing Officer lacks adequate information on which to base a 
decision.
    (3) In cases where there is only one appellant, the appellant 
withdraws the appeal.
    (4) The requested relief cannot be granted under existing law, fact,

that includes an explanation of why the appeal is dismissed.
    (c) A Reviewing Officer's dismissal decision is subject to 
discretionary review at the next administrative level as provided for in 
Sec. 251.87(d), except when a dismissal decision results from withdrawal 
of an appeal by an appellant, withdrawal of the initial decision by the 
Deciding Officer, or a mediated resolution of the dispute.

<R05>
Sec. 251.93  Resolution of issues.

    (a) Authorized Forest Service officers shall, to the extent 
practicable and consistent with the public interest, consult and meet in 
person, or by phone, with holders of written instruments prior to 
issuing written decisions related to administration of a written 
authorization. The purpose of such meetings is to discuss any issues or 
concerns related to the authorized use and to reach a common 
understanding and agreement where possible prior to issuance of a 
written decision.
    (b) When decisions are appealed, the Deciding Officer may discuss 
the appeal with the appellant(s) and intervenor(s) together or 
separately to narrow issues, agree on facts, and explore opportunities 
to resolve the issues by means other than review and decision on the 
appeal, including mediation pursuant to Sec. 251.103. At the request of 
the Deciding Officer, the Reviewing Officer may extend the time period 
to allow

[[Page 322]]

for meaningful negotiations, except for appeals under review at the 
discretionary level. In the event of mediation of a grazing dispute 
under Sec. 251.103, the Reviewing Officer may extend the time for 
mediation only as provided in Sec. 251.103.
    (c) The Deciding Officer has the authority to withdraw a decision, 
in whole or in part, during the appeal. Where a Deciding Officer decides 
to withdraw a decision, all parties to the appeal and the Reviewing 
Officer must receive written notice.

<R05>
Sec. 251.94  Responsive statement.

response to the specific facts or issues of law or regulation and the 
requested relief set forth by the appellant in the notice of appeal.
    (b) Timeframe. Unless the Reviewing Officer has granted an extension 
or dismissed the appeal, or unless mediation has been requested under 
this subpart, the Deciding Officer shall prepare a responsive statement 
and send it to the Reviewing Officer and all parties to the appeal

occurs but fails to resolve the issues, the Deciding Officer shall 
prepare a responsive statement and send it to the Reviewing Officer and 
all parties to the appeal within 30 days of the reinstatement of the 
appeal timeframes (Sec. 251.103(c)).
    (c) Replies. Within 20 days of the postmarked date of the responsive 
statement, the appellant(s) and any intervenor(s) may file a written 
reply to the responsive statement with the Reviewing Officer. Appellants 
and intervenors must send a copy of any reply to a responsive statement 
to all parties to the appeal, including the Deciding Officer.

not subject to appeal and further review.
    (b) Consolidation of appeals. A Reviewing Officer may consolidate 
multiple appeals of the same decision, or of similar decisions involving

Reviewing Officer may issue one decision in cases involving separate 
reviews filed pursuant to 36 CFR part 217 and under this part when the 
decision at issue is the same decision. In such case, the Reviewing 
Officer shall give notice to all parties to multiple appeals.
    (1) A decision to consolidate appeals is not subject to appeal and 
further review.
    (2) At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, the Deciding Officer 
may prepare one responsive statement to multiple appeals.

review conducted pursuant to Sec. 251.100 and second level appeals of 
decisions made by the District Ranger pursuant to Sec. 251.87(c) of this 
subpart, the Reviewing Officer may ask any party to an appeal for 
additional information as deemed necessary to decide the appeal. Such 
requests will be limited to obtaining and evaluating information needed 
to clarify issues raised. The Reviewing Officer shall notify all parties 
of the request for information, provide it to all parties, give 
opportunity to comment, and extend time periods if necessary to allow 
for submission of the information.

prior to the closing of the appeal record

[[Page 323]]

(Sec. 251.98) at the first level of appeal (Sec. 251.87). Requests to

    (d) A granting or denial of intervention is not subject to appeal to 
a higher level.
    (e) Appellants and intervenors must concurrently furnish copies of 
all submissions to each other as well as the Deciding Officer. Failure

the appeal record. At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, 
appellants may be given additional time to review and comment on initial 
submissions by intervenors.
    (f) An intervenor cannot continue an appeal if the appellant 
withdraws the appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 251.97  Oral presentation.

    (a) Purpose. An oral presentation provides an additional opportunity 
for an appellant, and other parties to an appeal, to present their 
viewpoints to the Reviewing Officer. The purpose is to restate, 
emphasize, and/or clarify information related to an appeal. Oral 
presentations are to be conducted in an informal manner and shall not be 
subject to formal rules of procedure such as those applicable to 
judicial proceedings.
    (b) Requests. Only an appellant may request and be granted an oral 
presentation. An appellant may request an oral presentation at any time 
prior to closing of the appeal record (Sec. 251.98). A Reviewing Officer 
shall automatically grant an oral presentation if the appellant 
requested the presentation as part of the notice of appeal.
    (c) Participation. At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, oral 
presentations may be open to public attendance, but participation is 
limited to parties to the appeal. The Reviewing Officer shall advise all 
parties to the appeal, including the Deciding Officer, of the place, 
time, and date of the oral presentation, and how the oral presentation 
will be conducted. All parties to an appeal shall be invited to 
participate. Appellants and intervenors must bear any expense involved 
in making an oral presentation in person or by telephone.
    (d) Limitation. Oral presentations shall be held only at the first 
level of appeal (Sec. 251.87(b)).


<R05>

the first level (Sec. 251.87 (a), (b)):
    (a) It is the responsibility of the Reviewing Officer to maintain in 
one location the documents related to the appeal.
    (b) The record consists of the documents filed with the Reviewing 
Officer including, but not limited to, the notice of appeal, responsive 
statement, replies to submissions by various parties to the appeal, 
orders and determinations made on the conduct of the appeal, and 
correspondence.
    (c) The Reviewing Officer has discretion to remove from the record 
documents that were not sent to all parties to an appeal.
    (d) Unless the Reviewing Officer has ordered otherwise, the appeal 
record closes with the expiration of the time period for filing of the 
reply(ies) to the responsive statement, or at the conclusion of an oral 
presentation, if there is one. The Reviewing Officer shall notify all 
parties to an appeal of the closure of the record.
    (e) The appeal record is open to public inspection.

[[Page 324]]

    (f) In appeals involving initial decisions of the Chief 
(Sec. 251.87(a)), the establishment of an administrative record as

Secretary elects to review the appeal. Except for the initial notice of 
appeal, any filings made previous to the Secretary's election to review 
will not be accepted.

procedures.
    (b) The Reviewing Officer shall affirm or reverse the original 
decision whole or in part and include the reason(s) for the decision. 
The Reviewing Officer may also include in the appeal decision 
instructions for further action by the Deciding Officer.

and issue an appeal decision within 30 days of the date the record is 
closed.

Reviewing Officer shall make and issue an appeal decision within 30 days 
of the date the record is received from the first level Reviewing 
Officer.
    (e) The Reviewing Officer shall send a copy of all appeal decisions 
to all participants.
    (f) Unless the next higher officer exercises the discretion to 
review an appeal decision as provided in Secs. 251.87(e) and 251.100 of 
this subpart, the appeal decision is the final administrative decision 
of the Department of Agriculture and is not subject to further review 
under this subpart or part 217 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 251.100  Discretionary review.

    (a) Petitions or requests for discretionary review shall not, in and 
of themselves, give rise to a decision to exercise discretionary review. 
In electing to exercise discretion, a Reviewing Officer should consider, 
but is not limited to, such factors as controversy surrounding the 
decision, the potential for litigation, and whether the appeal decision 
is precedential in nature or establishes new policy.
    (b) As provided for in Secs. 251.87(d) and (e), 251.91(k), and 
251.92, stay decisions rendered by a Forest Supervisor, certain 
dismissal decisions rendered by Forest Service line officers, and first-
level appeal decisions rendered by Regional Foresters and the Chief 
(Sec. 251.99), are subject to discretionary review at the next highest 
administrative level. Within one day following the date of a decision 
subject to such discretionary review, the Reviewing Officer shall 
forward a copy of the decision and the initial decision upon which the 
appeal is predicated to the next higher officer.
    (c) The next higher level officer shall have 15 calendar days from 
date of receipt to decide whether or not to review an appeal decision 
and may call for or use the appeal record in deciding whether or not to 
review the appeal decision. If the record is requested, the 15-day 
period is suspended at that point. The lower level Reviewing Officer 
shall forward it within 5 days of the request. Upon receipt, the higher 
level officer shall have 15 days to decide whether or not to review the 
lower level decision. If that officer takes no action by the expiration 
of the discretionary review period, appellants shall be notified by the 
discretionary level officer that the appeal decision of the Reviewing 
Officer stands as the final administrative review decision of the 
Department of Agriculture.
    (d) When an official exercises the discretion in Sec. 251.87(d) or 
Sec. 251.87(e) of this subpart to review a dismissal or appeal decision, 
the discretionary review shall be made on the existing appeal record and 
the lower level Reviewing Officer's appeal decision. The record shall 
not be reopened to accept additional submissions from any source, 
including the Reviewing Officer whose appeal decision is being reviewed.
    (e) When an official exercises discretion to review an appeal 
decision, a Reviewing Officer may extend a stay, in whole or in part, 
during pendency of the discretionary review.
    (f) The second level Reviewing Officer shall conclude the review 
within 30 days of the date of notice issued to an

[[Page 325]]

appellant that the lower level decision will be reviewed.
    (g) If a discretionary review decision is not issued by the end of 
the 30-day review period, appellants and intervenors shall be deemed to 
have exhausted their administrative remedies for purposes of judicial 
review. In such case, appellants, intervenors, and the lower level 
Reviewing Officer shall be notified by the discretionary level officer.
    (h) The Reviewing Officer shall provide a copy of the decision to 
all appellants, intervenors, the Deciding Officer, and the lower level 
Reviewing Officer.

FR 7896, Mar. 6, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 251.101  Policy in event of judicial proceedings.

    It is the position of the Department of Agriculture that any filing 
for Federal judicial review of and relief from a decision appealable 
under this subpart is premature and inappropriate, unless the appellant 
has first sought to resolve the dispute by invoking and exhausting the 
procedures of this subpart. This position may be waived only upon a 
written finding by the Chief.


<R05>
Sec. 251.102  Applicability and effective date.

    (a) Except where applicants or holders elect the decision review 
procedures of part 217 of this chapter, appealable decisions arising 
from the issuance, approval, and administration of written instruments 
authorizing occupancy and use of National Forest System lands made on or 
after February 22, 1989, shall be subject to the procedures of this 
part.
    (b) Decisions made before February 22, 1989, arising from the 
issuance, approval, and administration of written instruments 
authorizing occupancy and use of National Forest System lands shall be 
subject to appeal under the provisions of 36 CFR 211.18.

[54 FR 6892, Feb. 15, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 251.103   Mediation of term grazing permit disputes.

    (a) Decisions subject to mediation. In those States with Department 
of Agriculture certified mediation programs, any holder of a term 
grazing permit may request mediation, if a Deciding Officer issues a 
decision to suspend or cancel a term grazing permit, in whole or in 
part, as authorized by 36 CFR 222.4 (a)(2)(i), (ii), (iv), (v), and 
(a)(3) through (a)(6).
    (b) Parties. Notwithstanding the provisions addressing parties to an 
appeal at Sec. 251.86, only the following may participate in mediation 
of term grazing permit disputes under this section:
    (1) A mediator authorized to mediate under a Department of 
Agriculture State certified mediation program:
    (2) The Deciding Officer who made the decision being mediated, or 
designee;
    (3) The holder whose term grazing permit is the subject of the 
Deciding Officer's decision and who has requested mediation in the 
notice of appeal;
    (4) The holder's creditors, if applicable; and
    (5) Legal counsel, if applicable. The Forest Service will have legal 
counsel participate only if the permittee choose to have legal counsel.
    (c) Timeframe. When an appellant simultaneously requests mediation 
at the time an appeal is filed (Sec. 251.84), the Reviewing Officer 
shall immediately notify, by certified mail, all parties to the appeal 
that, in order to allow for mediation, the appeal is suspended for 45 
calendar days from the date of the Reviewing Officer's notice. If 
agreement has not been reached at the end of 45 calendar days, but it 
appears to the Deciding Officer that a mediated agreement may soon be 
reached, the Reviewing Officer may notify, by certified mail, all 
parties to the appeal that the period for mediation is extended for a 
period of up to 15 calendar days from the end of the 45-day appeal 
suspension period. If a mediated agreement cannot be reached under the 
specified timeframes, the Reviewing Officer shall immediately notify, by 
certified mail, all parties to the appeal that mediation was 
unsuccessful, that the stay granted during mediation is lifted, and that 
the timeframes and procedures applicable to an appeal (Sec. 251.89) are 
reinstated as of the date of such notice.
    (d) Confidentiality. Mediation sessions shall be confidential; 
moreover, dispute

[[Page 326]]

resolution communications, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 571(5), shall be 
confidential. However, the final agreement signed by the Forest Service 
official and the permit holder is subject to public disclosure.
    (e) Records. Notes taken or factual material received during 
mediation sessions are not to be entered as part of the appeal record.
    (f) Cost. The United States Government shall cover only incurred 
expenses of its own employees in mediation sessions.
    (g) Exparte communication. Except to request a time extension or 
communicate the results of mediation pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, the Deciding Officer, or designee, shall not discuss mediation 
and/or appeal matters with the Reviewing Officer.

                 Subpart D--Access to Non-Federal Lands

    Source: 56 FR 27417, June 14, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 251.110  Scope and application.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart set forth the procedures by 
which landowners may apply for access across National Forest System 
lands and the terms and conditions that govern any special use or other 
authorization that is issued by the Forest Service to permit such 
access.
    (b) These regulations apply to access across all National Forest 
System lands, including Congressionally designated areas, and supplement 
the regulations in subpart B of this part, and in parts 212 and 293 of 
this chapter. The regulations of this subpart do not affect rights-of-
way established under authority of R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932); rights-of-
way transferred to States under 23 U.S.C. 317; access rights outstanding 
in third parties at the time the United States acquired the land; or the 
rights reserved in conveyances to the United States and in other 
easements granted by an authorized officer of the Forest Service. Except 
for the aforementioned rights-of-way, currently valid special-use 
authorizations will become subject to the rules of this subpart upon 
expiration, termination, reversion, modification, or reauthorization.
    (c) Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this part and 
in parts 212 and 293 of this chapter, as appropriate, landowners shall 
be authorized such access as the authorized officer deems to be adequate 
to secure them the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land.
    (d) ln those cases where a landowner's ingress or egress across 
National Forest System lands would require surface disturbance or would 
require the use of Government-owned roads, trails, or transportation 
facilities not authorized for general public use, the landowner must 
apply for and receive a special-use or road-use authorization 
documenting the occupancy and use authorized on National Forest System 
lands or facilities and identifying the landowner's rights, privileges, 
responsibilities, and obligations.
    (e) Where ingress and egress will require the use of existing 
Government-owned roads, trails, or other transportation facilities which 
are open and available for general public use, use by the landowner 
shall be in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.
    (f) The rules of this subpart do not apply to access within 
conservation system units in Alaska which are subject to title XI of the 
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101), except 
for access to inholdings authorized by section 1110(b) of that Act.
    (g) Where there is existing access or a right of access to a 
property over non-National Forest land or over public roads that is 
adequate or that can be made adequate, there is no obligation to grant 
additional access through National Forest System lands.

    Access means the ability of landowners to have ingress and egress to 
their lands. It does not include rights-of-way for power lines or other 
utilities.

[[Page 327]]

    Adequate access means a route and method of access to non-Federal 
land that provides for reasonable use and enjoyment of the non-Federal 
land consistent with similarly situated non-Federal land and that 
minimizes damage or disturbance to National Forest System lands and 
resources.
    Congressionally designated area means lands which are within the 
boundaries of a component of the National Wilderness Preservation 
System, National Wild and Scenic River System, National Trails System, 
and also National Monuments, Recreation, and Scenic Areas within the 
National Forest System, and similar areas designated by Federal statute.
    Landowner(s) means the owner(s) of non-Federal land or interests in 
land within the boundaries of the National Forest System.


<R05>
Sec. 251.112  Application requirements.

    (a) A landowner shall apply for access across National Forest System 
lands in accordance with the application requirements of Sec. 251.54 of 
this part. Such application shall specifically include a statement of 
the intended mode of access to, and uses of, the non-Federal land for 
which the special-use authorization is requested.
    (b) The application shall disclose the historic access to the 
landowner's property and any rights of access which may exist over non-
federally owned land and shall provide reasons why these means of access 
do not provide adequate access to the landowners property.
    (c) The information required to apply for access across National 
Forest lands under this subpart is approved for use under subpart B of 
this part and assigned OMB control number 0596-0082.


<R05>
Sec. 251.113  Instrument of authorization.

    To grant authority to construct and/or use facilities and structures 
on National Forest System lands for access to non-Federal lands, the 
authorized officer shall issue a special-use authorization in 
conformance with the provisions of subpart B of this part or a road-use 
permit. In cases where Road Rights-of-way Construction And Use 
Agreements are in effect, the authorized officer may grant an easement 
in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 251.114  Criteria, terms and conditions.

    (a) In issuing a special-use authorization for access to non-Federal 
lands, the authorized officer shall authorize only those access 
facilities or modes of access that are needed for the reasonable use and 
enjoyment of the land and that minimize the impacts on the Federal 
resources. The authorizing officer shall determine what constitutes 
reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands based on contemporaneous uses 
made of similarly situated lands in the area and any other relevant 
criteria.
    (b) Landowners must pay an appropriate fee for the authorized use of 
National Forest System lands in accordance with Sec. 251.57 of this 
part.
    (c) A landowner may be required to provide a reciprocal grant of 
access to the United States across the landowner's property where such 
reciprocal right is deemed by the authorized officer to be necessary for 
the management of adjacent Federal land. In such case, the landowner 
shall receive the fair market value of the rights-of-way granted to the 
United States. If the value of the rights-of-way obtained by the 
Government exceeds the value of the rights-of-way granted, the 
difference in value will be paid to the landowner. If the value of the 
rights-of-way across Government land exceeds the value of the rights-of-
way across the private land, an appropriate adjustment will be made in 
the fee charged for the special-use authorization as provided in 
Sec. 251.57(b)(5) of this part.
    (d) For access across National Forest System lands that will have 
significant non-Forest user traffic, a landowner may be required to 
construct new roads or reconstruct existing roads to bring the roads to 
a safe and adequate standard. A landowner also may be required to 
provide for the operation and maintenance of the road. This may be done 
by arranging for such road to be made part of the local public road 
system, or formation of a local improvement district to assume the 
responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the road as either 
a private road or as a

[[Page 328]]

public road, as determined to be appropriate by the authorizing officer.
    (e) When access is tributary to or dependent on forest development 
roads, and traffic over these roads arising from the use of landowner's 
lands exceeds their safe capacity or will cause damage to the roadway, 
the landowner(s) may be required to obtain a road-use permit and to 
perform such reconstruction as necessary to bring the road to a safe and 
adequate standard to accommodate such traffic in addition to the 
Government's traffic. In such case, the landowner(s) also shall enter 
into a cooperative maintenance arrangement with the Forest Service to 
ensure that the landowner's commensurate maintenance responsibilities 
are met or shall make arrangements to have the jurisdiction and 
maintenance responsibility for the road assumed by the appropriate 
public road authority.
    (f) In addition to ensuring that applicable terms and conditions of 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met, the authorizing 
officer, prior to issuing any access authorization, must also ensure 
that:
    (1) The landowner has demonstrated a lack of any existing rights or 
routes of access available by deed or under State or common law;
    (2) The route is so located and constructed as to minimize adverse 
impacts on soils, fish and wildlife, scenic, cultural, threatened and 
endangered species, and other values of the Federal land;
    (3) The location and method of access is as consistent as reasonably 
possible with the management of any congressionally designated area and 
is consistent with Forest Land and Resource Management Plans or the 
plans are amended to accommodate the access grant, and;
    (4) When access routes exist across the adjacent non-Federal lands 
or the best route as determined by the authorizing officer is across 
non-Federal lands, the applicant landowner has demonstrated that all 
legal recourse to obtain reasonable access across adjacent non-Federal 
lands has been exhausted or has little chance of success.
    (g) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the 
following factors shall be considered in authorizing access to non-
federally owned lands over National Forest System lands which are 
components of the National Wilderness Preservation System:
    (1) The use of means of ingress and egress which have been or are 
being customarily used with respect to similarly situated non-Federal 
land used for similar purposes;
    (2) The combination of routes and modes of travel, including 
nonmotorized modes, which will cause the least lasting impact on the 
wilderness but, at the same time, will permit the reasonable use of the 
non-federally owned land;
    (3) The examination of a voluntary acquisition of land or interests 
in land by exchange, purchase, or donation to modify or eliminate the 
need to use wilderness areas for access purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 251.121   Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions in subpart B of this part, the 
following terms apply to this subpart:
    Best application--the application, as determined by the authorized 
officer, that best meets the evaluation criteria contained in a 
prospectus to solicit visitor services.
    Conservation System Unit (CSU) as it relates to the Tongass and 
Chugach National Forests in Alaska--a National Forest Monument or any 
unit of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails 
System, or National Wilderness Preservation System, including existing 
units and any such unit established, designated, or expanded hereafter.
    Controlling interest--in the case of a corporation, an interest, 
beneficial or otherwise, of sufficient outstanding voting securities or 
capital of the business so as to permit the exercise of managerial 
authority over the actions and operations of the corporation or election 
of a majority of the board of directors of the corporation. In the case 
of a partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, or individual 
entrepreneurship, a beneficial ownership of or interest in the entity or 
its capital so as to permit the exercise of managerial authority over 
the actions and operations of the entity. In other circumstances, any 
arrangement under which a third party has the ability to exercise 
management authority over the actions or operations of the business.
    Historical operator--a holder of a valid special use authorization 
to provide visitor services in a CSU under Forest Service jurisdiction 
who:
    (1) On or before January 1, 1979, was lawfully and adequately 
providing visitor services in that CSU;
    (2) Has continued lawfully and adequately to provide the same or 
similar types of visitor services within that CSU; and
    (3) Is otherwise determined by the authorized officer to have a 
right to continue to provide the same or similar visitor services.
    Local area--any site within 100 miles of the location within a CSU 
where any visitor services covered by a single solicitation by the 
Forest Service are to be authorized.
    Local resident:

local area for 12 consecutive months prior to issuance of a solicitation 
of applications for a visitor services authorization for a CSU; who 
maintain their primary, permanent residence and business within the 
local area; and who, whenever absent from this primary, permanent 
residence, have the intention of returning to it.
    (2) For corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, joint

ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3197).
    Preferred operator--a Native Corporation that is determined, 
pursuant to Sec. 251.123, to be most directly affected by establishment 
or expansion of a CSU; or a local resident, as defined in this section, 
who competes for a visitor service special use authorization under 
Sec. 251.124 of this subpart.
    Responsive application--an application that is received in a timely 
manner and that meets the requirements stated in the prospectus.
    Visitor service--any service or activity for which persons who visit 
a CSU pay a fee, commission, brokerage, or other compensation, including

<R05>
Sec. 251.122  Historical operator special use authorizations.

    (a) A historical operator has the right to continue to provide 
visitor services under appropriate terms and conditions contained in a 
special use authorization, as long as such services are determined by 
the authorized officer to be consistent with the purposes

[[Page 330]]

for which the CSU was established or expanded. A historical operator may 
not operate without such an authorization.
    (b) Any person who qualifies as a historical operator under this 
subpart and who wishes to exercise the rights granted to historical 
operators under section 1307(a) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(a)) must 
notify the authorized officer responsible for the CSU.
    (c) A historical operator may apply for a special use authorization 
to provide visitor services similar to but in lieu of those provided by 
that historical operator before January 1, 1979. The authorized officer 
shall grant the application if those visitor services are determined by 
the authorized officer to be:
    (1) Consistent with the purposes for which the applicable CSU was 
established or expanded;
    (2) Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by 
the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and
    (3) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.
    (d) Upon the authorized officer's determination that the person 
qualifies as a historical operator, under either paragraph (a) or 
paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized officer shall amend the 
current special use authorization or issue a new special use 
authorization to identify that portion of the authorized services that 
is deemed to be historical operations. The special use authorization 
shall identify the location, type, and frequency or volume of visitor 
services to be provided.
    (e) When a historical operator's special use authorization expires, 
the authorized officer shall offer to reissue the special use 
authorization for the same or similar visitor services, as long as the 
visitor services remain consistent with the purposes for which the CSU 
was established or expanded, the historical operator was lawfully and 
adequately providing visitor services under the previous special use 
authorization, and the historical operator continues to possess the 
capability to provide the visitor services adequately.
    (1) If the operator accepts the offer to reissue, the authorized 
officer shall issue a new special use authorization that clearly 
identifies the historical operations as required by paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (2) If the authorized officer determines that it is necessary to 
reduce the visitor services to be provided by a historical operator, the 
authorized officer shall modify the historical operator's special use 
authorization to reflect the reduced services as follows:
    (i) If more than one historical operator provides services in the 
area where visitor service capacity is to be reduced, the authorized 
officer shall apportion the reduction among the historical operators, 
taking into account historical operating levels and such other factors 
as are relevant to achieve a proportionate reduction among the 
operators.
    (ii) If the reductions in visitor service capacity make it necessary 
to reduce operators in an area, the authorized officer shall select, 
through a competitive process that is limited to historical operators 
only, the operator or operators to receive a special use authorization 
from among the historical operators. Historical operators participating 
in this competitive process may not claim a preference as a preferred 
operator under Sec. 251.124.
    (f) Any of the following shall result in the loss of historical 
operator status:
    (1) Revocation of a special use authorization for historical types 
and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the special use authorization;
    (2) A historical operator's refusal of an offer to reissue a special 
use authorization made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;
    (3) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator 
through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or otherwise, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section; or
    (4) An operator's failure to provide the authorized services for a 
period of more than 24 consecutive months.
    (g) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator 
that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an 
individual or individuals, who were personally engaged in the visitor 
service activities of the historical operator before January 1,

[[Page 331]]

1979, shall not be deemed a change in the historical operator's 
controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.
    (h) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authorized officer 
from authorizing persons other than historical operators to provide 
visitor services in the same area, as long as historical operators 
receive authorization to provide visitor services that are the same as 
or similar to those they provided on or before January 1, 1979.
    (i) If an authorized officer grants to a historical operator an 
increase in the scope or level of visitor services from what was 
provided on or before January 1, 1979, beyond what was authorized under 
paragraph (d) of this section, for either the same or similar visitor 
services, the historical operator has no right of preference for the 
increased amount of authorized services. If additional operations are 
authorized, the special use authorization shall explicitly state that 
they are not subject to the historical operator preference.


<R05>
Sec. 251.123  Most directly affected Native Corporation determination.

    (a) Before issuance of the first special use authorization for a 
specific CSU pursuant to Sec. 251.124 on or after the effective date of 
this subpart, the authorized officer shall give notice to Native 
Corporations interested in providing visitor services within the CSU and 
give them an opportunity to submit an application to be considered the 
Native Corporation most directly affected by the establishment or 
expansion of the CSU under section 1307(b) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 
1397(b)). In giving notice of the application procedure, the authorized 
officer shall make clear that this is the only opportunity to apply for 
most directly affected status for that particular CSU.
    (1) At a minimum, an application from an interested Native 
Corporation shall include the following:
    (i) Name, address, and telephone number of the Native Corporation; 
date of its incorporation; its articles of incorporation and structure; 
and the name of the applicable CSU and the solicitation to which the 
Native Corporation is responding;
    (ii) Location of the Native Corporation's population centers; and
    (iii) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts (including changes 
in historical and traditional use and landownership patterns) on the 
Native Corporation resulting from establishment or expansion of the 
applicable CSU.
    (2) In addition to the minimum information required by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, Native Corporations may submit such additional 
information as they consider relevant.
    (b) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native 
Corporations, the authorized officer shall determine the most directly 
affected Native Corporation considering the following factors:
    (1) Distance and accessibility from the Native Corporation's 
population centers and/or business address to the applicable CSU;
    (2) Socioeconomic impacts (including changes in historical and 
traditional use and landownership patterns) on Native Corporations 
resulting from establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU; and
    (3) Information provided by Native Corporations and other 
information considered relevant by the authorized officer to assessment 
of the effects of establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU.
    (c) In the event that two or more Native Corporations are determined 
to be equally affected for purposes of the most directly affected Native 
Corporation determination pursuant to this section, each such Native 
Corporation shall be considered a preferred operator under this subpart.
    (d) A Native Corporation determined to be most directly affected for 
a CSU shall maintain that status for all future visitor service 
solicitations for that CSU.


<R05>
Sec. 251.124  Preferred operator competitive special use authorization 
procedures.

    (a) In selecting persons to provide visitor services for a CSU, the 
authorized officer shall, if the number of visitor service 
authorizations is to be limited, give a preference (subject to any 
rights of historical operators under this subpart) to preferred 
operators as

[[Page 332]]

defined in this subpart who are determined to be qualified to provide 
such visitor services.
    (b) In such circumstances, the authorized officer shall solicit 
applications competitively by issuing a prospectus for persons to apply 
for a visitor services authorization. Notwithstanding Forest Service 
outfitting and guiding policy in Forest Service Handbook 2709.11, 
chapter 40, when authorizations, including priority use permits for 
activities other than sport hunting and fishing, expire in accordance 
with their terms, they shall not be reissued if there is a need to limit 
use and when there is competitive interest by preferred operators.
    (c) To qualify as a preferred operator under this subpart, an 
applicant responding to a solicitation made under this section must be 
determined by the authorized officer to be a local resident as defined 
in Sec. 251.121 of this subpart, or the Native Corporation most directly 
affected by establishment or expansion of the CSU covered by the 
solicitation pursuant to Sec. 251.123 of this subpart.
    (d) Applicants seeking preferred operator status based on local 
residency must provide documentation verifying their claim. Factors 
demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent 
residence and business include, but are not limited to, the permanent 
address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, tax 
returns, and voter registration.
    (e) An application from a preferred operator in the form of a 
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, individual 
entrepreneurship, nonprofit entity, or other form of organization shall 
be considered valid only when the application documents to the 
satisfaction of the authorized officer that the preferred operator holds 
the controlling interest in the corporation, partnership, limited 
partnership, joint venture, individual entrepreneurship, nonprofit 
entity, or other form of organization.
    (f) A qualified preferred operator shall be given preference, 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, over all other applicants, 
except with respect to use allocated to historical operators pursuant to 
Sec. 251.122 of this subpart.
    (g) If the best application from a preferred operator is at least 
substantially equal to the best application from a non-preferred 
operator, the preferred operator shall be issued the visitor service 
authorization. If an application from an applicant other than a 
preferred operator is determined to be the best application (and no 
preferred operator submits a responsive application that is 
substantially equal to it), the preferred operator who submitted the 
best application from among the applications submitted by preferred 
operators shall be given the opportunity, by amending its application, 
to meet the terms and conditions of the best application received. If 
the amended application of that preferred operator is considered by the 
authorized officer to be at least substantially equal to the best 
application, the preferred operator shall be issued the visitor service 
authorization. If a preferred operator does not amend its application to 
meet the terms and conditions of the best application, the authorized 
officer shall issue the visitor service authorization to the applicant 
who submitted the best application in response to the prospectus.


<R05>
Sec. 251.125  Preferred operator privileges and limitations.

    (a) A preferred operator has no preference within a National Forest 
in Alaska beyond that authorized by section 1307 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 
1397) and by Sec. 251.124 of this subpart.
    (b) Local residents and most directly affected Native Corporations 
have equal priority for consideration in providing visitor services 
pursuant to Sec. 251.124 of this subpart.
    (c) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit the authorized officer 
from issuing special use authorizations to other applicants within the 
CSU, as long as the requirements of Sec. 251.124 are met.
    (d) If an operator qualifies as a local resident for any part of an 
area designated in the solicitation for a specific visitor service, in 
matters related solely to that solicitation, the operator shall be 
treated as a local resident for the entire area covered by that 
solicitation.

[[Page 333]]

    (e) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, 
assigned, transferred, or devised, either directly or indirectly, in 
whole or in part.


<R05>
Sec. 251.126  Appeals.

    Decisions related to the issuance of special use authorizations in 
response to written solicitations by the Forest Service under this 
subpart or related to the modification of special use authorizations to 
reflect historical use are subject to administrative appeal under 
subpart C of this part.

applicable laws.

    Source: 59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 254.1  Scope and applicability.

    (a) These rules set forth the procedures for conducting exchanges of 
National Forest System lands. The procedures in these rules may be 
supplemented by instructions issued to Forest Service officers in 
Chapter 5400 of the Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbooks 
5409.12 and 5409.13.
    (b) These rules apply to all National Forest System exchanges of 
land or interests in land, including but not limited to minerals, water 
rights, and timber, except those exchanges made under the authority of 
Small Tracts Act of January 12, 1983 (16 U.S.C. 521c-521i) (36 CFR part 
254, subpart C), and as otherwise noted. These rules also apply to other 
methods of acquisition, where indicated.
    (c) The application of these rules to exchanges made under the 
authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 
U.S.C. 1621), or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 
U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to those provisions which do not conflict 
with the provisions of these Acts.
    (d) Unless the parties to an exchange otherwise agree, land 
exchanges for which the parties have agreed in writing to initiate prior 
to April 7, 1994, will proceed in accordance with the rules and 
regulations in effect at the time of the agreement.
    (e) Except for exchanges requiring cash equalization payments made 
available through the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 460[1]9), the boundaries of a national forest are 
automatically extended to encompass lands acquired under the Weeks Act 
of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), provided the

[[Page 334]]

acquired lands are contiguous to existing national forest boundaries and 
total no more than 3,000 acres in each exchange.
    (f) Exchanges under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, or the General 
Exchange Act of March 20, 1922, may involve land-for-timber (non-Federal 
land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber), or timber-for-land 
(the exchange of the rights to non-Federal timber for Federal land), or 
tripartite land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to 
Federal timber cut by a third party in behalf of the exchange parties).
    (g) Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands are 
authorized by a number of statutes, depending upon the status 
(conditions of ownership) of such lands and the purpose for which an 
exchange is to be made. The status of National Forest System land is 
determined by the method by which the land or interests therein became 
part of the National Forest System. Unless otherwise provided by law, 
lands acquired by the United States in exchanges assume the same status 
as the Federal lands conveyed.
    (h) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended 
(43 U.S.C. 1701), is supplemental to all applicable exchange laws, 
except the cash equalization provisions of the Sisk Act of December 4, 
1967, as amended (16 U.S.C. 484a).

meanings set forth in this section.
    Acquisition means the attainment of lands or interests in lands by 
the Secretary, acting on behalf of the United States, by exchange, 
purchase, donation, or eminent domain.
    Adjustment to relative values means compensation for exchange-

party, which ordinarily would be borne by the other party. These 
adjustments do not alter the agreed upon value of the lands involved in 
an exchange.
    Agreement to initiate means a written, nonbinding statement of 
present intent to initiate and pursue an exchange, which is signed by 
the parties and which may be amended by consent of the parties or

    Appraisal or appraisal report means a written statement 
independently and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting 
forth an opinion as to the market value of the lands or interests in 
lands as of a specific date(s), supported by the presentation and 
analysis of relevant market information.
    Approximately equal value means a comparative estimate of value of 
the lands involved in an exchange which have readily apparent and 
substantially similar elements of value, such as location, size, use, 
physical characteristics, and other amenities.

as to appraised value, performed by an arbitrator appointed by the 
Secretary from a list recommended by the American Arbitration 
Association.
    Assembled land exchange means an exchange of Federal land for a 
package of multiple ownership parcels of non-Federal land consolidated 
for purposes of one land exchange transaction.
    Authorized officer means a Forest Service line or staff officer who 
has been delegated the authority and responsibility to make decisions 
and perform the duties described in this subpart.
    Bargaining is a process other than arbitration, by which parties 
attempt to resolve a dispute concerning the appraised value of the lands 
involved in an exchange.
    Federal lands means any lands or interests in lands, such as mineral 
and timber interests, that are owned by the United States and 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture through the Chief of the 
Forest Service, without regard to how the United States acquired 
ownership.
    Hazardous substances are those substances designated under 
Environmental Protection Agency regulations at 40 CFR part 302.
    Highest and best use means an appraiser's supported opinion of the 
most probable and legal use of a property, based on market evidence, as 
of the date of valuation.

[[Page 335]]

    Lands means any land and/or interests in land.
    Market value means the most probable price in cash, or terms 
equivalent to cash, which lands or interest in lands should bring in a 
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair 
sale, where the buyer and seller each acts prudently and knowledgeably, 
and the price is not affected by undue influence.
    Mineral laws means the mining and mineral leasing laws applicable to 
Federally owned lands and minerals reserved from the public domain for 
national forest purposes and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C.

    Party means the United States or any person, State, or local 
government who enters into an agreement to initiate an exchange.
    Person means any individual, corporation, or other legal entity 
legally capable to hold title to and convey land. An individual must be

laws of the United States or of the State where the land is located or 
the corporation is incorporated. No Member of Congress may participate 
in a land exchange with an agency of the United States, as set forth in 
18 U.S.C. 431-433.
    Public land laws means that body of non-mineral land laws dealing

    Statement of value means a written report prepared by a qualified 
appraiser in conformance with the minimum standards of the Uniform 
Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice that states the appraiser's 
conclusion(s) of value.


<R05>
Sec. 254.3  Requirements.

    (a) Discretionary nature of exchanges. The Secretary is not required 
to exchange any Federal lands. Land exchanges are discretionary, 
voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal 
parties. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding exchange 
agreement, any party may withdraw from and terminate an exchange 
proposal at any time during the exchange process.
    (b) Determination of public interest. The authorized officer may 
complete an exchange only after a determination is made that the public 
interest will be well served.
    (1) Factors to consider. When considering the public interest, the 
authorized officer shall give full consideration to the opportunity to 
achieve better management of Federal lands and resources, to meet the 
needs of State and local residents and their economies, and to secure 
important objectives, including but not limited to: protection of fish 
and wildlife habitats, cultural resources, watersheds, and wilderness 
and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreation opportunities and public 
access; consolidation of lands and/or interests in lands, such as 
mineral and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management 
and development; consolidation of split estates; expansion of 
communities; accommodation of existing or planned land use 
authorizations (Sec. 254.4(c)(4); promotion of multiple-use values; 
implementation of applicable Forest Land and Resource Management Plans; 
and fulfillment of public needs.
    (2) Findings. To determine that an exchange well serves the public 
interest, the authorized officer must find that--

[[Page 336]]

    (i) The resource values and the public objectives served by the non-
Federal lands or interests to be acquired must equal or exceed the 
resource values and the public objectives served by the Federal lands to 
be conveyed, and
    (ii) The intended use of the conveyed Federal land will not 
substantially conflict with established management objectives on 
adjacent Federal lands, including Indian Trust lands.
    (3) Documentation. The findings and the supporting rationale shall 
be documented and made part of the administrative record.
    (c) Equal value exchanges. Except as provided in Sec. 254.11 of this 
subpart, lands or interests to be exchanged must be of equal value or 
equalized in accordance with the methods set forth in Sec. 254.12 of 
this subpart. An exchange of lands or interests shall be based on market 
value as determined by the Secretary through appraisal(s), through 
bargaining based on appraisal(s), through other acceptable and commonly 
recognized methods of determining market value, or through arbitration.
    (d) Same-State exchanges. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the 
Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange must be located 
within the same State.
    (e) Congressional designations. Upon acceptance of title by the 
United States, lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior by 
exchange under the authority granted by the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976, as amended, which are within the boundaries of 
any unit of the National Forest System, the National Wild and Scenic 
Rivers System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness 
Preservation System, or any other system established by Act of Congress; 
or the boundaries of any national conservation area or national 
recreation area established by Act of Congress, immediately are reserved 
for and become a part of the unit or area in which they are located, 
without further action by the Secretary of the Interior, and, 
thereafter, shall be managed in accordance with all laws, rules, 
regulations, and land resource management plans applicable to such unit 
or area.
    (f) Land and resource management planning. The authorized officer 
shall consider only those exchange proposals that are consistent with 
land and resource management plans (36 CFR part 219). Lands acquired by 
exchange that are located within areas having an administrative 
designation established through the land management planning process 
shall automatically become part of the area within which they are 
located, without further action by the Forest Service, and shall be 
managed in accordance with the laws, rules, regulations, and land and 
resource management plan applicable to such area.
    (g) Environmental analysis. After an agreement to initiate an 
exchange is signed, the authorized officer shall undertake an 
environmental analysis in accordance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4371), the Council on Environmental 
Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and Forest Service 
environmental policies and procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 
1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). In making this analysis, the 
authorized officer shall consider timely written comments received in 
response to the exchange notice published pursuant to Sec. 254.8 of this 
subpart.
    (h) Reservations or restrictions in the public interest. In any 
exchange, the authorized officer shall reserve such rights or retain 
such interests as are needed to protect the public interest or shall 
otherwise restrict the use of Federal lands to be exchanged, as 
appropriate. The use or development of lands conveyed out of Federal 
ownership are subject to any restrictions imposed by the conveyance 
documents and all laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and 
local governing bodies.
    (i) Hazardous substances.
    (1) Federal lands. The authorized officer shall determine whether 
hazardous substances are known to be present on the Federal lands 
involved in the exchange and shall provide notice of known storage, 
release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal lands in the 
contract agreement and in the conveyance document, pursuant to 40 CFR 
part 373 and 42 U.S.C. 9620. For

[[Page 337]]

purposes of this section, the notice of hazardous substances on involved 
Federal lands in an agreement to initiate an exchange or an exchange 
agreement meets the requirements for notices established in 40 CFR part 
373. Unless the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party 
under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a) and participated as an owner, or in the 
operation, arrangement, generation, or transportation of the hazardous 
substances found on the Federal land, the conveyance document from the 
United States must contain a covenant warranting that all remedial 
action necessary to protect human health and the environment with 
respect to any such substances remaining on the property has been taken 
before the date of transfer and that any additional remedial action 
found necessary after the transfer shall be conducted by the United 
States, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3). The conveyance document must 
also reserve to the United States the right of access to the conveyed 
property if remedial or corrective action is required after the date of 
transfer. Where the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party 
with respect to the property, it may be appropriate to enter into an 
agreement as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 9607(e) whereby that party would 
indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless against 
any loss or cleanup costs after conveyance.
    (2) Non-Federal lands. The non-Federal party shall notify the 
authorized officer of any hazardous substances known to have been 
released, stored, or disposed of on the non-Federal land, pursuant to 
Sec. 254.4 of this subpart. Notwithstanding such notice, the authorized 
officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be 
present on the non-Federal land involved in an exchange. If hazardous 
substances are known or believed to be present on the non-Federal land, 
the authorized officer shall reach an agreement with the non-Federal 
party regarding the responsibility for appropriate response action 
concerning the hazardous substances before completing the exchange. The 
terms of this agreement and any appropriate ``hold harmless agreement'' 
shall be included in an exchange agreement, pursuant to Sec. 254.14 of 
this subpart.
    (j) Legal description of properties. All lands subject to an 
exchange must be properly described on the basis of either a survey 
executed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and 
standards of the United States or, if those laws and standards cannot be 
applied, the lands shall be properly described and clearly locatable by 
other means as may be prescribed or allowed by law.
    (k) Special review. Except as provided in this paragraph, land 
acquisitions of $150,000 or more in value made under the authority of 
the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), must be 
submitted to Congress for oversight review, pursuant to the Act of 
October 22, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 521b). However, minor and 
insignificant changes in land acquisition proposals need not be 
resubmitted for congressional oversight, provided the general concept of 
and basis for the acquisition remain the same.


<R05>
Sec. 254.4  Agreement to initiate an exchange.

    (a) Exchanges may be proposed by the Forest Service or by any 
person, State, or local government. Initial exchange proposals should be 
directed to the authorized officer responsible for the management of 
Federal lands proposed for exchange.
    (b) To assess the feasibility of an exchange proposal, the 
prospective parties may agree to obtain a preliminary estimate of the 
values of the lands involved in the proposal. A qualified appraiser must 
prepare the preliminary estimate.
    (c) If the authorized officer agrees to proceed with an exchange 
proposal, all prospective parties shall execute a nonbinding agreement 
to initiate an exchange. At a minimum, the agreement must include:
    (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange 
and the status of their ownership or ability to provide title to the 
land;
    (2) A description of the lands or interest in lands being considered 
for exchange;
    (3) A statement by a party, other than the United States and State 
and

[[Page 338]]

local governments, that such party is a citizen of the United States or 
a corporation or other legal entity subject to the laws of the United 
States or a State thereof;
    (4) A description of the appurtenant rights proposed to be exchanged 
or reserved; any authorized uses, including grants, permits, easements, 
or leases; and any known unauthorized uses, outstanding interests, 
exceptions, covenants, restrictions, title defects or encumbrances;
    (5) A time schedule for completing the proposed exchange;
    (6) An assignment of responsibility for performance of required 
functions and for costs associated with processing the exchange;
    (7) A statement specifying whether compensation for costs assumed 
will be allowed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 254.7 of this 
subpart;
    (8) Notice of any known release, storage, or disposal of hazardous 
substances on involved Federal or non-Federal lands and any commitments 
regarding responsibility for removal or other remedial actions 
concerning such substances on involved non-Federal lands (Sec. 254.3(i) 
and Sec. 254.14);
    (9) A grant of permission by each party to physically examine the 
lands offered by the other party;
    (10) The terms of any assembled land exchange arrangement, pursuant 
to Sec. 254.5 of this subpart;
    (11) A statement as to the arrangements for relocation of any 
tenants occupying non-Federal lands pursuant to Sec. 254.15 of this 
subpart;
    (12) A notice to an owner-occupant of the voluntary basis for the 
acquisition of the non-Federal lands, pursuant to Sec. 254.15 of this 
subpart; and
    (13) A statement as to the manner in which documents of conveyance 
will be exchanged, should the exchange proposal be successfully 
completed.
    (d) Unless the parties agree to some other schedule, no later than 
90 days from the date of the executed agreement to initiate an exchange, 
the parties shall arrange for appraisals which are to be completed 
within timeframes and under such terms as are negotiated. In the absence 
of current market information reliably supporting value, the parties may 
agree to use other acceptable and commonly recognized methods to 
estimate value.
    (e) An agreement to initiate may be amended by consent of the 
parties or terminated at any time upon written notice by any party.
    (f) Entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange does not 
legally bind any party to proceed with processing or to consummate a 
proposed exchange, or to reimburse or pay damages to any party to a 
proposed exchange that is not consummated or to anyone doing business 
with any such party.
    (g) The withdrawal from an exchange proposal by an authorized 
officer at any time prior to the notice of decision, pursuant to 
Sec. 254.13 of this subpart, is not appealable under 36 CFR part 215 or 
36 CFR part 251, subpart C.

<R05>
Sec. 254.5  Assembled land exchanges.

    (a) Whenever the authorized officer determines it to be practicable, 
an assembled land exchange arrangement may be used to facilitate 
exchanges and reduce costs.
    (b) The parties to an exchange may agree to such an arrangement 
where multiple ownership parcels of non-Federal lands are consolidated 
into a package for the purpose of completing one exchange transaction.
    (c) An assembled land exchange arrangement must be documented in the 
agreement to initiate an exchange, pursuant to Sec. 254.4 of this 
subpart.
    (d) Value of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an 
assembled land exchange arrangement shall be estimated pursuant to 
Sec. 254.9 of this subpart.

[59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1994; 59 FR 15501, Apr. 1, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 254.6  Segregative effect.

    (a) If a proposal is made to exchange Federal lands, the authorized 
officer may request the appropriate State Office of the Bureau of 
Management (BLM) to segregate the Federal lands by a notation on the 
public land records. Subject to valid existing rights, the Federal lands 
shall be segregated from appropriation under the

[[Page 339]]

public land laws and mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years 
from the date of record notation.
    (b) Any interests of the United States in the non-Federal lands that 
are covered by the exchange proposal may be noted and segregated from 
appropriation under the mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years 
from the date of notation.
    (c) The segregative effect terminates as follows:
    (1) Automatically, upon issuance of a patent or other document of 
conveyance to the affected lands;
    (2) On the date and time specified in an opening order, published in 
the Federal Register by the appropriate BLM State Office, if a decision 
is made not to proceed with the exchange or upon removal of any lands 
from the exchange proposal; or
    (3) Automatically, at the end of the segregation period not to 
exceed 5 years from the date of notation on the public land records, 
whichever occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 254.7  Assumption of costs.

    (a) Generally, each party to an exchange will bear their own costs 
of the exchange. However, if the authorized officer finds it is in the 
public interest as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an 
agreement to initiate an exchange may provide that:
    (1) One or more of the parties may assume, without compensation, all 
or part of the costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the 
authorized officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other 
parties; or
    (2) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
parties may agree to make adjustments to the relative values involved in 
an exchange transaction, in order to compensate parties for assuming 
costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the authorized 
officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other parties. These 
costs or services may include but are not limited to: land surveys; 
appraisals; mineral examinations; timber cruises; title searches; title 
curative actions; cultural resource surveys and mitigation; hazardous 
substance surveys and controls; removal of encumbrances; arbitration, 
including all fees; bargaining; cure of deficiencies preventing highest 
and best use of the land; conduct of public hearings; assemblage of non-
Federal parcels from multiple ownerships; and the expenses of complying 
with laws, regulations, and policies applicable to exchange 
transactions, or which are necessary to bring the Federal and non-
Federal lands involved in the exchange to their highest and best use for 
appraisal and exchange purposes.
    (b) As a condition of an agreement to initiate, the authorized 
officer may agree to assume without compensation costs ordinarily borne 
by the non-Federal party or to compensate the non-Federal party for 
assuming Federal costs only on an exceptional basis when it is clearly 
in the public interest and when the authorized officer determines and 
documents that each of the following circumstances exist:
    (1) The amount of such cost assumed or compensation is reasonable 
and accurately reflects the value of the cost or service provided, or 
any responsibility and requirement assumed;
    (2) The proposed exchange is a high priority of the agency;
    (3) The land exchange must be expedited to protect important Federal 
resource values, such as congressionally designated areas or endangered 
species habitat;
    (4) Cash equalization funds are available for compensation of the 
non-Federal party; and
    (5) There are no other practicable means available to the authorized 
officer for meeting Federal exchange processing costs, responsibilities, 
or requirements.
    (c) The total amount of an adjustment agreed to as compensation for 
costs pursuant to this section shall not exceed the limitations set 
forth in Sec. 254.12(b) of this subpart.

[59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1994; 59 FR 15501, Apr. 1, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 254.8  Notice of exchange proposal.

    (a) Upon entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange, the 
authorized officer shall publish a notice once a week for four 
consecutive weeks in newspapers of general circulation in the counties 
in which the Federal and non-Federal lands or interests proposed

[[Page 340]]

for exchange are located. The authorized officer shall notify authorized 
users, the jurisdictional State and local governments, and the 
congressional delegation and shall make other distribution of the notice 
as appropriate. At a minimum, the notice shall include:
    (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange;
    (2) A description of the Federal and non-Federal lands being 
considered for exchange;
    (3) A statement as to the effect of segregation from appropriation 
under the public land laws and mineral laws, if applicable;
    (4) An invitation to the public to submit in writing any comments on 
or concerns about the exchange proposal, including advising the agency 
as to any liens, encumbrances, or other claims relating to the lands 
being considered for exchange; and
    (5) The deadline by which comments must be received, and the name, 
title, and address of the official to whom comments must be sent and 
from whom additional information may be obtained.
    (b) To be assured of consideration in the environmental analysis of 
the proposed exchange, all comments must be made in writing to the 
authorized officer and postmarked or delivered within 45 days after the 
initial date of publication.
    (c) The authorized officer is not required to republish legal 
descriptions of any lands that may be excluded from the final exchange 
transaction, provided such lands were identified in the notice of 
exchange proposal. In addition, minor corrections of land descriptions 
and other insignificant changes do not require republication.


<R05>
Sec. 254.9  Appraisals.

    The Federal and non-Federal parties to an exchange shall comply with 
the appraisal standards as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, and, to the extent appropriate, with the Uniform Appraisal 
Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions: Interagency Land Acquisition 
Conference 1992 (Washington, DC, 1992), ISBN 0-16-038050-2 when 
appraising the values of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in 
an exchange.
    (a) Appraiser qualifications.
    (1) A qualified appraiser(s) shall provide to the authorized officer 
appraisals estimating the market value of Federal and non-Federal 
properties involved in an exchange. A qualified appraiser may be an 
employee or a contractor to the Federal or non-Federal exchange parties. 
At a minimum, a qualified appraiser shall be an individual agreeable to 
all parties and approved by the authorized officer, who is competent, 
reputable, impartial, and has training and experience in appraising 
property similar to the property involved in the appraisal assignment.
    (2) Qualified appraisers shall possess qualifications consistent 
with State regulatory requirements that meet the intent of Title XI, 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 
(FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 3331). In the event a State or Territory does not 
have approved policies, practices, and procedures regulating the 
activities of appraisers, the Forest Service may establish appraiser 
qualification standards commensurate with those generally adopted by 
other States or Territories meeting the requirements of FIRREA.
    (b) Market value.
    (1) In estimating market value, the appraiser shall:
    (i) Determine the highest and best use of the property to be 
appraised;
    (ii) Estimate the value of the lands and interests as if in private 
ownership and available for sale in the open market;
    (iii) Include historic, wildlife, recreation, wilderness, scenic, 
cultural, or other resource values or amenities as reflected in prices 
paid for similar properties in the competitive market;
    (iv) Consider the contributory value of any interest in land such as 
water rights, minerals, or timber, to the extent they are consistent 
with the highest and best use of the property; and
    (v) If stipulated in the agreement to initiate in accordance with 
Sec. 254.4 of this subpart, estimate separately the value of each 
property optioned or acquired from multiple ownerships by the

[[Page 341]]

non-Federal party for purposes of exchange, pursuant to Sec. 254.5 of 
this subpart. In this case, the appraiser also must estimate the value 
of the Federal and non-Federal properties in a similar manner.
    (2) In estimating market value, the appraiser may not independently 
add the separate values of the fractional interests to be conveyed, 
unless market evidence indicates the following:
    (i) The various interests contribute their full value (pro rata) to 
the value of the whole; and
    (ii) The valuation is compatible with the highest and best use of 
the property.
    (3) In the absence of current market information reliably supporting 
value, the authorized officer may use other acceptable and commonly 
recognized methods to determine market value.
    (c) Appraisal report standards. Appraisals prepared for exchange 
purposes must contain the following minimum information:
    (1) A summary of facts and conclusions;
    (2) The purpose and/or the function of the appraisal, a definition 
of the estate being appraised, and a statement of the assumptions and 
limiting conditions affecting the appraisal assignment, if any;
    (3) An explanation of the extent of the appraiser's research and 
actions taken to collect and confirm information relied upon in 
estimating value;
    (4) An adequate description of the physical characteristics of the 
land being appraised; a statement of all encumbrances; title 
information; location, zoning, and present use; an analysis of highest 
and best use; and at least a 5-year sales history of the property;
    (5) A disclosure of any condition that is observed during the 
inspection of the property or becomes known to the appraiser through the 
normal research which would lead the appraiser to believe that hazardous 
substances may be present on the property being appraised;
    (6) A comparative market analysis and, if more than one method of 
valuation is used, an analysis and reconciliation of the methods used to 
support the appraiser's estimate of value;
    (7) A description of comparable sales, including a description of 
all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to 
the transaction, source and method of financing, effect of any favorable 
financing on sale price, and verification by a party involved in the 
transaction;
    (8) An estimate of market value;
    (9) The effective date of valuation, date of appraisal, signature, 
and certification of the appraiser;
    (10) A certification by the appraiser to the following:
    (i) The appraiser has personally contacted the property owner or 
designated representative and offered the owner an opportunity to be 
present during inspection of the property;
    (ii) The appraiser has personally examined the subject property and 
all comparable sale properties relied upon in the report;
    (iii) The appraiser has no present or prospective interest in the 
appraised property; and
    (iv) The appraiser has not received compensation that was contingent 
on the analysis, opinions, or conclusions contained in the appraisal 
report; and
    (11) Copies of relevant written reports, studies, or summary 
conclusions prepared by others in association with the appraisal 
assignment which were relied upon by the appraiser to estimate value, 
which may include, but is not limited to, current title reports, mineral 
reports, or timber cruises prepared by qualified specialists.
    (d) Appraisal review.
    (1) Appraisal reports shall be reviewed by a qualified review 
appraiser meeting the qualifications set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Statements of value prepared by agency appraisers are not 
subject to this review.
    (2) The review appraiser shall determine whether the appraisal 
report:
    (i) Is complete, logical, consistent, and supported by market 
analysis;
    (ii) Complies with the standards prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section; and
    (iii) Reasonably estimates the probable market value of the lands 
appraised.
    (3) The review appraiser shall prepare a written review report, 
containing at a minimum:

[[Page 342]]

    (i) A description of the review process used;
    (ii) An explanation of the adequacy, relevance, and reasonableness 
of the data and methods used by the appraiser to estimate value;
    (iii) The review appraiser's conclusions regarding the appraiser's 
estimate of market value; and
    (iv) A certification by the review appraiser to the following:
    (A) The review appraiser has no present or prospective interest in 
the property which is the subject of the review report; and
    (B) The review appraiser has not received compensation that was 
contingent upon approval of the appraisal report.

Sec. 254.10  Bargaining; arbitration.

    (a) Unless the parties to an exchange agree in writing to suspend or 
modify the deadlines contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of 
this section, the parties shall adhere to the following:
    (1)(i) Within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) 
for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an 
exchange may agree on the appraised values or may initiate a process of 
bargaining or some other process to determine values. Bargaining or any 
other process must be based on an objective analysis of the valuation in 
the appraisal report(s) and is a means of reconciling differences in 
such report(s). Bargaining or another process to determine values may 
involve one or more of the following actions:
    (A) Submission of the disputed appraisal(s) to another qualified 
appraiser for review:
    (B) Request for additional appraisals;
    (C) Involvement of an impartial third party to facilitate resolution 
of the value disputes, or
    (D) Use of some other acceptable and commonly recognized practice 
for resolving value disputes.
    (ii) Any agreement based upon bargaining must be in writing and made 
part of the administrative record of the exchange. Such agreement must 
contain a reference to all relevant appraisal information and state how 
the parties reconciled or compromised appraisal information to arrive at 
an agreement based on market value.
    (2) If within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) 
for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an 
exchange cannot agree on values but wish to continue with the land 
exchange, the appraisal(s), at the initiative of either party, must be 
submitted to arbitration, unless, in lieu of arbitration, the parties 
have employed a process of bargaining or some other process to determine 
values. If arbitration occurs, it must be conducted in accordance with 
the real estate valuation arbitration rules of the American Arbitration 
Association. The Secretary or an official to whom such authority has 
been delegated shall appoint an arbitrator from a list provided by the 
American Arbitration Association.
    (3) Within 30 days after completion of arbitration, the parties 
involved in the exchange must determine whether to proceed with the 
exchange, modify the exchange to reflect the findings of the arbitration 
or any other factors, or withdraw from the exchange. A decision to 
withdraw from the exchange may be made upon written notice by either 
party at this time or at any other time prior to entering into a binding 
exchange agreement.
    (4) If the parties agree to proceed with an exchange after 
arbitration, the values established by arbitration are binding upon all 
parties for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of the 
arbitration decision.
    (b) Arbitration is limited to the disputed valuation of the lands 
involved in a proposed exchange and an arbitrator's award decision is 
limited to the value estimate(s) of the contested appraisal(s). An 
arbitrator may not include in an award decision recommendations 
regarding the terms of a proposed exchange, nor may an arbitrator's 
award decision infringe upon the authority of the Secretary to make all 
decisions regarding management of Federal lands and to make public 
interest determinations.

the proposed exchange will be expedited;
    (2) The value of the lands to be conveyed out of Federal ownership 
is not more than $150,000 as based upon a statement of value prepared by 
a qualified appraiser and accepted by an authorized officer;

location, acreage, use, and physical attributes; and
    (4) There are no significant elements of value requiring complex 
analysis.
    (b) The authorized officer, not the non-Federal party, determines 
whether the Federal and non-Federal lands are approximately equal in 
value and must document how the determination was made.

Sec. 254.12  Value equalization; cash equalization waiver.

    (a) To equalize the agreed upon values of the Federal and non-
Federal lands involved in an exchange, either with or without 
adjustments of relative values as compensation for various costs, the 
parties to an exchange may agree to:
    (1) Modify the exchange proposal by adding or excluding lands; and/
or
    (2) Use cash equalization, after making all reasonable efforts to 
equalize values by adding or deleting lands.
    (b) The combined amount of any cash equalization payment and/or the 
amount of adjustments agreed to as compensation for costs under 
Sec. 254.7 of this subpart may not exceed 25 percent of the value of the 
Federal lands to be conveyed.
    (c) The Secretary of Agriculture may not waive cash equalization 
payment due the United States, but the parties may agree to waive cash 
equalization payment due the non-Federal party. The amount to be waived 
may not exceed 3 percent of the value of the lands being exchanged out 
of Federal ownership or $15,000, whichever is less.

area within which the lands covered by the notice are located, the non-
Federal exchange parties, authorized users of involved Federal lands, 
the congressional delegation, and individuals who requested notification 
or filed written objections, and others as appropriate.
    (b) For a period of 45 days after the date of publication of a 
notice of the availability of a decision to approve or disapprove an 
exchange proposal, the decision shall be subject to appeal as provided 
under 36 CFR part 215 or, for eligible parties, under 36 CFR part 251, 
subpart C.

Sec. 254.13 of this subpart is upheld; and
    (7) The agreement is not terminated by mutual consent or upon such 
terms as may be provided in the agreement.
    (c) In the event of a failure to perform or to comply with the terms 
of an exchange agreement, the noncomplying party is liable for all costs 
borne by the other party as a result of the proposed exchange, 
including, but not limited to, land surveys, appraisals, mineral 
examinations, timber cruises, title searches, title curative actions, 
cultural resource surveys and mitigation, hazardous substance surveys 
and controls, removal of encumbrances, arbitration, curing deficiencies 
preventing highest and best use of the land, and any other expenses 
incurred in processing the proposed land exchange.
    (d) Absent an executed exchange agreement, an action taken by the

Sec. 254.15  Title standards.

    (a) Title evidence.
    (1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General 
Counsel, evidence of title for the non-Federal lands being conveyed to 
the United States must be in recordable form and in conformance with the 
Department of Justice regulations and ``Standards for the Preparation of 
Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States'' in effect at 
the time of conveyance.
    (2) The United States is not required to furnish title evidence for 
the Federal lands being exchanged.
    (b) Conveyance documents.
    (1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General 
Counsel, all conveyances to the United States must be prepared, 
executed, and acknowledged in accordance with the Department of Justice 
regulations and ``Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in 
Land Acquisitions by the United States'' in effect at the time of 
conveyance.
    (2) Conveyances of lands from the United States are made by patent, 
quitclaim deed, or deed and without express or implied warranties, 
except as to hazardous substances pursuant to Sec. 254.3 of this 
subpart.
    (c) Title encumbrances.
    (1) Non-Federal lands.
    (i) Title to the non-Federal lands must be acceptable to the United 
States. For example, encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, 
mortgages, and other objections or title defects shall be eliminated, 
released, or waived in accordance with requirements of the preliminary 
title opinion of the USDA Office of the General

[[Page 345]]

Counsel or the Department of Justice, as appropriate.
    (ii) The United States shall not accept lands in which there are 
reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and 
management of the land by the United States or would otherwise be 
inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which, 
the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal 
landowner are subject to the appropriate rules and regulations of the 
Secretary, except upon special finding by the Chief, Forest Service in 
the case of States, agencies, or political subdivisions thereof (36 CFR 
part 251, subpart A).
    (iii) Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party which is 
not a part of the exchange proposal, should be removed by the non-
Federal party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless 
the authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange 
previously agree upon a specified period to remove the personal 
property. If the personal property is not removed prior to acceptance of 
title or within the otherwise prescribed time, it shall be deemed 
abandoned and shall become vested in the United States.
    (iv) The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements 
for the relocation of any tenants. Qualified tenants occupying non-
Federal lands affected by a land exchange may be entitled to relocation 
benefits under 49 CFR 24.2. Unless otherwise provided by law or 
regulation (49 CFR 24.101(a)(1)), relocation benefits are not applicable 
to owner-occupants involved in exchanges with the United States provided 
the owner-occupants are notified in writing that the non-Federal lands 
are being acquired by the United States on a voluntary basis.
    (2) Federal lands. If Federal lands proposed for exchange are 
occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third 
party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such 
authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach 
agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under 
the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease. The non-Federal 
exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to 
issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by 
the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the 
authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the 
authorized use or shall determine whether the public interest will be 
best served by terminating such use pursuant to 36 CFR 251.60.


<R05>
Sec. 254.16  Case closing.

    (a) Title transfers. Unless otherwise agreed, and notwithstanding 
the decision in United States v. Schurz, 102 U.S. 378 (1880), or any 
other law or ruling to the contrary, title to both the non-Federal and 
Federal lands pass simultaneously and are deemed accepted by the United 
States and the non-Federal landowner, respectively, when the documents 
of conveyance are recorded in the county clerk's or other local 
recorder's office. Before recordation, all instructions, requirements, 
and conditions set forth by the United States and the non-Federal 
landowner must be met. The minimum requirements and conditions necessary 
for recordation include the following, as appropriate:
    (1) The determination by the authorized officer that the United 
States will receive possession, acceptable to it, of such lands;
    (2) The issuance of title evidence as of the date of recordation 
which conforms to the instructions and requirements of the USDA Office 
of the General Counsel's preliminary title opinion; and
    (3) Continuation searches disclosing no matters of record that would 
require any change in the aforementioned title evidence as issued.
    (b) Automatic segregation of lands. Subject to valid existing 
rights, non-Federal lands acquired through exchange by the United States 
automatically are segregated from appropriation under the public land 
laws and mineral laws until midnight of the 90th day after acceptance of 
title by the United States, and the public land records must be noted 
accordingly. Thereafter, the lands will be open automatically to 
operation of the public land laws and mineral laws, except to the extent 
otherwise provided by law,

unless action is taken pursuant to 43 CFR part 2300 to initiate a 
withdrawal within the 90-day period.

adjustments under the Secretary's authority within the area set aside.
    (d) A Forest Service official must prepare a public notice of the 
proposed townsite sale to be inserted once a week for 4 consecutive 
weeks in a local newspaper:
    (1) The notice shall include descriptive information on the proposed 
townsite sale and identify the applicant and responsible Forest Service

<R05>
Sec. 254.23  Studies, assessments, and approval.

    (a) After initial public notice has been published, a Forest Service 
official must conduct the necessary studies and assessments to--
    (1) Determine if the applicant has made a satisfactory showing that 
the land will meet essential community needs resulting from internal 
growth;
    (2) Determine if lands applied for would serve indigenous community 
objectives that outweight other public objectives and values which would 
be served by maintaining such a tract in Federal ownership;
    (3) Determine if the sale would substantially affect or impair 
important scenic, wildlife, environmental, historical, archeological, or 
cultural values;
    (4) Evaluate the applicability of public comments;
    (5) Identify the extent of valid existing rights and uses; and
    (6) Determine if zoning ordinances, covenants, or standards are 
needed to protect adjacent National Forest land and to protect or 
mitigate valid existing rights and uses.
    (b) Upon approval, the authorized Forest Service official shall take 
appropriate steps to have an assessment made of the fair market value of 
the land and process the conveyance pursuant to Secs. 254.24, 254.25, 
and 254.26.
    (c) Upon disapproval, a Forest Service official shall--

                  Subpart C--Conveyance of Small Tracts

    Authority: Pub. L. 97-465; 96 Stat. 2535.

    Source: 49 FR 1185, Jan. 10, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 254.30  Purpose.

    These regulations set forth procedures by which the Secretary of 
Agriculture may resolve land disputes and management problems pursuant 
to Pub. L. 97-465, commonly called the Small Tracts Act, by conveying, 
through sale, exchange, or interchange, three categories of tracts of 
land: Parcels encroached on, road rights-of-way, and mineral survey 
fractions. Implementation of these regulations does not constitute 
authorization of nor consent to adverse possession against lands 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 254.31  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this subpart,
    An applicant is a person who occupies or has improvements on 
National Forest System land under claim of title or color of title, or 
who owns land abutting or underlying a road right-of-way, or who owns 
land interspersed with or adjacent to mineral survey fractions.

[[Page 348]]

    Approximately equal value is a comparative estimate of value of 
lands involved in an interchange where elements of value, such as 
physical characteristics and other amenities, are readily apparent and 
substantially similar.
    Claim of title is a claim of land as a person's own, based on any 
reasonable evidence which establishes the person's actual use of the 
land as though the person had full title thereto from the time the 
person obtained ownership of abutting land.
    Color of title arises from an instrument purporting to convey title 
to a tract of land.
    Encroachments are improvements occupied or used on National Forest 
System land under claim of title or color of title.
    Exchange is a discretionary, voluntary transaction involving mutual 
transfers of land or interests in land between the Secretary of 
Agriculture acting by and through the Forest Service and a nonfederal 
entity.
    Good faith is honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of 
circumstances which ought to put a prudent person upon inquiry.
    Improvements mean an addition to property costing labor or capital 
which affects its value. The term generally includes fixtures, 
structures and attendant facilities, or buildings.
    Interchange is a land transfer in which the Secretary and another 
person exchange lands or interests in lands of approximately equal value 
without a formal appraisal.
    Mineral survey fractions are small parcels of National Forest System 
lands interspersed with or adjacent to lands transferred out of Federal 
ownership under the mining laws.
    Person includes any nonfederal entity such as a State or any 
political subdivision as well as any individual or business entity.
    Secretary refers to the Secretary of the United States Department of 
Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 254.32  Encroachments.

    (a) Conveyances under this subpart are limited to tracts of 10 acres 
or less to resolve encroachments by persons:
    (1) To whom no advance notice was given that the improvements 
encroached or would encroach, and
    (2) Who in good faith relied on an erroneous survey, title search, 
or other land description which did not reveal such encroachment.
    (b) Forest Service officials shall consider the following factors 
when determining whether to convey lands upon which encroachments exist:
    (1) The location of the property boundaries based on historical 
location and continued acceptance and maintenance,
    (2) Factual evidence of claim of title or color of title,
    (3) Notice given to persons encroaching on National Forest System 
lands,
    (4) Degree of development in the encroached upon area, and
    (5) Creation of an uneconomic remnant.


<R05>
Sec. 254.33  Road rights-of-way.

    (a) Reserved or acquired road right-of-way parcels subject to 
conveyance under this subpart are limited to those which are 
substantially surrounded by lands not owned by the United States.
    (b) Forest Service officials shall consider public road system 
right-of-way needs based on National Forest transportation planning and 
State and local law before making any conveyance of rights-of-way.
    (c) Reimbursement will be required for the value of any improvements 
made by the United States or other highway authorities, unless waived by 
the Chief of the Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 254.34  Mineral survey fractions.

    (a) Mineral survey fractions subject to conveyance under this 
subpart are limited to those tracts which:
    (1) Cannot be efficiently administered because of size, shape, or 
location;
    (2) Are occupied or could be occupied or used by adjoining owners; 
and
    (3) When sold separately or aggregated in one transaction, do not 
exceed 40 acres.
    (b) Forest Service officials shall consider the following criteria 
in determining whether to convey mineral survey fractions under this 
subpart:

[[Page 349]]

    (1) The mineral survey fractions are interspersed among and are more 
or less an integral part of private land holdings;
    (2) The feasibility and cost of surveying the parcels in order to 
manage them effectively;
    (3) The size, shape, and location of the parcels as they affect 
management, utility, access, occupancy or use of the parcels or the 
lands with which they are interspersed.


<R05>
Sec. 254.35  Limitations.

    (a) Lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the 
National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, and 
National Monuments are excluded from any conveyance under these 
provisions.
    (b) Lands within National Recreation Areas may not be conveyed by 
sale under this subpart.
    (c) The value of Federal lands conveyed in any transaction, pursuant 
to this subpart, shall not exceed $150,000.
    (d) Compensation for lands conveyed shall be of at least equal 
value, or in the case of interchange, of approximately equal value, and 
may be in the form of land, interest in land (including minerals), or 
cash, or any combination thereof.
    (e) The sale, exchange, or interchange of lands or interest in lands 
under these rules are discretionary and shall be made only if found to 
be in the public interest.
    (f) The abutting landowner(s) shall have the first right of 
acquisition.
    (g) The area of land conveyed shall be limited to the minimum 
necessary to resolve encroachment or land management problems.

livestock, or if the name of the owner is unknown, such livestock may be 
impounded any time 15 days after the date a notice of intent to impound 
livestock is first published in a local newspaper and posted at the

<R05>
Sec. 272.3  Public service use.

    The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the use of Woodsy Owl 
for noncommercial educational purposes, without charge, when such use is 
essentially as a public service and will, in his judgment, contribute to 
public information and education concerning wise use of the environment 
and programs which foster maintenance and improvement of environmental 
quality.

    (6) That such other conditions as the Chief may deem necessary in 
each case have been established.
    (b) Requirements for exclusive licenses. Exclusive licenses when 
granted, shall conform to the following:
    (1) A definite expiration date shall be specified based on the 
minimum time determined by the Chief to be needed by the licensee to 
introduce or popularize the item licensed and to recover the costs and 
expenses incurred in so doing.
    (2) The Chief shall retain the independent right to use Woodsy Owl 
in any concurrent, noncommercial program, and to allow for the 
manufacture and sale of Woodsy Owl merchandise which, in his judgment, 
would not be in conflict with the licensed item.
    (3) The licensee shall be required to have the licensed item 
available for sale, and promotion within a specified period, or show 
cause why this could not be done.
    (4) The licensee shall be required to invest a specified minimum 
amount of money in the development, production, and promotion of the 
licensed item, as determined by the Chief to be necessary to insure that 
the licensee's use of Woodsy Owl will result in a substantial 
contribution to public information concerning pollution abatement and 
environmental enhancement.
    (5) The Chief shall retain the right to revoke any license for 
failure of the licensee to comply with all the terms and conditions of 
the license.
    (6) The licensee shall be required to submit periodic progress 
reports to apprise the Forest Service of his activities and progress in 
achieving stated objectives.
    (7) The license shall not be subject to transfer or assignment,

<R05>
Sec. 290.1  Purpose and scope.

    The rules of this part implement the requirements of the Federal 
Cave Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 4301-4309), hereafter referred 
to as the ``Act''. The rules apply to cave management on National Forest 
System lands. These rules, in conjunction with

[[Page 371]]

rules in part 261 of this chapter, provide the basis for identifying and 
managing significant caves on National Forest System lands in accordance 
with the Act. National Forest System lands will be managed in a manner 
which, to the extent practical, protects and maintains significant cave 
resources in accordance with the policies outlined in the Forest Service 
Directive System and the management direction contained in the 
individual forest plans.


<R05>
Sec. 290.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the terms listed in this section have 
the following meaning:
    Authorized officer means the Forest Service employee delegated the 
authority to perform the duties described in this part.
    Cave means any naturally occurring void, cavity, recess, or system 
of interconnected passages beneath the surface of the earth or within a 
cliff or ledge and which is large enough to permit a person to enter, 
whether the entrance is excavated or naturally formed. Such term shall 
include any natural pit, sinkhole, or other opening which is an 
extension of a cave entrance or which is an integral part of the cave.
    Cave resources mean any materials or substances occurring in caves 
including, but not limited to, biotic, cultural, mineralogic, 
paleontologic, geologic, and hydrologic resources.
    National Forest System lands means all national forest lands 
reserved or withdrawn from the public domain, acquired through purchase, 
exchange, or donation, national grasslands and land utilization 
projects, and other lands, waters, or interests administered by the 
Forest Service.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Agriculture.
    Significant cave means a cave located on National Forest System 
lands that has been determined to meet the criteria in Sec. 290.3 (c) or 
(d) and has been designated in accordance with Sec. 290.3(e).


<R05>
Sec. 290.3  Nomination, evaluation, and designation of significant caves.

    (a) Nominations for initial and subsequent listings. The authorized 
officer will give governmental agencies and the public, including those 
who utilize caves for scientific, educational, or recreational purposes, 
the opportunity to nominate caves. The authorized officer shall give 
public notice, including a notice published in the Federal Register, 
calling for nominations for the initial listing and setting forth the 
procedures for preparing and submitting the nominations. Nominations for 
subsequent listings will be accepted from governmental agencies and the 
public by the Forest Supervisor where the cave is located as new cave 
discoveries are made. Caves nominated but not approved for designation 
may be renominated as additional documentation or new information 
becomes available.
    (b) Evaluation for initial and subsequent listings. The evaluation 
of the nominations for significant caves will be carried out in 
consultation with individuals and organizations interested in the 
management and use of caves and cave resources, within the limits 
imposed by the confidentiality provisions of Sec. 290.4. Nominations 
shall be evaluated using the criteria in Sec. 290.3 (c) and (d).
    (c) Criteria for significant caves. A significant cave on National 
Forest System lands shall possess one or more of the following features, 
characteristics, or values.
    (1) Biota. The cave provides seasonal or yearlong habitat for 
organisms or animals, or contains species or subspecies of flora or 
fauna native to caves, or are sensitive to disturbance, or are found on 
State or Federal sensitive, threatened, or endangered species lists.
    (2) Cultural. The cave contains historic properties or archeological 
resources (as defined in Parts 800.2 and 296.3 of this chapter 
respectively, or in 16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.), or other features included 
in or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places 
because of their research importance for history or prehistory, 
historical associations, or other historical or traditional 
significance.
    (3) Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic. The cave possesses one or 
more of the following features:
    (i) Geologic or mineralogic features that are fragile, represent 
formation

[[Page 372]]

processes that are of scientific interest, or that are otherwise useful 
for study.
    (ii) Deposits of sediments or features useful for evaluating past 
events.
    (iii) Paleontologic resources with potential to contribute useful 
educational or scientific information.
    (4) Hydrologic. The cave is a part of a hydrologic system or 
contains water which is important to humans, biota, or development of 
cave resources.
    (5) Recreational. The cave provides or could provide recreational 
opportunities or scenic values.
    (6) Educational or scientific. The cave offers opportunities for 
educational or scientific use; or, the cave is virtually in a pristine 
state, lacking evidence of contemporary human disturbance or impact; or, 
the length, volume, total depth, pit depth, height, or similar 
measurements are notable.
    (d) Specially designated areas. All caves located within special 
management areas, such as Special Geologic Areas, Research Natural 
Areas, or National Monuments, that are designated wholly or in part due 
to the cave resources found therein are determined to be significant.
    (e) Designation and documentation. If the authorized officer 
determines that a cave nominated and evaluated under paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c) 
of this section, the authorized officer shall designate the cave as 
significant. The authorized officer will notify the nominating party of 
the results of the evaluation and designation. Each forest will retain 
appropriate documentation for all significant caves located within its 
administrative boundaries. At a minimum, this documentation shall 
include a statement of finding signed and dated by the authorized 
officer and the information used to make the determination. This 
documentation will be retained as a permanent record in accordance with 
the confidentiality provision in Sec. 290.4.
    (f) Undiscovered passages. If a cave is determined to be 
significant, its entire extent on federal land, including passages not 
mapped or discovered at the time of the determination, is deemed 
significant. This includes caves that extend from lands managed by any 
other Federal agency into National Forest System lands, as well as caves 
initially believed to be separate for which interconnecting passages are 
discovered after significance is determined.
    (g) Decision final. The decision to designate or not designate a 
cave as significant is made at the sole discretion of the authorized 
officer based upon the criteria in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section and is not subject to further administrative review of appeal 
under Parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 290.4  Confidentiality of cave location information.

    (a) Information disclosure. No Forest Service employee shall 
disclose any information that could be used to determine the location of 
a significant cave or a cave nominated for designation, unless the 
authorized officer determines that disclosure will further the purposes 
of the Act and will not create a substantial risk of harm, theft, or 
destruction to cave resources.
    (b) Requesting confidential information. Notwithstanding paragraph 
(a) of this section, the authorized officer may make confidential cave 
information available to Federal or State governmental agencies, bona 
fide educational or research institutes, or individuals or organizations 
assisting the land management agencies with cave management activities. 
To request confidential cave information, such entities shall make a 
written request to the authorized officer which includes the following:
    (1) Name, address, and telephone number of the individual 
responsible for the security of the information received;
    (2) A legal description of the area for which the information is 
sought;
    (3) A statement of the purpose for which the information is sought; 
and,
    (4) Written assurances that the requesting party will maintain the 
confidentiality of the information and protect the cave and its 
resources.
    (c) Decision final. The decision to permit or deny access to 
confidential cave information is made at the sole discretion of the 
authorized officer and is not subject to further administrative review 
or appeal under 5 U.S.C. 552 or parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 290.5  Collection of information.

    The collection of information contained in this rule represents new 
information requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320, Controlling 
Paperwork Burdens on the Public. In accordance with those rules and the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 as amended (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest 
Service has received approval by the Office of Management and Budget to 
collect cave nomination information under clearance number 0596-0123 and 
confidential information under 0596-0122. The information provided for 
the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be 
listed as ``significant'' and the information in the requests to obtain 
confidential cave information will be used to decide whether to grant 
access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is 
voluntary. No action may be taken against a person for refusing to 
supply the information requested. Response to the information 
requirements for obtaining confidential cave information is required to 
obtain a benefit in accordance with section 5 of the Federal Cave 
Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4304).

<R05>
Sec. 292.11  Introduction.

    (a) Administration of the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units will 
be coordinated with the other purposes of the Central Valley Project of 
the Bureau of Reclamation and of the recreation area as a whole so as to 
provide for: (1) Public outdoor recreation benefits; (2) conservation of 
scenic, scientific, historic, and other values contributing to public 
enjoyment; and (3) the management, utilization, and disposal of 
renewable natural resources which in the judgment of the Secretary of 
Agriculture will promote or is compatible with, and does not 
significantly impair, public recreation and conservation of scenic, 
scientific, historic, or other values contributing to public enjoyment.
    (b) The Secretary may not acquire without consent of the owner any 
privately owned ``improved property'' or interests therein within the 
boundaries of these units, so long as the appropriate local zoning 
agency shall have in force and applicable to such property a duly 
adopted, valid, zoning ordinance

[[Page 375]]

that is approved by the Secretary. This suspension of the Secretary's 
authority to acquire ``improved property'' without the owner's consent 
would automatically cease: (1) If the property is made the subject of a 
variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not 
conform to the applicable standards contained in Secs. 292.11 to 292.13; 
or (2) if such property is put to any use which does not conform to any 
applicable zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary.
    (c) Improved property as used in Secs. 292.11 to 292.13, means any 
building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which 
was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than three 
acres of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of 
buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such 
``improved property'' any shore or waters, together with so much of the 
land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public 
access thereto.
    (d) Sections 292.11 to 292.13 specify the standards with which local 
zoning ordinances for the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units must 
conform if the ``improved property'' or unimproved property proposed for 
development as authorized by the Act within the boundaries of the units 
is to be exempt from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of 
Secs. 292.11 to 292.13 are to:
    (1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other than those 
which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the purposes of the 
act establishing the national recreation area; (2) promote the 
protection and development of properties in keeping with the purposes of 
that Act by means of use, acreage, setback, density, height or other 
requirements; and (3) provide that the Secretary receive notice of any 
variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of the 
zoning ordinance approved by him.
    (e) Following promulgation of Secs. 292.11 to 292.13 of final form, 
the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any 
amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which 
conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in effect at the 
time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment.
    (f) Any owner of unimproved property who proposes to develop his 
property for service to the public may submit to the Secretary a 
development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which 
the property is to be developed and the use to which it is proposed to 
be put. If the Secretary determines that the development and the use of 
the property conforms to approved zoning ordinances, and serves the 
purposes of the National Recreation Area and that the property is not 
needed for easements and rights-of-way for access, utilities, or 
facilities, or for administration sites, campgrounds, or other areas 
needed for use by the United States for visitors, he may in his 
discretion issue to such owner a certification that so long as the 
property is developed, maintained, and used in conformity with approved 
zoning ordinances the Secretary's authority to acquire the property 
without the owner's consent is suspended.


<R05>
Sec. 292.12  General provisions; procedures.

    (a) Approval of zoning ordinance and development plans. (1) All 
validly adopted zoning ordinances and amendments thereto pertaining to 
the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the county 
of origin to the Secretary for written approval relative to their 
conformance with the applicable standards of Secs. 292.11 to 292.13. 
Within 60 days following submission, the county will be notified of the 
Secretary's approval or disapproval of the zoning ordinances or 
amendments thereto. If more than 60 days are required, the county will 
be notified of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed 
necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's approval shall remain 
effective so long as the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto remain 
in effect as approved.
    (2) Development plans pertaining to unimproved property within the 
Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the owner to 
the Secretary for determination as to whether they conform with approved 
zoning ordinances and whether the planned use and development would 
serve the Act.

[[Page 376]]

Within 30 days following submission of such plans the Secretary will 
approve or disapprove the plans or, if more than 30 days are required, 
will notify the applicant of the expected delay and of the additional 
time deemed necessary.
    (b) Amendment of ordinances. Amendments of approved ordinances may 
be furnished in advance of their adoption to the Secretary for written 
decision as to their conformance with applicable standards of 
Secs. 292.11 to 292.13.
    (c) Variances or exceptions to application of ordinances. (1) The 
Secretary shall be given written notice of any variance granted under, 
or any exception made to, the application of a zoning ordinance or 
amendment thereto approved by him.
    (2) The County, or private owners of improved property, may submit 
to the Secretary proposed variances or exceptions to the application of 
an approved zoning ordinance or amendment thereto for written advice as 
to whether the intended use will make the property subject to 
acquisition without the owner's consent. Within 30 days following his 
receipt of such a request, the Secretary will advise the interested 
party or parties as to his determination. If more than 30 days are 
required by the Secretary for such determination, he shall so notify the 
interested party or parties stating the additional time required and the 
reasons therefore.
    (d) Certification of property. Where improvements and land use of 
improved property conform with approved ordinances, or with approved 
variances from such ordinances, certification that the Secretary's 
authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is 
suspended may be obtained by any party in interest upon request to the 
Secretary. Where the development and use of unimproved property for 
service to the public is approved by the Secretary, certification that 
the authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is 
suspended may be issued to the owner.
    (e) Effect of noncompliance. Suspension of the Secretary's authority 
to acquire any improved property without the owner's consent will 
automatically cease if: (1) Such property is made the subject of 
variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not 
conform to the applicable standard in the Secretary's regulation, (2) 
such property is put to a use which does not conform to any applicable 
zoning ordinance, or, as to property approved by the Secretary for 
development, a use which does not conform to the approved development 
plan or (3) the local zoning agency does not have in force a duly 
adopted, valid zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary in 
accordance with the standards of Secs. 292.11 to 292.13.
    (f) Nonconforming commercial or industrial uses. Any existing 
commercial or industrial uses not in conformance with approved zoning 
ordinances shall be discontinued within 10 years from the date such 
ordinances are approved: Provided, however, That with the approval of 
the Secretary such 10-year period may be extended by the county for a 
prescribed period sufficient to allow the owner reasonable additional 
time to amortize investments made in the property before November 8, 
1965.


<R05>
Sec. 292.13  Standards.

    (a) The standards set forth in Secs. 292.11-292.13 shall apply to 
the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units, which are defined by the 
boundary descriptions in the notice of the Secretary of Agriculture of 
July 12, 1966 (31 FR 9469), and to a strip of land outside the National 
Recreation Area on either side of Federal Aid Secondary Highway Numbered 
1089, as more fully described in 2(a) of the act establishing the 
recreation area (79 Stat. 1296).
    (b) New industrial or commercial uses. New industrial or commercial 
uses will be prohibited in any location except under the following 
conditions:
    (1) The industrial use is such that its operation, physical 
structures, or waste byproducts would not have significant adverse 
impacts on surrounding or nearby outdoor recreation, scenic and esthetic 
values. Industrial uses having an adverse impact include, but are not 
limited to, cement production, gravel extraction operations involving 
more than one-fourth acre of surface, smelters, sand, gravel and 
aggregate processing plants, fabricating plants, pulpmills, and 
commercial livestock feeder yards.

[[Page 377]]

    (2)(i) The commercial use is for purposes of providing food, 
lodging, automotive or marine maintenance facilities and services to 
accommodate recreationists and the intended land occupancy and physical 
structures are such that they can be harmonized with adjacent land 
development and surrounding appearances in accordance with approved 
plans and schedules.
    (ii) This standard provides for privately owned and operated 
businesses whose purposes and physical structures are in keeping with 
objectives for use and maintenance of the area's outdoor recreation 
resources. It precludes establishment of drive-in theaters, zoos, and 
similar nonconforming types of commercial entertainment.
    (c) Protection of roadsides. Provisions to protect natural scenic 
qualities and maintain screening along public travel routes will 
include:
    (1) Prohibition of new structural improvements or visible utility 
lines within a strip of land extending back not less than 150 feet from 
both sides of the centerline of any public road or roadway except roads 
within subdivisions or commercial areas. In addition to buildings, this 
prohibition pertains to above-ground power and telephone lines, borrow 
pits, gravel, or earth extraction areas, and quarries.
    (2) Retention of trees and shrubs in the above-prescribed roadside 
strips to the full extent that is compatible with needs for public 
safety and road maintenance. Wholesale clearing by chemical or other 
means for fire control and other purposes will not be practiced under 
this standard.
    (d) Protection of shorelines. Provisions to protect scenic qualities 
and reduce potentials for pollution of public reservoirs will include: 
Prohibition of structures within 300 feet horizontal distance from 
highwater lines of reservoirs other than structures the purpose of which 
is to service and accommodate boating or to facilitate picnicking and 
swimming: Provided, That exceptions to this standard may be made upon 
showing satisfactory to the Secretary that proposed structures will not 
conflict with scenic and antipollution considerations.
    (e) Property development. Location and development of structures 
will conform with the following minimum standards:
    (1) Commercial development. (i) Stores, restaurants, garages, 
service stations, and comparable business enterprises will be situated 
in centers zoned for this purpose unless they are operated as part of a 
resort or hotel. Commercial centers will be of sufficient size that 
expansion of facilities or service areas is not dependent upon use of 
public land.
    (ii) Sites outside designated commercial centers will be used for 
resort development contingent upon case by case concurrence of the 
responsible county officials and the Secretary that such use is, in all 
aspects, compatible with the purposes for establishing the recreation 
area.
    (iii) Structures for commercial purposes, inclusive of isolated 
resorts or motels, will not exceed two stories height at front 
elevation, and will be conventional architecture and will utilize 
colors, nonglare roofing materials, and spacing or layout that 
harmonizes with forested settings. Except for signs, structures designed 
primarily for purposes of calling attention to products or service will 
not be permitted.
    (2) Residential development. (i) Locations approved for residential 
development will be buffered by distance, topography, or forest cover 
from existing or planned public use areas such as trailer parks, 
campgrounds, or organization sites. Separation will be sufficient to 
avoid conflicts resulting from intervisibility, noise, and proximity 
that is conducive to private property trespass.
    (ii) Requirements for approval of residential areas will include: 
(a) Construction of access when main access would otherwise be limited 
to a road constructed by the United States primarily to service publicly 
owned recreation developments; (b) limitation of residences to single-
family units situated at a density not exceeding two per acre, but any 
lot of less than a half-acre may be used for residential purposes if, on 
or before promulgation of Secs. 292.11-292.13, such lot was in separate 
ownership or was delineated in a county-approved plat that constitutes 
part of a duly recorded subdivision; (c) use

[[Page 378]]

of set-backs, limitations to natural terrain, neutral exterior colors, 
nonglare roofing materials, and limitations of building heights fully 
adequate to harmonize housing development with the objective of the 
National Recreation Area as set forth in the act.
    (3) Signs and signing. Only those signs may be permitted which: (i) 
Do not exceed 1 square foot in area for any residential use; (ii) do not 
exceed 40 square feet in area, 8 feet in length, and 15 feet maximum 
height from ground for any other use, including advertisement of the 
sale or rental of property; and (iii) which are not illuminated by any 
neon or flashing device. Commercial signs may be placed only on the 
property on which the advertised use occurs, or on the property which is 
advertised for sale or rental. Signs shall be subdued in appearance, 
harmonizing in design and color with the surroundings and shall not be 
attached to any tree or shrub. Nonconforming signs may continue for a 
period not to exceed 2 years from the date a zoning ordinance containing 
these limitations is adopted.

<R05>
Sec. 292.15  General provisions--procedures.

    (a) Classification of private property. For the purpose of 
establishing specific standards applicable to the several parcels of 
private land within the boundaries, such properties are classified and 
assigned to land use categories as shown on the Land Use Category Map, 
dated December 15, 1973, as amended July 16, 1976, on file and available 
for public inspection in the office of the Area Ranger, Sawtooth 
National Recreation Area, Ketchum, Idaho. The classification of private 
properties is based on evaluation of scenic, natural, historic, 
pastoral, wildlife, and other values.
    (b) Land use categories. Land use categories shown on the map 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:
    (1) Designated community. All properties inside a designated 
community.
    (2) Residential. Areas for residential development outside 
designated communities.
    (3) Commercial. Areas for commercial development outside designated 
communities.
    (4) Agriculture. All properties outside designated communities not 
placed in a residential or commercial land use category.
    (5) Mineral. Any areas in the land use in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(4) of this section, used for mineral operations.
    (c) Changes in classification. The Secretary may make changes in the 
classification of private lands set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section by incorporating such changes in an amendment of these 
regulations.
    (d) Certification of compliance with standards--(1) Present use. Any 
owner of property may request in writing the Area Ranger to examine the 
present use of the property and issue a certification that such present 
use conforms to the applicable standards established in Sec. 292.16 for 
the land use category in which the property is placed. If after 
examination the Area Ranger determines that the present use of the 
property does so conform, he will issue a certification to this effect.
    (2) Planned development or change in use. Any owner of property who 
proposes to change the use or develop his property for other than 
agricultural use may submit to the Area Ranger a use or development plan 
setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is 
to be developed and the use to which the property is to be put. If the 
Area Ranger determines that the development and use plan conforms to the 
applicable standards established in Sec. 292.16 for the land use 
category in which the property is placed, he will issue a certification 
to this effect.
    (3) Notification of action. Within 45 days after receipt of request 
for certification, the Area Ranger shall:
    (i) Issue the certification.
    (ii) Notify applicant that additional information is needed before 
action can be taken on the application.
    (iii) Notify applicant that certification is denied, and reasons for 
denial.
    (iv) Notify applicant that action on the request is deferred for a 
specified period of time for stated reasons.
    (e) Qualified certifications. (1) Any owner of a property classified 
residential or commercial under paragraph (a) of this section which had 
been improved and was being used for residential or commercial purposes 
on the effective date of these regulations, but which does not conform 
to the standards established for properties in the land use category in 
which the property is placed may nevertheless be issued a certification 
for period not to exceed 10 years so that the improvements may be made 
to conform to the standards. Such certification shall specify that it is 
only effective so long as the property is not subdivided, and is not 
further improved and the improvements existing on the effective

[[Page 380]]

date of these regulations, are not reconstructed, altered or relocated, 
except to meet standards. The certification shall specify the date on 
which it shall terminate.
    (2) If the Area Ranger determines, prior to certification, that a 
part or all of a property, for which a request for certification is 
made, is needed for access to and utilization of public property or for 
recreation and other facilities, he may except from the certification 
that part of the property needed for these purposes.
    (f) Revocation of certification. The Area Ranger will revoke a 
certification when he finds that the property is being used or developed 
not in conformance with the terms of the certification or the applicable 
standards established in Sec. 292.16 or is in imminent danger of being 
so used or developed. Notice of such revocation will be in writing and 
delivered to the owner in person or by certified mail. A partial 
revocation may be made when a portion of a property covered by a 
certification is determined to be needed for access to and utilization 
of public property or for recreation and other facilities.
    (g) Effect of certification. Property for which a certification is 
held by the owner shall not be acquired by the Secretary by 
condemnation.
    (h) Effect of noncompliance with standards. Property for which a 
determination has been made that it is being used or developed not in 
conformance with the applicable standards established in Sec. 292.16 for 
the land use category in which the property is placed may be acquired by 
the Secretary by condemnation.
    (i) Acquisition by negotiated purchase. (1) Any privately owned land 
or interest in land determined by the Secretary to be needed in 
furtherance of the objectives and purposes for which the Sawtooth 
National Recreation Area was established may be acquired by negotiated 
purchase subject only to the limitation in paragraph (j) of this 
section.
    (2) Property which has been developed for use prior to the effective 
date of these regulations, but which is not in conformance with 
applicable standards may be acquired by the Secretary through negotiated 
purchase and the Secretary may permit the owners, their successors or 
assigns to retain a right of use and occupancy of the improved property 
for a definite term not beyond December 31, 1988.
    (j) Limitation on acquisitions. Acquisitions of lands or interests 
therein for access to and utilization of public property and for 
recreation and other facilities shall not exceed 5 percent of the total 
acreage of all private property within the Sawtooth National Recreation 
Area on August 22, 1972. A land acquisition plan shall be prepared by 
the Area Ranger and approved by the Regional Forester showing those 
properties needed for access to and utilization of public property or 
for recreation and other facilities. Said plan may be revised from time 
to time upon approval by the Regional Forester. Said plan shall be 
available for inspection by the public in the office of the Area Ranger.
    (k) Land exchanges. Some parcels of Federal lands within the 
Sawtooth National Recreation Area are classified or may be subsequently 
classified in the overall general plan for the Recreation Area as 
suitable for selection through land exchange. Using existing land 
exchange authorities, these Federal lands may be made available for 
selection by parties owning land within the boundaries of the National 
Recreation Area to resolve some existing or potential land use 
conflicts. The values of the properties so exchanged shall be 
approximately equal, or, if they are not approximately equal, they shall 
be equalized by the payment of cash. Federal lands which may be located 
within the boundaries of designated communities will be considered for 
exchange only after acceptable community development plans and 
ordinances have been implemented.
    (l) Appeals. Any landowner who is adversely affected by a decision 
of the Area Ranger under these regulations may file an appeal under the 
provisions of 36 CFR part 251, subpart C.
    (m) Judicial review. The United States District Court for the 
District of Idaho shall have jurisdiction to review these regulations 
upon a compliant filed within 6 months after the effective

[[Page 381]]

date of these regulations, by any affected landowner in an action for a 
declaratory judgment as provided in the Act of August 22, 1972 (86 Stat. 
612), section 4(a).

Sec. 292.18  Mineral resources.

    (a) Occupancy. No unpatented mining claim may be used or occupied, 
except as otherwise permitted for any purpose other than exploration, 
mining, or processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto.
    (b) Letter of authorization. A letter of authorization with the 
posting of an appropriate bond is required prior to conducting 
operations in the SNRA.
    (c) Operating plan. A proposed operating plan must be filed with the 
Area Ranger prior to conductng any operations and prior to construction, 
reconstruction, improvement or maintenance of roads and trails, bridges, 
or other facilities for access within the SNRA; provided, that an 
operating plan is not required for--
    (1) Operations which only involve vehicular travel on existing roads 
open to public use;
    (2) Marking and/or reestablishing claims corners;
    (3) Sampling and exploration work which will not cause significant 
damage to surface resources and will not involve the removal of more 
than 100 pounds of material for analysis and study, provided the Area 
Ranger has prior notice of such activities; or
    (4) The evaluation and study of existing underground mine workings 
not involving surface disturbances.
    (d) Operating plan--requirements. Each operating plan shall include:
    (1) The names and mailing addresses of operators and their agents, 
along with a statement of owenership and/or authorization under which 
the operation is to be conducted, and including a copy of the location 
notice(s), proof of assessment labor, and quit claim deeds if ownership 
has changed within the assessment year.
    (2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the 
proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed 
roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations and 
the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will 
be disturbed.

[[Page 385]]

    (3) Information describing the nature of operations proposed and how 
they will be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed 
roads or access routes, the means of transportaion to be used, the 
period during which the proposed operations will take place, and 
measures to be taken for protecting the values of the SNRA and 
reclaiming the lands.
    (e) Operating plan--approval. (1) The Area Ranger shall promptly 
acknowledge receipt of any operating plan to the operator. The Area 
Ranger shall review the environmental effects and conduct a technical 
examination of each proposed operating plan.

The technical examination shall identify the resources and the land uses 
in the area of operations. The Area Ranger shall use the current General 
Management Plan of the SNRA and the Final Environmental Statement as 
guides in determining whether the proposed operations may result in 
substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA. In his review, the 
Area Ranger may solicit comments from the general public and/or other 
government agencies in analysis of environmental effects. In his review, 
the Area Ranger will consider the compatibility of the proposed 
operating plan with the Act and the General Management Plan. The Area 
Ranger may not approve an operating plan for an identical claimed area 
to more than one operator.
    (2) Within 30 working days of receipt of a proposed operating plan, 
the Area Ranger shall take one of the following actions:
    (i) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved as 
submitted; or,
    (ii) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved 
as subject to the operator accepting the changes or conditions deemed 
necessary by the Area Ranger; or,
    (iii) Notify the operator that more time is necessary to review the 
plan because of the need to prepare an environmental impact statement, 
or conduct a cultural resource survey, or other stated reasons; in such 
cases, the operator will be notified of the approximate time needed to 
complete the review; or,
    (iv) Notify the operator of an apparent conflict of ownership and 
that additional proof of ownership is required; or,
    (v) Notify the operator that the operating plan as submitted is 
inadequate to support any conclusion as to substantial impairment, and 
that additional information will be required; or,
    (vi) Notify the operator that the operating plan is not approved 
since such operations as specified in the plan would create substantial 
impairment.
    (f) Operating plans--suspension or modification. The Area Ranger may 
suspend or terminate authorization to operate in whole or in part where 
such operations are causing substantial impairment which cannot be 
mitigated. At any time during operations under an approved operation 
plan, the operator may be required to modify the operating plan in order 
to minimize or avoid substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA.
    (g) Bond requirements. (1) An operator shall furnish a bond, in the 
amount determined by the Area Ranger to be appropriate for reclamation 
of the disturbed surface area, prior to the commencement of operations. 
In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, 
as directed by the Forest Service, cash in an amount equal to the 
required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the 
United States having market value at the time of deposit or not less 
than the required dollar amount of the bond.
    (2) When the reclamation of the project, or portions thereof, has 
been completed, the operator will notify the Area Ranger who will 
examine the area to determine whether the reclamation is acceptable. 
When the Area Ranger has accepted as completed any portion of the 
reclamation, he shall reduce proportionately the amount of bond 
thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation. 
However, the operator will not be released from liability under the bond 
for the amount which may be necessary to revegetate each planting area 
for a minimum period of at least 5 years after the first efforts at 
revegetation if those initial efforts are unsuccessful.

[[Page 386]]

    (3) If the Area Ranger determines that revegetation is likely to 
occur before the expiration of such minimum period, he may release the 
operator from the extended liability under the bond for revegetation of 
planting area.
    (h) Access. The operator shall permit free and unrestricted public 
access to and through lands included within an unpatented mining claim 
for all lawful and proper purposes. In areas where such access would 
unduly interfere with authorized operations or would constitute a hazard 
to public health and safety, public use may be restricted with prior 
approval of the Area Ranger.

     Subpart E--Hells Canyon National Recreation Area--Private Lands

    Authority: 89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-13.

    Source: 59 FR 30497, June 13, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 292.20  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National 
Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-
13) encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private 
land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing, farming, timber 
harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, 
as they existed at the time the HCNRA was established on December 31, 
1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to 
promulgate regulations establishing standards for the use and 
development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary 
limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards 
are not met. The purpose of this subpart is to establish standards that 
would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited 
condemnation authority granted by the Act.
    (b) Scope. The regulations in this subpart establish standards 
applicable to all private property within the boundaries of the HCNRA, 
including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha 
Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells Canyon Wilderness. The regulations 
in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of 
private property; rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those 
uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was 
established. Uses not compatible with these standards could result in 
the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without a landowner's 
consent.
    The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect 
a taking of private property, including valid, existing water rights, 
nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a 
private landowner's property use that is compatible with the purposes of 
the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this 
subpart solely to determine whether private land uses or developments 
are compatible with the purposes and direction of the Act and, if not, 
to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating 
condemnation proceedings to acquire land or scenic easements.


<R05>

where structures typify the architectural style and materials of a 
significant historic era such as pre-World War II. Screening is not 
required, however, for new or replacement structures that are associated 
with an existing unscreened structure or structures that were not 
screened at the time this rule became effective.
    (3) No public or commercial solid waste disposal sites or hazardous 
substance disposal sites are located on private lands within the HCNRA.
    (4) All new or replacement utility lines are placed underground 
where ground conditions and topography permit. This standard does not 
prevent or impair routine maintenance of utility lines or related 
structures in existence prior to June 13, 1994.
    (5) No new or replacement structures are developed within the 
boundaries of the Hells Canyon Wilderness, provided that existing 
structures may be repaired and/or maintained.
    (6) Significant historic, archaeologic, or paleontologic sites are 
protected.
    (7) Sites used for the extraction of common mineral materials, such 
as gravel, for construction and maintenance purposes on all except 
designated mining lands, are screened where possible, and are not in 
excess of 2 acres in size.
    (8) New recreational facilities enhance and are compatible with the 
purpose of the Act.

standards are applicable to farm/forest/grazing lands:
    (1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the minimum lot 
size for residential development is 160 acres. Only residences 
associated with farm/forest/grazing uses may be developed. Partitions of 
less than 160 acres may be made to provide for the continuation of 
existing commercial agriculture, but such partitions may not be 
developed for residential use. Lots of less than 160 acres existing on 
June 13, 1994, with residences permanently affixed to a foundation or 
basement, are considered to be in compliance.
    (2) Structures are limited to those necessary to conduct farm/
forest/grazing use.
    (3) Dude ranching is permitted provided it is compatible with the 
purpose and direction of the Act and is part of a recognized ranching 
operation.
    (4) New or replacement structures for farm/forest/grazing use are 
not closer than 25 feet from a property line or 55 feet from the center 
line of a travel route.
    (c) Mining Lands. (1) The following standards are applicable to 
mining lands:
    (i) The owner of mining lands must consult with the Ranger 
concerning proposed mineral development activities prior to submitting a 
plan of operations to the relevant state or federal agencies.

writing within 45 days whether the existing or proposed use or 
development is in compliance with Sec. 292.23 of this subpart. The 
Ranger may extend the time for making a compliance determination by 30 
days if additional information is needed.
    (b) Noncompliance. (1) In the event that the Forest Service 
determines that an existing or proposed use of development is not in 
compliance with the standards of Sec. 292.23 of this subpart, the Ranger 
shall give the landowner written notice of the manner and nature of 
noncompliance. To the extent practicable, the notice will include 
suggestions for achieving compliance. The notice also must include a 
statement that the violation of a standard or standards and the failure 
to cure such violation may result in the initiation of condemnation 
proceedings by the Secretary.
    (2) The Forest Service may initiate a noncompliance determination on 
its own without having first received a landowner request.

[[Page 390]]

    (c) Written petition. The landowner may file a written petition with 
the Forest Supervisor for a review of a decision of compliance or 
noncompliance. The Forest Supervisor shall render a decision within 30 
days of the receipt of the petition. A decision by the Forest Supervisor 
constitutes the final administrative determination by the Department of 
Agriculture. Petitions of decisions on lands within the Rapid River Wild

finding of good cause with written notice and explanation to the 
operator, extends the time period for completion of the valid existing 
rights determination.
    (2) That the operator has failed to provide sufficient information 
to review a claim of valid existing rights and, therefore, the 
authorized officer has no obligation to evaluate whether the operator 
has valid existing rights or to process the operator's proposed plan of 
operations.
    (b)(1) If the authorized officer concludes that there is not 
sufficient evidence of valid existing rights, the officer shall so 
notify the operator in writing of the reasons for the determination, 
inform the operator that the proposed mineral operation cannot be 
conducted, advise the operator that the Forest Service will promptly 
notify the Bureau of Land Management of the determination and request 
the initiation of a mineral contest action against the pertinent mining 
claim, and advise the operator that further consideration of the 
proposed plan of operations is suspended pending final action by the 
Department of the Interior on the operator's claim of valid existing 
rights and any final judicial review thereof.
    (2) If the authorized officer concludes that there is not sufficient 
evidence of valid existing rights, the authorized officer also shall 
notify promptly the Bureau of Land Management of the determination and 
request the initiation of a mineral contest action against the pertinent 
mining claims.
    (c) An authorized officer's decision pursuant to paragraph (b) of

that the applicable mining claim constitutes a valid existing right; or
    (3) Final judicial review of final agency action by the Department 
of the Interior finds that the applicable mining claim constitutes a 
valid existing right.
    (e) Upon completion of the review of the plan of operations, the 
authorized officer shall ensure that the minimum information required by 
Sec. 292.63(c) of this subpart has been addressed and, pursuant to 
Sec. 228.5(a) of this chapter, notify the operator in writing whether or 
not the plan of operations is approved.
    (f) If the plan of operations is not approved, the authorized 
officer shall explain in writing why the plan of operations cannot be 
approved.
    (g) If the plan of operations is approved, the authorized officer 
shall establish a time period for the proposed operations which shall be 
for the minimum amount of time reasonably necessary for a prudent 
operator to complete the mineral development activities covered by the 
approved plan of operations.
    (h) An approved plan of operations is subject to review and 
modification as follows:
    (1) To bring the plan into conformance with changes in applicable 
federal law or regulation; or

authorized officer approved the plan, for example, new listings of 
threatened or endangered species; or
    (3) To correct errors or omissions made at the time the plan was 
approved, for example, to ensure compliance with applicable federal law 
or regulation; or
    (4) To permit operations requested by the operator that differ in 
type, scope, or duration from those in an approved plan of operations 
but that are not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) If an operator desires to conduct operations that differ in 
type, scope, or

[[Page 398]]

duration from those in an approved plan of operations, and if those 
changes will result in resource impacts not anticipated when the 
original plan was approved, the operator must submit a supplemental plan 
or a modification of the plan for review and approval.


<R05>
Sec. 292.65  Plan of operations--suspension.

    (a) The authorized officer may suspend mineral operations due to an 
operator's noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or terms 
and conditions of the approved plan of operations.
    (1) In those cases that present a threat of imminent harm to public 
health, safety, or the environment, or where such harm is already 
occurring, the authorized officer may take immediate action to stop the 
threat or damage without prior notice. In such case, written notice and 
explanation of the action taken shall be given the operator as soon as 
reasonably practicable following the suspension.
    (2) In those cases that do not present a threat of imminent harm to 
public health, safety, or the environment, the authorized officer must 
first notify the operator in writing of the basis for the suspension and 
provide the operator with reasonably sufficient time to respond to the 
notice of the authorized officer or to bring the mineral operations into

Sec. 293.2  Objectives.

    Except as otherwise provided in the regulations in this part, 
National Forest Wilderness shall be so administered as to meet the 
public purposes of recreational, scenic, scientific, educational, 
conservation, and historical uses; and it shall also be administered for 
such other purposes for which it may have been established in such a 
manner as to preserve and protect its wilderness character. In carrying 
out such purposes, National Forest Wilderness resources shall be managed 
to promote, perpetuate, and, where necessary, restore the wilderness 
character of the land and its specific values of solitude, physical and 
mental challenge, scientific study, inspiration, and primitive 
recreation. To that end:
    (a) Natural ecological succession will be allowed to operate freely 
to the extent feasible.
    (b) Wilderness will be made available for human use to the optimum 
extent consistent with the maintenance of primitive conditions.

[[Page 401]]

paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this 
section, a road may be constructed or reconstructed in an inventoried 
roadless area if the Responsible Official determines that one of the 
following circumstances exists:
    (1) A road is needed to protect public health and safety in cases of 
an imminent threat of flood, fire, or other catastrophic event that, 
without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property;
    (2) A road is needed to conduct a response action under the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA) or to conduct a natural resource restoration action under 
CERCLA, Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, or the Oil Pollution Act;
    (3) A road is needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or 
as provided for by statute or treaty;

[[Page 408]]

    (4) Road realignment is needed to prevent irreparable resource 
damage that arises from the design, location, use, or deterioration of a 
classified road and that cannot be mitigated by road maintenance. Road 
realignment may occur under this paragraph only if the road is deemed 
essential for public or private access, natural resource management, or 
public health and safety;
    (5) Road reconstruction is needed to implement a road safety 
improvement project on a classified road determined to be hazardous on 
the basis of accident experience or accident potential on that road;

implementation of a management activity not otherwise prohibited by this 
subpart;
    (3) The cutting, sale, or removal of timber is needed and 
appropriate for personal or administrative use, as provided for in 36 
CFR part 223; or
    (4) Roadless characteristics have been substantially altered in a 
portion of an inventoried roadless area due to the construction of a 
classified road and subsequent timber harvest. Both the road 
construction and subsequent timber harvest must have occurred after the 
area was designated an inventoried roadless area and prior to January 
12, 2001. Timber may be cut, sold, or removed only in the substantially 
altered portion of the inventoried roadless area.

<R05>
Sec. 295.1  Applicability.

    The regulations in the following parts pertain to administrative 
designation and location of specific areas and trails of National Forest 
System lands on which the use of vehicles traveling off National Forest 
System roads is allowed, restricted or prohibited. Prohibitions 
regarding use of vehicles off roads is provided in 36 CFR part 261.

[43 FR 20006, May 10, 1978, as amended at 66 FR 3218, Jan. 12, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 295.2  Planning and designation for use of vehicles off National 
Forest System roads.

    (a) On National Forest System lands, the continuing land management 
planning process will be used to allow, restrict, or prohibit use by 
specific vehicle types off roads. This process will include coordination 
with appropriate Federal, State and local agencies. The planning process 
will analyze and evaluate current and potential impacts arising from 
operation of specific vehicle types on soil, water, vegetation, fish and 
wildlife, forest visitors and cultural and historic resources. If the 
analysis indicates that the use of one or more vehicle types off roads 
will cause considerable adverse effects on the resources or other forest 
visitors, use of the affected areas and trails by the vehicle type or 
types likely to cause such adverse effects will be restricted or 
prohibited until such time as the adverse effects can be eliminated as 
provided in 36 CFR part 261.
    (b) Off-road vehicle management plans shall provide vehicle 
management direction aimed at resource protection, public safety of all 
users, minimizing conflicts among users, and provide for diverse use and 
benefits of the National Forests. Designation of areas and trails shall 
be in accordance with the following:
    (1) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize damage to soil, 
watershed, vegetation, or other resources of the public lands.
    (2) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize harassment of 
wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife habitats.
    (3) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize conflicts between 
off-road vehicle use and other existing or proposed recreational uses of 
the same or neighboring public lands, and to ensure the compatibility of 
such uses with existing conditions in populated areas, taking into 
account noise and other factors.
    (4) Areas and trails shall not be located in officially designated 
Wilderness Areas or Primitive Areas.

However, this does not preclude the use of any fire, military, 
emergency, or law enforcement vehicle for emergency purposes, or the use 
of any combat or

[[Page 410]]

combat support vehicle for national defense purposes, or registered 
motorboats, or vehicle use expressly authorized by the Chief, Forest 
Service, under a permit, lease, license, or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 295.3  Public participation.

    The public shall be provided an opportunity to participate in the 
process of allowing, restricting, or prohibiting use of areas and trails 
to one or more specific vehicle types off forest development roads. 
Sixty days advance notice will be given to allow for public review of 
proposed or revised designations. In emergency situations, temporary 
designations up to one year in length may be made or revised without 
public participation if needed to protect the resources and/or to 
provide for public safety.


<R05>
Sec. 295.4  Public information.

    In addition to the requirements of 36 CFR 261.51, information and 
maps will be published and made available to the public, describing:
    (a) The regulation of vehicular use.
    (b) Time periods when use is allowed, restricted or prohibited.
    (c) The type of vehicle regulated.


<R05>
Sec. 295.5  Monitoring effects of vehicle use off National Forest System roads.

    The effects of use by specific types of vehicles off roads on 
National Forest System lands will be monitored. If the results of 
monitoring, including public input, indicate that the use of one or more 
vehicle types off roads is causing or will cause considerable adverse 
effects on the factors and resource values referred to in Sec. 295.2, 
the area or trail suffering adverse effects will be immediately closed 
to the responsible vehicle type or types until the adverse effects have 
been eliminated and measures have been implemented to prevent future 
recurrence as provided in 36 CFR part 261. Forest Supervisors may 
delegate immediate closure authority to District Rangers or other forest 
officers in order to facilitate timely actions to meet these objectives. 
Designations, use restrictions, and operating conditions will be revised 
as needed to meet changing conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 295.6  Revision of off-road vehicle management plans.

    Forest Supervisors will annually review off-road vehicle management 
plans and temporary designations implemented since the last annual 
review. If the plan needs revision, the public will be given the 
opportunity to participate in the review as stated in Sec. 295.3.

Sec. 296.1  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the 
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and 
procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing 
protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and 
Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land 
managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration 
provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 
42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal 
of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized 
excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of 
archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for 
ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources 
when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources.
    (b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions 
on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations 
relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple 
uses of the public lands.

permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those 
activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or 
removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might 
incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. 
General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other 
authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal 
as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the 
Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities 
which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, 
leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal 
of archaeological resources required for compliance with those 
authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit 
requirements of this part.
    (2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person 
collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet,

[[Page 414]]

or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this 
part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of 
any archaelogical resource.
    (3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 
of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or 
removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological 
resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in 
the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or 
archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member 
shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;
    (4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to 
carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued 
under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the 
enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such 
permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions 
until expiration.
    (5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit 
is issued under this part.
    (c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal 
land manager's direction, associated with the management of 
archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application 
procedures of Sec. 296.6. However, the Federal land manager shall insure 
that provisions of Sec. 296.8 and Sec. 296.9 have been met by other 
documented means, and that any official duties which might result in 
harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, 
as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject of 
consideration under Sec. 296.7.
    (d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf 
of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager 
shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of Sec. 296.5(b)(5), 
Sec. 296.7, Sec. 296.8(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), Sec. 296.9, 
Sec. 296.10, Sec. 296.12, and Sec. 296.13(a) to such Governor or to such 
designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the 
Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/
or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving 
any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other 
scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land 
manager.
    (e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities 
governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may 
be required for activities which do not require a permit under this 
part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any 
activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this 
part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of 
determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning 
such activities.


<R05>
Sec. 296.6  Application for permits and information collection.

    (a) Any person may apply to the appropriate Federal land manager for

[[Page 415]]

    (5) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of 
archaeological resources on public lands, the names of the university, 
museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the 
applicant proposes to store all collections, and copies of records, 
data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work. 
Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized 
official of the institution, of willingness to assume curatorial 
responsibility for the collections, records, data, photographs and other 
documelts and to safeguard and preserve these materials as property of 
the United States.
    (6) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of 
archaeological resources on Indian lands, the name of the university, 
museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the 
applicant proposes to store copies of records, data, photographs, and 
other documents derived from the proposed work, and all collections in 
the event the Indian owners do not wish to take custody or otherwise 
dispose of the archaeological resources. Applicants shall submit written

contained in Sec. 296.6 of these regulations has been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and 
assigned clearance number 1024-0037. The purpose of the information 
collection is to meet statutory and administrative requirements in the 
public interest. The information will be used to assist Federal land 
managers in determining that applicants for permits are qualified, that 
the work proposed would further archaeological knowledge, that 
archaeological resources and associated records and data will be 
properly preserved, and that the permitted activity would not conflict 
with the management of the public lands involved. Response to the 
information requirement is necessary in order for an applicant to obtain 
a benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 296.7  Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or 
destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural 
importance.

    (a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm 
to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on 
public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 
days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify 
any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or 
cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the 
public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.
    (1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be 
sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the 
tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be 
the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe 
and the Federal land manager.
    (2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native 
American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider 
sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.
    (3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager 
may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to 
discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential 
harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any 
mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the 
terms and conditions of the permit under Sec. 296.9.
    (4) When the Federal land manager detemines that a permit applied 
for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent 
threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal 
land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.

[[Page 416]]

    (b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural 
importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian 
tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal 
land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief 
executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the 
location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural 
importance so that such information may be on file for land management 
purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National 
Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure 
pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 
U.S.C. 470w-3).
    (2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American 
group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has 
aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land 
manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate 
with official representatives of that group to obtain information on 
sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.
    (3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any 
Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations 
for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this 
section.
    (4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in 
consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other 
Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of 
special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been 
issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the 
discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification 
have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land 
manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of 
permits, under Sec. 296.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land 
manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following 
the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and 
consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving 
Native American human remains and other ``cultural items'', as defined 
by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its 
implementing regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 296.10  Suspension and revocation of permits.

    (a) Suspension or revocation for cause. (1) The Federal land manager 
may suspend a permit issued pursuant to this part upon determining that 
the permittee has failed to meet any of the terms and conditions of the

<R05>
Sec. 296.11  Appeals relating to permits.

    Any affected person may appeal permit issuance, denial of permit 
issuance, suspension, revocation, and terms and conditions of a permit 
through existing administrative appeal procedures, or through procedures

<R05>
Sec. 296.12  Relationship to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation 
Act.

    Issuance of a permit in accordance with the Act and this part does 
not constitute an undertaking requiring compliance with section 106 of 
the Act of October 15, 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470f). However, the mere issuance 
of such a permit does not excuse the Federal land manager from 
compliance with section 106 where otherwise required.

Sec. 296.14  Determination of archaeological or commercial value and 
cost of restoration and repair.

    (a) Archaeological value. For purposes of this part, the 
archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a 
violation of the prohibitions in Sec. 296.4 of this part or conditions 
of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the value of the 
information associated with the archaeological resource. This value 
shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the 
scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the 
violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost 
of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out 
laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to 
realize the information potential.
    (b) Commercial value. For purposes of this part, the commercial 
value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the 
prohibitions in Sec. 296.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued 
pursuant to this part shall be its fair market value. Where the 
violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the 
fair market value should be determined using the condition of the 
archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its 
prior condition can be ascertained.
    (c) Cost of restoration and repair. For purposes of this part, the 
cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damaged as a 
result of a violation of prohibitions or conditions pursuant to this 
part, shall be the sum of the costs already incurred for emergency 
restoration or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary 
to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be 
limited to, the costs of the following:
    (1) Reconstruction of the archaeological resource;
    (2) Stabilization of the archaeological resource;
    (3) Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization;
    (4) Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization;
    (5) Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by 
the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from 
further disturbance;
    (6) Examination and analysis of the archaeological resource 
including recording remaining archaeological information, where 
necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which 
cannot be otherwise conserved;
    (7) Reinterment of human remains in accordance with religious custom 
and State, local, or tribal law, where appropriate, as determined by the 
Federal land manager.
    (8) Preparation of reports relating to any of the above activities.

to paragraph (d) of this section, or to await the Federal land manager's 
notice of assessment, and to request a hearing in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section. The notice shall also inform the person 
of the right to seek judicial review of any final administrative 
decision assessing a civil penalty.
    (c) The person served with a notice of violation shall have 45 
calendar days

[[Page 420]]

    (d) Petition for relief. The person served with a notice of 
violation may request that no penalty be assessed or that the amount be 
reduced, by filing a petition for relief with the Federal land manager 
within 45 calendar days of the date of service of the notice of

    (2) The Federal land manager shall take into consideration all 
available information, including information provided pursuant to 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section or furnished upon further request 
by the Federal land manager.
    (3) If the facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has 
occurred, the Federal land manager shall so notify the person served 
with a notice of violation, and no penalty shall be assessed.
    (4) Where the facts warrant a conclusion that a violation has 
occurred, the Federal land manager shall determine a penalty amount in 
accordance with Sec. 296.16.
    (f) Notice of assessment. The Federal land manager shall notify the 
person served with a notice of violation of the penalty amount assessed 
by serving a written notice of assessment, either in person or by 
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). The Federal 
land manager shall include in the notice of assessment:
    (1) The facts and conclusions from which it was determined that a 
violation did occur;
    (2) The basis in Sec. 296.16 for determining the penalty amount 
assessed and/or any offer to mitigate or remit the penalty; and
    (3) Notification of the right to request a hearing, including the 
procedures to be followed, and to seek judicial review of any final 
administrative decision assessing a civil penalty.
    (g) Hearings. (1) Except where the right to request a hearing is 
deemed to have been waived as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, the person served with a notice of assessment may file a 
written request for a hearing with the adjudicatory body specified in 
the notice. The person shall enclose with the request for hearing a copy 
of the notice of assessment, and shall deliver the request as specified 
in the notice of assessment, personally or by registered or certified 
mail (return receipt requested).
    (2) Failure to deliver a written request for a hearing within 45 
days of the date of service of the notice of assessment shall be deemed 
a waiver of the right to a hearing.
    (3) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be held in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. section 554. In any such hearing, the amount of 
civil penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with this part, 
and shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Federal land 
manager under paragraph (f) of this section or any offer of mitigation 
or remission made by the Federal land manager.
    (h) Final administrative decision. (1) Where the person served with 
a notice of violation has accepted the penalty

[[Page 421]]

pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the notice of violation 
shall constitute the final administrative decision;
    (2) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has not 
filed a timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section, the notice of assessment shall constitute the final 
administrative decision;
    (3) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has filed a 
timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the decision resulting from the hearing or any applicable 
administrative appeal therefrom shall constitute the final 
administrative decision.
    (i) Payment of penalty. (1) The person assessed a civil penalty 
shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final 
administrative decision in which to make full payment of the penalty 
assessed, unless a timely request for appeal has been filed with a 
United States District Court as provided in section 7(b)(1) of the Act.
    (2) Upon failure to pay the penalty, the Federal land manager may 
request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to collect the 
penalty in a United States District Court for any district in which the 
person assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts 
business. Where the Federal land manager is not represented by the 
Attorney General, a civil action may be initiated directly by the 
Federal land manager.
    (j) Other remedies not waived. Assessment of a penalty under this 
section shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to pursue other 
available legal or administrative remedies.


<R05>
Sec. 296.16  Civil penalty amounts.

    (a) Maximum amount of penalty. (1) Where the person being assessed a 
civil penalty has not committed any previous violation of any 
prohibition in Sec. 296.4 or of any term or condition included in a 
permit issued pursuant to this part, the maximum amount of the penalty 
shall be the full cost of restoration and repair of archaeological 
resources damaged plus the archaeological or commercial value of 
archaeological resources destroyed or not recovered.
    (2) Where the person being assessed a civil penalty has committed 
any previous violation of any prohibition in Sec. 296.4 or of any term 
or condition included in a permit issued pursuant to this part, the 
maximum amount of the penalty shall be double the cost of restoration 
and repair plus double the archaeological or commercial value of 
archaeological resources destroyed or not recovered.
    (3) Violations limited to the removal of arrowheads located on the 
surface of the ground shall not be subject to the penalties prescribed 
in this section.
    (b) Determination of penalty amount, mitigation, and remission. The 
Federal land manager may assess a penalty amount less than the maximum 
amount of penalty and may offer to mitigate or remit the penalty.
    (1) Determination of the penalty amount and/or a proposal to 
mitigate or remit the penalty may be based upon any of the following 
factors:
    (i) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to return 
to the Federal land manager archaeological resources removed from public 
lands or Indian lands;
    (ii) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to 
assist the Federal land manager in activity to preserve, restore, or 
otherwise contribute to the protection and study of archaeological 
resources on public lands or Indian lands;
    (iii) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to 
provide information which will assist in the detection, prevention, or 
prosecution of violations of the Act or this part;
    (iv) Demonstration of hardship or inability to pay, provided that 
this factor shall only be considered when the person being assessed a 
civil penalty has not been found to have previously violated the 
regulations in this part;
    (v) Determination that the person being assessed a civil penalty did 
not willfully commit the violation;
    (vi) Determination that the proposed penalty would constitute 
excessive punishment under the circumstances;
    (vii) Determination of other mitigating circumstances appropriate to 
consideration in reaching a fair and expeditious assessment.

[[Page 422]]

    (2) When the penalty is for a violation on Indian lands, the Federal 
land manager shall consult with and consider the interests of the Indian 
landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the Indian lands 
prior to proposing to mitigate or remit the penalty.
    (3) When the penalty is for a violation which may have had an effect 
on a known Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, the 
Federal land manager should consult with and consider the interests of 
the affected tribe(s) prior to proposing to mitigate or remit the 
penalty.

archaeological resources, vehicles, or equipment involved in a violation 
may be subject to forfeiture.
    (b) Section 8(a) of the Act provides for rewards to be made to 
persons who furnish information which leads to conviction for a criminal

to receive payment. Officers and employees of Federal, State, or local 
government who furnish information or render service in the performance 
of their official duties, and persons who have provided information 
under Sec. 296.16(b)(1)(iii) shall not be certified eligible to receive 
payment of rewards.
    (c) In cases involving Indian lands, all civil penalty monies and 
any item forfeited under the provisions of this section shall be 
transferred to the appropriate Indian or Indian tribe.


<R05>

under subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 of the United States Code or 
any other provision of law, information concerning the nature and 
location of any archaeological resource, with the following exceptions:
    (1) The Federal land manager may make information available, 
provided that the disclosure will further the purposes of the Act and 
this part, or the Act of June 27, 1960, as amended (16 U.S.C. 469-469c), 
without risking harm to the archaeological resource or to the site in 
which it is located.
    (2) The Federal land manager shall make information available, when 
the Governor of any State has submitted to the Federal land manager a 
written request for information, concerning the archaeological resources 
within the requesting Governor's State, provided that the request 
includes:
    (i) The specific archaeological resource or area about which 
information is sought;

[60 FR 5260, 5261, Jan. 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 296.20  Public Awareness Programs.

    (a) Each Federal land manager will establish a program to increase 
public awareness of the need to protect important archaeological 
resources located on public and Indian lands. Educational activities 
required by section 10(c) of the Act should be incorporated into other 
current agency public education and interpretation programs where 
appropriate.
    (b) Each Federal land manager annually will submit to the Secretary 
of the Interior the relevant information on public awareness activities 
required by section 10(c) of the Act for inclusion in the comprehensive

Sec. 296.21  Surveys and Schedules.

    (a) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and 
the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority will develop 
plans for surveying lands under each agency's control to determine the 
nature and extent of archaeological resources pursuant to section 14(a) 
of the Act. Such activities should be consistent with Federal agency 
planning policies and other historic preservation program 
responsibilities required by 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq. Survey plans prepared 
under this section will be designed to comply with the purpose of the 
Act regarding the protection of archaeological resources.
    (b) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and 
the Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority will prepare schedules 
for surveying lands under each agency's control that are likely to 
contain the most scientifically valuable archaeological resources 
pursuant to section 14(b) of the Act. Such schedules will be developed 
based on objectives and information identified in survey plans described 
in paragraph (a) of this section and implemented systematically to cover 
areas where the most scientifically valuable archaeological resources 
are likely to exist.
    (c) Guidance for the activities undertaken as part of paragraphs (a) 
through (b) of this section is provided by the Secretary of the 
Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic 
Preservation.
    (d) Other Federal land managing agencies are encouraged to develop 
plans for surveying lands under their jurisdictions and prepare 
schedules for surveying to improve protection and management of 
archaeological resources.
    (e) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and 
the Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority will develop a system for 
documenting and reporting suspected violations of the various provisions 
of the Act. This system will reference a set of procedures for use by 
officers, employees, or agents of Federal agencies to assist them in 
recognizing violations, documenting relevant evidence, and reporting 
assembled information to the appropriate authorities. Methods employed 
to document and report such violations should be compatible with 
existing agency reporting systems for documenting violations of other 
appropriate Federal statutes and regulations. Summary information to be 
included in the Secretary's comprehensive report will be based upon the 
system developed by each Federal land manager for documenting suspected 
violations.

amended, provides for the protection of the free-flowing, scenic, and 
natural values of rivers designated as components or potential 
components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System from the 
effects of construction of any water resources project.


<R05>
Sec. 297.2  Scope and application.

    These rules apply to Federal assistance in the construction of water 
resources projects affecting Wild and Scenic Rivers or Study Rivers 
administered in whole or part by the Secretary of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 297.3  Definitions.

    Act means the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (82 Stat. 906, as amended; 
16 U.S.C. 1271-1288).
    Construction means any action carried on with Federal assistance 
affecting the free-flowing characteristics or the scenic or natural 
values of a Wild and Scenic River or Study River.
    Federal assistance means any assistance by an authorizing agency 
including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) A license, permit, preliminary permit, or other authorization 
granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to sections 
4(e) and 4(f) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797;
    (b) A license, permit, or other authorization granted by the Corps 
of Engineers, Department of the Army, pursuant to the Rivers and Harbors 
Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), and section 404 of the Clean Water 
Act (33 U.S.C. 1344); and,
    (c) Any other license, permit, or authorization which may be 
required by an agency or Department of the Federal Government before, 
during, or after construction of a water resources project.
    Free-flowing is defined by section 16(b) of the Act as ``existing or 
flowing in natural condition without impoundment, diversion, 
straightening, riprapping, or other modification of the waterway'' (16 
U.S.C. 1287(b)).
    Study period means the time during which a river is being studied as 
a potential component of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System and such 
additional time as provided in section 7(b)(ii) of the Act not to exceed 
3 additional years during which a report recommending designation is 
before the Congress, or such additional time as may be provided by 
statute.
    Study river means a river and the adjacent area within one quarter 
mile of the banks of the river which is designated for study as a 
potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System 
pursuant to section 5(a) of the Act.
    Water resources project means any dam, water conduit, reservoir, 
powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works under the Federal 
Power Act (41 Stat. 1063) as amended, or other construction of 
developments which would affect the free-flowing characteristics of a 
Wild and Scenic River or Study River.
    Wild and scenic river means a river and the adjacent area within the 
boundaries of a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System 
pursuant to section 3(a) or 2(a)(ii) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 297.4  Requirements for Federal agencies.

    (a) No license, permit, or other authorization can be issued for a 
Federally assisted water resources project on any portion of a Wild and 
Scenic River or Study River nor can appropriations be requested to begin 
construction of such projects, without prior notice to the Secretary of 
Agriculture, and a determination in accordance with section 7 of the 
Act.
    (b) As soon as practicable, but no less than 60 days prior to the 
date of proposed action, the Federal agency shall provide a notice of 
intent to issue such license, permit, or other authorization to the 
Chief, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2417, 
Washington, DC 20013. The Secretary will, to the extent possible, give 
expedited consideration to a notice of intent for a project needed to 
address an emergency situation.
    (c) The notice shall include the following information:

[[Page 425]]

    (1) Name and location of affected river;
    (2) Location of the project;
    (3) Nature of the permit or other authorization proposed for 
issuance;
    (4) A description of the proposed activity; and
    (5) Any relevant information, such as plans, maps, and environmental 
studies, assessments, or environmental impact statements.


<R05>
Sec. 297.5  Determination.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture will consent to the issuance of any 
Federal license, permit, or other authorization if, as a finding of 
fact, it is determined that:
    (1) The water resources project will not have a direct and adverse 
effect on the values for which a Wild and Scenic River or Study River 
was designated, when any portion of the project is within the boundaries 
of said river, or;
    (2) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade 
nor unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish wildlife 
values of a Wild and Scenic River, when any portion of the project is 
located above, below, or outside the Wild and Scenic River, or;
    (3) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade 
nor diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish and wildlife values of a 
Study River when the project is located above, below, or outside the 
Study River during the study period.
    (b) If consent is denied, the Secretary may recommend measures to 
eliminate adverse effects, and the authorizing agencies may submit 
revised plans for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 297.6  Environmental analysis requirements.

    (a) The determination of the effects of a proposed water resources 
project shall be made in compliance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA). To the extent possible, authorizing agencies should 
ensure that any environmental studies, assessments, or environmental 
impact statements prepared for a water resources project adequately 
address the environmental effects on resources protected by the Wild and 
Scenic Rivers Act, and that the Department of Agriculture is apprised of 
ongoing analyses so as to facilitate coordination and identification of 
Wild and Scenic River related issues.
    (b) To the extent practicable, impacts on Wild and Scenic River 
values will be considered in the context of other review procedures 
provided by law. Authorizing agencies are encouraged to consult with the 
Forest Service in order to identify measures which could eliminate any 
direct and adverse effects, thereby increasing the likelihood of 
securing consent.
