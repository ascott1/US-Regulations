                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request. 

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 200.2  Field organization.

    The field organization of the Forest Service consists of regions, 
stations, and areas as described below:
    (a) Regions of the National Forest System. For the purpose of 
managing the lands administered by the Forest Service, the United States 
is divided into nine geographic regions of the National Forest System. 
Each region has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Regional 
Forester who is responsible to the Chief for the activities assigned to 
that region. Within each region are located national forests and other 
lands of the Forest Service.
    (1) National Forests. Each Forest has a headquarters office and is 
supervised by a Forest Supervisor who is responsible to the Regional 
Forester. Two or more proclaimed or designated National Forests, or all 
of the Forests in a State, may be combined into one Forest Service 
Administrative Unit headed by one Forest Supervisor. Each Forest is 
divided into Ranger Districts. The Alaska Region is composed of two 
National Forests without Ranger Districts; with one Forest divided into 
three areas, each administered by a Forest Supervisor.
    (2) Ranger districts. Each district may include a portion of a 
national forest, a national grassland or portion thereof, a national 
recreation area, a wilderness or primitive area, and other lands 
administered by the Forest Service. Each district has a headquarters 
office and is supervised by a District Ranger (or Area Ranger in some 
cases) who is responsible to the Forest Supervisor.
    (b) Forest and rangeland research coordination. The field research 
program is coordinated by six research stations, the national Forest 
Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical 
Forestry. Each has a headquarters office and a Director who is 
responsible to the Chief for all research activities within a 
geographical area of the United States or its territories. Scientists 
are based at Research Work Units with laboratories located in 36 lower 
States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Scientists primarily conduct 
their work within a given geographical area, but due to the integrated 
and cooperative nature of the research program, they make work 
nationwide and internationally.
    (c) State and private forestry cooperation. Field level cooperation 
between the Forest Service, States, and the private sector on forestry 
activities is accomplished by the Northeastern Area State and Private 
Forestry for the Northeastern States; and by the National Forest 
Regional Offices in the Southeastern and Western States. The 
Northeastern Area is supervised by an Area Director who is responsible 
to the Chief for State and private forestry activities within the Area. 
Regional Foresters in Regions 1 through 8 and Region 10 are responsible 
for State and private forestry activities within those regions.
    (d) International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The Institute is 
managed by a Director who is the senior Forest Service official in 
Puerto Rico. The Director is responsible to the Chief for planning and 
directing research, science and technology exchange, technical 
assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and international 
cooperation on natural resources concerning tropical forestry.
    (e) Field addresses. The addresses of Regional Foresters, Station 
Directors, and Area Directors are given below. Under each Regional 
Office address is a list of National Forest Administrative Units by 
States with locations of Forest Supervisor headquarters. Headquarters 
locations for Ranger Districts, National Grasslands, and National

Recreation Areas are not listed but may be obtained from Forest 
Supervisors or Regional Foresters.

                   Subpart B--Functions and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 200.3  Forest Service functions.

    (a) Legislative authority. The basic laws authorizing activities of 
the Forest Service are set forth in the U.S.C. in title 7 (Agriculture), 
chapters 14, 17, 33, 55, 59, and 61; title 16 (Conservation), chapters 
2, 3, 4, 5C, 6, 23, 27, 28, 30, 36, and 37; title 29 (Labor), chapter 
17; and title 43 (Public Lands), chapters 22 and 35.
    (b) Work of the Forest Service. Under delegated authority from the 
Secretary of Agriculture, the broad responsibilities of the Forest 
Service are:
    (1) Leadership in forestry. The Forest Service provides overall 
leadership in forest and forest-range conservation, development, and 
use. This involves determination of forestry conditions and 
requirements, and recommendations of policies and programs needed to 
keep the Nation's private and public lands fully productive.
    (2) National Forest System administration. (i) The Forest Service 
administers and manages the National Forest System lands in accordance 
with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of June 12, 1960 (16 U.S.C. 
528-531); the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 
August 17, 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614); and the National Forest 
Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a, 476, 500, 513-516, 
521b; 576b, 1600-1602, 1604, 1606, 1608-1614).

[[Page 10]]

    (ii) The National Forest System comprises about 188 million acres of 
land in the National Forests, National Grasslands, and other areas which 
have been transferred to the Forest Service for administration. On these 
public lands:
    (A) Forestry methods are applied in growing and harvesting timber,
    (B) Forage is scientifically managed for the use of domestic 
livestock whose numbers are kept in balance with the carrying capacity 
of the range,
    (C) Wildlife habitat and species are managed,
    (D) Watersheds are managed to safeguard the water supply and 
stabilize streamflow,
    (E) Recreation resources are managed for public enjoyment and 
benefit,
    (F) Many forms of land and resource use are granted under permit or 
lease, and
    (G) Physical and resource improvements needed to develop, protect, 
and use all resources are built and maintained.
    (3) Cooperative forestry. The Forest Service carries out cooperative 
forestry programs for public benefit through programs initiated by 
State, county, and other Federal agencies in accordance with the 
Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of July 1, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2101-
2111). These programs are directed at the protection, development, and 
sustained production of all forestry resources, both public and private.
    (4) Forest research. The Forest Service conducts research on 
problems involving protection, development, management, renewal, and 
continuous use of all resources, products, values, and services of 
forest lands in accordance with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
Resources Research Act of June 30, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641-1647). Research 
is conducted on:
    (i) Forest and range management, including the five basic resources 
of timber, forest soil and water, range forage, wildlife and fish 
habitat, and forest recreation,
    (ii) Forest protection from fire, insects, and disease,
    (iii) Forest products and engineering, and
    (iv) Forest resource economics including forest survey, forest 
economics, and forest products marketing.

<R05>
Sec. 200.4  Administrative issuances.

    (a) The regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture governing the 
protection and administration of National Forest System lands and other 
programs of the Forest Service are set forth in Chapter 2 of Title 36 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Administrative policy, procedure, and guidance to Forest Service 
employees for the conduct of Forest Service activities are issued as 
directives, or through correspondence, by the office of the Chief of the 
Forest Service and by the field officers listed in Sec. 200.2.
    (1) Directives are issued through the Forest Service Directive 
System, which is comprised of the Forest Service Manual and related 
Forest Service Handbooks. The Directive System codifies the agency's 
policy, practice, and procedure affecting more than one unit and the 
delegations of continuing authority and assignment of continuing 
responsibilities; serves as the primary administrative basis for the 
internal management and control of all programs; and is the primary 
source of administrative direction to Forest Service employees.
    (2) In contrast to direction issued through the Directive System, 
guidance issued to one or more organizational units through letters and 
memoranda relate to decisions or interpretations on specific activities, 
cases, or incidents or to other matters of agency business, especially 
those matters of short-term duration or immediate interest.
    (c) Forest Service Directive System issuances are published under 
delegated authority as follows:
    (1) The Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances 
to all Forest Service units are published by the Office of the Chief.
    (2) Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances may 
be supplemented as needed for field office use by a Regional Forester, a 
Regional

[[Page 11]]

Special Agent in Charge of Law Enforcement and Investigations, a 
Research Station Director, the International Institute for Tropical 
Forestry Director, the Area Director, or a Forest Supervisor.
    (d) Guidance issued through letters and memoranda must be issued in 
accordance with signing authorities delegated through issuances to the 
Forest Service Directive System.
    (e) An alphabetical index of the contents of the Forest Service 
Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks is published in Forest 
Service Handbook 1109.11, Directive System User Guide. The index 
contains a listing of all Series, Titles, and Chapters in the Forest 
Service Manual and a listing of all Forest Service Handbooks in the 
Directive System.
    (f) Forest Service Handbook 6209.11, Records Management Handbook, 
outlines and indexes the filing system for all correspondence and other 
records.
    (g) Forms and reports used by the agency are listed in, and 
instructions for their use are issued throughout, the Forest Service 
Directive System and are collated in Forest Service Handbook 1309.14, 
Information Requirements Handbook.

[62 FR 33367, June 19, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 200.5  Indexes.

    Publication of the indexes described in Sec. 200.4 is deemed both 
unnecessary and impractical because of the large volume of material 
involved. However, copies of the indexes are available for public review 
in the Forest Service headquarters office in Washington, DC, and at 
field offices listed under Sec. 200.2(d). The Forest Service will 
provide copies of any index upon request at a cost not to exceed the 
direct cost of duplication.

[40 FR 12790, Mar. 21, 1975. Redesignated at 62 FR 13540, Mar. 21, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 200.6  Information available; inspection, copying, and charges.

    (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 7 CFR 1.2, the Forest 
Service shall make available for public inspection and copying all 
published or unpublished directives, forms, records, and final opinions, 
including concurring or dissenting opinions and orders made in the 
adjudication of cases. Charges for information requested from the Forest

given location, the personnel where the request is received will direct 
the requester to another office where the information may be obtained.
    (c) Inspection and copying availability is as follows:
    (1) Facilities for inspection and copying are available at the 
offices listed in Secs. 200.1 and 200.2, during established office hours 
for the particular location, usually 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through

equipment to the appropriate offices listed in Secs. 200.1 and 200.2.
    (3) Requesters should make prior arrangements for using agency 
copying facilities or for bringing in copying equipment and, in the 
later case, should get advance approval from the office.
    (d) Any request for information pursuant to the provisions of the 
Freedom of Information Act must be submitted in accordance with 
Secs. 200.7 and 200.8. The Forest Service charges a fee for copies of 
records not generally made available to the public but released pursuant 
to a FOIA request in accordance with a schedule of fees established by 
the Department of Agriculture at 7 CFR Part 1, Subpart A, Appendix A.

[[Page 12]]

These fees do not apply to information that is generally and routinely 
made available to the public upon request, such as recreational 
brochures, pamphlets, maps, and technical guides as well as agency 
directive issuances. Separate charges for such general information are 
established in the agency's Directive System (Sec. 200.4). For example, 
some pamphlets and small segments of the Forest Service Manual and 
Handbook may be provided at no cost, but maps of the National Forest 
System and larger sections of the Manual and Handbook are available for 
a charge. Current charges are explained at the time the request is made.

    (5) Questions on timeliness will be decided by the Reviewing 
Officer.
    (6) Decisions may be implemented unless a stay is granted.
    (d) Extensions. (1) Time for filing notice of appeal may not be 
extended.
    (2) Written requests for extensions to request an oral presentation, 
to prepare a statement of reasons, to provide comments on the responsive 
statement, and to submit comments following an oral presentation may be 
granted by the Reviewing Officer for good cause shown by the Applicant. 
A decision will be made within 10 days of receipt and written 
notification will be provided.
    (e) Notice of appeal content. The notice must specifically identify 
the decision being appealed, the decision date, the Forest Officer who 
made the decision, how the Appellant is affected by the decision, and 
the relief desired.
    (f) Levels of appeal. (1) The available levels of appeal are in 
sequence according to the National Forest System line officer 
relationship. A decision made within delegated authority by any officer 
who serves as staff to a line officer listed below is considered a 
decision made by the line officer. A procedural decision cannot be 
appealed to a level higher than that available for the initial 
substantive decision from which the procedural matter arises.
    (i) Initial decisions of a District Ranger may be appealed to the 
Forest Supervisor, with second level appeal to the Regional Forester.
    (ii) Initial decisions of a Forest Supervisor may be appealed to the 
Regional Forester, with second level appeal to the Chief.
    (iii) Initial decisions of a Regional Forester may be appealed to 
the Chief.
    (iv) Initial decisions of the Chief may be appealed to the Secretary 
of Agriculture.
    (2) Appeal decisions made by the Chief will be sent to the Secretary 
within one business day: The Secretary may exercise discretion to review 
such decisions, but will accept a notice of appeal or petition only for 
initial decisions made by the Chief.
    (3) A notice of appeal of any initial decision made by the Chief 
shall, within 5 days of its receipt by the Chief, be sent along with the 
relevant decision to the Secretary for review at the Secretary's 
discretion. The appeal is deemed denied if the Secretary takes no action 
within 10 days of receiving the appeal.
    (4) Appeal decisions made by the Chief may be implemented if the 
Secretary, within 10 days of receipt, does not exercise discretionary 
review.
    (5) If the Secretary elects to review a decision made by the Chief, 
the review may be conducted based on the record before the Chief, or 
under other procedures the Secretary may deem appropriate, including the 
preparation of a responsive statement.
    (6) Decisions at the final level of review constitute the final 
administrative determination of the Department of Agriculture.
    (g) Responsive statement. At each level of appeal except for 
decisions of the Chief, the Deciding Officer will, within 30 days of 
receiving a statement of reasons, prepare a responsive statement and 
send it to the parties to the appeal. The responsive statement will 
respond to Appellant's reasons, and by specific reference may 
incorporate documents submitted by parties to the appeal. Appellants 
may, within 20 days from the

[[Page 21]]

mailing date of the responsive statement, provide a concise reply. Upon 
receipt of such reply, or at the end of the 20-day period, whichever 
comes first, the appeal record will be sent to the Reviewing Officer.
    (h) Stay of decision pending appeal. (1) An appellant or intervenor 
may request a stay of decision at any time while an appeal is pending.
    (2) When a request to intervene is accompanied by a stay request, 
the Reviewing Officer shall first decide whether to grant intervention. 
The 21-day period for ruling on the stay request begins on the date 
intervention is granted. The Reviewing Officer will not rule on the stay 
request if intervention is denied.
    (3) In making a request for stay of decision, an appellant or 
intervenor must:
    (i) File the request for stay and accompanying documents with the 
Reviewing Officer and simultaneously provide a copy to the Deciding 
Officer.
    (ii) Enclose a copy of the Notice of Appeal or request for 
intervention, unless already submitted and acknowledged.
    (iii) As part of the request, provide a written description of the 
specific project(s), activity(ies), or other action(s) to be stopped. 
The request must state the specific reason(s) why the stay should be 
granted in detail sufficient to permit the Reviewing Officer to evaluate 
and rule upon the stay request. Requesters' description shall include:
    (A) Specific effect(s) upon the requester in site-specific terms of 
the project(s), activity(ies), or other action(s) to be stopped; (B) 
impacts or affects to resources in the area affected by the project(s), 
activity(ies), or action(s) to be stopped; and (C) how the effects in 
paragraphs (h)(3)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section would prevent a 
meaningful appeal on the merits while the appeal decision is pending.
    (4) The Reviewing Officer may rule on a stay request or petition to 
change or lift a stay at any time, but, must rule no later than 21 
calendar days from receipt.
    (i) If a stay is granted, the stay shall specify: Specific 
activities to be stopped; duration of the stay; and reasons for granting 
the stay. A stay shall remain in effect for 10 days after a decision on 
the merits, unless a different period is specified in the stay decision 
document, or a Reviewing Officer changes a stay decision pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(7) of this section.
    (ii) If a stay is denied, in whole or in part, the decision document 
shall specify the reasons for the denial and any subsequent appeal 
rights.
    (5) In deciding a stay request, a Reviewing Officer shall consider 
the following:
    (i) Information provided by the requester pursuant to paragraph 
(h)(3)(iii) of this section including the validity of any claims of 
injury to the requester or the public interest.
    (ii) The effect a stay decision would have on the preservation of a 
meaningful appeal on the merits.
    (iii) Any other factors the Reviewing Officer may consider relevant.
    (6) Deciding Officers may provide Reviewing Officers with a response 
to stay requests. A copy of any response provided shall be sent to all 
parties to the appeal.
    (7) A Reviewing Officer may change a stay decision, according to any 
terms established in the stay decision itself, or at any time during 
pendancy of an appeal that circumstances support a change of the stay.
    (i) A Reviewing Officer may change a stay decision upon petition by 
any party to the appeal (including the Deciding Officer) at any time 
that circumstances support such action. A decision not to change a stay 
decision is not appealable.
    (ii) In making any change to a stay decision, the Reviewing Officer 
must consider the criteria outlined in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
    (iii) Petitions to change an existing stay decision must contain an 
explanation of how circumstances have changed.
    (8) Levels of appeal for any decision on a stay request or change 
thereof are those specified in paragraphs (f), (l), and (o) of this 
section. Appellants may choose to file a procedural appeal of a stay 
decision pursuant to paragraph (o)(4) of this section or to request a 
change in a stay decision pursuant to paragraph (h)(7) of this section, 
but

[[Page 22]]

may not elect to pursue both options. In appeals with multiple parties 
(appellants and/or intervenors), once any party invokes a procedural 
appeal of a stay decision or a request to change a stay decision, 
whichever occurs first, all other parties shall be bound by that action 
and cannot then pursue the alternate course of action.
    (9) The provisions of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(8) of this 
section apply to all appeals pending on July 20, 1987.
    (i) Dismissal. (1) An Appellant may withdraw an appeal at any time 
by notifying the Deciding Officer and other parties to the appeal in 
writing.
    (2) A Reviewing Officer may dismiss an appeal when:
    (i) Appellant has failed to submit a timely statement of reasons and 
the notice of appeal provides an insufficient basis upon which to base a 
decision.
    (ii) Relief desired by the Appellant cannot be granted under 
existing facts or laws.
    (3) Dismissals are appealable, if a level is available as set forth 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (j) Scope of appeal. Throughout all levels of appeal, an Appellant 
and any Intervenor shall be confined to the issues originally raised in 
the appeal. New information on the original issues may be introduced at 
any level.
    (k) Provision for comments. Any person or organization may submit 
written comments for the record. Such comments will be considered as 
provided for in paragraph (p) of this section.
    (l) Intervenors. (1) At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, any 
person or organization having an immediate interest in the subject of an 
appeal may intervene by submitting written information at any level of 
the apppeal process. Such intervention shall not act to elevate the 
appeal to levels higher than available to the original Appellant.
    (2) In appeals involving Intervenors, the Reviewing Officer may 
prescribe special procedures to expedite the process. The parties to the 
appeal will be notified of these procedures.
    (3) Appellants and Intervenors must concurrently furnish copies of 
all submissions to each other; otherwise, such submissions may be 
removed from the appeal record. At the discretion of the Reviewing 
Officer, Appellants may be given time to review and comment on initial 
submissions by intervenors and vice versa.
    (4) Appellants or Intervenors appealing a decision to a higher level 
must furnish copies of their notice of appeal to all other named parties 
to the appeal.
    (m) Oral presentation. Within the appeal time limits established 
herein, parties to an appeal may ask to give an oral presentation. The 
Reviewing Officer will respond in writing to the request no later than 
10 days after receiving the appeal record. If the request is granted, 
the Reviewing Officer will advise the parties of who will hear the 
presentation, and of the place, time, and date. Participants may provide 
documentary material at the presentation and, within 10 days after the 
presentation, may also submit a brief summary of their remarks.
    (n) Consolidation of appeals. Multiple appeals of the same decision, 
or of similar decisions involving common issues, facts, or law, may be 
consolidated by the Reviewing Officer who may then issue one appeal 
decision. At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, the Deciding 
Officer may prepare one responsive statement to multiple appeals.
    (o) Procedural matters. (1) Decisions on stays and dismissals are 
the only appealable procedural decisions. Such appeals must be filed 
with the Deciding Officer within 30 days of the procedural decision. A 
statement of the Appellant's reasons must be included.
    (2) Within 10 days of receipt, the Deciding Officer shall send 
appeals on stays and dismissals and a response to the Reviewing Officer 
for decision.
    (3) Decisions on procedural matters will be made by the Reviewing 
Officer within 10 days of receipt and all parties will be notified of 
the decision in writing.
    (4) Appeal of decisions on procedural matters cannot exceed the 
highest level available for the initial substantive decision appealed.
    (p) Appeal record. The record consists of a distinct set of 
identifiable documents directly concerning the appeal, including, but 
not limited to, notices of

[[Page 23]]

appeal, comments, statements of reasons, responsive statements, 
procedural determinations, correspondence, summaries of oral 
presentations and related documents, appeal decisions, and other 
information the Reviewing Officer may consider necessary to reach a 
decision. For a period not to exceed 10 days following the date the 
record is received by the Reviewing Officer or from the date of the oral 
presentation, whichever is the later date, parties may submit additional 
information to the Reviewing Officer for the record. They must 
concurrently send copies to all other parties who may within 20 days of 
the date they receive such material, provide a concise response to the 
Reviewing Officer. Upon receipt of such response, the record will be 
closed. The record is open for public inspection.
    (q) Request for additional information or remand for further action. 
If the appeal record is considered inadequate to affirm or reverse a 
decision, the Reviewing Officer may suspend the appeal process and 
request additional information, or remand the case with instructions for 
further action.
    (r) Appeal decision. An appeal decision will be based only on the 
record and should be made within 30 days of the date the record is 
closed. The Appellant will be notified if more time is needed.
    (s) Continuance of appeals. Provisions of 36 CFR 211.19 will remain 
in effect for appeals initially filed between June 28, 1977, and the 
effective date of 36 CFR 211.18. The procedures of this section shall 
not apply to any decision of a forest officer made after February 21, 
1989.

traffic are defined to include, but not be limited to, groupings such as 
commercial hauling, recreation and administrative.
    (iii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use 
as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
    (iv) Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Cost recovery on forest service roads. The Chief may determine 
that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, 
improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment thereof, used or to be 
used for commercial hauling of non-Federal forests products and other 
non-Federal products, commodities and materials, should be borne by the 
owners or haulers thereof. The Chief may condition the permission to use 
a road, or segment thereof, upon payment to the United States of the 
proportionate share of the cost and bearing proportionate maintenance as 
determined to be attributable to the owner's or hauler's use in 
accordance with Sec. 212.9. This condition to use roads would apply 
where the owners or haulers:
    (1) Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction, 
reconstruction, or improvements, and

[[Page 26]]

    (2) Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of 
the costs.
    (d) Maintenance and reconstruction of forest service roads by 
users--(1) Maintenance. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with 
an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or 
users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and other 
products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition commensurate 
with the particular use requirements of each. The maintenance to be 
borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use and no individual 
user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of maintenance other 
than that commensurate with his use.
    (2) Reconstruction. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with 
an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or 
users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is 
requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate 
his use.
    (3) Deposits in lieu of performance. If the maintenance or 
reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that 
maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the 
Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to 
provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs. 
Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be 
used for the purposes deposited, except that:
    (i) Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may 
be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of 
performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates, 
and
    (ii) Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for 
which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or 
refunded.
    (e) Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator. Any fees or 
other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement 
or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's 
cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for 
making these payments.

Sec. 212.6  Ingress and egress.

    (a) Policy in acquiring and granting access. To assure effective 
protection, management, and utilization of lands administered by the 
Forest Service and intermingled and adjacent private and public lands, 
and for the use and development of the resources upon which communities 
within or adjacent to the National Forests are dependent, the Chief 
shall as promptly as is feasible obtain needed access thereto and shall 
grant appropriate access across National Forest and other lands and 
easements administered by the Forest Service to intermingled or adjacent 
landowners. Construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a road or 
highway requires written authorization.
    (b) Actual settlers and other persons residing within the National 
Forests and other areas administered by the Forest Service. Actual 
settlers and other persons residing within the National Forests and 
other areas administered by the Forest Service shall be permitted 
ingress and egress over the same and use of existing forest development 
roads and trails in order to reach their homes and to utilize their 
property: Provided, such ingress and egress or use shall conform to 
rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of the 
lands and the roads or trails to be used.
    (c) Others. Entering upon the National Forests and other lands 
administered by the Forest Service and use of existing forest 
development roads and trails shall be permitted for all proper

[[Page 27]]

and lawful purposes subject to compliance with rules and regulations 
governing the lands and the roads or trails to be used.

Sec. 212.7  Access procurement by the United States.

    (a) Existing or proposed forest development roads which are or will 
be parts of a system of a State, county, or other local subdivision. 
Forest development roads which are or will be parts of a road system of 
a State, county, or other local subdivision and are on rights-of-way 
held in the name of the State, county, or other local subdivision may be 
constructed, reconstructed, improved or maintained by the Forest Service 
when there is an appropriate agreement with the State, county, or other 
local subdivision under authority of 23 U.S.C. 205: Provided, Such 
construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance is essential 
to provide safe and economical access to the National Forests and other 
lands administered by the Forest Service.
    (b) Acquisition of easements and rights of use. Except as otherwise 
provided in the regulations of this part, easements for road and trail 
construction across non-Federal lands and easements or rights of use 
over non-Federal roads and trails will be acquired in the name of the 
United States of America and its assigns. The easements or rights of use 
may be acquired by purchase, condemnation, donation, or as a reciprocal 
for permits or easements for roads or trails to be constructed or for 
easements over or permits to use existing roads or trails.
    (c) Methods of compensation for easements and rights of use acquired 
by the United States. Compensation in negotiated acquisitions may be:
    (1) By payment from appropriated funds;
    (2) Pursuant to reservation in the grant of easement to the United 
States whereby the grantor reserves the right to require haulers of 
Federal timber or other Federal products over the road conveyed or 
thereafter constructed by the grantor to make payments to the grantor in 
accordance with the terms of the reservation;
    (3) By granting reciprocal rights; or
    (4) By a combination of these methods.
    (d) Cooperative construction and use agreements. Where areas, partly 
lands administered by the Forest Service and partly private or other 
ownership are undeveloped or inadequately developed by roads, the Chief 
will, to the extent feasible and advantageous to the United States, join 
in planning, constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, and 
using an adequate road system on the basis of each party bearing the 
proportion of the cost attributable to the anticipated benefits as set 
forth in Sec. 212.9.
    (e) Condemnation. Where access across non-Federal land or over a 
non-Federal road or trail cannot be obtained through negotiations with 
reasonable promptness, condemnation will be undertaken.
    (f) Access over non-Federal land and use of non-Federal roads or 
trails on a temporary basis. The Chief may negotiate a temporary 
agreement for access over non-Federal land and for use of an existing 
non-Federal road or trail where there is immediate need for temporary 
access for limited purposes that can be economically met by such 
procedure, or where the foreseeable need does not justify the 
expenditures necessary to provide a permanent road or trail.
    (g) Use and control of interests in roads, trails, and easements 
acquired by the United States. Interests in roads, trails, and easements 
acquired by the United States shall be under the control of the United 
States, subject to approved reservations, limitations and other 
provisions set forth in the easement, permit, or other indenture. This 
control by the United States may include restricting or conditioning the 
use of the interest owned by the United States in the

[[Page 28]]

road, trail, or easement where necessary.

Sec. 212.8  Permission to cross lands and easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest Service.

    (a) Permission to construct or use roads across lands and assignable 
easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest 
Service. If a reciprocal benefit is needed by the United States, 
permission to construct or use a road across lands and across assignable 
easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest 
Service will be conditioned, except as provided in this section, for any 
applicant who seeks a permit to construct or use a road across the same, 
upon the grant to the United States of a reciprocal benefit. Such 
benefit shall bear:
    (1) A reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by 
the Forest Service; and
    (2) A value substantially similar to the value of the estate or 
interest in lands or easements applied for. In those instances where the 
values of the interests needed by the United States exceed those applied 
for by the applicant, the additional interests required by the United 
States will be acquired as provided in Sec. 212.7(b) and (c). Where 
values needed by the applicant exceed those needed by the United States, 
the difference in values will be determined under principles set forth 
below and in Secs. 212.5(c) and 212.9. If a reciprocal benefit is not 
needed by the United States, or the applicant shows good cause why the 
reciprocal benefit needed by the United States cannot or should not be 
granted by him, or the applicant declines to grant the reciprocal 
benefit requested by the United States or if a bona fide emergency 
exists, permission to construct or use a road across lands owned by the 
United States may be conditioned for any applicant upon reasonable 
charges and all other terms and conditions required by the Chief to 
protect the interests of the United States. Permits for such road 
construction or use will be non-exclusive and will be conditioned upon 
compliance with their terms and conditions and with the rules and 
regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and 
those applicable to such roads.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Replacement of prior grants. (1) Upon application to the Chief, 
an easement under the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1233, 16 U.S.C. 
525), shall be replaced by an easement under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Upon application to the Chief, an easement shall be granted 
under paragraph (d) of this section as a replacement for any 
stipulations for ingress and egress issued under the Act of June 4, 1897 
or permit or other document evidencing the applicant's right to use a 
road: Provided, The applicant has met the requirements for obtaining 
such easement as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Easements for roads crossing lands or easements administered by 
the Forest Service. (1) Applications for permanent or temporary 
easements for specified periods or otherwise to be granted under the Act 
of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1039, 16 U.S.C. 533), over lands or 
easements administered by the Forest Service, or over roads thereon will 
be approved by the Chief for those applicants who have conveyed or 
provided appropriate easements over roads, assignable easements and 
lands owned or controlled by them to the United States of America and 
its assigns and who have already constructed, or will, as scheduled by 
agreement, construct their proportionate share of the road or road 
system of which the segments described in the application are parts. The 
Chief, after approval of the application and the grant of the easement, 
will cause the same to be entered in the records of the Forest Service, 
and delivered to the applicant.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Chief may 
grant to

[[Page 29]]

the applicant a permanent or temporary easement for specified periods or 
otherwise upon such exchange of easements or share-cost arrangement or 
other reasonable consideration as he may deem appropriate.
    (3) The Chief may grant to a State or local subdivision thereof; 
easements for roads over lands or easements administered by the Forest 
Service and over roads thereon, when the roads thereon or roads to be 
constructed thereon will serve said lands and are, or will become a part 
of the road system maintained by such State or local subdivision for 
general public use: Provided, That easements shall not be granted under 
authority of this act (78 Stat. 1089), 16 U.S.C. 533 which may be 
granted under the Highway Act (72 Stat. 916, 23 U.S.C. 317), as amended. 
The easements shall contain such provisions, terms, and conditions as 
the Chief may determine are necessary to retain and protect the 
interests needed by the United States.
    (4) All instruments affecting permanent interests in land executed 
pursuant to this paragraph (d) of this section shall be recorded in each 
county where the lands are located. Copies of all instruments affecting 
interests in lands reserved from public domain shall be furnished by the 
Chief to the Secretary of the Interior.
    (5) The Chief may terminate any easement granted under the 
provisions of the Act of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1089, 16 U.S.C. 
534),
    (i) By consent of the owner of the easement,
    (ii) By condemnation, or
    (iii) Upon abandonment after nonuse by the owner of the easement for 
a period of 5 years. Before any easement is terminated for nonuse or 
abandonment, the owner of the easement must be given notice and, upon 
his request made within 60 days after receipt of the notice, a hearing 
in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR part 211, subpart B.

Sec. 212.9  Principles for sharing use of roads.

    The use of roads under arrangements for sharing costs or performance 
shall be in accordance with the following:
    (a) Road improvement. Use of a road for commercial hauling, except 
occasional or minor amounts, will be conditioned upon improvement or 
supplemental construction of the road to safety and economically serve 
the contemplated use, unless the Chief determines that the safety and 
economy of the established and foreseeable use by the United States, its 
users and cooperators will not be impaired by the use for which 
application is being made. With the consent of the Chief the applicant 
may deposit funds in the estimated amount required for the improvements 
or supplemental construction in lieu of performance. Such funds will be 
used by the Forest Service to do the planned work. The cost of the 
improvements or supplemental construction will be taken into account in 
determining any otherwise required contribution to cover the 
proportionate share of the cost of road acquisition, construction, 
reconstruction or improvement attributable to the use.
    (b) Corresponding benefits. Corresponding benefits which may be 
accepted by the Chief for sharing road use will be those which bear a 
reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the 
Forest Service. They may be in the form of:

[[Page 30]]

    (1) Deposit of funds with the Forest Service for use in paying the 
cost of road construction, reconstruction, or improvement to be borne by 
the user;
    (2) The grant of a reciprocal right of substantially similar value 
to the road use sought;
    (3) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement by applicant of a 
road needed for access to and use of lands administered by the Forest 
Service; or (4) any combination of these.
    (c) Cost determinations for roads cooperatively constructed under 
agreements. When roads are constructed under cooperative agreements to 
meet mutual needs of the United States and others for access, 
determinations of the shares of costs to be borne by the United States 
and the cooperating parties will include consideration of:
    (1) The standard of road required for the planned hauling;
    (2) The share of planned use;
    (3) The location and volume of tributary timber owned by each party 
and expected to be hauled over the road or roads;
    (4) The tributary areas owned or controlled by each party;
    (5) Expected use by the public; and
    (6) Other appropriate considerations.
    (d) Cost recovery by the United States from others. When roads are 
used under permit for commercial hauling instead of under cooperative 
agreement, any cost to be recovered by the United States will be 
calculated in proportion to the planned use of the road. The road cost 
used in such calculation will be the amount or estimated amount expended 
in the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of 
that capacity of the road required to serve the use needs of all parties 
that are or reasonably can be expected to use the road. The road costs 
shall not exceed the replacement value of the road. Such road share-cost 
payments will be through deposits in advance of use unless the user 
provides a payment bond satisfactory to the Chief guaranteeing that 
payments will be made promptly upon billing by the Forest Service.
    (e) Cost sharing with a cooperator. The costs to achieve the agreed 
upon road or road system may be met by:
    (1) Use of appropriated funds;
    (2) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement of roads or 
segments of roads by purchasers of products from lands administered by 
the Forest Service or other users;
    (3) Use of deposits made by cooperator with the Forest Service to 
cover cooperator's agreed share;
    (4) Agreement with cooperator pursuant to which cooperator does more 
than his agreed share of constructing, reconstructing, or improving a 
road and recovers costs incurred in excess of his agreed share by 
charging purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest 
Service an equitable amount within the limits and to the total amount 
specified in the agreement; or
    (5) A combination of the aforementioned methods.
    (f) Road maintenance and resurfacing. Cooperators will share the 
road maintenance and resurfacing costs under suitable agreements to 
perform, arrange for performance by others, or by making deposits with 
the Forest Service which will be used to pay the cost of work necessary 
to keep such roads in satisfactory condition commensurate with use 
requirements of each cooperator. No cooperator shall be required to 
perform or bear such costs other than those occasioned by its individual 
use. Other users will bear costs in accordance with Sec. 212.5(d).
    (g) Interests to be acquired by the United States in roads or 
easements therefor. Where the United States is to bear or share the cost 
of constructing or improving, or acquiring a road system, a road, or a 
segment thereof, or acquires an easement therefor, the interest acquired 
will:
    (1) Be for perpetual use unless the road use falls within the 
limited classes where temporary roads or roads for limited periods are 
acceptable;
    (2) Provide adequately for foreseeable management, protection, and 
utilization needs of lands administered by the Forest Service and 
intermingled and adjacent private and public lands and for the use and 
development of the resources upon which communities within or adjacent 
to the National Forest are dependent; and
    (3) not be subject to conditions, reservations, or convenants 
unrelated to

[[Page 31]]

the road use, or which seek or might tend to direct or limit policies 
and procedures for management of lands administered by the Forest 
Service.

Sec. 212.10  Maximum economy forest development roads.

    The Chief may acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, and maintain 
forest development roads within and near the National Forests and other 
lands administered by the Forest Service in locations and according to 
specifications which will permit maximum economy in harvesting timber 
from such lands tributary to such roads and at the same time meet the 
requirements for protection, development, and management thereof and for 
utilization of the other resources thereof. Financing of such roads may 
be accomplished--
    (a) By the Chief utilizing appropriated funds,
    (b) By requirements on purchasers of National Forest timber and 
other products, including provisions for amortization of road costs in 
contracts,
    (c) By cooperative financing with other public agencies and with 
private agencies or persons, or
    (d) By a combination of these methods: Provided, That where roads of 
a higher standard than that needed in the harvesting and removal of the 
timber and other products covered by the particular sale are to be 
constructed, the purchaser of the National Forest timber and other 
products shall not be required to bear that part of the costs necessary 
to meet such higher standard, and the Chief may make such arrangements 
to this end as may be appropriate, including arrangements for 
performance of purchaser's road development work under the Act of March 
3, 1925, as amended by section 5 of the Act of April 24, 1950 (16 U.S.C.

not subject to the suspension established by paragraph (b) of this 
section if they fall within one of the following unroaded areas:
    (1) Unroaded areas within national forests that have a signed Record 
of Decision revising their land and resource management plans prepared 
pursuant to the National Forest Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1604) after 
January 1, 1996, and on which the administrative appeals process under 
36 CFR part 217 has been completed as of March 1, 1999;
    (2) Unroaded areas within a National Forest that have a signed 
Record of Decision revising the land and resource management plan 
prepared pursuant to the National Forest Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1604) 
on which the administrative appeals process under 36 CFR part 217 has 
begun before or after March 1, 1999. (For these forests, any issues 
related to the construction of roads in unroaded areas will be addressed 
in the appeal decision, when appropriate.);
    (3) Unroaded areas within the National Forest System encompassed by 
a land and resource management plan amendment or revision adopted before 
or during the period in which this section is effective, where such 
amendment or revision has been developed through multi-federal agency 
coordination using a science based eco-regional assessment;
    (4) Road construction or reconstruction in unroaded areas where 
roads are needed for public safety, needed to ensure access provided by

catastrophic event that, without intervention, would cause the loss of 
life or property.
    (d) Scope and applicability. (1) This rule does not suspend or 
modify any existing permit, contract, or other instrument authorizing 
the occupancy and use of National Forest System land. Additionally, this 
rule does not suspend or modify any existing National Forest System land 
allocation decision, nor is this rule intended to suspend or otherwise 
affect other management activities or uses within

<R05>
Sec. 215.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The rules of this part have two purposes. First, this 
part establishes a process by which persons or organizations may receive 
notice and be provided opportunity to comment on proposed actions 
implementing national forest land and resource management plans prior to 
a final decision by the responsible official. This includes notice of 
and opportunity to comment on nonsignificant amendments of land and 
resource management plans that are made in conjunction with those 
proposed actions. Second, this part provides for prompt administrative 
review of project and activities implementing forest plans and 
establishes who may appeal decisions on planned actions, the kind of 
decisions that may be appealed, the responsibilities of the participants 
in an appeal, and the procedures that apply.
    (b) Scope. The process established in this part constitutes the 
final administrative opportunity for the public to influence National 
Forest System project decisionmaking prior to implementation. The rules 
of this part complement, but do not replace, numerous other 
opportunities to participate in and influence agency decisionmaking 
provided pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the 
National Forest Management Act, and the implementing regulations and 
procedures in 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 and 36 CFR parts 216 and 219, 
Forest Service Manual Chapters 1920 and 1950, and Forest Service 
Handbooks 1909.12 and 1909.15.


<R05>
Sec. 215.2  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part--
    Appeal is the written document filed with an Appeal Deciding Officer 
by one who objects to a decision covered by this part.
    Appeal Deciding Officer is the Forest Service line officer having 
the delegated authority and responsibile to render a decision on an 
appeal filed under this part.
    Appeal Period is the 45 calendar-day period during which an appeal 
may be filed with the Appeal Deciding Officer.
    Appeal Record is the information assembled and/or created during the 
course of an appeal and upon which review of an appeal is conducted. It 
consists of the decision documentation, the appeal, the Responsible 
Official's documentation of the informal disposition meeting, the public 
notice of decision document, and written comments submitted by 
interested parties.
    Appeal Reviewing Officer is an agency official who reviews an appeal 
and makes a written recommendation to the Appeal Deciding Officer on the 
disposition of the appeal.
    Appellant is a person or organization filing an appeal under this 
part.
    Categorical Exclusion refers to a category of actions which do not 
individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human 
environment and for which neither an environmental impact statement 
(EIS) nor an environmental assessment (EA) is required (40 CFR 1508.4; 
Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, Chapter 30).
    Comment Period is the 30 calendar day period, following publication 
of the notice for public comment, available to interested persons to 
provide comments to a Responsible Official on a proposed action subject 
to this part.
    Decision Document is the document that records the decisions for 
actions implementing land and resource management plans. (See also, 
Record of Decision, Decision Notice, and Decision Memo.)
    Decision documentation refers to the decision document and all 
relevant environmental and other analysis documentation and records on 
which the Responsible Official based a decision that is at issue under 
an appeal filed pursuant to this part. Decision documentation may 
include, but is not limited to, a project or case file, Record of

[[Page 36]]

Decision, Decision Notice, Decision Memo, environmental assessment, 
finding of no significant impact, draft and final environmental impact 
statement, land and resource management plan, regional guide, and 
documents incorporated by reference in any of the preceding documents.
    Decision Memo is a concise written record of a Responsible 
Official's decision to implement actions that have been categorically 
excluded from documentation in an environmental impact statement or 
environmental assessment (40 CFR 1508.4, Forest Service Handbook 
1909.15, Chapter 30).
    Decision Notice is a concise written record of a Responsible 
Official's decision based on an environmental assessment and a finding 
of no significant impact. (40 CFR 1508.9, Forest Service Handbook 
1909.15, Chapter 40).
    Environmental Assessment is a concise public document that provides 
sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an 
environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact (40 
CFR 1508.9; Forest Service Handbook (FSH), 1909.15, Chapter 40).
    Environmental Impact Statement is a detailed written statement as 
required by section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act 
of 1969 (40 CFR 1508.11; FSH 1909.15, Chapter 20).
    Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is a document prepared by a 
federal agency presenting the reasons why an action, not otherwise 
excluded, will not have a significant effect on the human environment 
and for which an environmental impact statement, therefore, will not be 
prepared. It includes the environmental assessment or a summary of it 
and shall note any other environmental documents related to it (40 CFR 
1508.13; Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, Chapter 40).
    Forest Service line officer is a Forest Service official who serves 
in a direct line of command from the Chief and who has the delegated 
authority to make and execute decisions subject to this part. 
Specifically, for the purposes of this part, a Forest Service employee 
who holds one of the following offices and titles: District Ranger, 
Deputy Forest Supervisor, Forest Supervisor, Deputy Regional Forester, 
Regional Forester, Associate Deputy Chief, Deputy Chief, Associate Chief 
of the Forest Service, or an employee delegated the authority to act in 
one of these capacities.
    Interested Party is a person or organization other than the 
appellant that provides written information to the Appeal Reviewing 
Officer regarding an appeal.
    Proposed action is a proposal made by the Forest Service to 
authorize, recommend, or implement an action on National Forest System 
lands to meet a specific purpose and need which is subject to the notice 
and comment provisions of this part.
    Proposed Timber Harvest Categorically Excluded from Documentation 
under Forest Service Handbook 1909.12, section 31.2, paragraph 4 is 
timber harvest which removes 250,000 board feet or less of merchantable 
wood products, or salvage which removes 1,000,000 board feet or less of 
merchantable wood products; which requires one mile or less of low 
standard road construction (Service level D. FSH 7709.56); and assures 
regeneration of harvested or salvaged areas, where required; which 
normally are categorically excluded from documentation in an 
environmental assessment or environmental impact statement; and for 
which a project or case file and decision memo are required (Forest 
Service Handbook 1909.12, sec. 31.2, para. 4).
    Record of Decision is a document signed by a Responsible Official 
recording a decision that was preceded by preparation of an 
environmental impact statement (40 CFR 1505.2; Forest Service Handbook 
1909.15, Chapter 20).
    Responsibile Official is the Forest Service line officer who has the 
authority and responsibility to make decisions on proposed actions 
subject to notice, comment and appeal under this part.

days from the close of the appeal filing period.
    (b) If an appeal is filed, implementation may not occur for 15 days 
following the date of appeal disposition. In the event of multiple

    (a) Identification of Appeal Reviewing Officer. An agency official 
at the Regional Office level designated by the Chief is the Appeal 
Reviewing Officer for appeals of District Ranger and Forest Supervisor 
decisions. An agency official at the Washington Office level designated 
by the Chief is the Appeal Reviewing Officer for appeals of Regional 
Forester Decisions. The Appeal Reviewing Officer shall be an officer at 
least at the level of the agency official who made the initial decision 
on the project or activity that is under appeal and has not participated 
in the initial decision and will not be responsible for implementing the 
initial decision after the appeal is decided.

Sec. 215.20  Policy in event of judicial proceedings.

    Unless waived in a specific case, it is the position of the

a decision subject to review under this part is premature and 
inappropriate unless the plaintiff has first sought to invoke and 
exhaust the procedures available under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes procedures to ensure that Federal, State, and 
local governments and the public have adequate notice and opportunity to 
comment upon the formulation of standards, criteria, and guidelines 
applicable to Forest Service programs.


<R05>
Sec. 216.2  Definitions.

    (a) The Forest Service Manual consists of numerous volumes organized 
by numerically coded subject matter. The volumes contain legal 
authorities, responsibilities, delegations, and general instruction and 
direction needed on a continuous basis by Forest Service officers at 
more than one unit to plan and execute programs. The parent text is 
issued by the national headquarters and sets forth the policies, and 
other guidance applicable Service-wide. National directives are 
supplemented, as necesary, by Forest Service field offices. Supplements 
to the Forest Service Manual are applicable only within the Forest 
Service organizational jurisdiction for which they are issued. The 
Forest Service Manual is revised to conform to changing law, orders, 
regulations, or management needs.
    (b) Public participation activities are actions initiated by the 
Forest Service to facilitate an exchange of information with the public. 
These actions include, but are not limited to, oral and written measures 
such as public notices, letters, discussion papers, and gatherings such 
as meetings, workshops, and hearings.
    (c) Standards, criteria, and guidelines means those written 
policies, instructions, and orders, originated by the Forest Service and 
issued in the Forest Service Manual which establish the general 
framework for the management and conduct of Forest Service programs.


<R05>
Sec. 216.3  Applicability; relationship to other public participation opportunities.

    (a) The requirements described in this part do not apply to--
    (1) Rules or regulations promulgated according to the requirements 
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553;
    (2) Instructions, procedures, and other material issued in Forest 
Service Handbooks; and
    (3) Proposed Manual directives which provide guidance and procedures 
on administrative support activities such as personnel matters, 
procurement, service contracting, and other routine business operations 
of the agency.
    (b) This part does not supersede or replace the requirements of the 
National Environmental Policy Act as set forth in 40 CFR part 1500 and 
chapter 1950 of the Forest Service Manual. The requirements described in 
this part do not apply where equivalent public notice and opportunity 
for comment on the contents of a proposed Manual directive are provided 
during compliance with NEPA procedures.

[[Page 44]]

    (c) The direction for management of many Forest Service programs is 
developed with public participation during land and resource management 
planning part 219, and other activities. The relevant results of such 
public participation shall be used in formulation of Forest Service 
Manual directives to avoid duplicating public participation efforts.
    (d) In addition to the opportunity for formal public review and 
comment offered in this part, the public may informally review and 
comment on Manual material at other times.
    (e) These regulations do not prevent informal consultation with 
selected Federal, State, and local governments and the public when such 
consultation is deemed appropriate in formulating Manual material.


<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Determining the need for formal public review of proposed Manual directives.

    (a) Agency officials responsible for formulating Manual directives 
containing applicable standards, criteria, and guidelines shall 
determine whether substantial public interest or controversy concerning 
a proposed Manual directive can be expected.
    (b) The following shall be considered in making this determination:
    (1) Direct written or oral communication with those known to be 
interested in the proposal;
    (2) The degree to which the proposal is likely to adversely or 
beneficially affect the general public as well as those known to be 
interested in the proposal;
    (3) The amount of change the proposal represents from current 
direction;
    (4) The extent of recent news media coverage on subjects related to 
the proposal; and
    (5) The amount of interest or controversy expressed on previous 
proposals on the same or similar subjects.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Documentation.

    The responsible Forest Service official shall document the results 
of the determination made pursuant to Sec. 216.4(b), and the reasons 
therefor, in a concise written summary. The summary may be combined with 
documentation required by NEPA procedures or other applicable law or 
policy. The summary shall be prepared and filed at the same location as 
the Forest Service official responsible for developing the Manual 
directive.


<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Notice and comment procedures for proposed Manual directives identified for formal public review.

    (a) Where it is determined that substantial public interest or 
controversy concerning a proposed Manual directive can be expected, the 
following minimum requirements for notifying the public and giving 
opportunity to comment on the proposal apply:
    (1) National Forest and Ranger District Proposals. The responsible 
official shall determine appropriate means of notifying the public. This 
may include, but is not limited to, legal notice in a newspaper of 
general circulation or press release. The public shall have a minimum of 
30 calendar days to review and comment on the proposal.
    (2) Regional, Station, and Area Proposals. The responsible official 
shall determine appropriate means of notifying the public. This may 
include, but is not limited to, notice and summary of the proposal in 
the Federal Register, legal notice in one or more newspapers of general 
circulation, or press release. The public shall have a minimum of 30 
calendar days to review and comment on the proposal.
    (3) National Proposals. The responsible official shall publish a 
notice and summary of the proposal in the Federal Register, followed by 
a minimum of 60 calendar days for public review and comment.
    (b) Agency officials will give direct notice to Federal, State, and 
local governments and to the public known to be interested in the 
proposal. Along with the notice, the responsible official shall also 
provide either a complete proposal or a summary of the proposal for 
review.
    (c) The responsible Forest Service official may conduct additional 
public participation activities related to the proposed Manual directive 
as are deemed appropriate and necessary.
    (d) Comments received from the public shall be analyzed and 
considered in

[[Page 45]]

the formulation and preparation of the final Manual directive.
    (e) The final Manual directive or a summary shall be sent to those 
who offered comments on the proposed directive and further publicized as 
deemed appropriate by the responsible official.


<R05>
Sec. 216.7  Exemption of proposed Manual directives from normal procedures.

    When it is found for good cause that an exigency exists, an interim 
Manual directive that is determined to be of substantial public interest 
or expected controversy may be issued in advance of providing 
opportunity for public comment. However, as soon as practicable after 
issuance, the interim Manual directive will be made available for public 
review and comment as described in Sec. 216.6. In making the Manual 
directive available, the responsible official shall state why the 
interim directive was issued prior to obtaining public comments.


<R05>
Sec. 216.8  Availability of proposed Manual directives identified for formal public review.

    As a minimum, review copies of proposed Manual directives determined 
to be of substantial public interest or expected controversy shall be 
available in the Forest Supervisor's Office and District Rangers' 
Offices when National Forest proposals are involved; in the Regional 
Office and Forest Supervisors' Offices when regional proposals are 
involved; and in Regional Offices and National Headquarters when 
national proposals are involved. When Manual directives involve Forest 
Service Research or State and Private Forestry programs, review copies 
shall be available at comparable administrative offices.

Sec. 217.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part provides a process by which a person or organization 
interested in the management of the National Forest System may 
administratively appeal decisions to approve, amend, or revise a 
National Forest land and resource management plan or approve or amend a

    (2) All time periods in this rule are to be computed using calendar 
days. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are included in computing 
the time period for filing a notice of appeal; however, when the filing 
period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the 
filing time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day.
    (c) Evidence of timely filing. It is the responsibility of the 
appellant to file the notice on or before the last day of the filing 
period. In the event of question, a legible postmark will be considered 
evidence of timely filing. Where postmarks are illegible, the Reviewing 
Officer shall rule on the timely filing of the appeal. Notices of appeal 
that are filed before the filing period specified in the published legal 
notice shall be accepted, but premature filing does not affect 
timeframes specified in this rule.

significant amendment, or revision, or on a programmatic decision 
documented in a Record of Decision, not more than 160 days from the date 
the notice of appeal was filed.
    (2) In the event of multiple appeals of the same decision, the 
appeal decision

date shall be calculated from the filing date of the last notice of 
appeal.

decision on the appeal. Reviewing Officers may, on their own initiative, 
request the Deciding Officer to meet with participants to discuss the 
appeal and explore opportunities to resolve the issues. However, 
Reviewing Officers may not participate in such discussions. At the 
request of the Deciding Officer, or on their own initiative, Reviewing

decision, the potential for litigation, whether the decision is 
precedential in nature, or whether the decision modifies existing or 
establishes new policy.
    (b) As provided for a Secs. 217.7 (c) and (d), 217.10(h), and 
217.11, certain dismissal decisions rendered by Forest Service line 
officers, and appeal decisions rendered by Regional Foresters and the 
Chief (Sec. 217.16) are subject to discretionary review at the next 
highest administrative level. Within one day following the date of any 
decision subject to such discretionary review, the Reviewing Officer 
shall forward a copy of the decision and the decision documents 
(Sec. 217.2) upon which the appeal was predicated to the next higher 
officer.
    (c) When a stay of implementation is in effect, it shall remain in 
effect until the end of the 15-day period in which a higher level 
officer must decide whether or not to review a Reviewing Officer's 
decision (Sec. 217.17(d)). If the higher level officer decides to review 
the Reviewing Officer's decision, the stay will remain in effect until a 
decision is issued (Sec. 217.17(f)), or until the end of the 30-day 
review period provided in Sec. 217.17(g) whichever is less.
    (d) The higher level officer shall have 15 days from date of receipt 
to decide whether or not to review a lower level appeal decision, and 
may request and use the appeal record in deciding whether or not to 
review the decision, including decisions to dismiss. If the record is 
requested, the 15-day period is suspended at that point. The lower level 
Reviewing Officer shall forward it within 5 days of the request. Upon 
receipt, the higher level officer shall have 15 days to decide whether 
or not to review the lower level decision. If that officer takes no 
action by the expiration of the 15-day period or the additional 15-day 
period following receipt of the record, the decision of the Reviewing 
Officer stands as the final administrative decision of the Department of 
Agriculture. All participants shall be notified by the discretionary 
level whether or not the decision will be reviewed.

[[Page 53]]

    (e) Where an official exercises the discretion in Sec. 217.7 (d) or 
(e) of this subpart to review a dismissal or appeal decision, the 
discretionary review shall be made on the existing appeal record and the 
lower level Reviewing Officer's appeal decision. The record shall not be 
reopened to accept additional submissions from any source including the 
Reviewing Officer whose appeal decision is being reviewed.
    (f) The discretionary level Reviewing Officer shall conclude the 
review within 30 days of the date of the notice issued to participants 
that the lower decision will be reviewed, and shall send a copy of the 
review decision to all participants.
    (g) If a discretionary review decision is not issued by the end of 
the 30-day review period, appellants and intervenors shall be deemed to 
have exhausted their administrative remedies for purposes of judicial 
review. In such case, the participants shall be notified by the 
discretionary level.

<R04>
 Subpart A--National Forest System Land and Resource Management Planning

    Authority:  Secs. 6 and 15, 90 Stat. 2949, 2952, 2958 (16 U.S.C. 
1604, 1613); and 5 U.S.C. 301.

    Source: 47 FR 43037, Sept. 30, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 219.1  Purpose and principles.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart set forth a process for 
developing, adopting, and revising land and resource management plans 
for the National Forest System as required by the Forest and Rangeland 
Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended (hereafter, RPA). 
These regulations prescribe how land and resource management planning is 
to be conducted on National Forest System lands. The resulting plans 
shall provide

[[Page 54]]

for multiple use and sustained yield of goods and services from the 
National Forest System in a way that maximizes long term net public 
benefits in an environmentally sound manner.
    (b) Plans guide all natural resource management activities and 
establish management standards and guidelines for the National Forest 
System. They determine resource management practices, levels of resource 
production and management, and the availability and suitability of lands 
for resource management. Regional and forest planning will be based on 
the following principles:
    (1) Establishment of goals and objectives for multiple-use and 
sustained-yield management of renewable resources without impairment of 
the productivity of the land;
    (2) Consideration of the relative values of all renewable resources, 
including the relationship of nonrenewable resources, such as minerals, 
to renewable resources;
    (3) Recognition that the National Forests are ecosystems and their 
management for goods and services requires an awareness and 
consideration of the interrelationships among plants, animals, soil, 
water, air, and other environmental factors within such ecosystems;
    (4) Protection and, where appropriate, improvement of the quality of 
renewable resources;
    (5) Preservation of important historic, cultural, and natural 
aspects of our national heritage;
    (6) Protection and preservation of the inherent right of freedom of 
American Indians to believe, express, and exercise their traditional 
religions;
    (7) Provision for the safe use and enjoyment of the forest resources 
by the public;
    (8) Protection, through ecologically compatible means, of all forest 
and rangeland resources from depredations by forest and rangeland pests;
    (9) Coordination with the land and resource planning efforts of 
other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes;
    (10) Use of a systematic, interdisciplinary approach to ensure 
coordination and integration of planning activities for multiple-use 
management;
    (11) Early and frequent public participation;
    (12) Establishment of quantitative and qualitative standards and 
guidelines for land and resource planning and management;
    (13) Management of National Forest System lands in a manner that is 
sensitive to economic efficiency; and
    (14) Responsiveness to changing conditions of land and other 
resources and to changing social and economic demands of the American 
people.


<R05>
Sec. 219.2  Scope and applicability.

    The regulations in this subpart apply to the National Forest System, 
which includes special areas, such as wilderness, wild and scenic 
rivers, national recreation areas, and national trails. Whenever the 
special area authorities require additional planning, the planning 
process under this subpart shall be subject to those authorities.
    (a) Unless inconsistent with special area authorities, requirements 
for additional planning for special areas shall be met through plans 
required under this subpart.
    (b) If, in a particular case, special area authorities require the 
preparation of a separate special area plan, the direction in any such 
plan may be incorporated without modification in plans prepared under 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 219.3  Definitions and terminology.

    For purposes of this subpart the following terms, respectively, 
shall mean:
    Allowable sale quantity: The quantity of timber that may be sold 
from the area of suitable land covered by the forest plan for a time 
period specified by the plan. This quantity is usually expressed on an 
annual basis as the ``average annual allowable sale quantity.''
    Base sale schedule: A timber sale schedule formulated on the basis 
that the quantity of timber planned for sale and harvest for any future 
decade is equal to or greater than the planned sale and harvest for the 
preceding decade, and this planned sale and harvest for any decade is 
not greater than the long-term sustained yield capacity.
    Biological growth potential: The average net growth attainable in a 
fully stocked natural forest stand.

[[Page 55]]

    Capability: The potential of an area of land to produce resources, 
supply goods and services, and allow resource uses under an assumed set 
of management practices and at a given level of management intensity. 
Capability depends upon current conditions and site conditions such as 
climate, slope, landform, soils, and geology, as well as the application 
of management practices, such as silviculture or protection from fire, 
insects, and disease.
    Corridor: A linear strip of land identified for the present or 
future location of transportation or utility rights-of-way within its 
boundaries.
    Cost efficiency: The usefulness of specified inputs (costs) to 
produce specified outputs (benefits). In measuring cost efficiency, some 
outputs, including environmental, economic, or social impacts, are not 
assigned monetary values but are achieved at specified levels in the 
least cost manner. Cost efficiency is usually measured using present net 
value, although use of benefit-cost ratios and rates-of-return may be 
appropriate.
    Diversity: The distribution and abundance of different plant and 
animal communities and species within the area covered by a land and 
resource management plan.
    Even-aged management: The application of a combination of actions 
that results in the creation of stands in which trees of essentially the 
same age grow together. Managed even-aged forests are characterized by a 
distribution of stands of varying ages (and, therefore, tree sizes) 
throughout the forest area. The difference in age between trees forming 
the main canopy level of a stand usually does not exceed 20 percent of 
the age of the stand at harvest rotation age. Regeneration in a 
particular stand is obtained during a short period at or near the time 
that a stand has reached the desired age or size for regeneration and is 
harvested. Clearcut, shelterwood, or seed tree cutting methods produce 
even-aged stands.
    Forest land: Land at least 10 percent occupied by forest trees of 
any size or formerly having had such tree cover and not currently 
developed for non-forest use. Lands developed for non-forest use include 
areas for crops, improved pasture, residential, or administrative areas, 
improved roads of any width, and adjoining road clearing and powerline 
clearing of any width.
    Goal: A concise statement that describes a desired condition to be 
achieved sometime in the future. It is normally expressed in broad, 
general terms and is timeless in that it has no specific date by which 
it is to be completed. Goal statements form the principal basis from 
which objectives are developed.
    Goods and services: The various outputs, including on-site uses, 
produced from forest and rangeland resources.
    Integrated pest management: A process for selecting strategies to 
regulate forest pests in which all aspects of a pest-host system are 
studied and weighed. The information considered in selecting appropriate 
strategies includes the impact of the unregulated pest population on 
various resources values, alternative regulatory tactics and strategies, 
and benefit/cost estimates for these alternative strategies. Regulatory 
strategies are based on sound silvicultural practices and ecology of the 
pest-host system and consist of a combination of tactics such as timber 
stand improvement plus selective use of pesticides. A basic principle in 
the choice of strategy is that it be ecologically compatible or 
acceptable.
    Long-term sustained-yield timber capacity: The highest uniform wood 
yield from lands being managed for timber production that may be 
sustained under a specified management intensity consistent with 
multiple-use objectives.
    Management concern: An issue, problem, or a condition which 
constrains the range of management practices identified by the Forest 
Service in the planning process.
    Management direction: A statement of multiple-use and other goals 
and objectives, the associated management prescriptions, and standards 
and guidelines for attaining them.
    Management intensity: A management practice or combination of 
management practices and associated costs designed to obtain different 
levels of goods and services.

[[Page 56]]

    Management practice: A specific activity, measure, course of action, 
or treatment.
    Management prescription: Management practices and intensity selected 
and scheduled for application on a specific area to attain multiple-use 
and other goals and objectives.
    Multiple use: The management of all the various renewable surface 
resources of the National Forest System so that they are utilized in the 
combination that will best meet the needs of the American people; making 
the most judicious use of the land for some or all of these resources or 
related services over areas large enough to provide sufficient latitude 
for periodic adjustments in use to conform to changing needs and 
conditions; that some lands will be used for less than all of the 
resources; and harmonious and coordinated management of the various 
resources, each with the other, without impairment of the productivity 
of the land, with consideration being given to the relative values of 
the various resources, and not necessarily the combination of uses that 
will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output.
    Net public benefits: An expression used to signify the overall long-
term value to the nation of all outputs and positive effects (benefits) 
less all associated inputs and negative effects (costs) whether they can 
be quantitatively valued or not. Net public benefits are measured by 
both quantitative and qualitative criteria rather than a single measure 
or index. The maximization of net public benefits to be derived from 
management of units of the National Forest System is consistent with the 
principles of multiple use and sustained yield.
    Objective: A concise, time-specific statement of measurable planned 
results that respond to pre-established goals. An objective forms the 
basis for further planning to define the precise steps to be taken and 
the resources to be used in achieving identified goals.
    Planning area: The area of the National Forest System covered by a 
regional guide or forest plan.
    Planning period: One decade. The time interval within the planning 
horizon that is used to show incremental changes in yields, costs, 
effects, and benefits.
    Planning horizon: The overall time period considered in the planning 
process that spans all activities covered in the analysis or plan and 
all future conditions and effects of proposed actions which would 
influence the planning decisions.
    Present net value: The difference between the discounted value 
(benefits) of all outputs to which monetary values or established market 
prices are assigned and the total discounted costs of managing the 
planning area.
    Public issue: A subject or question of widespread public interest 
relating to management of the National Forest System.
    Real dollar value: A monetary value which compensates for the 
effects of inflation.
    Receipt shares: The portion of receipts derived from Forest Service 
resource management that is distributed to State and county governments, 
such as the Forest Service 25 percent fund payments.
    Responsible line officer: The Forest Service employee who has the 
authority to select and/or carry out a specific planning action.
    Sale schedule: The quantity of timber planned for sale by time 
period from an area of suitable land covered by a forest plan. The first 
period, usually a decade, of the selected sale schedule provides the 
allowable sale quantity. Future periods are shown to establish that 
long-term sustained yield will be achieved and maintained.
    Silvicultural system: A management process whereby forests are 
tended, harvested, and replaced, resulting in a forest of distinctive 
form. Systems are classified according to the method of carrying out the 
fellings that remove the mature crop and provide for regeneration and 
according to the type of forest thereby produced.
    Suitability: The appropriateness of applying certain resource 
management practices to a particular area of land, as determined by an 
analysis of the economic and environmental consequences and the 
alternative uses foregone. A unit of land may be suitable for a variety 
of individual or combined management practices.

[[Page 57]]

    Sustained-yield of products and services: The achievement and 
maintenance in perpetuity of a high-level annual or regular periodic 
output of the various renewable resources of the National Forest System 
without impairment of the productivity of the land.
    Timber production: The purposeful growing, tending, harvesting, and 
regeneration of regulated crops of trees to be cut into logs, bolts, or 
other round sections for industrial or consumer use. For purposes of 
this subpart, the term timber production does not include production of 
fuelwood.
    Uneven-aged management: The application of a combination of actions 
needed to simultaneously maintain continuous high-forest cover, 
recurring regeneration of desirable species, and the orderly growth and 
development of trees through a range of diameter or age classes to 
provide a sustained yield of forest products. Cutting is usually 
regulated by specifying the number or proportion of trees of particular 
sizes to retain within each area, thereby maintaining a planned 
distribution of size classes. Cutting methods that develop and maintain 
uneven-aged stands are single-tree selection and group selection.


<R05>
Sec. 219.4  Planning levels.

    (a) General guideline. Planning requires a continuous flow of 
information and management direction among the three Forest Service 
administrative levels: national, regional, and forest. Management 
direction shall:
    (1) Include requirements for analysis to determine programs that 
maximize net public benefits, consistent with locally derived 
information about production capabilities;
    (2) Reflect production capabilities, conditions and circumstances 
observed at all levels; and
    (3) Become increasingly specific as planning progresses from the 
national to the forest level. In this structure, regional planning is a 
principal process for conveying management direction from the national 
level to the forest level and for conveying information from forest 
level to the national level. The planning process is essentially 
iterative in that the information from the forest level flows up to the 
national level where in turn information in the RPA Program flows back 
to the forest level.
    (b) Planning levels and relationships--(1) National. The Chief of 
the Forest Service shall develop the Renewable Resources Assessment and 
Program (hereafter, ``RPA Assessment and RPA Program'') according to 
sections 3 and 4 of the RPA.
    (i) RPA Assessment. The RPA Assessment shall include analysis of 
present and anticipated uses, demand for, and supply of the renewable 
resources of forest, range, and other associated lands with 
consideration of, and an emphasis on, pertinent supply, demand, and 
price relationship trends; an inventory of present and potential 
renewable resources and an evaluation of opportunities for improving 
their yield of tangible and intangible goods and services, together with 
estimates of investment costs and direct and indirect returns to the 
Federal Government; a description of Forest Service programs and 
responsibilities in research, cooperative programs, and management of 
the National Forest System; and analysis of important policy issues and 
consideration of laws, regulations, and other factors expected to 
influence and affect significantly the use, ownership, and management of 
forest, range, and other associated lands. The RPA Assessment shall be 
based on the future capabilities of forest and rangelands and shall 
include information generated during the regional, forest, and other 
planning processes.
    (ii) RPA Program. The RPA Program shall consider the costs of supply 
and the relative values of both market and nonmarket outputs. The 
alternatives considered shall include national renewable resource goals 
and quantified objectives for resource outputs and other benefits and 
shall be designed to represent a range of expenditure levels sufficient 
to demonstrate full opportunities for management. A portion of each 
national objective developed in the RPA Program shall be distributed to 
each region and be incorporated into each regional guide. Resource 
objectives shall be tentatively selected for each forest planning area. 
In formulating the objectives for each region and forest planning area, 
local supply

[[Page 58]]

capabilities and market conditions will be considered.
    (2) Regional. Each Regional Forester shall develop a regional guide. 
Regional guides shall establish regional standards and guidelines as 
required by Sec. 219.9(a). Consistent with resource capabilities, 
regional guides shall reflect goals and objectives of the RPA Program. 
For planning purposes, the regional guides shall display tentative 
resource objectives for each Forest from the RPA Program. Regional 
guides shall also provide for general coordination of National Forest 
System, State and Private Forestry (S&PF), and Research programs. The 
Chief shall approve the regional guide. The Regional Forester may 
request adjustment of assigned regional objectives. Any adjustment shall 
require the approval of the Chief, Forest Service.
    (3) Forest. Each Forest Supervisor shall develop a forest plan for 
administrative units of the National Forest System. One forest plan may 
be prepared for all lands for which a Forest Supervisor has 
responsibility; or separate forest plans may be prepared for each 
National Forest, or combination of National Forests, within the 
jurisdiction of a single Forest Supervisor. A single forest plan may be 
prepared for the entire Tongass National Forest. These forest plans 
shall constitute the land and resource management plans as required 
under sections 6 and 13 of the RPA. A range of resource objectives shall 
be formulated as alternatives and evaluated, including at least one 
alternative which responds to and incorporates the tentative RPA Program 
resource objectives displayed in the regional guide. Based on this 
evaluation, the Forest Supervisor shall recommend objectives for 
incorporation into the forest plan to the Regional Forester. The 
Regional Forester shall approve the forest plan. This approval may 
incorporate adjustment of the tentative RPA Program resource objectives 
displayed in the regional guide.


<R05>
Sec. 219.5  Interdisciplinary approach.

    (a) A team representing several disciplines shall be used for 
regional and forest planning to insure coordinated planning of the 
various resources. Through interactions among its members, the team 
shall integrate knowledge of the physical, biological, economic and 
social sciences, and the environmental design arts in the planning 
process. The team shall consider problems collectively, rather than 
separating them along disciplinary lines. Team functions include, but 
are not limited to--
    (1) Assessing the problems and resource use and development 
opportunities associated with providing goods and services;
    (2) Obtaining the public's views about possible decisions;
    (3) Implementing the planning coordination activities within the 
Forest Service and with local, State and other Federal agencies;
    (4) Developing a broad range of alternatives which identify the 
benefits and costs of land and resource management according to the 
planning process described in this subpart.
    (5) Developing the land and resource management plan and associated 
environmental impact statement required pursuant to the planning 
process;
    (6) Presenting to the responsible line officer an integrated 
perspective on land and resource management planning; and
    (7) Establishing the standards and requirements by which planning 
and management activities will be monitored and evaluated.
    (b) In appointing team members, the responsible line officer shall 
determine and consider the qualifications of each team member on the 
basis of the complexity of the issues and concerns to be addressed 
through the plan. The team shall collectively represent diverse 
specialized areas of professional and technical knowledge applicable to 
the planning area, and the team members shall have recognized relevant 
expertise and experience in professional, investigative, scientific, or 
other responsible work in specialty areas which they collectively 
represent. The team may consist of whatever combination of Forest 
Service staff and other Federal government personnel is necessary to 
achieve an interdisciplinary approach. The team is encouraged to consult 
other persons when required specialized knowledge does not exist within 
the

[[Page 59]]

team itself. In addition to technical knowledge in one or more resource 
specialties, members should possess other attributes which enhance the 
interdisciplinary process. As a minimum, these attributes should 
include--
    (1) An ability to solve complex problems;
    (2) Skills in communication and group interaction;
    (3) Basic understanding of land and natural resource planning 
concepts, processes, and analysis techniques; and
    (4) The ability to conceptualize planning problems and feasible 
solutions.


<R05>
Sec. 219.6  Public participation.

    (a) Because the land and resource management planning process 
determines how the lands of the National Forest System are to be 
managed, the public is encouraged to participate throughout the planning 
process. The intent of public participation is to--
    (1) Broaden the information base upon which land and resource 
management planning decisions are made;
    (2) Ensure that the Forest Service understands the needs, concerns, 
and values of the public;
    (3) Inform the public of Forest Service land and resource planning 
activities; and
    (4) Provide the public with an understanding of Forest Service 
programs and proposed actions.
    (b) Public participation in the preparation of environmental impact 
statements for planning begins with the publication of a notice of 
intent in the Federal Register. Public involvement in the preparation of 
draft and final environmental impact statements shall conform to the 
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and associated 
implementing regulations and Forest Service Manual and Handbook guidance 
(hereafter, ``NEPA procedures''). Public comments shall be analyzed 
according to NEPA procedures.
    (c) Public participation activities, as deemed appropriate by the 
responsible line officer, shall be used early and often throughout the 
development of plans. Formal public participation activities will begin 
with a notice to the news media and other sources which includes, as 
appropriate, the following information:
    (1) A description of the proposed planning action;
    (2) A description and map of the geographic area affected;
    (3) The issues expected to be discussed;
    (4) The kind, extent, and method(s) of public participation to be 
used;
    (5) The times, dates, and locations scheduled or anticipated, for 
public meetings;
    (6) The name, title, address, and telephone number of the Forest 
Service official who may be contacted for further information; and
    (7) The location and availability of documents relevant to planning 
process.
    (d) Public participation activities should be appropriate to the 
area and people involved. Means of notification should be appropriate to 
the level of planning. Public participation activities may include, but 
are not limited to, requests for written comments, meetings, 
conferences, seminars, workshops, tours, and similar events designed to 
foster public review and comment. The Forest Service shall state the 
objectives of each participation activity to assure that the public 
understands what type of information is needed and how this information 
relates to the planning process.
    (e) Public comments shall be considered individually and by type of 
group and organization to determine common areas of concern and 
geographic distribution. The result of this analysis should be evaluated 
to determine the variety and intensity of viewpoints about ongoing and 
proposed planning and management standards and guidelines.
    (f) All scheduled public participation activities shall be 
documented by a summary of the principal issues discussed, comments 
made, and a register of participants.
    (g) At least 30 days' public notice shall be given for public 
participation activities associated with the development of regional 
guides and forest plans. Any notice requesting written comments on 
regional planning shall allow at least 60 calendar days for response. A 
similar request on forest

[[Page 60]]

planning shall allow at least 30 calendar days for response. Draft 
regional guides and forest plans and environmental impact statements 
shall be available for public comment for a least 3 months. See also 
Secs. 219.8(c) and 219.10(b).
    (h) The responsible line officer shall attend, or provide for 
adequate representation at, public participation activities.
    (i) Copies of approved guides and plans shall be available for 
public review as follows:
    (1) The RPA Assessment and the RPA Program shall be available at 
national headquarters, The Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry 
Office, and all Regional offices, Research Stations, Forest Supervisors' 
offices, and District Rangers' offices;
    (2) The regional guides shall be available at national headquarters, 
the issuing regional office and regional offices of contiguous regions, 
each Forest Supervisor's office of forests within and contiguous to the 
issuing region, and each District Ranger's office in the region;
    (3) The forest plan shall be available at the regional office for 
the forest, the Forest Supervisor's office, Forest Supervisors' offices 
contiguous to the forest, District Rangers' offices within the forest, 
and at least one additional location, to be determined by the Forest 
Supervisor, which shall offer convenient access to the public.

These documents may be made available at other locations convenient to 
the public.
    (j) Documents considered in the development of plans shall be 
available at the office where the plans were developed.
    (k) Forest planning activities should be coordinated to the extent 
practicable with owners of lands that are intermingled with, or 
dependent for access upon, National Forest System lands. The results of 
this coordination shall be included in the environmental impact 
statement for the plan as part of the review required in Sec. 219.7(c). 
The responsible line officer may individually notify these owners of 
forest planning activities where it is determined that notice provided 
for the general public is not likely to reach the affected landowners.
    (l) Fees for reproducing requested documents shall be charged 
according to the Secretary of Agriculture's Fee Schedule (7 CFR part 1, 
subpart A, appendix A).


<R05>
Sec. 219.7  Coordination with other public planning efforts.

    (a) The responsible line officer shall coordinate regional and 
forest planning with the equivalent and related planning efforts of 
other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes.
    (b) The responsible line officer shall give notice of the 
preparation of a land and resource management plan, along with a general 
schedule of anticipated planning actions, to the official or agency so 
designated by the affected State (including the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico). The same notice shall be mailed to all Tribal or Alaska Native 
leaders whose tribal lands or treaty rights are expected to be impacted 
and to the heads of units of government for the counties involved. These 
notices shall be issued simultaneously with the publication of the 
notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement required 
by NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1501.7).
    (c) The responsible line officer shall review the planning and land 
use policies of other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and 
Indian tribes. The results of this review shall be displayed in the 
environmental impact statement for the plan (40 CFR 1502.16(c), 1506.2). 
The review shall include--
    (1) Consideration of the objectives of other Federal, State and 
local governments, and Indians tribes, as expressed in their plans and 
policies;
    (2) An assessment of the interrelated impacts of these plans and 
policies;
    (3) A determination of how each Forest Service plan should deal with 
the impacts identified; and,
    (4) Where conflicts with Forest Service planning are identified, 
consideration of alternatives for their resolution.
    (d) In developing land and resource management plans, the 
responsible line officer shall meet with the designated

[[Page 61]]

State official (or designee) and representatives of other Federal 
agencies, local governments, and Indian tribal governments at the 
beginning of the planning process to develop procedures for 
coordination. As a minimum, such conferences shall also be held after 
public issues and management concerns have been identified and prior to 
recommending the preferred alternative. Such conferences may be held in 
conjunction with other public participation activities, if the 
opportunity for government officials to participate in the planning 
process is not thereby reduced.
    (e) In developing the forest plan, the responsible line officer 
shall seek input from other Federal, State and local governments, and 
universities to help resolve management concerns in the planning process 
and to identify areas where additional research is needed. This input 
should be included in the discussion of the research needs of the 
designated forest planning area.
    (f) A program of monitoring and evaluation shall be conducted that 
includes consideration of the effects of National Forest management on 
land, resources, and communities adjacent to or near the National Forest 
being planned and the effects upon National Forest management of 
activities on nearby lands managed by other Federal or other government 
agencies or under the jurisdiction of local governments.

Sec. 219.8  Regional planning procedure.

    (a) Regional guide. A regional guide shall be developed for each 
administratively designated Forest Service region. Regional guides shall 
reflect general coordination of National Forest System, State and 
Private Forestry, and Research programs. Regional guides shall provide 
standards and guidelines for addressing major issues and management 
concerns which need to be considered at the regional level to facilitate 
forest planning. Public participation and coordination, the current RPA 
Program and Assessment, and the existing forest and resource plans shall 
be used as sources of information in meeting this requirement. Data and 
information requirements established nationally will be followed in 
structuring and maintaining required data.
    (b) Responsibilities--(1) Chief, Forest Service. The Chief shall 
establish agency-wide policy for regional planning and approve all 
regional guides.
    (2) Regional forester. The Regional Forester has overall 
responsibility for preparing and implementing the regional guide and for 
preparing the environmental impact statement for proposed standards and 
guidelines in the regional guide. The Regional Forester appoints and 
supervises the interdisciplinary team.
    (3) Interdisciplinary team. The team, under the direction of the 
Regional Forester, implements the public participation and coordination 
activities required by Sec. 219.6 and Sec. 219.7. The team shall 
continue to function even though membership may change and shall monitor 
and evaluate planning results and recommend amendments. The team shall 
develop a regional guide in compliance with NEPA procedures.
    (c) Public review. A draft and final environmental impact statement 
shall be prepared for the proposed standards and guidelines in the 
regional guide according to NEPA procedures. To the extent feasible, a 
single process shall be used to meet planning and NEPA requirements. The 
draft statement shall identify a preferred alternative. Beginning on the 
date of publication of the notice of availability of the draft 
environmental impact statement in the Federal Register, the statement 
and the proposed guide shall be available for public comment for at 
least 3 months at convenient locations in the vicinity of the lands 
covered by the guide. During this period, and in accordance with the 
provisions in Sec. 219.6, the Regional Forester or his designee shall 
publicize and hold public participation activities as deemed necessary 
for adequate public input.
    (d) Guide approval. The Chief shall review the proposed guide and 
the final environmental impact statement and either approve or 
disapprove the guide.
    (1) Approval. The Chief shall prepare a concise public record of 
decision which documents approval and accompanies the regional guide and 
the final environmental impact statement. The

[[Page 62]]

record or decision shall be prepared according to NEPA procedures (40 
CFR 1505.2). The approved regional guide shall not become effective 
until at least 30 days after publication of the notice of availability 
of the final environmental impact statement in the Federal Register.
    (2) Disapproval. The Chief shall return the regional guide and final 
environmental impact statement to the Regional Forester with a written 
statement of the reasons for disapproval. The Chief may also specify a 
course of action to be undertaken by the Regional Forester in order to 
remedy deficiencies, errors, or omissions in the regional guide or 
environmental impact statement.
    (e) Public appeal of approval decisions. The provisions of 36 CFR 
part 211, subpart B apply to any administrative appeal of the Chief's 
decision to approve a regional guide. Decisions to disapprove a guide 
and other decisions made during the regional planning process prior to 
issuance of a record of decision approving the guide are not subject to 
administrative appeal.
    (f) Amendment. The Regional Forester may amend the regional guide. 
The Regional Forester shall determine whether the proposed amendment 
would result in a significant change in the guide. If the change 
resulting from the proposed amendment is determined to be significant, 
the Regional Forester shall follow the same procedure for amendment as 
that required for development and approval of a regional guide. If the 
change resulting from the amendment is determined not to be significant 
for the purposes of the planning process, the Regional Forester may 
implement the amendment following appropriate public notification and 
satisfactory completion of NEPA procedures.
    (g) Planning records. The Regional Forester shall develop and 
maintain planning records that document decisions and activities that 
result from the process of developing a regional guide and the 
accomplishment of legal and administrative planning requirements. These 
records include at least the draft environmental impact statement, final 
environmental impact statement, regional guide, record of decision, a 
work plan to guide and manage planning, the procedures used in 
completing each action, and the results of these actions.


<R05>
Sec. 219.9  Regional guide content.

    (a) The regional guide shall contain--
    (1) A summary of the analysis of the regional management situation, 
including a brief description of the existing management situation and 
the major issues and management concerns which need to be addressed at 
the regional level to facilitate forest planning;
    (2) A description of management direction including programs, goals, 
and objectives;
    (3) A display of tentative resource objectives for each forest 
planning area from the current RPA Program;

within the region according to geographic areas, forest types, or other 
suitable classifications;
    (ii) Establishing the maximum size, dispersal, and size variation of 
tree openings created by even-aged management, and the state of 
vegetation that will be reached before a cut-over area is no longer 
considered an opening, using factors enumerated in Sec. 219.27(d);
    (iii) Defining the management intensities and utilization standards 
to be used in determining harvest levels for the region;
    (iv) Designating transportation corridors and associated direction 
for forest planning, such as management requirements for corridors, 
transmission lines, pipelines, and water canals. (The designation of 
corridors is not to preclude the granting of separate rights-of-way 
over, upon, under, or through the Federal lands where the authorized 
line officer determines that confinement to a corridor is not 
appropriate.) (43 U.S.C. 1763, 36 CFR 251.56); and

[[Page 63]]

    (v) Identifying in forest plans significant current and potential

<R05>
Sec. 219.10  Forest planning--general procedure.

    (a) Responsibilities--(1) Regional Forester. The Regional Forester 
shall establish regional policy for forest planning and approve all 
forest plans in the region.
    (2) Forest Supervisor. The Forest Supervisor has overall 
responsibility for the preparation and implementation of the forest plan 
and preparation of the environmental impact statement for the forest 
plan. The Forest Supervisor appoints and supervises the 
interdisciplinary team.
    (3) Interdisciplinary team. The team, under the direction of the 
Forest Supervisor, implements the public participation and coordination 
activities required by Sec. 219.6 and Sec. 219.7. The team shall 
continue to function even though membership may change and shall monitor 
and evaluate planning results and recommend revisions and amendments. 
The interdisciplinary team shall develop a forest plan and environmental 
impact statement using the process established in Sec. 219.12 and 
paragraph (b) below.
    (b) Public review of plan and environmental impact statement. A 
draft and final environmental impact statement shall be prepared for the 
proposed plan according to NEPA procedures. The draft environmental 
impact statement shall identify a preferred alternative. To comply with 
16 U.S.C. 1604(d), the draft environmental impact statement and proposed 
plan shall be available for public comment for at least 3 months, at 
convenient locations in the vicinity of the lands covered by the plan, 
beginning on the date of the publication of the notice of availability 
in the Federal Register. During this period, and in accordance with the 
provisions in Sec. 219.6, the Forest Supervisor shall publicize and hold 
public participation activities as deemed necessary to obtain adequate 
public input.
    (c) Plan approval. The Regional Forester shall review the proposed 
plan and the final environmental impact statement and either approve or 
disapprove the plan.
    (1) Approval. The Regional Forester shall prepare a concise public 
record of decision which documents approval and accompanies the plan and 
final environmental impact statement. The record of decision shall be 
prepared according to NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1505.2). The approved plan 
shall not become effective until at least 30 days after publication of 
the notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement 
in the Federal Register, to comply with 16 U.S.C. 1604(d) and 1604(j).
    (2) Disapproval. The Regional Forester shall return the plan and 
final environmental impact statement to the Forest Supervisor with a 
written statement of the reasons for disapproval. The Regional Forester 
may also specify a course of action to be undertaken by the Forest 
Supervisor in order to remedy deficiencies, errors, or omissions in the 
plan or environmental impact statement.
    (d) Public appeal of approval decision. The provisions of 36 CFR 
part 211, subpart B apply to any administrative appeal of the Regional 
Forester's decision to approve a forest plan. Decisions to disapprove a 
plan and other decisions made during the forest planning process prior 
to the issuance of a record of decision approving the plan are not 
subject to administrative appeal.
    (e) Plan implementation. As soon as practicable after approval of 
the plan, the Forest Supervisor shall ensure that, subject to valid 
existing rights, all outstanding and future permits,

[[Page 64]]

contracts, cooperative agreements, and other instruments for occupancy 
and use of affected lands are consistent with the plan. Subsequent 
administrative activities affecting such lands, including budget 
proposals, shall be based on the plan. The Forest Supervisor may change 
proposed implementation schedules to reflect differences between 
proposed annual budgets and appropriated funds. Such scheduled changes 
shall be considered an amendment to the forest plan, but shall not be 
considered a significant amendment, or require the preparation of an 
environmental impact statement, unless the changes significantly alter 
the long-term relationship between levels of multiple-use goods and 
services projected under planned budget proposals as compared to those 
projected under actual appropriations.
    (f) Amendment. The Forest Supervisor may amend the forest plan. 
Based on an analysis of the objectives, guidelines, and other contents 
of the forest plan, the Forest Supervisor shall determine whether a 
proposed amendment would result in a significant change in the plan. If 
the change resulting from the proposed amendment is determined to be 
significant, the Forest Supervisor shall follow the same procedure as 
that required for development and approval of a forest plan. If the 
change resulting from the amendment is determined not to be significant 
for the purposes of the planning process, the Forest Supervisor may 
implement the amendment following appropriate public notification and 
satisfactory completion of NEPA procedures.
    (g) Revision. A forest plan shall ordinarily be revised on a 10-year 
cycle or at least every 15 years. It also may be revised whenever the 
Forest Supervisor determines that conditions or demands in the area 
covered by the plan have changed significantly or when changes in RPA 
policies, goals, or objectives would have a significant effect on forest 
level programs. In the monitoring and evaluation process, the 
interdisciplinary team may recommend a revision of the forest plan at 
any time. Revisions are not effective until considered and approved in 
accordance with the requirements for the development and approval of a 
forest plan. The Forest Supervisor shall review the conditions on the 
land covered by the plan at least every 5 years to determine whether 
conditions or demands of the public have change significantly.
    (h) Planning records. The Forest Supervisor and interdisciplinary 
team shall develop and maintain planning records that document the 
decisions and activities that result from the process of developing a 
forest plan. Records that support analytical conclusions made and 
alternatives considered by the team and approved by the Forest 
Supervisor throughout the planning process shall be maintained. Such 
supporting records provide the basis for the development of the forest 
plan and associated documents required by NEPA procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 219.11  Forest plan content.

    The forest plan shall contain the following:
    (a) A brief summary of the analysis of the management situation, 
including demand and supply conditions for resource commodities and 
services, production potentials, and use and development opportunities;
    (b) Forest multiple-use goals and objectives that include a 
description of the desired future condition of the forest or grassland 
and an identification of the quantities of goods and services that are 
expected to be produced or provided during the RPA planning periods;
    (c) Multiple-use prescriptions and associated standards and 
guidelines for each management area including proposed and probable 
management practices such as the planned timber sale program; and
    (d) Monitoring and evaluation requirements that will provide a basis 
for a periodic determination and evaluation of the effects of management 
practices.


<R05>
Sec. 219.12  Forest planning--process.

    (a) General requirements. The preparation, revision, or significant 
amendment of a forest plan shall comply with the requirements 
established in this section. The planning process includes at least 
those actions set forth in paragraphs (b) through (k) of the section.

[[Page 65]]

Some actions may occur simultaneously, and it may be necessary to repeat 
an action as additional information becomes available. The environmental 
impact statement for each forest plan shall be prepared according to 
NEPA procedures. To the extent feasible, a single process shall be used 
to meet planning and NEPA requirements.
    (b) Identification of purpose and need. The interdisciplinary team 
shall identify and evaluate public issues, management concerns, and 
resource use and development opportunities, including those identified 
throughout the planning process during public participation activities 
and coordination with other Federal agencies, State and local 
governments, and Indian tribes. The Forest Supervisor shall determine 
the major public issues, management concerns, and resource use and 
development opportunities to be addressed in the planning process.
    (c) Planning criteria. Criteria shall be prepared to guide the 
planning process. Criteria apply to collection and use of inventory data 
and information, analysis of the management situation, and the design, 
formulation, and evaluation of alternatives. Criteria designed to 
achieve the objective of maximizing net public benefits shall be 
included. Specific criteria may be derived from--
    (1) Laws, Executive Orders, regulations, and agency policy as set 
forth in the Forest Service Manual;
    (2) Goals and objectives in the RPA Program and regional guides;
    (3) Recommendations and assumptions developed from public issues, 
management concerns, and resource use and development opportunities;
    (4) The plans and programs of other Federal agencies, State and 
local governments, and Indian tribes;
    (5) Ecological, technical, and economic factors; and
    (6) The resource integration and management requirements in 
Secs. 219.13 through 219.27.
    (d) Inventory data and information collection. Each Forest 
Supervisor shall obtain and keep current inventory data appropriate for 
planning and managing the resources under his or her administrative 
jurisdiction. The Supervisor will assure that the interdisciplinary team 
has access to the best available data. This may require that special 
inventories or studies be prepared. The interdisciplinary team shall 
collect, assemble, and use data, maps, graphic material, and explanatory 
aids, of a kind, character, and quality, and to the detail appropriate 
for the management decisions to be made. Data and information needs may 
vary as planning problems develop from identification of public issues, 
management concerns, and resource use and development opportunities. 
Data shall be stored for ready retrieval and comparison and periodically 
shall be evaluated for accuracy and effectiveness. The interdisciplinary 
team will use common data definitions and standards established by the 
Chief of the Forest Service to assure uniformity of information between 
all planning levels. As information is recorded, it shall be applied in 
any subsequent planning process. Information developed according to 
common data definitions and standards shall be used in the preparation 
of the 1990, and subsequent RPA Assessments and RPA Programs.
    (e) Analysis of the management situation. The analysis of the 
management situation is a determination of the ability of the planning 
area covered by the forest plan to supply goods and services in response 
to society's demands. The primary purpose of this analysis is to provide 
a basis for formulating a broad range of reasonable alternatives. The 
analysis may examine the capability of the unit to supply outputs both 
with and without legal and other requirements. As a minimum, the 
analysis of the management situation shall include the following:
    (1) Benchmark analyses to define the range within which alternatives 
can be constructed. Budgets shall not be a constraint. The following 
benchmark analyses shall be consistent with the minimum applicable 
management requirements of Sec. 219.27 and shall define at least--
    (i) The minimum level of management which would be needed to 
maintain and protect the unit as part of the National Forest System 
together with associated costs and benefits;

[[Page 66]]

    (ii) The maximum physical and biological production potentials of 
significant individual goods and services together with associated costs 
and benefits;
    (iii) Monetary benchmarks which estimate the maximum present net 
value of those resources having an established market value or an 
assigned value;
    (A) For forest planning areas with major resource outputs that have 
an established market price, monetary benchmarks shall include an 
estimate of the mix of resource uses, combined with a schedule of 
outputs and costs, which will maximize the present net value of those 
major outputs that have an established market price;
    (B) For all forest planning areas, monetary benchmarks shall include 
an estimate of the mix of resource uses, combined with a schedule of 
outputs and costs, which will maximize the present net value of those 
major outputs that have an established market price or are assigned a 
monetary value;
    (C) For forest planning areas with a significant timber resource, 
estimates for paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section shall 
be developed both with and without meeting the requirements for 
compliance with a base sale schedule of timber harvest, as described in 
Sec. 219.16(a)(1), and with and without scheduling the harvest of even-
aged stands generally at or beyond culmination of mean annual increment 
of growth, as described in Sec. 219.16(a)(2)(iii).
    (D) Estimates for paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section 
shall be developed both with and without other constraints when needed 
to address major public issues, management concerns, or resource 
opportunities identified during the planning process.
    (2) The current level of goods and services provided by the unit and 
the most likely amount of goods and services expected to be provided in 
the future if current management direction continues; this will be the 
same analysis as that required by Sec. 219.12(f)(5).
    (3) Projections of demand using best available techniques, with both 
price and nonprice information. To the extent practical, demand will be 
assessed as price-quantity relationships.
    (4) A determination of the potential to resolve public issues and 
management concerns.
    (5) Based on consideration of data and findings developed in 
paragraphs (e)(1)-(4), a determination of the need to establish or 
change management direction.
    (f) Formulation of alternatives. The interdisciplinary team shall 
formulate a broad range of reasonable alternatives according to NEPA 
procedures. The primary goal in formulating alternatives, besides 
complying with NEPA procedures, is to provide an adequate basis for 
identifying the alternative that comes nearest to maximizing net public 
benefits, consistent with the resource integration and management 
requirements of Secs. 219.13 through 219.27.
    (1) Alternatives shall be distributed between the minimum resource 
potential and the maximum resource potential to reflect to the extent 
practicable the full range of major commodity and environmental resource 
uses and values that could be produced from the forest. Alternatives 
shall reflect a range of resource outputs and expenditure levels.
    (2) Alternatives shall be formulated to facilitate analysis of 
opportunity costs and of resource use and environmental trade-offs among 
alternatives and between benchmarks and alternatives.
    (3) Alternatives shall be formulated to facilitate evaluation of the 
effects on present net value, benefits, and costs of achieving various 
outputs and values that are not assigned monetary values, but that are 
provided at specified levels.
    (4) Alternatives shall provide different ways to address and respond 
to the major public issues, management concerns, and resource 
opportunities identified during the planning process.
    (5) Reasonable alternatives which may require a change in existing 
law or policy to implement shall be formulated if necessary to address a 
major public issue, management concern, or resource opportunity 
identified during the planning process (40 CFR 1501.7, 1502.14(c)).

[[Page 67]]

    (6) At least one alternative shall be developed which responds to 
and incorporates the RPA Program tentative resource objectives for each 
forest displayed in the regional guide.
    (7) At least one alternative shall reflect the current level of 
goods and services provided by the unit and the most likely amount of 
goods and services expected to be provided in the future if current 
management direction continues. Pursuant to NEPA procedures, this 
alternative shall be deemed the ``no action'' alternative.
    (8) Each alternative shall represent to the extent practicable the 
most cost efficient combination of management prescriptions examined 
that can meet the objectives established in the alternative.
    (9) Each alternative shall state at least--
    (i) The condition and uses that will result from long-term 
application of the alternative;
    (ii) The goods and services to be produced, the timing and flow of 
these resource outputs together with associated costs and benefits;
    (iii) Resource management standards and guidelines; and
    (iv) The purposes of the management direction proposed.
    (g) Estimated effects of alternatives. The physical, biological, 
economic, and social effects of implementing each alternative considered 
in detail shall be estimated and compared according to NEPA procedures. 
These effects include those described in NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1502.14 
and 1502.16) and at least the following:
    (1) The expected outputs for the planning periods, including 
appropriate marketable goods and services, as well as nonmarket items, 
such as recreation and wilderness use, wildlife and fish, protection and 
enhancement of soil, water, and air, and preservation of aesthetic and 
cultural resource values;
    (2) The relationship of expected outputs to the RPA Program 
tentative resource objectives for the forest displayed in the current 
regional guide;
    (3) Direct and indirect benefits and costs, analyzed in sufficient 
detail to estimate--
    (i) the expected real-dollar costs (discounted when appropriate), 
including investment, administrative, and operating costs of the agency 
and all other public and private costs required to manage the forest up 
to the point where the outputs are valued and the environmental 
consequences are realized;
    (ii) the expected real-dollar value (discounted when appropriate) of 
all outputs attributable to each alternative to the extent that monetary 
values can be assigned to nonmarket goods and services, using 
quantitative and qualitative criteria when monetary values may not 
reasonably be assigned;
    (iii) the economic effects of alternatives, including impacts on 
present net value, total receipts to the Federal Government, direct 
benefits to users that are not measured in receipts to the Federal 
Government, receipt shares to State and local governments, income, and 
employment in affected areas; and
    (iv) the monetary opportunity costs (changes in present net value) 
associated with those management standards and resource outputs in each 
alternative that were not assigned monetary values but were provided at 
specified levels, compared with the maximum present net value benchmarks 
developed in Sec. 219.12(e)(1)(iii).
    (4) The significant resource tradeoffs and opportunity costs 
associated with achieving alternative resource objectives.
    (h) Evaluation of alternatives: Using planning criteria, the 
interdisciplinary team shall evaluate the significant physical, 
biological, economic, and social effects of each management alternative 
that is considered in detail. The evaluation shall include a comparative 
analysis of the aggregate effects of the management alternatives and 
shall compare present net value, social and economic impacts, outputs of 
goods and services, and overall protection and enhancement of 
environmental resources.
    (i) Preferred alternative recommendation. The Forest Supervisor 
shall review the interdisciplinary team's evaluation and shall recommend 
to the Regional Forester a preferred alternative to be identified in the 
draft environmental impact statement and displayed as the proposed plan.

[[Page 68]]

    (j) Plan approval. The Regional Forester shall review the proposed 
plan and final environmental impact statement and either approve or 
disapprove the plan in accordance with Sec. 219.10(c). The record of 
decision for approval of a plan shall include, in addition to the 
requirements of NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1505.2), a summarized comparison 
of the selected alternative with:
    (1) Any other alternative considered which is environmentally 
preferable to the selected alternative; and
    (2) Any other alternative considered which comes nearer to 
maximizing present net value.
    (k) Monitoring and evaluation. At intervals established in the plan, 
implementation shall be evaluated on a sample basis to determine how 
well objectives have been met and how closely management standards and 
guidelines have been applied. Based upon this evaluation, the 
interdisciplinary team shall recommend to the Forest Supervisor such 
changes in management direction, revisions, or amendments to the forest 
plan as are deemed necessary. Monitoring requirements identified in the 
forest plan shall provide for--
    (1) A quantitative estimate of performance comparing outputs and 
services with those projected by the forest plan;
    (2) Documentation of the measured prescriptions and effects, 
including significant changes in productivity of the land; and
    (3) Documentation of costs associated with carrying out the planned 
management prescriptions as compared with costs estimated in the forest 
plan.
    (4) A description of the following monitoring activities:
    (i) The actions, effects, or resources to be measured, and the 
frequency of measurements;
    (ii) Expected precision and reliability of the monitoring process; 
and
    (iii) The time when evaluation will be reported.
    (5) A determination of compliance with the following standards:
    (i) Lands are adequately restocked as specified in the forest plan;
    (ii) Lands identified as not suited for timber production are 
examined at least every 10 years to determine if they have become 
suited; and that, if determined suited, such lands are returned to 
timber production;
    (iii) Maximum size limits for harvest areas are evaluated to 
determine whether such size limits should be continued; and
    (iv) Destructive insects and disease organisms do not increase to 
potentially damaging levels following management activities.

Sec. 219.13  Forest planning--resource integration requirements.

    The minimum requirements for integrating individual forest resource 
planning into the forest plan are established in Secs. 219.14 through 
219.26 of this subpart. For the purposes of meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 219.12(c), additional planning criteria may be found in the 
guidelines for managing specific resources set forth in the Forest 
Service Manual and Handbooks.


<R05>
Sec. 219.14  Timber resource land suitability.

    During the forest planning process, lands which are not suited for 
timber production shall be identified in accordance with the criteria in 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
    (a) During the analysis of the management situation, data on all 
National Forest System lands within the planning area shall be reviewed, 
and those lands within any one of the categories described in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (4) of this section shall be identified as not suited 
for timber production--
    (1) The land is not forest land as defined in Sec. 219.3.
    (2) Technology is not available to ensure timber production from the 
land without irreversible resource damage to soils productivity, or 
watershed conditions.
    (3) There is not reasonable assurance that such lands can be 
adequately restocked as provided in Sec. 219.27(c)(3).
    (4) The land has been withdrawn from timber production by an Act of 
Congress, the Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief of the Forest 
Service.
    (b) Forest lands other than those that have been identified as not 
suited for timber production in paragraph (a)

[[Page 69]]

of this section shall be further reviewed and assessed prior to 
formulation of alternatives to determine the costs and benefits for a 
range of management intensities for timber production. For the purpose 
of analysis, the planning area shall be stratified into categories of 
land with similar management costs and returns. The stratification 
should consider appropriate factors that influence the costs and returns 
such as physical and biological conditions of the site and 
transportation requirements. This analysis shall identify the management 
intensity for timber production for each category of land which results 
in the largest excess of discounted benefits less discounted costs and 
shall compare the direct costs of growing and harvesting trees, 
including capital expenditures required for timber production, to the 
anticipated receipts to the government, in accordance with Sec. 219.12 
and paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.
    (1) Direct benefits are expressed as expected gross receipts to the 
government. Such receipts shall be based upon expected stumpage prices 
and payments-in-kind from timber harvest considering future supply and 
demand situation for timber and upon timber production goals of the 
regional guide.
    (2) Direct costs include the anticipated investments, maintenance, 
operating, management, and planning costs attributable to timber 
production activities, including mitigation measures necessitated by the 
impacts of timber production.
    (3) In addition to long-term yield, the financial analysis must 
consider costs and returns of managing the existing timber inventory.
    (c) During formulation and evaluation of each alternative as 
required in Sec. 219.12 (f) and (g), combinations of resource management 
prescriptions shall be defined to meet management objectives for the 
various multiple uses including outdoor recreation, timber, watershed, 
range, wildlife and fish, and wilderness. The formulation and evaluation 
of each alternative shall consider the costs and benefits of alternative 
management intensities for timber production as identified pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with Sec. 219.12(f). Lands 
shall be tentatively identified as not appropriate for timber production 
to meet objectives of the alternative being considered if--
    (1) Based upon a consideration of multiple-use objectives for the 
alternative, the land is proposed for resource uses that preclude timber 
production, such as wilderness;
    (2) Other management objectives for the alternative limit timber 
production activities to the point where management requirements set 
forth in Sec. 219.27 cannot be met; or
    (3) The lands are not cost-efficient, over the planning horizon, in 
meeting forest objectives, which include timber production.
    (d) Lands identified as not suited for timber production in 
paragraph (a) of this section and lands tentatively identified as not 
appropriate for timber production in paragraph (c) of this section shall 
be designated as not suited for timber production in the preferred 
alternative. Designation in the plan of lands not suited for timber 
production shall be reviewed at least every 10 years. Such lands may be 
reviewed and redesignated as suited for timber production due to changed 
conditions at any time, according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and 
(c) of this section, and according to the procedures for amendment or 
revision of the forest plan in Sec. 219.10 (f) and (g).


<R05>
Sec. 219.15  Vegetation management practices.

    When vegetation is altered by management, the methods, timing, and 
intensity of the practices determine the level of benefits that can be 
obtained from the affected resources. The vegetation management 
practices chosen for each vegetation type and circumstance shall be 
defined in the forest plan with applicable standards and guidelines and 
the reasons for the choices. Where more than one vegetation management 
practice will be used in a vegetation type, the conditions under which 
each will be used shall be based upon thorough reviews of technical and 
scientific literature and practical experience, with appropriate 
evaluation of this knowledge for relevance

[[Page 70]]

to the specific vegetation and site conditions. On National Forest 
System land, the vegetation management practice chosen shall comply with 
the management requirements in Sec. 219.27(b).


<R05>
Sec. 219.16  Timber resource sale schedule.

    In a forest plan, the selected forest management alternative 
includes a sale schedule which provides the allowable sale quantity. The 
sale schedule of each alternative, including those which depart from 
base sale schedules, shall be formulated in compliance with 
Sec. 219.12(f) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) Alternatives shall be formulated that include determinations of 
the quantity of the timber that may be sold during each decade. These 
quantity determinations shall be based on the principle of sustained 
yield and shall meet the management requirements in Sec. 219.27. For 
each alternative, the determination shall include a calculation of the 
long-term sustained-yield capacity and the base sale schedule and, when 
appropriate, a calculation of timber sale alternatives that may depart 
from the base sale schedule as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (1) For the base sale schedules, the planned sale for any future 
decade shall be equal to, or greater than, the planned sale for the 
preceding decade, provided that the planned sale is not greater than the 
long-term sustained-yield capacity consistent with the management 
objectives of the alternative.
    (2) The determinations of the appropriate long-term sustained-yield 
capacities, base sale schedules, and departure alternatives to the base 
sale schedules shall be made on the basis of the guidelines which 
follow:
    (i) For the long-term sustained-yield capacities and the base sale 
schedules, assume intensities of management and degree of timber 
utilization consistent with the goals, assumptions, and requirements 
contained in, or used in, the preparation of the current RPA Program and 
regional guide. For the base sale schedule, the management and 
utilization assumptions shall reflect the projected changes in practices 
for the four decades contained in, or used in, the preparation of the 
current RPA Program and regional guide. Beyond the fourth decade, the 
assumptions shall reflect those projected for the fourth decade of the 
current RPA Program, unless there is a basis for a different assumption;
    (ii) For alternatives with sale schedules which depart from the 
corresponding base sale schedule, assume an appropriate management 
intensity;
    (iii) In accordance with the established standards, assure that all 
even-aged stands scheduled to be harvested during the planning period 
will generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment of 
growth. Mean annual increment shall be based on expected growth, 
according to management intensities and utilization standards assumed in 
paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section and on forest type and 
site quality. Mean annual increment shall be expressed in cubic measure. 
Alternatives which incorporate exceptions to these standards shall be 
evaluated if it is reasonable to expect that overall multiple use 
objectives would be better attained. Alternatives which incorporate 
exceptions to these standards are permitted for the use of sound 
silvicultural practices, such as thinning or other stand improvement 
measures; for salvage or sanitation harvesting of timber stands which 
are substantially damaged by fire, windthrow, or other catastrophe, or 
which are in imminent danger from insect or disease attack; for cutting 
for experimental and research purposes; or for removing particular 
species of trees, after consideration has been given to the multiple 
uses of the area being planned and after completion of the public 
participation process applicable to the preparation of a forest plan; 
and
    (iv) Each sale schedule shall provide for a forest structure that 
will enable perpetual timber harvest which meets the principle of 
sustained-yield and multiple-use objectives of the alternative.
    (3) Alternatives with sale schedules which depart from the 
principles of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and which will lead to 
better attaining the

[[Page 71]]

overall objectives of multiple-use management shall be evaluated when 
any of the following conditions are indicated:
    (i) None of the other alternatives considered provides a sale 
schedule that achieves the assigned goals of the RPA Program as provided 
in Sec. 219.4(b);
    (ii) High mortality losses from any cause can be significantly 
reduced or prevented or forest age-class distribution can be improved, 
thereby facilitating future sustained-yield management; or
    (iii) Implementation of the corresponding base sale schedule would 
cause a substantial adverse impact upon a community in the economic area 
in which the forest is located.
    (iv) It is reasonable to expect that overall multiple-use objectives 
would otherwise be better attained.
    (b) The sale schedule of the management alternative selected in 
accordance with Sec. 219.12 provides the allowable sale quantity for the 
first plan period.


<R05>
Sec. 219.17  Evaluation of roadless areas.

    (a) Unless otherwise provided by law, roadless areas within the 
National Forest System shall be evaluated and considered for 
recommendation as potential wilderness areas during the forest planning 
process, as provided in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) During analysis of the management situation, the following areas 
shall be subject to evaluation:
    (i) Roadless areas including those previously inventoried in the 
second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II), in a unit plan, or 
in a forest plan, which remain essentially roadless and undeveloped, and 
which have not yet been designated as wilderness or for nowilderness 
uses by law. In addition, other essentially roadless areas may be 
subject to evaluation at the discretion of the Forest Supervisor.
    (ii) Areas contiguous to existing wilderness, primitive areas, or 
administratively proposed wildernesses, regardless of which agency has 
jurisdiction for the wilderness or proposed wilderness;
    (iii) Areas that are contiguous to roadless and undeveloped areas in 
other Federal ownership that have identified wilderness potential; and
    (iv) Areas designated by Congress for wilderness study, 
administrative proposals pending before Congress, and other legislative 
proposals pending which have been endorsed by the President.
    (2) For each area subject to evaluation under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, the determination of the significant resource issues, 
which in turn affect the detail and scope of evaluation required by the 
Forest Service, shall be developed with public participation. As a 
minimum, the evaluation shall include consideration of:
    (i) The values of the area as wilderness;
    (ii) The values foregone and effects on management of adjacent lands 
as a consequence of wilderness designation;
    (iii) Feasibility of management as wilderness, in respect to size, 
nonconforming use, land ownership patterns, and existing contractual 
agreements or statutory rights;
    (iv) Proximity to other designated wilderness and relative 
contribution to the National Wilderness Preservation System; and
    (v) The anticipated long-term changes in plant and animal species 
diversity, including the diversity of natural plant and animal 
communities of the forest planning area and the effects of such changes 
on the values for which wilderness areas were created.

[47 FR 43037, Sept. 30, 1982, as amended at 48 FR 40383, Sept. 7, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 219.18  Wilderness management.

    Forest planning shall provide direction for the management of 
designated wilderness and primitive areas in accordance with the 
provisions of 36 CFR part 293. In particular, plans shall--
    (a) Provide for limiting and distributing visitor use of specific 
areas in accord with periodic estimates of the maximum levels of use 
that allow natural processes to operate freely and that do not impair 
the values for which wilderness areas were created; and
    (b) Evaluate the extent to which wildfire, insect, and disease 
control

[[Page 72]]

measures may be desirable for protection of either the wilderness or 
adjacent areas and provide for such measures when appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 219.19  Fish and wildlife resource.

    Fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable 
populations of existing native and desired non-native vertebrate species 
in the planning area. For planning purposes, a viable population shall 
be regarded as one which has the estimated numbers and distribution of 
reproductive individuals to insure its continued existence is well 
distributed in the planning area. In order to insure that viable 
populations will be maintained, habitat must be provided to support, at 
least, a minimum number of reproductive individuals and that habitat 
must be well distributed so that those individuals can interact with 
others in the planning area.
    (a) Each alternative shall establish objectives for the maintenance 
and improvement of habitat for management indicator species selected 
under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, to the degree consistent with 
overall multiple use objectives of the alternative. To meet this goal, 
management planning for the fish and wildlife resource shall meet the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this 
section.
    (1) In order to estimate the effects of each alternative on fish and 
wildlife populations, certain vertebrate and/or invertebrate species 
present in the area shall be identified and selected as management 
indicator species and the reasons for their selection will be stated. 
These species shall be selected because their population changes are 
believed to indicate the effects of management activities. In the 
selection of management indicator species, the following categories 
shall be represented where appropriate: Endangered and threatened plant 
and animal species identified on State and Federal lists for the 
planning area; species with special habitat needs that may be influenced 
significantly by planned management programs; species commonly hunted, 
fished, or trapped; non-game species of special interest; and additional 
plant or animal species selected because their population changes are 
believed to indicate the effects of management activities on other 
species of selected major biological communities or on water quality. On 
the basis of available scientific information, the interdisciplinary 
team shall estimate the effects of changes in vegetation type, timber 
age classes, community composition, rotation age, and year-long 
suitability of habitat related to mobility of management indicator 
species. Where appropriate, measures to mitigate adverse effects shall 
be prescribed.
    (2) Planning alternatives shall be stated and evaluated in terms of 
both amount and quality of habitat and of animal population trends of 
the management indicator species.
    (3) Biologists from State fish and wildlife agencies and other 
Federal agencies shall be consulted in order to coordinate planning for 
fish and wildlife, including opportunities for the reintroduction of 
extirpated species.
    (4) Access and dispersal problems of hunting, fishing, and other 
visitor uses shall be considered.
    (5) The effects of pest and fire management on fish and wildlife 
populations shall be considered.
    (6) Population trends of the management indicator species will be 
monitored and relationships to habitat changes determined. This 
monitoring will be done in cooperation with State fish and wildlife 
agencies, to the extent practicable.
    (7) Habitat determined to be critical for threatened and endangered 
species shall be identified, and measures shall be prescribed to prevent 
the destruction or adverse modification of such habitat. Objectives 
shall be determined for threatened and endangered species that shall 
provide for, where possible, their removal from listing as threatened 
and endangered species through appropriate conservation measures, 
including the designation of special areas to meet the protection and 
management needs of such species.


<R05>
Sec. 219.20  Grazing resource.

    In forest planning, the suitability and potential capability of 
National

[[Page 73]]

Forest System lands for producing forage for grazing animals and for 
providing habitat for management indicator species shall be determined 
as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Lands so 
identified shall be managed in accordance with direction established in 
forest plans.
    (a) Lands suitable for grazing and browsing shall be identified and 
their condition and trend shall be determined. The present and potential 
supply of forage for livestock, wild and free-roaming horses and burros, 
and the capability of these lands to produce suitable food and cover for 
selected wildlife species shall be estimated. The use of forage by 
grazing and browsing animals will be estimated. Lands in less than 
satisfactory condition shall be identified and appropriate action 
planned for their restoration.
    (b) Alternative range management prescriptions shall consider 
grazing systems and the facilities necessary to implement them; land 
treatment and vegetation manipulation practices; and evaluation of pest 
problems; possible conflict or beneficial interactions among livestock, 
wild free-roaming horses and burros and wild animal populations, and 
methods of regulating these; direction for rehabilitation of ranges in 
unsatisfactory condition; and comparative cost efficiency of the 
prescriptions.


<R05>
Sec. 219.21  Recreation resource.

    To the degree consistent with needs and demands for all major 
resources, a broad spectrum of forest and rangeland related outdoor 
recreation opportunities shall be provided for in each alternative. 
Planning activities to achieve this shall be in accordance with national 
and regional direction and procedural requirements of paragraphs (a) 
through (g) of this section.
    (a) Forest planning shall identify--
    (1) The physical and biological characteristics that make land 
suitable for recreation opportunities;
    (2) The recreational preferences of user groups and the settings 
needed to provide quality recreation opportunities; and
    (3) Recreation opportunities on the National Forest System lands.
    (b) The supply of developed recreational facilities in the area of 
National Forest influence shall be appraised for adequacy to meet 
present and future demands.
    (c) Planning alternatives shall include consideration of 
establishment of physical facilities, regulation of use, and recreation 
opportunities responsive to current and anticipated user demands.
    (d) In formulation and analysis of alternatives as specified in 
Sec. 219.12 (f) and (g), interactions among recreation opportunities and 
other multiple uses shall be examined. This examination shall consider 
the impacts of the proposed recreation activities on other uses and 
values and the impacts of other uses and activities associated with them 
on recreation opportunities, activities, and quality of experience.
    (e) Formulation and evaluation of alternatives under paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section shall be coordinated to the extent feasible with 
present and proposed recreation activities of local and State land use 
or outdoor recreation plans, particularly the State Comprehensive 
Outdoor Recreation Plan, and recreation opportunities already present 
and available on other public and private lands, with the aim of 
reducing duplication in meeting recreation demands.
    (f) The visual resource shall be inventoried and evaluated as an 
integrated part of evaluating alternatives in the forest planning 
process, addressing both the landscape's visual attractiveness and the 
public's visual expectation. Management prescriptions for definitive 
land areas of the forest shall include visual quality objectives.
    (g) Off-road vehicle use shall be planned and implemented to protect 
land and other resources, promote public safety, and minimize conflicts 
with other uses of the National Forest System lands. Forest planning 
shall evaluate the potential effects of vehicle use off roads and, on 
the basis of the requirements of 36 CFR part 295 of this chapter, 
classify areas and trails of National Forest System lands as to whether 
or not off-road vehicle use may be permitted.

<R05>
Sec. 219.22  Mineral resource.

    Mineral exploration and development in the planning area shall be 
considered in the management of renewable resources. The following shall 
be recognized to the extent practicable in forest planning:
    (a) Active mines within the area of land covered by the forest plan;
    (b) Outstanding or reserved mineral rights;
    (c) The probable occurrence of various minerals, including 
locatable, leasable, and common variety;
    (d) The potential for future mineral development and potential need 
for withdrawal of areas from development;
    (e) Access requirements for mineral exploration and development; and
    (f) The probable effect of renewable resource prescriptions and 
management direction on mineral resources and activities, including 
exploration and development.


<R05>
Sec. 219.23  Water and soil resource.

    Forest planning shall provide for--
    (a) General estimates of current water uses, both consumptive and 
non-consumptive, including instream flow requirements within the area of 
land covered by the forest plan;
    (b) Identification of significant existing impoundments, 
transmission facilities, wells, and other man-made developments on the 
area of land covered by the forest plan;
    (c) Estimation of the probable occurrence of various levels of water 
volumes, including extreme events which would have a major impact on the 
planning area;
    (d) Compliance with requirements of the Clean Water Act, the Safe 
Drinking Water Act, and all substantive and procedural requirements of 
Federal, State, and local governmental bodies with respect to the 
provision of public water systems and the disposal of waste water;
    (e) Evaluation of existing or potential watershed conditions that 
will influence soil productivity, water yield, water pollution, or 
hazardous events; and
    (f) Adoption of measures, as directed in applicable Executive 
orders, to minimize risk of flood loss, to restore and preserve 
floodplain values, and to protect wetlands.


<R05>
Sec. 219.24  Cultural and historic resources.

    Forest planning shall provide for the identification, protection, 
interpretation, and management of significant cultural resources on 
National Forest System lands. Planning of the resource shall be governed 
by the requirements of Federal laws pertaining to historic preservation, 
and guided by paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
    (a) Forest planning shall--
    (1) Provide an overview of known data relevant to history, 
ethnography, and prehistory of the area under consideration, including 
known cultural resource sites;
    (2) Identify areas requiring more intensive inventory;
    (3) Provide for evaluation and identification of appropriate sites 
for the National Register of Historic Places;

Archaeologist and with other State and Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 219.25  Research natural areas.

    Forest planning shall provide for the establishment of Research 
Natural Areas (RNA's). Planning shall make

[[Page 75]]

provision for the identification of examples of important forest, 
shrubland, grassland, alpine, aquatic, and geologic types that have 
special or unique characteristics of scientific interest and importance 
and that are needed to complete the national network of RNA's. Biotic, 
aquatic, and geologic types needed for the network shall be identified 
using a list provided by the Chief of the Forest Service. Authority to 
establish RNA's is delegated to the Chief at 7 CFR 2.60(a) and 36 CFR 
251.23. Recommendations for establishment of areas shall be made to the 
Chief through the planning process.


<R05>
Sec. 219.26  Diversity.

    Forest planning shall provide for diversity of plant and animal 
communities and tree species consistent with the overall multiple-use 
objectives of the planning area. Such diversity shall be considered 
throughout the planning process. Inventories shall include quantitative 
data making possible the evaluation of diversity in terms of its prior 
and present condition. For each planning alternative, the 
interdisciplinary team shall consider how diversity will be affected by 
various mixes of resource outputs and uses, including proposed 
management practices. (Refer to Sec. 219.27(g).)


<R05>
Sec. 219.27  Management requirements.

    The minimum specific management requirements to be met in 
accomplishing goals and objectives for the National Forest System are 
set forth in this section. These requirements guide the development, 
analysis, approval, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of forest 
plans.
    (a) Resource protection. All management prescriptions shall--
    (1) Conserve soil and water resources and not allow significant or 
permanent impairment of the productivity of the land;
    (2) Consistent with the relative resource values involved, minimize 
serious or long-lasting hazards from flood, wind, wildfire, erosion, or 
other natural physical forces unless these are specifically excepted, as 
in wilderness;
    (3) Consistent with the relative resource values involved, prevent 
or reduce serious, long lasting hazards and damage from pest organisms, 
utilizing principles of integrated pest management. Under this approach 
all aspects of a pest-host system should be weighed to determine 
situation-specific prescriptions which may utilize a combination of 
techniques including, as appropriate, natural controls, harvesting, use 
of resistant species, maintenance of diversity, removal of damaged 
trees, and judicious use of pesticides. The basic principle in the 
choice of strategy is that, in the long term, it be ecologically 
acceptable and compatible with the forest ecosystem and the multiple use 
objectives of the plan;
    (4) Protect streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands, and 
other bodies of water as provided under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section;
    (5) Provide for and maintain diversity of plant and animal 
communities to meet overall multiple-use objectives, as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section;
    (6) Provide for adequate fish and wildlife habitat to maintain 
viable populations of existing native vertebrate species and provide 
that habitat for species chosen under Sec. 219.19 is maintained and 
improved to the degree consistent with multiple-use objectives 
established in the plan;
    (7) Be assessed prior to project implementation for potential 
physical, biological, aesthetic, cultural, engineering, and economic 
impacts and for consistency with multiple uses planned for the general 
area;
    (8) Include measures for preventing the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat for threatened and endangered species;
    (9) Provide that existing significant transportation and utility 
corridors and other significant right-of-ways that are capable and 
likely to be needed to accommodate the facility or use from an 
additional compatible right-of-way be designated as a right-of-way 
corridor. Subsequent right-of-way grants will, to the extent 
practicable, and as determined by the responsible line officer, use 
designated corridors;
    (10) Ensure that any roads constructed through contracts, permits, 
or leases are designed according to standards appropriate to the planned 
uses,

[[Page 76]]

considering safety, cost of transportation, and effects upon lands and 
resources;
    (11) Provide that all roads are planned and designed to re-establish 
vegetative cover on the disturbed area within a reasonable period of 
time, not to exceed 10 years after the termination of a contract, lease 
or permit, unless the road is determined necessary as a permanent 
addition to the National Forest Transportation System; and
    (12) Be consistent with maintaining air quality at a level that is 
adequate for the protection and use of National Forest System resources 
and that meets or exceeds applicable Federal, State and/or local 
standards or regulations.
    (b) Vegetative manipulation. Management prescriptions that involve 
vegetative manipulation of tree cover for any purpose shall--
    (1) Be best suited to the multiple-use goals established for the 
area with potential environmental, biological, cultural resource, 
aesthetic, engineering, and economic impacts, as stated in the regional 
guides and forest plans, being considered in this determination;
    (2) Assure that lands can be adequately restocked as provided in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, except where permanent openings are 
created for wildlife habitat improvement, vistas, recreation uses and 
similar practices;
    (3) Not be chosen primarily because they will give the greatest 
dollar return or the greatest output of timber, although these factors 
shall be considered;
    (4) Be chosen after considering potential effects on residual trees 
and adjacent stands;
    (5) Avoid permanent impairment of site productivity and ensure 
conservation of soil and water resources;
    (6) Provide the desired effects on water quantity and quality, 
wildlife and fish habitat, regeneration of desired tree species, forage 
production, recreation uses, aesthetic values, and other resource 
yields; and
    (7) Be practical in terms of transportation and harvesting 
requirements, and total costs of preparation, logging, and 
administration.
    (c) Silvicultural practices. The following management requirements 
apply to timber harvest and cultural treatments:
    (1) No timber harvesting shall occur on lands classified as not 
suited for timber production pursuant to Sec. 219.14 except for salvage 
sales, sales necessary to protect other multiple-use values or 
activities that meet other objectives on such lands if the forest plan 
establishes that such actions are appropriate. These lands shall 
continue to be treated for reforestation purposes if necessary to 
achieve the multiple-use objectives of the plan.
    (2) The selected sale schedule provides the allowable sale quantity 
for the first planning period. Within the planning period, the volume of 
timber to be sold in any one year may exceed the average annual 
allowable sale quantity so long as the total amount sold for the 
planning period does not exceed the allowable sale quantity. Nothing in 
this paragraph prohibits salvage or sanitation harvesting of timber 
stands which are substantially damaged by fire, windthrow, or other 
catastrophe, or which are in imminent danger of insect or disease attack 
and where such harvests are consistent with silvicultural and 
environmental standards. Such timber may either substitute for timber 
that would otherwise be sold under the plan or, if not feasible, be sold 
over and above the planned volume.
    (3) When trees are cut to achieve timber production objectives, the 
cuttings shall be made in such a way as to assure that the technology 
and knowledge exists to adequately restock the lands within 5 years 
after final harvest. Research and experience shall be the basis for 
determining whether the harvest and regeneration practices planned can 
be expected to result in adequate restocking. Adequate restocking means 
that the cut area will contain the minimum number, size, distribution, 
and species composition of regeneration as specified in regional 
silvicultural guides for each forest type. Five years after final 
harvest means 5 years after clearcutting, 5 years after final overstory 
removal in shelterwood cutting, 5 years after the

[[Page 77]]

seed tree removal cut in seed tree cutting, or 5 years after selection 
cutting.
    (4) Cultural treatments such as thinning, weeding, and other partial 
cutting may be included in the forest plan where they are intended to 
increase the rate of growth of remaining trees, favor commercially 
valuable tree species, favor species or age classes which are most 
valuable for wildlife, or achieve other multiple-use objectives.
    (5) Harvest levels based on intensified management practices shall 
be decreased no later than the end of each planning period if such 
practices cannot be completed substantially as planned.
    (6) Timber harvest cuts designed to regenerate an even-aged stand of 
timber shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection 
of soil, watershed, fish and wildlife, recreation, and aesthetic 
resources, and the regeneration of the timber resource.
    (7) Timber harvest and other silvicultural treatments shall be used 
to prevent potentially damaging population increases of forest pest 
organisms. Silvicultural treatments shall not be applied where such 
treatments would make stands susceptible to pest-caused damage levels 
inconsistent with management objectives.
    (d) Even-aged management. When openings are created in the forest by 
the application of even-aged silviculture, the following management 
requirements apply:
    (1) Openings shall be located to achieve the desired combination of 
multiple-use objectives. The blocks or strips cut shall be shaped and 
blended with the natural terrain, to the extent practicable, to achieve 
aesthetic, wildlife habitat, or other objectives established in the 
plan. Regional guides shall provide guidance on dispersion of openings 
in relation to topography, climate, geography, local land use patterns, 
forest types or other factors. As a minimum, openings in forest stands 
are no longer considered openings once a new forest is established. 
Forest plans may set forth variations to this minimum based on site-
specific requirements for achieving multiple-use objectives. Regional 
guides shall provide guidance for determining variations to this minimum 
in the forest plan, based on requirements for watershed, wildlife 
habitat, scenery or other resource protection needs, or other factors.
    (2) Individual cut blocks, patches, or strips shall conform to the 
maximum size limits for areas to be cut in one harvest operation 
established by the regional guide according to geographic areas and 
forest types. This limit may be less than, but will not exceed, 60 acres 
for the Douglas-fir forest type of California, Oregon, and Washington; 
80 acres for the southern yellow pine types of Alabama, Arkansas, 
Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas; 100 acres for the hemlock-sitka spruce 
forest type of coastal Alaska; and 40 acres for all other forest types 
except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Cut openings larger than those specified may be permitted where 
larger units will produce a more desirable combination of net public 
benefits. Such exceptions shall be provided for in regional guides. The 
following factors shall be considered in evaluating harvest cuts of 
various sizes and shapes to determine size limits by geographic areas 
and forest types: Topography; relationship of units to other natural or 
artificial openings and proximity of units; coordination and consistency 
with adjacent forests and regions; effect on water quality and quantity; 
visual absorption capability; effect on wildlife and fish habitat; 
regeneration requirements for desirable tree species based upon the 
latest research findings; transportation and harvesting system 
requirements; environmental and forest pest hazards to regeneration, 
residual trees, and surrounding stands; and the relative total costs of 
preparation and administration, transportation requirements, harvesting, 
site preparation, planting, stocking control, and future stand tending 
of harvest cuts of various sizes and shapes. Specification for 
exceptions shall include the particular conditions under which the 
larger size is permitted and shall set a new maximum size permitted 
under those conditions.
    (ii) Size limits exceeding those established in paragraphs (d)(2) 
and (d)(2)(i)

[[Page 78]]

of this section are permitted on an individual timber sale basis after 
60 days' public notice and review by the Regional Forester.
    (iii) The established limit shall not apply to the size of areas 
harvested as a result of natural catastrophic condition such as fire, 
insect and disease attack, or windstorm.
    (e) Riparian areas. Special attention shall be given to land and 
vegetation for approximately 100 feet from the edges of all perennial 
streams, lakes, and other bodies of water. This area shall correspond to 
at least the recognizable area dominated by the riparian vegetation. No 
management practices causing detrimental changes in water temperature or 
chemical composition, blockages of water courses, or deposits of 
sediment shall be permitted within these areas which seriously and 
adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat. Topography, 
vegetation type, soil, climatic conditions, management objectives, and 
other factors shall be considered in determining what management 
practices may be performed within these areas or the constraints to be 
placed upon their performance.
    (f) Soil and water. Conservation of soil and water resources 
involves the analysis, protection, enhancement, treatment, and 
evaluation of soil and water resources and their responses under 
management and shall be guided by instructions in official technical 
handbooks. These handbooks must show specific ways to avoid or mitigate 
damage, and maintain or enhance productivity on specific sites. These 
handbooks may be regional in scope or, where feasible, specific to 
physiographic or climatic provinces.
    (g) Diversity. Management prescriptions, where appropriate and to 
the extent practicable, shall preserve and enhance the diversity of 
plant and animal communities, including endemic and desirable 
naturalized plant and animal species, so that it is at least as great as 
that which would be expected in a natural forest and the diversity of 
tree species similar to that existing in the planning area. Reductions 
in diversity of plant and animal communities and tree species from that 
which would be expected in a natural forest, or from that similar to the 
existing diversity in the planning area, may be prescribed only where 
needed to meet overall multiple-use objectives. Planned type conversion 
shall be justified by an analysis showing biological, economic, social, 
and environmental design consequences, and the relation of such 
conversions to the process of natural change.


<R05>
Sec. 219.28  Research.

    (a) Research needs for management of the National Forest System 
shall be identified during planning and periodically reviewed during 
evaluation of implemented plans. Particular attention should be given to 
research needs identified during the monitoring and evaluation described 
in Sec. 219.12(k). These identified needs shall be included in 
formulating overall research programs and plans which involve private as 
well as public forest and rangelands.
    (b) Research needed to support or improve management of the National 
Forest System shall be established and budgeted at the research station 
and national levels. Priorities for this portion of the Forest Service 
Research Program shall be based upon the information gathered at all 
planning levels of the National Forest System.
    (c) An annual report shall be prepared at the national level with 
assistance from Regions and Stations which shall include, but not be 
limited to, a description of the status of major research programs which 
address National Forest System needs for Research, significant findings, 
and how this information is to be or has recently been applied.


<R05>
Sec. 219.29  Transition period.

    (a) Until a forest planning area of the National Forest System is 
managed under a forest plan developed pursuant to this subpart and 
approved by the Regional Forester, the land may continue to be managed 
under existing land use and resource plans. As soon as practicable, 
existing plans shall be amended or revised to incorporate standards and 
guidelines in this subpart. Pending approval of a forest plan, existing 
plans may be amended or revised to include

[[Page 79]]

management requirements not inconsistent with the provisions of the RPA 
and these regulations.
    (b) Requirements of amendments to this subpart shall be incorporated 
in forest plans and regional guides through the ongoing planning 
process. Planning process steps already completed need not be repeated.
    (1) If, prior to the effective date of an amendment to this subpart, 
a forest plan either has been approved in final form or released in 
draft form for public review, the plan need not be modified to 
incorporate requirements of such amendment, until the next scheduled 
revision of the forest plan;
    (2) If, prior to the effective date of an amendment to this subpart, 
a regional guide either has been approved in final form or released in 
draft form for public review, the guide need not be modified to 
incorporate the requirements of such amendment, until a significant 
amendment to the guide is made for reasons other than incorporating 
requirements of amendments to this subpart.
    (c) A forest plan may become effective prior to the development and 
approval of its related regional guide, provided that the forest plan is 
reviewed upon regional guide approval, and if necessary, amended to 
comply with regional management direction. If such an amendment is 
significant, it shall be accomplished pursuant to the requirements for 
the development of a forest plan as set forth in this subpart.
    (d) As a result of the eruption of Mount St. Helens, a land 
management plan for the Mount St. Helens area shall be prepared 
substantially in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this subpart, the area 
included in the Mount St. Helens land management plan will not be 
subject to planning activities for the first generation Gifford Pinchot 
National Forest Plan unless the Regional Forester for the Pacific 
Northwest Region determines that additional planning activities are 
desirable.
    (2) Lands which were inventoried as roadless and designated for 
nonwilderness uses in the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II) 
shall be managed for uses other than wilderness. Except for a small part 
of the Mount Margaret roadless area (B 6071), the Mount St. Helens land 
management plan shall not consider wilderness designation for these 
lands.
    (3) Lands which were inventoried as roadless and designated as 
further planning in the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II) 
shall be evaluated in the Mount St. Helens land management plan and 
shall be managed in accordance with that plan.

Sec. 222.3  Issuance of grazing and livestock use permits.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified by the Chief, Forest Service, all 
grazing and livestock use on National Forest System lands and on other 
lands under Forest Service control must be authorized by a grazing or 
livestock use permit.
    (b) Grazing permits and livestock use permits convey no right, 
title, or interest held by the United States in any lands or resources.
    (c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to issue permits for 
livestock grazing and other use by livestock of the National Forest 
System and on other lands under Forest Service control as follows:
    (1) Grazing permits with priority for renewal may be issued as 
follows: On National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States 10-year 
term permits will be issued unless the land is pending disposal, or will 
be devoted to other uses prior to the end of ten years, or it will be in 
the best interest of sound land management to specify a shorter term. On 
National Forest System lands other than National Forests in the 16 
contiguous western States, the permit term shall be for periods of 10 
years or less. Term grazing permits for periods of 10 years or less in 
the form of grazing agreements may be issued to cooperative grazing 
associations or similar organizations incorporated or otherwise 
established pursuant to State law. Such an agreement will make National 
Forest System lands and improvements available to the association for 
grazing in accordance with provisions of the grazing agreement and 
Forest Service

[[Page 83]]

policies. Term permits authorized in this paragraph may be in the form 
of private land or on-and-off grazing permits where the person is 
qualified to hold such permits under provisions the Chief may require. 
Permits issued under this paragraph are subject to the following:
    (i) Except as provided for by the Chief, Forest Service, paid term 
permits will be issued to persons who own livestock to be grazed and 
such base property as may be required, provided the land is determined 
to be available for grazing purposes by the Chief, Forest Service, and 
the capacity exists to graze specified numbers of animals.
    (ii) A term permit holder has first priority for receipt of a new 
permit at the end of the term period provided he has fully complied with 
the terms and conditions of the expiring permit.
    (iii) In order to update terms and conditions, term permits may be 
cancelled at the end of the calendar year of the midyear of the decade 
(1985, 1995, etc.), provided they are reissued to the existing permit 
holder for a new term of 10 years.
    (iv) New term permits may be issued to the purchaser of a 
permittee's permitted livestock and/or base property, provided the 
permittee waives his term permit to the United States and provided the 
purchaser is otherwise eligible and qualified.
    (v) If the permittee chooses to dispose of all or part of his base 
property or permitted livestock (not under approved nonuse) but does not 
choose to waive his term permit, the Forest Supervisor will give written 
notice that he no longer is qualified to hold a permit, provided he is 
given up to one year to reestablish his qualifications before 
cancellation action is final.
    (vi) The Chief, Forest Service, shall prescribe provisions and 
requirements under which term permits will be issued, renewed, and 
administered, including:
    (A) The amount and character of base property and livestock the 
permit holder shall be required to own.
    (B) Specifying the period of the year the base property shall be 
capable of supporting permitted livestock.
    (C) Acquisition of base property and/or permitted livestock.
    (D) Conditions for the approval of nonuse of permit for specified 
periods.
    (E) Upper and special limits governing the total number of livestock

conditions as the Chief, Forest Service, may prescribe, are authorized 
as follows:
    (i) Temporary grazing permits for periods not to exceed one year, 
and on a charge basis, may be issued:
    (A) To allow for use of range while a term grazing permit is held in 
suspension.
    (B) To use forage created by unusually favorable climatic 
conditions.
    (C) To use the forage available when the permit of the normal user's 
livestock is in nonuse status for reasons of personal convenience.
    (D) To allow a person to continue to graze livestock for the 
remainder of the grazing season where base property has been sold, the 
permit waived, and a new term permit issued.
    (E) To allow grazing use in the event of drought or other emergency 
of National or Regional scope where such use would not result in 
permanent resource damage.
    (ii) Livestock use permits for not to exceed one year may be issued 
under terms and conditions prescribed by the Chief, Forest Service, as 
follows:
    (A) Paid permits for transportation livestock to persons engaged in 
commercial packing, dude ranching, or other commercial enterprises which 
involve transportation livestock including mining, ranching, and 
logging, activities.
    (B) Paid or free permits for research purposes and administrative 
studies.
    (C) Paid or free permits to trail livestock across National Forest

areas and may be used to move animals away from hazards during capture 
operations.
    (4) During capture operations, animals shall be moved in such a way 
as to prevent harmful stress or injury.
    (5) The authorized officer shall supervise all helicopter uses as 
follows:
    (i) Have means to communicate with the pilot and be able to direct 
the use of the helicopter; and
    (ii) Be able to observe effects of the use of the helicopters on the 
well-being of the animals.
    (c) Fixed-wing aircraft may be used for inventory, observation, and 
surveillance purposes necessary in administering the Act. Such use shall 
be consistent with the Act of September 8, 1959, as amended (18 U.S.C. 
41 et seq.). Fixed-wing aircraft shall not be used in connection with 
capture operations except as support vehicles.
    (d) Motor vehicles may be used in the administration of the Act 
except that such vehicles shall not be used for driving or chasing wild 
horses or burros in capture operations. Motor vehicles may also be used 
for the purpose of transporting captured animals subject to the 
following humane procedures.
    (1) Such transportation shall comply with appropriate State and 
Federal laws and regulations applicable to humane transportation of 
horses and burros.
    (2) Vehicles shall be inspected by an authorized officer prior to 
use to ensure vehicles are in good repair and of adequate rate capacity.
    (3) Vehicles shall be carefully operated to ensure that captured 
animals are transported without undue risk or injury.
    (4) Where necessary and practical, animals shall be sorted as to 
age, temperament, sex, size, and condition so as to limit, to the extent 
possible, injury due to fighting and trampling.
    (5) The authorizing officer shall consider the condition of the 
animals, weather conditions, type of vehicle, and distance to be 
traveled when planning for transportation of captured animals.
    (6) Unless otherwise approved by the authorized officer, the 
transportation of wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be limited 
in sequence, to a maximum of 24 hours in transit followed by a minimum 
of 5 hours of on-the-ground rest with adequate feed and water.


<R05>
Sec. 222.25  Protection of wild free-roaming horses and burros when they are upon other than the National Forest System or public lands.

    Individual animals and herds of wild free-roaming horses and burros 
will be under the protection of the Chief, Forest Service, even though 
they may thereafter move to lands of other ownership or jurisdiction as 
a part of their annual territorial habitat pattern or for other reasons. 
The Chief will exercise surveillance of these animals through the use of 
cooperative agreements and as otherwise authorized by law and act 
immediately through appropriate administrative or criminal and civil 
judicial procedures to provide them the protective measures of the Act 
at any time he has cause to believe its provisions are being violated.


<R05>
Sec. 222.26  Removal of wild free-roaming horses and burros from private lands.

    Owners of land upon which wild free-roaming horses and burros have 
strayed from the National Forest System may request their removal by 
calling the nearest office of either the Forest Service or Federal 
Marshall.


<R05>
Sec. 222.27  Maintenance of wild free-roaming horses and burros on privately-owned lands.

    Owners of land who wish to maintain wild free-roaming horses and 
burros which have strayed onto their lands from the National Forest 
System may do so by notifying the nearest office of the Forest Service 
in a timely fashion and providing such information on a continuing basis 
as the Chief, Forest Service, may require. Such owners

[[Page 92]]

shall protect the wild free-roaming horses and burros on their lands. 
They may not, in so maintaining these animals, impede their return to 
National Forest System lands unless authorized by agreement with the 
Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 222.28  Agreements.

    The Chief, Forest Service, may enter into agreements as he deems 
necessary to further the protection, management, and control of wild 
free-roaming horses and burros.


<R05>
Sec. 222.29  Relocation and disposal of animals.

    (a) The Chief, Forest Service, shall, when he determines over-
population of wild horses and burros exists and removal is required, 
take immediate necessary action to remove excess animals from that 
particular territory. Such action shall be taken until all excess 
animals have been removed so as to restore a thriving natural ecological 
balance to the range, and protect the range from deterioration 
associated with over-population.
    (b) No person except an authorized Forest Service officer or his 
agent shall destroy, remove, or relocate any wild free-roaming horse or 
burro located on the National Forest System.
    (c) Wild horses and burros shall be relocated or removed in the 
following order of priority:
    (1) In the most humane manner possible, sick, lame, or old animals 
shall be destroyed;
    (2) Relocate animals to other National Forest System lands which 
were identified as 1971 wild horse or burro territory, providing 
suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize 
vegetation condition;
    (3) Relocate animals to other federally-owned lands which were 
identified as 1971 wild horse or burro occupied lands, providing 
suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize 
vegetation condition and animals are requested by the appropriate land 
manager having jurisdiction;
    (4) Place animals under private maintenance and care agreements 
where there is an adoption demand by qualified individuals, groups, or 
Government agency, and for which there is assurance of humane treatment 
and care, provided not more than four animals are placed under private 
maintenance and care agreements per year to any individual, 
organization, or government agency unless there is a determination 
expressed otherwise in writing, by an authorized Forest Service Officer; 
and
    (5) Excess animals, for which an adoption demand by qualified 
applicants does not exist, shall be destroyed in the most humane manner 
possible, and if several methods are equally humane, select the most 
cost efficient.
    (d) Where excess animals have been placed under private maintenance 
and care agreements after December 15, 1971, as provided for in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and animals have been provided humane 
conditions, treatment, and care, for a period of one year, the Chief, 
Forest Service, may grant title to not more than four animals per year 
to each individual, organization, or government agency.
    (e) The applicants must make written application for title and/or 
adoption, must be of legal age in the State in which they reside, and 
must pay fees for adoption and transportation as follows:
    (1) The application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable advance 
payment of $25 by guaranteed remittance. If custody of a wild, free-
roaming horse or burro is granted by the authorized Forest Service 
officer, the advance payment shall be applied against the adoption fee 
required to be paid at the time the maintenance and care agreement 
Sec. 222.29(c)(4) is executed.
    (2) The Forest Service shall charge an adoption fee of $125 for each 
horse and $75 for each burro, except that there shall be no adoption fee 
for an unweaned offspring under 6 months of age accompanying its mother.
    (3) Any transportation costs incurred for the transportation of the 
animal(s) to the point of pickup must be paid before an approved 
individual, group, or government agency takes custody of the animal(s).
    (f) Humane conditions, treatment, and care must have been provided 
for no less that one year preceding the filing of the application for 
title. The conveyance of title shall include a

[[Page 93]]

written statement by an authorized officer attesting that the animal is 
in good condition.

12548, 51 FR 1986 Comp., p. 188.


<R05>
Sec. 222.50  General procedures.

    (a) Fees shall be charged for all livestock grazing or livestock use 
of National Forest system lands, or other lands under Forest Service 
control. An exception is livestock authorized free of charge under 
provisions of Sec. 222.3(c)(2)(ii) (B) through (G).
    (b) Guiding establishment of fees are the law and general 
governmental policy as established by Bureau of the Budget (now, Office 
of Management and Budget) Circular A-25 of September 23, 1959, which 
directs that a fair market value be obtained for all services and 
resources provided the public through establishment of a system of 
reasonable fee charges, and that the users be afford equitable 
treatment. This policy precludes a monetary consideration in the fee 
structure for any permit value that may be capitalized into the permit 
holder's private ranching operation.
    (c) A grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock 
grazing or use. A head month is a month's use and occupancy of range by 
one animal, except for sheep or goats. A full head month's fee is 
charged for a month of grazing by adult animals; if the grazing animal 
is weaned or 6 months of age or older at the time of entering National 
Forest System lands; or will become 12 months of age during the 
permitted period of use. For fee purposes 5 sheep or goats, weaned or 
adult, are equivalent to one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, or mule.
    (d) No additional charge will be made for the privilege of lambing 
upon National Forest System lands, or other lands under Forest Service 
control.
    (e) Transportation livestock may be charged for at a special rate, 
and at a minimum established for such use. Fees for horses, mules, or 
burros associated with management of permitted livestock on an 
allotment, or for research purposes and administrative studies, and 
authorized on a charge basis, are determined under provisions of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) The fees for trailing livestock across National Forest System 
lands will conform with the rates established for other livestock. Where 
practicable, fees for trailing permitted livestock will be covered in 
the regular grazing fee and the crossing period covered in the regular 
grazing period.
    (g) All fees for livestock grazing or livestock use of National 
Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control are 
payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, entry, or 
livestock use unless otherwise authorized by the Chief, Forest Service.
    (h) Unauthorized grazing use rate will be determined by establishing 
a base value without giving consideration for those contributions 
normally made by the permittee under terms of the grazing permit. The 
base will be adjusted annually by the same indexes used to adjust the 
regular fee. This rate will also apply to excess number of livestock 
grazing by permittees; to livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing 
season; or to livestock grazed under an unvalidated permit.
    (i) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions 
and circumstances as the Chief, Forest Service, may specify.
    (j) The fee year for the purpose of charging grazing fees will be 
March 1 through the following February.
    (k) The data year for the purpose of collecting beef cattle price 
data for computing indexes will be November 1 through the following 
October and apply to the following fee year.

<R05>
Sec. 222.51  National Forests in 16 Western States.

    (a) Grazing fees are established on lands designated National 
Forests and Land Utilization Projects in the 16 contiguous Western 
States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South 
Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. (National Grasslands are 
excluded, see Sec. 222.52.)
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 222.50, paragraph (b), 
the calculated

[[Page 95]]

grazing fee for 1988 and subsequent grazing fee years represents the 
economic value of the use of the land to the user and is the product of 
multiplying the base fair market value of $1.23 by the result of the 
annual Forage Value Index, added to the sum of the Beef Cattle Price 
Index minus the Prices Paid Index and divided by 100; provided, that the 
annual increase or decrease in such fee for any given year shall be 
limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the previous year's 
fee, and provided further, that the fee shall not be less than $1.35 per 
head per month. The indexes used in this formula are as follows:
    (1) Forage Value Index means the weighted average estimate of the 
annual rental charge per head per month for pasturing cattle on private 
rangelands in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and 
Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) from 
the June Enumerative Survey) divided by $3.65 per head month and 
multiplied by 100;
    (2) Beef Cattle Price Index means the weighted average annual 
selling price for beef cattle (excluding calves) in the 11 Western 
States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, 
Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National 
Agricultural Statistics Service) for November through October (computed 
by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) divided by $22.04 per 
hundred weight and multiplied by 100; and
    (3) Prices Paid Index means the following selected components from 
the National Agricultural Statistics Service ``Annual National Index of 
Prices Paid by Farmers for Goods and Services'' adjusted by the weights 
indicated in parentheses to reflect livestock production costs in the 
Western States:

1. Fuels and Energy (14.5);
2. Farm and Motor Supplies (12.0);
3. Autos and Trucks (4.5);
4. Tractors and Self-Propelled Machinery (4.5);
5. Other Machinery (12.0);
6. Building and Fencing Materials (14.5);
7. Interest (6.0);
8. Farm Wage Rates (14.0);
9. Farm Services (18.0).

<R05>
Sec. 222.53  Grazing fees in the East--noncompetitive procedures.

    (a) Scope. Except as provided in Sec. 222.54 of this subpart, the 
fee charged for commercial livestock grazing use and occupancy on 
National Forest System (NFS) lands in the States of New York, Missouri, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and in the Southern Region shall be determined 
through noncompetitive, fair market value procedures. These rules do not 
apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or 
National Grasslands in Texas. Grazing permits under the noncompetitive 
fee method in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit 
administration in Subpart A of this part.
    (b) Applicability. The rules of this section apply to the 
establishment of grazing fees for existing permittees in the Eastern and 
Southern Regions on National Forest System lands, including grazing 
associations in New York and Missouri as of March 1, 1990, to any 
livestock on-and-off permits defined in Subpart A of this part; and to 
any allotments advertised for competitive bidding which were not bid on 
(Sec. 222.54(h)). Noncompetitive permits vacated or terminated by an 
existing permittee and any new allotments created after the effective 
date of this rule shall be offered on a competitive bid basis as 
specified in Sec. 222.54 of this subpart. As provided in subpart A of 
this part, holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a 
new permit.
    (c) Fee System. The grazing fee charged under this section shall be 
based on fair market value, as determined by: Using comparable private 
grazing lease rates, adjusted for the difference in the costs of grazing 
comparable private leased lands and National Forest System lands, or by 
reference to prevailing prices in competitive markets for other Federal 
or State

[[Page 96]]

leased grazing lands that are the same or substantially similar to 
grazing lands offered or administered by the Forest Service in the East 
with comparability adjustments as appropriate. Comparable grazing lease 
rates shall be adjusted for the difference between the total costs of 
operating on leased grazing lands and the total costs (other than 
grazing fee costs) of operating on National Forest System lands.
    (1) Establishing Base Grazing Value. (i) The Chief of the Forest 
Service, or an authorized officer to whom such authority has been 
delegated, shall determine an estimated base market value of grazing use 
and occupancy on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States for 
the following designated subregions:
    (A) Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio);
    (B) Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);
    (C) Northeast (Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and 
Vermont);
    (D) Appalachia (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and 
West Virginia);
    (E) Southeast/Delta (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); and
    (F) Florida.
    (ii) The Chief or authorized officer shall revise or update 
estimated market values of grazing use and occupancy, as necessary to 
respond to significant changes in the agricultural economy in the East, 
and to ensure that fees represent fair market value.
    (iii) The Chief, or an authorized officer to whom authority has been 
delegated, where sufficient market data exist, may establish the base 
grazing value for grazing allotments using comparable, local lease rates 
for private grazing lands.
    (2) Annual Adjustment of Base Grazing Value. To maintain currency 
with the private grazing lease market, the respective base grazing 
value(s) established for grazing permits under this section shall be 
annually adjusted through a hay price index, by respective subregion. 
The hay price index means the weighted average selling price of ``other 
baled hay,'' computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by designated State and subregion. 
This index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually 
reflect the percentage change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
    (3) Computation of Annual Grazing Fee--(i) Annual Fee Basis. The 
annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the 
current period's hay price index, less the value of any agency required 
range improvements.
    (ii) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements 
for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be 
identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing 
permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the 
annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range 
improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee 
to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management 
direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource 
management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must 
involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the 
grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance 
management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, 
riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, 
or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements 
specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing 
permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course 
of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
    (4) Implementation. The grazing fee formula provided by this section 
shall be used to calculate fees for the 1990 grazing fee year. Where 
implementation would raise fees, the increase shall be phased in over a 
5-year period. Full fair market value will be reached in 5 years, 
beginning in 1990.

<R05>
Sec. 222.54  Grazing fees in the East--competitive bidding.

    (a) General Procedures--(1) Applicability. The rules of this section 
apply to

[[Page 97]]

grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on National Forest 
System lands in the Eastern or Southern Regions, as of February 26, 1990 
as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments for such lands that 
have already been established under competitive procedures as of the 
date of this rule. Permits offered for competitive bidding in the East 
are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in 
subpart A of this part. The rules of this section do not apply to 
negotiated livestock use permits or permits with on-and-off grazing 
provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. Holders of term 
permits have first priority for receipt of a new term grazing permit in 
accordance with subpart A of this part. These rules also do not apply to 
grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National 
Grasslands in Texas.
    (2) Allowable Bidders. Bids for grazing permits shall be accepted 
from individuals, partnerships, grazing associations (formed after 
February 26, 1990), joint ventures, corporations, and organizations.
    (b) Establishment of Minimum Bid Price. Authorized officers shall 
establish a minimum bid price for each available allotment as described 
in Sec. 222.53 of this subpart.
    (c) Prospectus. (1) At such time as allotments are vacated, as new 
allotments are established, or as existing competitively bid permits 
expire, the authorized officer shall prepare and advertise a prospectus 
for those allotments on which grazing will be permitted.
    (2) The prospectus shall include the terms and conditions of 
occupancy and use under the grazing permit to be issued, as well as 
document existing improvements and their condition. The prospectus shall 
also disclose the following:
    (i) Estimated market value of the forage per head month of grazing 
use;
    (ii) The minimum bid price the agency will accept;
    (iii) Any required range improvements; and
    (iv) The minimum qualifications that applicants must meet to be 
eligible for a permit.
    (3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, allotment management 
planning documents and allotment maintenance requirements, and the 
latest annual permittee instructions shall be made available to all 
prospective bidders upon request.
    (d) Submission of bid. Each applicant shall submit an application 
for the grazing permit, along with a sealed bid for the grazing fee, and 
a bid deposit of 10 percent of the total amount of the bid.
    (e) Qualifications and Deposit Refunds. Upon opening applicants 
bids, the authorized officer shall determine whether each bidder meets 
the qualifications to hold a permit as set forth in Subpart A of this 
part; and shall refund the deposit to any applicant who is not qualified 
or who does not offer the high bid.
    (f) Permit Issuance. The authorized officer shall issue the grazing 
permit to the qualified high bidder, except as provided in paragraphs 
(f)(1) and (2) of this section. The successful bidder receives the 
privilege of obtaining or renewing a grazing permit and is billed for 
the occupancy offered and forage sold.
    (1) Priority for Reissuance. On allotments where a current permit is 
expiring and competition has been held on a new grazing permit, the 
current grazing permittee shall have priority for retaining the permit. 
Accordingly, an applicant who holds the permit on the allotment under 
bid, who has a satisfactory record of performance under that permit, and 
who is not the higher bidder for the future grazing privileges in the 
specified allotment shall be offered the opportunity to match the high 
bid and thereby retain the permit. Should there be more than one 
existing permittee in the allotment under bid, each shall be offered the 
option of meeting the high bid; if only one current permittee opts to 
meet the high bid, the remaining allowable grazing use, if any, shall be 
awarded to the initial high bidder.
    (2) Identical Bids. In cases of identical bids, the selection of the 
successful applicant shall be made through a drawing.
    (g) Computation of Successful Bidder's Annual Fee--(1) Annual Fee 
Basis. The highest bid received shall establish the

[[Page 98]]

base grazing value in the initial year of the grazing permit for each 
allotment offered. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing 
value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index for the relevant 
subregion as described in Sec. 222.53(c)(1), and (c)(3), less the value 
of any agency required range improvements. This hay price index shall be 
based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percent 
change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
    (2) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for 
permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be 
identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing 
permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the 
annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range 
improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee 
to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management 
direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource 
management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must 
involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the 
grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance 
management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, 
riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, 
or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements 
specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing 
permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course 
of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
    (h) No Bids Received. If qualified sealed bids are not received, the 
authorized officer reserves the right to conduct an oral auction using 
the minimum bid price established under paragraph (b) of this section or 
to establish grazing fees through noncompetitive grazing fee procedures 
specified in Sec. 222.53 of this subpart.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 223.1  Authority to sell timber.

    Trees, portions of trees, and other forest products on National 
Forest System lands may be sold for the purpose of achieving the 
policies set forth in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, as 
amended (74 Stat. 215; 16 U.S.C. 528-531), and the Forest and Rangeland 
Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended (88 Stat. 476; as 
amended, 16 U.S.C. 1600-1614), and the Program thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 223.2  Disposal of timber for administrative use.

    Trees, portions of trees, or other forest products in any amount on 
National Forest System lands may be disposed of for administrative use, 
by sale or without charge, as may be most advantageous to the United 
States, subject to the maximum cut fixed in accordance with established 
policies for management of the National Forests. Such administrative use 
shall be limited to the following conditions and purposes:
    (a) For construction, maintenance or repair of roads, bridges, 
trails, telephone lines, fences, recreation areas or other improvements 
of value for the protection or the administration of Federal lands.
    (b) For fuel in Federal camps, buildings and recreation areas.
    (c) For research and demonstration projects.
    (d) For use in disaster relief work conducted by public agencies.
    (e) For disposal when removal is desirable to protect or enhance 
multiple-use values in a particular area.


<R05>
Sec. 223.3  Sale of seized material.

    Seized material (trees, portions of trees or other forest products 
cut in trespass from National Forest System lands) may be sold to the 
highest bidder under specific authorization from the Regional Forester. 
If advertisement is impractical, sales of material with an appraised 
value of less than $10,000 will be made on informal bids.


<R05>
Sec. 223.4  Exchange of trees or portions of trees.

    Trees or portions of trees may be exchanged for land under laws 
authorizing the exchange of National Forest timber. Cutting of exchange 
timber must comply with the purposes cited in Sec. 223.1.

(42 Stat. 465, 16 U.S.C 485; 43 Stat. 1215, 16 U.S.C. 516)


<R05>
Sec. 223.5  Scope of free use granted to individuals.

    (a) Free use may be granted to individuals for firewood for personal 
use, except that such use may be limited to bona fide settlers, miners, 
residents and prospectors living within or immediately adjacent to the 
National Forest when the available supply is insufficient to meet the 
total demand. Free use may be granted to such bona fide settlers, 
miners, residents and prospectors for minerals, for fencing, building, 
mining, prospecting and domestic purposes.

(Sec. 1, 30 Stat. 35, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 477, 551)
    (b) Free use will be granted individuals primarily to aid in the 
protection and silvicultural improvement of the forests. Except in 
unusual cases, the material will be restricted to dead, insect-infested, 
or diseased timber, logging debris, and thinnings. Other material may be 
granted in unusual cases where its refusal would cause unwarranted 
hardship. Where limited supply or other conditions justify such action, 
the free use of green material may be refused.


<R05>
Sec. 223.6  Cutting and removal of timber in free-use areas.

    Supervisors may designate portions or all of a National Forest as 
free-use areas where such action is compatible with land management 
plans and shall give public notice of their action. Within such free-use 
areas, any dead timber or any green timber previously marked or 
designated by forest officers

[[Page 101]]

may be cut and removed for personal use for domestic purposes. Cutting 
and removal of timber in free-use areas shall be in accordance with such 
rules as may be prescribed by the district ranger to prevent fires, 
minimize damage to uncut trees and other resources, and to avoid 
confusion among users.

[42 FR 28252, June 2, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 73029, Dec. 17, 1979. 
Redesignated at 49 FR 2760, Jan. 23, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 223.7  Permission for free use of timber outside free-use areas.

    Similar material may be cut outside of a free-use area without 
permit in cases of emergency, but the person taking such material shall 
promptly notify the district ranger. Small quantities of material needed 
by transients while in the forest may also be taken without permit; 
subject to such rules as may be prescribed pursuant to Sec. 261.70. In 
all other cases permits will be required for green material.


<R05>
Sec. 223.8  Delegations of authority to approve free use by individuals.

    (a) Forest officers whom the supervisor may designate are authorized 
to grant free use of timber to individuals up to $20 in value in any one 
fiscal year. Supervisors may grant permits for material not exceeding 
$100 in value. Regional Foresters may approve permits for larger 
amounts, and in times of emergency may delegate authority to supervisors 
for not over $500 in value. Prior review by the Chief of the Forest 
Service will be given if the amount involved exceeds $5,000 in value.
    (b) Regional Foresters may authorize supervisors to permit the 
removal of specific classes of material without scaling or measurement.


<R05>
Sec. 223.9  Free use to owners of certain mining claims.

    Free use will be granted to an owner of a mining claim located 
subsequent to July 23, 1955, or of a mining claim which is otherwise 
subject to Section 4 of the Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367), if at 
any time said claim owner requires more timber for his mining 
operations, in connection with that claim, than is available on that 
claim because of Forest Service timber disposal therefrom subsequent to 
location of that claim. He will be granted, free of charge, timber from 
the nearest National Forest land which is ready for harvesting under the 
applicable management plan, substantially equivalent in kind and 
quantity to that estimated by the Forest Service to have been cut under 
Forest Service authorization from the claim subsequent to its location, 
Forest officers may be delegated authority to grant amounts of timber 
not in excess of those which these officers are authorized to sell in 
commercial sales.

(Sec. 4, 69 Stat. 368, 16 U.S.C. 612)


<R05>
Sec. 223.10  Free use to Alaskan settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors.

    Bona fide settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors for minerals 
in Alaska may take free of charge green or dried timber from the 
National Forests in Alaska for personal use but not for sale. Permits 
will be required for green saw timber. Other material may be taken 
without permit. The amount of material granted to any one person in 1 
year shall not exceed 10,000 board feet of saw timber and 25 cords of 
wood, or an equivalent volume in other forms. Persons obtaining 
materials shall, on demand, forward to the supervisor a statement of the 
quantity taken and the location from which it was removed.

(Sec. 1, 30 Stat. 35, 16 U.S.C. 477)


<R05>
Sec. 223.11  Free use to other Federal agencies.

    (a) National Forest timber will be granted free of charge to other 
branches of the Federal Government when authorized by law. Permits may 
be approved by forest officers for amounts not greater than they are 
otherwise authorized to sell.
    (b) Permits for timber issued hereunder shall be in accordance with 
the conditions prescribed in Sec. 223.30. The permittee may be required 
to report to the supervisor the amount of timber, by species, actually 
cut or may be required to furnish scalers for work under the direction 
of the forest officers in charge or, if authorized, to provide funds for 
the employment by the Forest Service of scalers to scale or

[[Page 102]]

measure the timber cut. The permittee may be required to dispose of the 
slash as cutting proceeds, or to employee people to work under the 
direction of a forest officer in disposing of the slash, or, if 
authorized, to provide funds for the employment of people for slash 
disposal under the direction of a forest officer.

(38 Stat. 1100, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 492)


<R05>
Sec. 223.12  Permission to cut, damage, or destroy trees without advertisement.

    Permission may be granted to cut, damage, or destroy trees, portions 
of trees, or other forest products on National Forest System lands 
without advertisement when necessary for the occupancy of a right-of-way 
or other authorized use of National Forest System land. Payment for 
timber of merchantable size and quality will be required at its 
appraised value, but at not less than applicable minimum prices 
established by Regional Foresters, and payment will be required for 
young growth timber below merchantable size at its damage appraisal 
value. Payment will not be required:
    (a) For timber necessarily killed or cut in connection with land 
uses which are of substantial benefit to the National Forests;
    (b) For timber necessarily killed or cut and used by the permittee 
which would have been granted free under other applicable regulations; 
or
    (c) For timber which will be cut by the permittee which the Forest 
Service retains for sale in log or other product form.

(Sec. 1, 30 Stat. 35, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 551)


<R05>
Sec. 223.13  Compliance.

    Forest officers authorizing free use shall ensure that such use is 
in compliance with applicable land management plans and is conducted in 
a manner which protects National Forest System resource values.

(92 Stat. 1301, Pub. L. 95-465)


<R05>
Sec. 223.14  Where timber may be cut.

    (a) The cutting of trees, portions of trees or other forest products 
may be authorized on any National Forest System lands, except for:
    (1) Timber reserved by a grantor of land, during the life of such 
reservation.
    (2) Timber reserved from cutting under other regulations.
    (3) Timber on unpatented mining claims located prior to July 23, 
1955, unless the claimant has executed a waiver pursuant to section 6 of 
the Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367), or unless pursuant to a 
proceeding under Section 5 of that Act, the claimant has failed to file 
a verified statement or has failed to establish the validity and 
effectiveness of his asserted rights.
    (4) Timber on lands identified in land management plans as not 
suited for timber production, except that salvage sales or sales 
necessitated to protect other multiple-use values may be made.
    (b) The cutting of timber on mining claims shall be conducted in 
such manner as not to endanger or materially interfere with prospecting, 
mining or processing operations.
    (c) Timber on an unpatented claim to which the United States does 
not otherwise have disposal rights may be disposed of with the written 
consent of the claimant, or, in emergencies without the consent of the 
claimant.
    (d) Timber on an unpatented claim may be cut by the claimant only 
for the actual development of the claim or for uses consistent with the 
purposes for which the claim was entered. Any severance or removal of 
timber, other than severance or removal to provide clearance, shall be 
in accordance with plan of operations required by Part 252 of this 
chapter, and with sound principles of forest management.
    (e) With prior approval by the Regional Forester, timber on lands 
under option by the United States or on offered lands included in an 
approved land exchange agreement may be sold. Before the sale is made, a 
cooperative agreement must be made with the owner of the land 
authorizing the Forest Service to conduct the sale and providing for 
return of stumpage receipts to the owner if title to the land is not 
accepted by the United States.
    (f) With prior approval by the Regional Forester, cutting of 
exchange timber described in Sec. 223.4 may be authorized in advance of 
the acceptance

[[Page 103]]

of title to the non-Federal land offered in exchange.

                    Subpart B--Timber Sale Contracts

                   Contract Conditions and Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 223.30  Consistency with plans, environmental standards, and other management requirements.

    The approving officer will insure that each timber sale contract, 
permit or other authorized form of National Forest timber disposal is 
consistent with applicable land and resource management plans and 
environmental quality standards and includes, as appropriate, 
requirements for:
    (a) Fire protection and suppression;
    (b) Protection of residual timber;
    (c) Regeneration of timber as may be made necessary by harvesting 
operations;
    (d) Minimizing increases in soil erosion;
    (e) Providing favorable conditions of water flow and quality;
    (f) Utilization of the timber resource to provide for the optimum 
practical use of the wood material as may be obtained with available 
technology, considering opportunities to promote more efficient wood 
utilization, regional conditions and species characteristics;
    (g) Reduction of the likelihood of loss to destructive agencies; and
    (h) Minimizing adverse effects on, or providing protection for and 
enhancing other National Forest resources, uses and improvements.


<R05>
Sec. 223.31  Duration of contracts.

    Sale contracts shall not exceed 10 years in duration, unless there 
is a finding by the Chief, Forest Service, that better utilization of 
the various forest resources (consistent with the provisions of the 
Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960) will result.


<R05>
Sec. 223.32  Timber sale operating plan.

    Sale contracts with a term of 2 years or more shall provide for the 
filing of an operating plan as soon as practicable after execution of 
the contract, such plan shall be a part of the contract. The plan of 
operation shall be general in nature, outlining the expected timing and 
order of sale development, including such major operations as road 
construction, felling and removal of timber, distribution of timber, and 
contractual requirements for erosion prevention and slash disposal. The 
plan of operation and revisions thereto shall be subject to concurrence 
by the Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 223.33  Redetermination of stumpage rates and deposits.

    Sale contracts exceeding 7 years in duration, and those of shorter 
duration to the extent found desirable by the approving officer, will 
provide for the redetermination of rates for stumpage and for required 
deposits at intervals of not more than 5 years, exclusive of any period 
allowed for the construction of improvements.


<R05>
Sec. 223.34  Advance payment.

    Sale contracts shall provide that timber and forest products be paid 
for in advance of cutting, unless the contract authorizes the purchaser 
to furnish a payment guarantee satisfactory to the Forest Service. 
Advance payments found to be in excess of amounts due the United States 
shall be refunded to the current holder of the contract or to successors 
in interest. (90 Stat. 2959; 16 U.S.C. 472a.)

[43 FR 38008, Aug. 25, 1978. Redesignated at 49 FR 2761, Jan. 23, 1984]

Sec. 223.35  Performance bond.

    Timber sale contracts may require the purchaser to furnish a 
performance bond for satisfactory compliance with its terms.


<R05>
Sec. 223.36  Volume determination.

    (a) Timber sale contracts may provide for volume determination by 
scaling, measuring, weighing, or counting the logs or other products, or 
by measuring the trees before cutting. If the contract or permit 
provides for the determination of volume by tree measurement and the 
timber has been paid for, the marking or otherwise designating of the 
tree authorizes cutting and removal. Otherwise no timber cut under any 
contract shall be removed from the place designated until it has been 
scaled, measured or counted as provided in the timber sale contract,

[[Page 104]]

unless such removal is specifically authorized in the contract.
    (b) National Forest timber sold on board foot scale shall be scaled 
by the Scribner Decimal C Log Rule, or if the advertisement and contract 
or permit so state, by the International \1/4\-inch log rule or by the 
International \1/4\-inch Decimal log rule. National Forest timber may 
also be sold by the cubic volume rule or by cords, each as used by the 
Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 223.37  Revegetation of temporary roads.

    Timber sale contracts, permits and other documents authorizing the 
cutting or removal of timber or forest products shall require the 
purchaser to treat temporary roads constructed or used thereunder so as 
to permit the reestablishment by artificial or natural means, or 
vegetative cover on the roadway and areas where the vegetative cover was 
disturbed by the construction or use of the road, as necessary to 
minimize erosion from the disturbed area. Such treatment shall be 
designed to reestablish vegetative cover as soon as practicable, but at 
least within 10 years after the termination of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 223.38  Standards for road design and construction.

    Road construction authorized under timber sale contracts, permits 
and other documents authorizing the cutting or removal of timber or 
forest products shall be designed to standards appropriate for the 
intended uses, considering safety, cost of transportation, and impacts 
on land and resources. If the sale contract provides for road design 
standards in excess of those needed for the harvest and removal of 
timber from that sale, including measures to protect adjacent resource 
values, provision shall be made in the contract for compensating the 
purchaser for the additional costs, unless the purchaser elects 
Government construction under section 14(i) of the National Forest 
Management Act of 1976.


<R05>
Sec. 223.39  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 223.40  Cancellation for environmental protection or inconsistency with plans.

    Timber sale contracts, permits, and other such instruments, 
authorizing the harvesting of trees or other forest products, with terms 
of longer than 2 years, shall provide for cancellation in order to 
prevent serious environmental damage or when they are significantly 
inconsistent with land management plans adopted or revised in accordance 
with section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning 
Act of 1974, as amended. Such provision shall provide for reasonable 
compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered costs incurred under the 
contract and for the difference between the current contract value and 
the average value of comparable National Forest timber sold during the 
preceding 6-month period.


<R05>
Sec. 223.41  Payment when purchaser elects government road construction.

    Each contract having a provision for construction of specified roads 
with total estimated construction cost in excess of $20,000 will include 
a provision to ensure that if the purchaser elects Government road 
construction, he pays for the timber an amount no less than the sum of 
estimated road construction cost and base rate value, as defined in 
Sec. 223.61.


<R05>
Sec. 223.42  Transfer of effective purchaser credits.

    The Forest Service may permit transfer of unused effective purchaser 
credit earned after December 16, 1975, from one timber sale account to 
another timber sale account of the same purchaser within the same 
National Forest, provided the sale contracts provide procedures for the 
use of purchaser credit. Approval for transfer shall not be granted for 
amounts needed to satisfy unfulfilled payment obligations or claims for 
damages due the United States. Purchaser credit transferred under this 
paragraph is subject

[[Page 105]]

to such additional restrictions as may be necessary for its orderly use.

<R05>
Sec. 223.43  Limitation on amounts of transferred purchaser credit.

    (a) The amount of purchaser credit which may be transferred into a 
given sale shall be limited to the difference between remaining current 
contract value and the total of:
    (1) Remaining base rate value needs,
    (2) Salvage sale fund needs plus sale area improvement needs in 
excess of base rate value needs, and
    (3) Total purchaser credit limit on the given sale.
    (b) This calculation shall be made as of the date of sale award for 
sales made on or after January 1, 1978. For sales made prior to January

that if the amount actually transferred in as of December 31, 1977, 
exceeds the calculated limit, the actual transfers as of that date shall 
be the established limit. Purchaser credit earned on a sale and 
subsequently transferred out may be replaced without regard to the 
transfer in limit. Sale area improvement needs shall be based on the 
original sale area betterment plan or revisions thereto approved prior 
to July 1, 1976. Salvage sale fund needs shall be based on the original 
salvage sale fund plan.

Sec. 223.44  Collection rights on contracts involved in transfer of purchase credit.

    To assure protection of the United States in connection with the 
implementation of this regulation, contract provisions shall not prevent 
the Forest Service from carrying out collection rights, authorized by 
the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 309), between 
contracts involved in the transfer of purchaser credit. Such claims 
against the contract receiving the transferred purchaser credit shall be 
limited to the amount transferred.

Sec. 223.45  Definitions applicable to transfer of purchaser credit.

    As used in Secs. 223.42 and 223.43, the term Purchaser includes any 
single individual, corporation, company, firm, partnership, joint 
venture, or other business entity or the successor in interest of any of 
the foregoing business entities having timber sale contracts on the same 
National Forest. The term National Forest shall be considered as a unit 
of the National Forest System, regardless of how it was established, 
which maintains a separate identity with respect to the distribution of 
receipts earned thereon to the States and counties. The term Effective 
Purchaser Credit means unused purchaser credit which does not exceed 
current contract value minus base rate value. The term base rate value 
is the sum of the products of base rates and estimated remaining 
unscaled (unreported on tree measurement contracts) volumes by species 
of timber included in a timber sale contract.

Sec. 223.46  Adjustment of contract termination date.

    Timber sale contracts may provide for adjustment of the termination 
date to provide additional time to compensate for delays in road 
construction and timber removal due to those causes beyond the 
purchaser's control, which may include but are not limited to acts of 
God, acts of the public enemy, acts of the Government, labor disputes, 
fires, insurrections or floods.


<R05>
Sec. 223.47  Date of completion of permanent road construction.

    (a) The date of completion of permanent road construction 
obligations as set forth in the Notice of Sale shall be incorporated 
into the timber sale contract.

[[Page 106]]

    (b) This date is applicable to construction by both the Forest 
Service and the timber purchaser.
    (c) The date is not applicable to roads not needed by the purchaser 
for timber removal.
    (d) The date for completion may be revised, if additional time is 
needed, under guidelines provided by the Chief, Forest Service, 
including but not limited to (1) default of contractors or (2) design 
changes, physical changes, or catastrophic damages which necessitate 
modification of specified road construction work.
    (e) If Forest Service failure to perform results in delay in road 
completion, the termination date shall be adjusted in accordance with 
the contract term adjustment provisions of the timber sale contract. If 
there is substantial delay in performance by the Forest Service, the 
contract shall provide that rates of payment may be redetermined, at the 
request of the purchaser, in accordance with guidelines established by 
the Chief, Forest Service.
    (f) If the purchaser retains responsibility for road construction, 
the date of completion for permanent roads may be modified to conform to 
the approved plan of operation.

Sec. 223.48  Restrictions on export and substitution of unprocessed timber.

    (a) Contracts for the sale of unprocessed timber from National 
Forest System lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 
48 States and Alaska, awarded before August 20, 1990, shall include 
provisions implementing the Secretary's timber export and substitution 
regulations at subpart D of this part in effect prior to that data. Such 
contracts shall also require purchasers to:
    (1) Submit annually, until all unprocessed timber is accounted for, 
a certified report on the disposition of any unprocessed timber 
harvested from the sale including a description of unprocessed timber 
which is sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of to another person and 
a description of the relationship with the other person;
    (2) Submit annually, until all unprocessed timber from the sale is 
accounted for, a certified report on the sale of any unprocessed timber 
from private lands in the tributary area which is exported or sold for 
export; and
    (3) Maintain records of all such transactions involving unprocessed 
timber and to make such records available for inspection and 
verification by the Forest Service for up to three (3) years after the 
sale is terminated.
    (b) Contracts for the sale of unprocessed timber from National 
Forest System lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 
48 States, awarded on or after August 20, 1990, shall include provisions 
implementing the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 et seq.).
    (c) The reporting and recordkeeping procedures in this section 
constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 
1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0021.

<R05>
Sec. 223.49  Downpayment.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, the terms listed in this 
paragraph shall have the following meaning:
    (1) Total bid value is the sum of the products obtained by 
multiplying the rate the purchaser bid for each species by the estimated 
volume listed in the contract.
    (2) Ineffective purchaser credit is that portion of the credit 
earned, pursuant to a specific Forest Service timber sale contract for 
construction of specified roads, or for other purposes in such contract, 
that exceeds the current contract value, minus base rate value as 
defined in that contract and, thus, is an amount that cannot be applied 
toward stumpage charges.
    (3) Bid premium is the amount in excess of the advertised value that 
a purchaser bids for timber offered.
    (4) Lump sum timber sales are premeasured sales where the entire 
value of the sale is paid in one payment at time of release for cutting.
    (5) Affiliate. Concerns or individuals are affiliates if directly or 
indirectly, either one controls or has the power to control the other, 
or a third party controls or has the power to control both. In 
determining whether or not affiliation exists, the Forest Service shall

[[Page 107]]

consider all appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, common 
ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.
    (b) Timber sale contracts shall include provisions that require 
purchasers to make a downpayment in cash or by application of earned 
effective purchaser credit at the time a timber sale contract is 
executed.
    (c) The minimum downpayment shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the 
total advertised value of each sale, plus 20 percent of the bid premium, 
except in those geographic areas where the Chief of the Forest Service 
determines that it is necessary to increase the amount of the 
downpayment in order to deter speculation. To determine the amount of 
the downpayment due on a sale where the timber is measured in units 
other than board feet, the Forest Service shall convert the measure to 
board feet, using appropriate conversion factors with any necessary 
adjustment.
    (d) On scaled sales, a purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited 
as a downpayment to cover other obligations due on that sale until 
stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the 
sale has been charged and paid for. On tree measurement sales, a 
purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to cover 
other obligations due on that sale until stumpage value representing 25 
percent of the total bid value of the sale is shown on the timber sale 
statement of account to have been cut, removed, and paid for. For lump 
sum sales, the downpayment amount may be applied to payment for release 
of the single payment unit.
    (e) A purchaser or any affiliate of that purchaser, awarded a Forest 
Service timber sale contract must meet the additional downpayment 
requirements of paragraph (g) of this section under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) The purchaser or its affiliate after September 29, 1988 has 
failed to perform in accordance with the terms of a Forest Service or 
Bureau of Land Management timber sale contract which results in 
notification by a Contracting Officer that a contract has expired 
uncompleted or is terminated for cause; and
    (2) The estimated value of the unscaled timber on scaled sales, or 
the estimated value of the timber outstanding on tree measurement sales, 
included in those terminated or expired contracts exceeds $100,000, and
    (3) Unpaid damages claimed by the Government remain outstanding 
prior to award of the new sale at issue and corrective action has not 
been taken to avoid future deficient performance.
    (f) A subsequent final determination by the Contracting Officer or 
by a court of competent jurisdiction that a contract was improperly 
classified under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will 
result in the refund or credit of any unobligated portion of the amount 
of downpayment exceeding that required by paragraphs (c) and (d) and the 
limitations of paragraph (h) on application of downpayment shall no 
longer apply.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, a purchaser meeting the criteria of paragraph (e) of this 
section must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total 
advertised value of that sale, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. 
This higher downpayment requirement applies throughout the National 
Forest System, except in those areas where the Chief of the Forest 
Service determines, before advertisement of the sale, that another 
downpayment rate is necessary to achieve the management objectives of 
the National Forest System.
    (1) In calculating bid premiums for the downpayment requirement, the 
Forest Service shall not include the portion of the bid premium that 
offsets ineffective purchaser credit.
    (2) To determine the amount of the downpayment due on a sale where 
the timber is measured in units other than board feet, the Forest 
Service shall convert the measure to board feet, using appropriate 
conversion factors with any necessary adjustments.
    (h) A purchaser subject to the additional downpayment requirements 
of paragraph (g) of this section cannot apply the amount deposited as a 
downpayment to other uses until:
    (1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is 
equal to

[[Page 108]]

or less than the amount of the downpayment; or
    (2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value remaining to be 
cut and removed as shown on the timber sale statement of account is 
equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment.
    (i) For the purpose of releasing funds deposited as downpayment by a 
purchaser subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the Forest Service 
shall compute the estimated value of timber as follows:
    (1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is 
the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract 
rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume 
and the volume that has been scaled of that species.
    (2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value of the timber 
outstanding (that not shown on the timber sale statement of account as 
cut and removed) is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the 
current contract rate for each species by the difference between the 
advertised volume and the volume that has been shown on the timber sale 
statement to have been cut and removed of the species. The current 
contract rate for each species is that specified in each Forest Service 
timber sale contract.
    (j) In order to deter speculation, the Chief of the Forest Service 
may increase the period for retention of the downpayment for future 
contracts subject to such criteria as the Chief may adopt after giving 
the public notice and opportunity to comment.

<R05>
Sec. 223.50  Periodic payments.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the 
meaning given:
    (1) Total contract value is the product of the estimated volume of 
the sale multiplied by the rates bid by the purchaser. Total contract 
value excludes required deposits and is determined at bid date.
    (2) Current contract value is the sum of the products of the current 
contract rates and, in a scaled sale, estimated remaining unscaled 
volume or, in a tree measurement sale, the estimated remaining 
quantities by species of included timber meeting utilization standards.
    (3) Normal operating season is the period so specified in a timber 
sale contract.
    (4) Periodic payment(s) is/are amount(s) specified in a timber sale 
contract that a purchaser must pay by the periodic payment determination 
date(s) unless reduced by amounts paid as stumpage for volume removed.
    (5) A periodic payment determination date is a date specified in a 
timber sale contract upon which the Forest Service will compare the 
payments made by the timber sale purchaser for timber charges 
(stumpage), exclusive of required deposits, with the periodic payment 
amount required as of that date in the contract.
    (b) Except for lump sum sales, each timber sale contract of more 
than one full normal operating season shall provide for periodic 
payments. The number of periodic payments required will be dependent 
upon the number of normal operating seasons within the contract, but 
shall not exceed two such payments during the course of the contract. 
Periodic payments must be made by the periodic payment determination 
date, except that the amount of the periodic payment shall be reduced to 
the extent that timber has been removed and paid for by the periodic 
payment determination date. Should the payment fall due on a date other 
than normal billing dates, the contract shall provide that the payment 
date will be extended to coincide with the next timber sale statement of 
account billing date.
    (1) At a minimum, each such contract shall require an initial 
periodic payment at the midpoint between the specified road completion 
date and the termination date. If there is no road construction 
requirement, payment shall be due at the midpoint between award date and 
the termination date.
    (2) Contracts exceeding 2 full operating seasons shall require an 
additional periodic payment to be due no later than the midpoint of the 
last normal operating season or 12 months from the initial periodic 
payment whichever date is first.

[[Page 109]]

    (c) Each timber sale contract shall require the initial periodic 
payment to equal 35 percent of the total contract value or 50 percent of 
the bid premium, whichever is greater. The amount of this periodic 
payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's 
credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
    (d) Where an additional periodic payment is required by the timber 
sale contract, this payment will equal 75 percent of the total contract 
value. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the 
payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber 
charges exceeding the current contract value.
    (e) Periodic payment determination dates that have not been reached 
shall be adjusted when contract term adjustments are granted under 36 
CFR 223.46 or market-related contract term additions are granted under 
36 CFR 223.52. Periodic payment determination dates shall not be 
adjusted when contract term extension is granted under the general 
authority of 36 CFR 223.115.
    (f) In accordance with 36 CFR 223.52(a), no contract executed before 
July 31, 1991, shall be modified to allow for market-related contract 
term additions unless the purchaser makes a written request to the 
Contracting Officer by December 1, 1991, for a simultaneous modification 
implementing the periodic payment requirements of this section. The 
midpoint payment clause in contracts executed before July 31, 1991, is 
not the ``periodic payment requirement'' mandated by 36 CFR 223.52(a).

Sec. 223.51  Bid monitoring.

    Each Regional Forester shall monitor bidding patterns on timber 
sales to determine if speculative bidding is occurring or if Purchasers 
are bidding in such a way that they would be unable to perform their 
obligations under the timber sale contract. A Regional Forester shall 
propose to the Chief changes in servicewide timber sale procedures, as 
they appear necessary, to discourage speculative bidding.

Sec. 223.52  Market-related contract term additions.

    (a) Contract provision. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section, each timber sale contract exceeding 1 year in length 
shall contain a provision for the addition of time to the contract term, 
under the following conditions:
    (i) The Chief of the Forest Service has determined that adverse wood 
products market conditions have resulted in a drastic reduction in wood 
product prices applicable to the sale; and
    (ii) The purchaser makes a written request for additional time to 
perform the contract.
    (2) The contract term addition provision of the contract must 
specify the index to be applied to each sale. The Forest Supervisor 
shall determine, and select from paragraph (b) of this section, the 
index to be used for each sale based on the species and product 
characteristics, by volume, being harvested on the sale. The index 
specified shall represent more than one-half of the advertised volume.
    (3) A market-related contract term addition provision shall not be 
included in contracts where the sale has a primary objective of 
harvesting timber subject to rapid deterioration.
    (b) Determination of drastic wood product price reductions. (1) The 
Forest Service shall monitor and use Producer Price Indices, as prepared 
by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), adjusted 
to a constant dollar base, to determine if market-related contract term 
additions are warranted.
    (i) The Forest Service shall monitor and use only the following 
indices:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Industry

Western Softwood Lumber....................................      2421# 4
Wood Chips.................................................      2421# 5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Preliminary index values will be revised when final index 
values become available, however, determination of a

[[Page 110]]

qualifying quarter will not be revised when final index values become 
available.
    (2) The Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic 
reduction in wood product prices has occurred when, for 2 or more 
consecutive quarters, the applicable adjusted price index is less than 
85 percent of the average of such adjusted index for the 4 highest of 
the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A 
qualifying quarter is a quarter where the applicable adjusted index is 
more than 15 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest 
of the previous 8 calendar quarters. Qualifying quarter determinations 
will be made using the Producer Price Indices for the months of March, 
June, September, and December.
    (3) A determination, made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, 
shall constitute a finding that the substantial overriding public 
interest justifies the contract term addition.
    (c) Granting market-related contract term additions. When the Chief 
of the Forest Service determines, pursuant to this section, that a 
drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, the Forest 
Service is to notify affected timber sale purchasers. For any contract 
which has been awarded and has not been terminated, the Forest Service, 
upon a purchaser's written request, will add 1 year to the contract's 
terms, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this 
section. This 1-year addition includes time outside of the normal 
operating season.
    (1) Additional contract time may not be granted for those portions 
of the contract which have a required completion date or for those 
portions of the contract where the Forest Service determines that the 
timber is in need of urgent removal or that timber deterioration or 
resource damage will result from delay.
    (2) For each additional consecutive quarter, in which a contract 
qualifies for a market-related contract term addition, the Forest 
Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 
months during the normal operating season to the contract.
    (3) No more than twice the original contract length or 3 years, 
whichever is less, shall be added to a contract's term by market-related 
contract term addition.
    (4) In no event shall a revised contract term exceed 10 years as a 
result of market-related contract term additions.
    (d) Recalculation of periodic payments. Where a contract is 
lengthened as a result of market conditions, any subsequent periodic 
payment dates shall be delayed 1 month for each month added to the 
contract's term.

<R05>
Sec. 223.60  Determining fair market value.

    The objective of Forest Service timber appraisals is to determine 
fair market value. Fair market value is estimated by such methods as are 
authorized by the Chief, Forest Service, through issuance of agency 
directives (36 CFR 200.4). Valid methods to determine fair market value 
include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, 
analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates 
based on average investments. Pertinent factors affecting market value 
also considered include, but are not limited to, prices paid and 
valuations established for comparable timber, selling value of products 
produced, estimated operating costs, operating difficulties, and quality 
of timber. Considerations and valuations may recognize and adjust for 
factors which are not normal market influences.

[61 FR 5685, Feb. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 223.61  Establishing minimum stumpage rates.

    The Chief, Forest Service, shall establish minimum stumpage rates, 
i.e., ``base rates,'' for species and products on individual National 
Forests, or groups of National Forests. Timber shall be sold for 
appraised value or minimum stumpage rates, whichever is higher. No 
timber may be sold or cut under timber sale contracts for less than 
minimum stumpage rates except

[[Page 111]]

to provide for the removal of insect-infested, diseased, dead or 
distressed timber or in accordance with contract provisions specifically 
providing for catastrophically-affected timber and incidental amounts of 
material not meeting utilization standards of the timber sale contract. 
For any timber sale offering where deposits are to be required for 
reforestation under the Act of June 9, 1930, as amended (46 Stat. 527; 
16 U.S.C. 576-576b) which exceed the value of the established minimum 
stumpage rates, the minimum rates may be increased by the approving 
officer as necessary to the amount of such required reforestation 
deposits and a minimum deposit to the Treasury. Minimum rates in timber 
sale contracts will not be set higher than established minimum rates for 
purposes other than assuring adequate funds for reforestation.


<R05>
Sec. 223.62  Timber purchaser road construction credit.

    Appraisal may also establish stumpage value as if unconstructed 
roads or other developments needed by the purchaser for removal of the 
timber were in place. When timber is appraised and sold on such basis, 
purchaser credit for road construction, not to exceed the estimated 
construction cost of such roads or other developments specified in the 
timber sale contract, shall, when such construction is accomplished by 
purchaser, be deducted from stumpage payments made by or due from 
purchaser under the timber sale contract for other than minimum stumpage 
rates and required deposits for slash disposal and road maintenance. As 
used in this section estimated construction costs means the total cost 
of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale 
contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by an 
independent contractor who is not the timber purchaser. In determining 
the purchaser credit amount applicable against timber payments, the 
estimated construction cost may be reduced for the effect of differences 
in applicable wage rates.


<R05>
Sec. 223.63  Advertised rates.

    Timber shall be advertised for sale at its appraised value, or its 
appraised value plus specified road costs. In either event, the 
advertised rates shall be not less than minimum stumpage rates, except 
that sales of insect-infested, diseased, dead, or distressed timber may 
be sold at less than minimum rates when harvest of such timber is 
necessary to protect or improve the forest or prevent waste of useable 
wood fiber.


<R05>
Sec. 223.64  Appraisal on a lump-sum value or rate per unit of measure basis.

    Timber may be appraised and sold at a lump-sum value or at a rate 
per unit of measure which rate may be adjusted during the period of the 
contract and as therein specified in accordance with formulas or other 
equivalent specifications for the following reasons:
    (a) Variations in lumber or other product value indices between the 
price index base specified in the contract and the price index actually 
experienced during the cutting of the timber;
    (b) Variance between advertised rates and rates redetermined by 
appraisal at dates specified in the contract;
    (c) Variance between redetermined rates and rates appropriate for 
changes in costs or selling values subsequent to the rate 
redetermination which reduce conversion value to less than such 
redetermined rates; and
    (d) Substantial loss of value due to physical deterioration of green 
timber or other physical damage to the sale area or access to the 
timber.


<R05>
Sec. 223.65  Appraisal of timber for land exchange; right-of-way, or other authorized use.

    The value of timber in land exchange or the value of timber required 
to be cut for occupancy of a right-of-way or other authorized use of 
National Forest System land for which payment will be made is to be 
determined by the appraisal methods in Sec. 223.60 of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 223.80  When advertisement is required.

    Except as otherwise provided in this part each sale in which the 
appraised value of the timber or other forest products exceeds $10,000 
will be made only after advertisement for a period of 30 days or, if in 
the opinion of the officer authorizing the sale, the quantity, value or 
other conditions justify, a longer period; and any sale of smaller 
appraised value will be advertised or informal bids solicited from 
potential purchasers if, in the judgment of the officer authorizing the 
sale, such action is deemed advisable.

Sec. 223.81  Shorter advertising periods in emergencies.

    In emergency situations where prompt removal of timber included in a 
sale is essential to avoid deterioration or to minimize the likelihood 
of the spread of insects, the approving officer may authorize shortening 
the formal advertising period to not less than 7 days. In other 
emergency situations, or for timber sold under 36 CFR 223.2 the Regional 
Forester or Chief may authorize shortening the formal advertising period 
to not less than 7 days.

Sec. 223.88  Bidding methods.

    (a) Competitive sales of National Forest timber shall be offered 
through either sealed or oral auction bidding. The method chosen for

    (2) Insure that the Federal Government receives not less than fair 
market value for the public resource,

[[Page 115]]

    (3) Consider the economic stability of communities whose economies 
are dependent upon National Forest timber, and
    (4) Be consistent with the objectives of the National Forest 
Management Act of 1976, as amended, and other Federal Statutes.
    (b) As a prerequisite to participation in an oral auction, bidders 
shall submit a written sealed bid at least equal to the minimum 
acceptable bid prices specified in the prospectus. No price subsequently 
bid at oral auction shall be accepted if it is less than the written 
sealed bid.
    (c) The Chief, Forest Service, shall specify the use of sealed bids 
or a mix of bidding methods in areas where he has reasonable belief that 
collusive bidding may be occurring or where he determines that less than 
normal competitive bidding is occurring.
    (d) Sealed bids shall be used for sales within Federal Sustained 
Yield Units, except where the policy statement for the Unit restricts 
purchasers of timber within the Unit from buying National Forest timber 
outside the Unit and the Chief determines that oral bidding will protect 
individual communities within the Unit.
    (e) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize departures from the 
requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section when he 
determines that departures are necessary to protect the public interest.
    (f) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize the testing and 
evaluation of alternative bidding methods for National Forest timber.

<R05>
Sec. 223.100  Award to highest bidder.

    The sale of advertised timber shall be awarded to the responsible 
bidder submitting the highest bid that conforms to the conditions of the 
sale as stated in the prospectus unless:
    (a) Determination is made to reject all bids.
    (b) Two or more bidders, all of whom meet the requirements, submit 
equal bids which are the highest bids, in which case award may be by the 
drawing of lots. Equal bids from parties having direct or indirect 
common control or association in logging, processing or marketing may be 
consolidated to the extent deemed necessary by the awarding officer in 
order to give to any others who have bid the same amount an equitable 
opportunity in the drawing of lots.
    (c) The highest bidder is notoriously or habitually careless with 
fire.
    (d) Monopoly, injurious to the public welfare, would result from the 
control of large amounts of public or of public and private timber.
    (e) The high bidder has elected Forest Service road construction in 
response to an advertisement extending such an option, the Forest 
Service cannot perform the construction and in response to solicitation 
has not received a satisfactory bid for such construction within the 
period stated in the prospectus and the high timber sale bidder is 
unwilling to perform the construction.

<R05>
Sec. 223.101  Determination of purchaser responsibility.

    (a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a timber sale contract 
unless that officer makes an affirmative determination of purchaser 
responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that 
the prospective purchaser is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall 
conclude that the

[[Page 116]]

prospective purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser.
    (b) To determine a purchaser to be responsible, a Contracting 
Officer must find that:
    (1) The purchaser has adequate financial resources to perform the 
contract or the ability to obtain them;
    (2) The purchaser is able to perform the contract within the 
contract term taking into consideration all existing commercial and 
governmental business commitments;
    (3) The purchaser has a satisfactory performance record on timber 
sale contracts. A prospective purchaser that is or recently has been 
seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed not to be 
responsible, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the 
circumstances were beyond the purchaser's control and were not created 
through improper actions by the purchaser or affiliate, or that the 
purchaser has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply 
sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably under a 
contract is strong evidence that a purchaser is not a responsible 
contractor. The Contracting Officer shall consider the number of 
contracts involved and extent of deficiency of each in making this 
evaluation;
    (4) The purchaser has a satisfactory record of integrity and 
business ethics;
    (5) The purchaser has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies 
suitable for logging the timber and for meeting the resource protection 
provisions of the contract;
    (6) The purchaser is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an 
award under applicable laws and regulations.
    (c) If the prospective purchaser is a small business concern and the 
Contracting Officer determines that the purchaser does not qualify as a 
responsible purchaser on an otherwise acceptable bid, the Contracting 
Officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration 
which will decide whether or not to issue a Certificate of Competency.
    (d) Affiliated concerns, as defined in Sec. 223.49(a)(5) of this 
subpart are normally considered separate entities in determining whether 
the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable 
standards for responsibility. However, the Contracting Officer shall 
consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may 
adversely affect the prospective purchaser's responsibility.

<R05>
Sec. 223.102  Procedures when sale is not awarded to highest bidder.

    If the highest bid is not accepted and the sale is still deemed 
desirable, all bids may be rejected and the timber readvertised; or, if 
the highest bidder cannot meet the requirements under which the timber 
was advertised or the withholding of award to him is based on one or 
more of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of Sec. 223.100, award at the 
highest price bid may be offered to the next highest qualified bidder or 
to the other qualified bidders in order of their bids until the award is 
accepted by one or refused by all of the qualified bidders.

Sec. 223.103  Award of small business set-aside sales.

    If timber is advertised as set aside for competitive bidding by 
small business concerns, award will be made to the highest bidder who 
qualifies as a small business concern and who has not been determined by 
the Small Business Administration to be ineligible for preferential 
award of set-aside sales. If there are no qualified small business 
bidders any readvertisement shall be without restriction on the size of 
bidders.

to contracts for the sale of National Forest timber in connection with 
areas damaged by major disaster as designated by the President pursuant 
to the Act.
    (a) Where an existing contract for the sale of National Forest 
timber does not provide relief from major physical change not due to 
purchaser's negligence prior to approval of construction of any section 
of specified road or other specified development facility and, as a 
result of a major disaster in a designated area a major physical change 
results in additional construction work by the purchaser in connection 
with such a road or facility, the United States shall bear such 
increased construction cost if, as determined by the Chief, Forest 
Service, the estimated cost is--
    (1) More than $1,000 for sales under 1 million board feet, or
    (2) More than $1 per thousand board feet for sales of 1 to 3 million 
board feet, or
    (3) More than $3,000 for sales over 3 million board feet.
    (b) Where the Chief, Forest Service, determines that damages are so 
great that restoration, reconstruction, or construction is not practical 
under the cost-sharing arrangement in paragraph (a) of this section, he 
may allow cancellation of the contract notwithstanding provisions 
therein or in Sec. 223.116.
    (c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to reduce to 7 days the 
minimum time to advertise the sale of National Forest timber whenever he 
determines that--
    (1) The sale of such timber will assist in the construction of any 
area of a State damaged by a major disaster,
    (2) The sale of such timber will assist in sustaining the economy of 
such area, or
    (3) The sale of such timber is necessary to salvage the value of 
timber damaged in such major disaster or to protect undamaged timber.
    (d) Any request for relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section shall be made in writing to the Forest Supervisor having 
administrative responsibility for the land involved.

Sec. 223.112  Modification of contracts.

    Timber sale contracts may be modified only when the modification 
will apply to unexecuted portions of the contract and will not be 
injurious to the United States. Modifications may be made by the officer 
approving the sale, by his successor, or by his superior, except as 
provided in Sec. 223.110.


<R05>
Sec. 223.113  Modification of contracts to prevent environmental damage or to conform to forest plans.

    Timber sale contract, permits, and other such instruments may be 
modified to prevent environmental damage or to make them consistent with 
amendments or revisions of land and resource management plans adopted 
subsequent to award or issuance of a timber sale contract, permit, or 
other such instrument. Compensation to the purchaser, if any, for 
modifications to a contract shall be made in accordance with provisions 
set forth in the timber sale contract. When determining compensation 
under a contract, timber payment rates shall be redetermined in 
accordance with appraisal methods in Sec. 223.60 of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 223.114  Acquisition by third party.

    No agreement permitting a third party to acquire the rights of a 
purchaser under a timber sale contract may be recognized and approved by 
the Forest Service except in writing, signed by the officer approving 
the sale, his successor, or superior officer. Such approval shall not 
relieve the purchaser of his responsibilities or liabilities under the 
timber sale contract and may be given only if--
    (a) The third party is acceptable to the Forest Service as a 
purchaser of

[[Page 118]]

timber under the conditions and requirements then in effect for similar 
timber sales and assumes in writing all of the obligations to the Forest 
Service under the terms of the timber sale contract as to the 
uncompleted portion thereof, or
    (b) The rights are acquired in trust as security and subject to such 
conditions as may be necessary for the protection of the public 
interests.


<R05>
Sec. 223.115  Contract extensions.

    The term of any contract or permit shall not be extended unless the 
approving officer finds:
    (a) That the purchaser has diligently performed in accordance with 
contract provisions and an approved plan of operation; or
    (b) That the substantial overriding public interest justifies the 
extension.


<R05>
Sec. 223.116  Cancellation.

    (a) Timber sale contracts and permits may be canceled:
    (1) For serious or continued violation of their terms.
    (2) Upon application, or with the consent of the purchaser, when 
such action is of advantage to the United States or not prejudicial to 
its interests.
    (3) Upon application of the purchaser if the value of the timber 
remaining to be cut is diminished materially because of catastrophic 
damage caused by forces beyond the control of the purchaser resulting in 
(i) physical change in the sale area or access to it, or (ii) damage to 
timber remaining to be cut.
    (4) For conviction of violation of criminal statutes or, following 
final agency or judicial determination, of violation of civil standards, 
orders, permits, or others regulations for the protection of 
environmental quality issued by a Federal agency, State agency, or 
political subdivision thereof, in the conduct of operations thereunder, 
on National Forest System land, unless compliance with such laws or 
regulations would preclude performance of other contractual 
requirements.
    (5) Upon determination by the Chief, Forest Service, that operations 
thereunder would result in serious environmental degradation or resource 
damage and with reasonable compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered 
costs incurred under the contract and the difference between the current 
contract value and the average value of comparable National Forest 
timber sold during the preceding 6-month period.
    (b) Cancellation will be by the Chief, Forest Service. Authority to 
cancel contracts under paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section may 
be delegated to Regional Foresters for sales within their authorization. 
All contract cancellations under paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall 
be by the Chief, Forest Service, whose decision shall be the final

    With respect to sustained yield units established pursuant to the

for personal and domestic use as provided by law and by regulation.
    (b) May offer for sale to cooperators, without competition but at 
not less than appraised value, timber on National Forest lands within an 
approved cooperative sustained yield unit; or, if the approved sustained 
yield unit consists entirely of federally owned or administered forest

communities, may offer National Forest timber for sale to responsible 
operators within such community or communities, at not less than 
appraised value but without competition or with competition restricted 
to responsible operators who will manufacture the timber to at least a 
stated degree within the community or communities to be maintained. Each 
such sale which involves more than $500 in stumpage value may be made 
only

[[Page 119]]

after notice has been given in advance by such means as may be deemed 
effective in informing the public of the proposed action, including in 
any event, publication, once weekly for four consecutive weeks and with 
additional insertions if needed, in one or more newspapers of general 
circulation in the vicinity of the place where the timber is located, of 
a notice of the proposed sale stating at least:
    (1) The location, estimated quantity and appraised value of the 
timber to be cut;
    (2) The name and address of the proposed purchaser or those of the 
operators among whom bidding is to be restricted;
    (3) The time and place of a public advisory hearing on the proposed 
sale, to be held not earlier than 30 days after the first publication of 
said notice, if requested by the State or county where the timber is 
located or by any other person deemed to have a reasonable interest in 
the proposed sale or in its terms; and
    (4) The title and address of the officer of the Forest Service to 
whom any request for such hearing should be made.

Such requests need be considered only if received at the place 
designated in the notice not later than 15 days after the first 
publication of such notice. If a public advisory hearing is to be held, 
notice of it shall be published in the same newspaper or newspapers as 
the original notice, stating the place where it will be held and the 
time, which shall not be earlier than 10 days after the first 
publication of the said notice of hearing, and shall appear once each 
week, but not for more than four successive weeks in any event, until 
the date set for the hearing. Any such hearing shall be conducted by the 
Chief or by any officer designated by him as his representative, except 
that if the amount of the proposed sale is not in excess of that which 
the Regional Forester has been authorized to sell without prior approval 
of the Chief the hearing may be held by the Regional Forester concerned 
or by his representative and decision may be by the Regional Forester. 
At any such hearing, opportunity shall be given to those having a 
reasonable interest to make oral statements or to file written 
statements discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed 
sale; and the officer holding the hearing may, in his discretion, permit 
the filing of such statements within a reasonable period after the close 
of the hearing to become part of the record for consideration before a 
decision is made.
    (c) Shall keep available for public inspection,
    (1) During the life of any sustained yield unit, the minutes or 
other record of the hearing held on the establishment thereof, and the

Sec. 223.118  Appeal process for small business timber sale set-aside program share recomputation decisions.

    (a) Decisions subject to appeal. The rules of this section govern 
appeal of

[[Page 120]]

recomputation decisions related to structural, special, or market 
changes or the scheduled 5-year recomputations of the small business 
share of National Forest System timber sales. Certain decisions related 
to recomputation of shares, such as structural change and carryover 
volume, may require two decisions, one to determine that a recomputation 
is needed and the other to recompute the shares. Decisions made both at 
the earlier stage as well as the later stage are appealable.
    (b) Manner of giving notice. (1) Predecisional notice and comment. 
The Responsible Official shall provide qualifying timber sale 
purchasers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 30 days for 
predecisional review and comment on any draft decision to reallocate 
shares, including the data used in making the proposed recomputation 
decision.
    (2) Notice of decision. Upon close of the 30-day predecisional 
review period, the Responsible Official shall consider any comments 
received. Within 15 days of the end of the comment period, the 
Responsible Official shall make a decision on the small business shares 
and shall give prompt written notice to all parties on the national 
forest timber sale bidders list for the affected area. The notice of 
decision must identify the name of the Appeal Deciding Officer, the 
address, the date by which an appeal must be filed, and a source for 
obtaining the appeal procedures information.
    (c) Who may appeal or file written comments as an interested party. 
(1) Only timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are 
affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales 
as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have submitted 
predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may 
appeal recomputation decisions under this section or may file written 
comments as an interested party.
    (2) Interested parties are defined as the Small Business 
Administration and those timber sale purchasers, or their 
representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small 
business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section and who have individually, or through an association to which 
they belong, submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (i) A timber sale purchaser may submit comments on an appeal as an 
interested party if an association to which the purchaser belongs filed 
predecisional comment but later decides not to appeal or not to file 
comments as an interested party.
    (ii) A timber sale purchaser, who is a member of an association that 
appeals a decision, may not file a separate appeal unless that purchaser 
filed separate predecisional comment under paragraph (b)(1).
    (3) Interested parties who submit written comments on an appeal 
filed by another party may not continue an appeal if the appellant 
withdraws the appeal.
    (d) Level of appeal. Only one level of review is available for 
appeal of decisions pertaining to recomputations under the Small 
Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program. The Appeal Deciding Officer is 
the official one level above the level of the Responsible Official who 
made the recomputation of shares decision. The Responsible Official is 
normally the Forest Supervisor; thus, the Appeal Deciding Officer is 
normally the Regional Forester. However, when the Regional Forester 
makes recomputation decisions, the Appeal Deciding Officer is the Chief 
or such officer at the National headquarters level as the Chief may 
designate.
    (e) Filing procedures. In order to file an appeal under this 
section, an appellant must file a notice of appeal, as specified in the 
notice of decision, with the Appeal Deciding Officer within 20 days of 
the date on the notice of the decision. This date must be specified in 
the notice of decision given pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Written comments filed by an interested party in response to an 
appeal must be filed within 15 days after the close of the appeal filing 
period.
    (f) Content of notice of appeal. (1) It is the responsibility of the 
appellant to provide sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show 
why a recomputation decision by the Responsible Official should be 
reversed or changed.

[[Page 121]]

    (2) An appellant must include the following information in a notice 
of appeal:
    (i) The appellant's name, mailing address, and daytime telephone 
number;
    (ii) The title or type of recomputation decision involved, the date 
of the decision, and the name of the Responsible Official;
    (iii) A brief description and date of the decision being appealed:
    (iv) A statement of how the appellant is adversely affected by the 
decision being appealed;
    (v) A statement of the facts in dispute regarding the issue(s) 
raised by the appeal;
    (vi) If relevant, any specific references to any law, regulation, or 
policy that the appellant believes to have been violated and the basis 
for such an allegation;
    (vii) A statement as to whether and how the appellant has tried to 
resolve with the Responsible Official the issue(s) being appealed, 
including evidence of submission of written comments at the 
predecisional stage as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the 
date of any discussion, and the outcome of that meeting or contact; and
    (viii) A statement of the relief the appellant seeks.
    (g) Time periods and timeliness. (1) All time periods applicable to 
this section will begin on the first day following a decision or action 
related to the appeal.
    (2) Time periods applicable to this section are computed using 
calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays are included in 
computing the time allowed for filing an appeal; however, when the 
filing period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, 
the filing time is automatically extended to the end of the next Federal 
working day.
    (3) It is the responsibility of those filing an appeal to file the 
notice of appeal by the end of the filing period. In the event of 
questions, legible postmarks on a mailed appeal or the time and date 
imprint on a facsimile appeal will be considered evidence of timely 
filing. Where postmarks or facsimile imprints are illegible, the Appeal 
Deciding Officer shall rule on the timeliness of the notice of appeal.
    (4) The time period for filing a notice of appeal is not extendable.
    (h) Dismissal without decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall 
dismiss an appeal and close the record without a decision in any of the 
following circumstances:
    (1) The appellant is not on the timber sale bidders list for the 
area affected by the recomputation decision;
    (2) The appellant's notice of appeal is not filed within the 
required time period;
    (3) The appellant's notice of appeal does not contain responses 
required by paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(viii) of this section; 
or
    (4) The appellant did not submit written comments on the proposed 
decision of the new recomputed shares as described in paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (i) Appeal record. The appeal record consists of the written 
decision being appealed, any predecisional comments received, any 
written comments submitted by interested parties, any other supporting 
data used to make the decision, the notice of appeal, and, if prepared, 
a responsive statement by the Responsible Official which addresses the 
issues raised in the notice of appeal. The Responsible Official must 
forward the record to the Appeal Deciding Officer within 7 days of the 
date the notice of appeal is received. A copy of the appeal record must 
be sent to the appellant at the same time.
    (j) Appeal decision. (1) Responsive statement for appeal decision. 
The Appeal Deciding Officer may request the Responsible Official to 
prepare a responsive statement. However, if the information in the files 
clearly demonstrates the rationale for the Responsible Official's 
decision, then a responsive statement addressing the points of the 
appeal is not necessary.
    (2) Appeal issue clarification. For clarification of issues raised 
in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer may request additional 
information from either the Responsible Official, the appellant, or an 
interested party who has submitted comments on the appeal. At the 
discretion of the Appeal Deciding Officer, an appellant or interested 
party may be invited to discuss data

[[Page 122]]

relevant to the appeal. Information provided to clarify issues or facts 
in the appeal must be based upon information previously documented in 
the file or appeal. Any information provided as a result of the Appeal 
Deciding Officer's request for more information must be made available 
to all parties, that is, to the Responsible Official, the appellant, and 
interested parties who have submitted comments on the appeal. All 
parties will have 5 days after the Appeal Deciding Officer receives the 
additional information to review and comment on the information, and the 
appeal decision period will be extended 5 additional days.
    (3) Issuance of final decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall 
review the decision and appeal record and issue a written appeal 
decision to the parties within 30 days of the close of the appeal period 
except that this period must be extended to 35 days when additional 
information is requested by the Appeal Deciding Officer. The Appeal 
Officer may affirm or reverse the Responsible Official's decision, in 
whole or in part. There is no extension of the time period for rendering 
an appeal decision.
    (k) Implementation of decisions during pendency of appeal. 
Recomputation of shares arising from a scheduled 5-year recomputation 
are effective on April 1 following the end of the 5-year period being 
considered. If an appeal that may affect the shares for the next 5-year 
period is not resolved by the April 1 date, the share decision announced 
by the Responsible Official must be implemented. If an appeal decision 
results in a change in the shares, the revised total share of the Small 
Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program must be accomplished during the 
remaining portion of the 5-year period.
    (l) Timber sale set-aside policy changes. Timber purchasers shall 
receive an opportunity, in accordance with all applicable laws and 
regulations, to review and comment on significant changes in the Small 
Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program or policy prior to adoption and 
implementation.
    (m) Information collection requirements. The provisions of paragraph 
(f) of this section specify the information that appellants must provide 
when appealing decisions pertaining to recomputation of shares. As such, 
these rules contain information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 
1320. These information requirements have been approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0141.

debarring official may in the public interest, debar a purchaser for any 
of the causes listed in Sec. 223.137. However, the existence of a cause

debarred. In making any debarment decision, the debarring official shall 
consider the seriousness of the purchaser's acts or omissions and any 
mitigating factors.
    (b) Effect of proposed debarment. (1) Upon issuance of a notice of

proceedings.
    (2) In addition to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, issuance of a 
notice of proposed debarment under Sec. 223.137(g) shall preclude such

Sec. 223.138  Procedures for debarment.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information which may be sufficient 
cause for debarment of a timber sale purchaser and affiliates shall be 
reported to the Forest Service Debarring Official. Generally, such 
information should be referred through the Forest Supervisor and the 
Regional Forester. The referral shall be accompanied by a complete 
statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits and a 
recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates a 
possible criminal offense, except possible antitrust violations, the 
debarring official shall notify the Office of Inspector General, USDA. 
Where the statement of facts indicates a possible antitrust violation, 
the debarring official shall notify the Antitrust Division, Department 
of Justice.
    (b) Decisionmaking process--(1) Notice of proposal to debar. The 
debarring official shall initiate debarment by advising the purchaser 
and any specifically named affiliate, by certified mail, return receipt 
requested. The notice document shall include the following information:
    (i) That debarment is being considered.
    (ii) The reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the recipient on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based.
    (iii) The cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 223.137 for proposing 
debarment.
    (iv) The specific procedures governing debarment decisionmaking in 
Sec. 223.138 (b)(1) through (b)(8).
    (v) The effect of the issuance of the notice of proposed debarment 
pending a final debarment decision (see Sec. 223.136(b)).
    (vi) The potential effect of a debarment.
    (2) Submission in opposition. Within 30 calendar days after receipt 
of the notice of proposed debarment, the respondent my submit, in

argument in opposition to and/or in mitigation of the proposed 
debarment, including any additional specific information that raises a 
genuine dispute over the material facts.
    (3) Informal hearing. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
a respondent may request an informal hearing with the debarring offical. 
The informal hearing shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date

the hearing if the respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the 
hearing, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or 
other authorized representative, may informally present and explain 
evidence that causes for debarment do not exist, evidence of any 
mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, 
duration or effects of proposed debarment or debarment. A transcript of 
the informal hearing shall not be required.
    (4) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. In actions

material facts. Such a conference shall be held within 20 calendar days 
from the date the request is received unless mutually agreed otherwise. 
The fact-finding conference shall conform with the following 
requirements:

appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any person the Forest Service presents.

[[Page 127]]

    (iii) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
made available at cost to the respondent upon request, unless the 
respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.
    (5) Debarring official's decision--(i) No additional proceedings 
necessary. In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgement or in 
which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the debarring 
official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in 
the administrative record, including any submission made by the 
purchaser or any specifically named affiliate. The decision shall be 
made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted, unless the debarring official extends this period 
for good cause.
    (ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, the debarring official shall promptly prepare written findings of 
fact. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as 
found, together with any information and argument submitted by the 
purchaser or any specifically named affiliate and any other information 
in the administrative record.
    (B) The debarring official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (C) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (6) Standard of evidence. In any action in which the proposed 
debarment is not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the cause 
for debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. In 
any action in which the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or 
civil judgment, the standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (7) Notice of debarring official's decision. (i) The purchaser and 
any affiliates involved shall be given prompt notice of the debarring 
official's decision by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the 
debarring official decides to impose debarment, the notice shall:
    (A) Refer to the notice of proposed debarment:
    (B) Specify the reasons for debarment;
    (C) State the period of debarment, including effective dates (see 
Sec. 223.139);
    (D) Specify any limitations on the terms of the debarment; and
    (E) State that any decision to debar is appealable to the 
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals pursuant to paragraph (b)(8) of 
this section.
    (ii) The debarring official shall also promptly notify Regional 
Foresters and Forest Supervisors of the decision.
    (8) Review of debarring official's decision. The purchaser and any 
affiliates involved may appeal a Forest Service debarring official's 
decision to debar within 30 days from receipt of the decision. To 
appeal, a purchaser and any affiliates involved must furnish a written 
notice to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals, 
Washington, DC 20250, and a copy of the appeal to the debarring official 
from whose decision the appeal is taken. The rules and procedures of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals set forth in 7 
CFR part 24, govern debarment appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 223.139  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s):
    (1) The debarring official shall consider any suspension period or 
period since issuance of the notice of proposed debarment in determining 
the debarment period.
    (2) Generally, a debarment for those causes listed at Sec. 223.137 
(a)-(f) of this subpart should not exceed three (3) years, except as 
otherwise provided by law.
    (3) A debarment for the causes listed at Sec. 223.137(g) shall not 
exceed five (5) years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend the debarment for those causes 
listed at Sec. 223.137 (a)-(f) of this subpart for an additional period 
if that official determines that an extension is necessary to

[[Page 128]]

protect the Government's interest. However:
    (1) A debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts 
and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based;
    (2) If debarment for an additional period is necessary, the 
debarring official shall initiate and follow the procedures in 
Sec. 223.138 to extend the debarment.
    (c) The debarring official may consider terminating the debarment or 
reducing the period or extent of debarment, upon the purchaser's 
request, supported by documentation, for reasons such as:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or judgment upon which the debarment 
was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.
    (d) The debarring official shall make final disposition of a 
reconsideration request under paragraph (c) of this section in writing 
within 30 working days of receipt of the reconsideration request and

Sec. 223.140  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a purchaser constitutes 
debarment of all divisions or other organizational elements of the 
purchaser, unless the debarment decision is limited by its terms to 
specific divisions, organizational elements, or classes of sales.
    (2) The debarring official may extend a debarment decision to 
include any affiliates of the purchaser, if they are--
    (i) Specifically named and
    (ii) Given written notice of the proposed debarment and provided an 
opportunity to respond (see Sec. 223.138(b)).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determinig the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of 
any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other 
individual associated with a purchaser may be imputed to a purchaser 
when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's 
performance of duties for or on behalf of the purchaser, or with the 
purchaser's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The purchaser's 
acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of 
such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
    (2) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of 
a purchaser may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the purchaser who 
participated in, knew of, or has reason to know of the purchaser's 
conduct.
    (3) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of 
one purchaser participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement 
may be imputed to other participating purchasers if the conduct occurred 
for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement or with the 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of those purchasers. Acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence.


<R05>
Sec. 223.141  Suspension.

    (a) The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a 
purchaser on the basis of adequate evidence for any of the causes in 
Sec. 223.142, using the procedures in Sec. 223.143. However, the 
existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that 
the purchaser be suspended. In making any suspension decision, the 
suspending official shall consider the seriousness of the purchaser's 
acts or omissions and any mitigating factors.
    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed, pending the 
completion of investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been 
determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the 
Government's interest. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, 
consideration shall be given to how much information is available, how 
credible it is given the circumstances, whether or

[[Page 129]]

not important allegations are corroborated and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment shall include an 
examination of basic documents such as contracts, bids, awards, 
inspection reports, and correspondence, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 223.142  Causes for suspension.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a purchaser suspected, upon 
adequate evidence, of the following:
    (1) Commission of:
    (i) Theft, forgery, bribery, embezzlement, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property;
    (ii) Fraud, a criminal offense, or violation of Federal or State 
antitrust laws, any of which occurred in connection with obtaining, 
attempting to obtain; or performing a public contract or subcontract; or
    (iii) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or 
business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present 
responsibility of a purchase of Government timber.
    (2) Indictment for any of the causes listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section constitutes adequate evidence for suspension.
    (3) A purchaser's suspension from the purchaser of timber by another 
Federal agency which sells timber.
    (b) The suspending official may, upon adequate evidence, also 
suspend a purchaser for any other cause so serious or compelling that it 
affects the present responsibility or a purchaser of Government timber.


<R05>
Sec. 223.143  Procedures for suspension.

    (a) Investigation and referral. Information which may be sufficient 
cause for suspension under Sec. 223.142 shall be reported to the Forest 
Service Suspending Official. Generally, such information should be 
referred through the Forest Supervisor and the Regional Forester. The 
referral shall be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts 
supported by appropriate exhibits and a recommendation for action. Where 
the statement of facts indicates a possible criminal offense, except 
possible antitrust violations, the suspending official shall notify the 
Office of Inspector General, USDA. Where the statement of facts 
indicates a possible antitrust violation, the suspending official shall 
notify the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice.
    (b) Decisionmaking process--(1) Notice of suspension. When a 
purchaser and any specifically named affiliates are suspended, the 
suspending official shall so advise the purchaser and any specifically 
named affiliate immediately by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
Such notice shall specify:
    (i) That they have been suspended as of the date of the notice;
    (ii) That the suspension is based on an indictment or other adequate 
evidence that the purchaser has committed irregularities,
    (A) Of a serious nature in business dealings with the Government, or
    (B) Seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Government 
dealings with the recipient;
    (iii) Any such irregularities shall be described in terms sufficient 
to place the recipient on notice without disclosing the Government's 
evidence;
    (iv) That the suspension is for a temporary period of time pending 
the completion of an investigation and such legal proceedings as may 
ensue;
    (v) The cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 223.142 for imposing 
suspension;
    (vi) The effect of the suspension (see Sec. 223.135);
    (vii) The specific procedures governing suspension decisionmaking in 
Sec. 223.143 (b)(1) through (b)(6).
    (2) Submission in opposition. Within 30 calendar days after receipt 
of the notice of suspension, the purchaser or any specifically named 
affiliate may submit, in person, in writing, or through a 
representative, information and argument in opposition to the 
suspension, including any additional specific information that raises a 
genuine dispute over material facts.
    (3) Informal hearing. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
respondent may request an informal hearing with the suspending official. 
The informal hearing shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date 
the request is received. The suspending official may postpone the date 
of the hearing if the respondent requests a

[[Page 130]]

postponement in writing. At the hearing, the respondent, appearing 
personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative, 
may informally present and explain evidence that causes for suspension 
do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments 
concerning the imposition, scope, duration or effects of suspension. A 
transcript of the informal hearing shall not be required.
    (4) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (i) If the 
suspending official finds that there exists a genuine dispute over facts 
material to the suspension, respondent(s) shall be afforded an 
opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present 
witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents, unless--
    (A) The action is based on an indictment; or
    (B) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or 
contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension 
would be prejudiced.
    (ii) If appropriate, the respondent may request a fact-finding 
conference on disputed material facts. Such a conference shall be held 
within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received unless 
mutually agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall conform 
with the following requirements:
    (A) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the 
suspending official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in 
the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected 
to by the Department of Justice.
    (B) At the conference, the respondent shall have the opportunity to 
appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any person the Forest Service presents.
    (iii) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent upon request, 
unless the respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive 
the requirement for a transcript.
    (5) Suspending official's decision. The suspending official may 
modify or terminate the suspension or leave it in force for the same 
reasons as for terminating or reducing the period or extent of debarment 
(see Sec. 223.139(c)). The decision shall be made in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (i) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based on an 
indictment, in which the respondent's submission does not raise a 
genuine dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings 
to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official's decision shall 
be based on all the information in the administrative record, including 
any submissions and argument made by the respondent. The decision shall 
be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, 
written findings of fact shall be promptly prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (B) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (C) The suspending official's decision shall be made only after the 
conclusion of any proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (6) Notice of suspending official's decision. The purchaser and any 
affiliates involved shall be given prompt written notice of the 
suspending officer's decision to continue or not continue the suspension 
by certified mail, return receipt requested.

<R05>
Sec. 223.160  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to the provisions of this section:
    (a) Export means either direct or indirect export to a foreign 
country and occurs on the date that a person enters into a contract or 
other binding transaction for the export of unprocessed timber or, if 
that date cannot be established, when unprocessed timber is found in an 
export yard or pond, bundled or otherwise prepared for shipment, or 
aboard an ocean-going vessel. An export yard or pond is an area where 
sorting and/or bundling of logs for shipment outside the United States 
is accomplished. Unprocessed timber, whether from National Forest System 
or private lands, is exported directly when exported by the National 
Forest timber purchaser. Timber is exported indirectly when export 
occurs as a result of a sale to another person or as a consequence of 
any subsequent transaction.
    (b) Historic level means the average annual volume of unprocessed 
timber purchased or exported in calendar years 1971, 1972, and 1973.
    (c) Private lands mean lands held or owned by a private person. 
Nonprivate lands include, but are not limited to, lands held or owned by 
the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or any 
other public agency, or lands held in trust by the United States for 
Indians.
    (d) Substitution means the purchase of unprocessed timber from 
National Forest System lands to be used as replacement for unprocessed 
timber from private lands which is exported by the purchaser. 
Substitution occurs when (1) a person increases purchases of National 
Forest timber in any Calendar year more than 10 percent above their 
historic level and in the same calendar year exports unprocessed timber 
from private land in the tributary area; or (2) a person increases 
exports of unprocessed timber from private land in any tributary area 
more than 10 percent above their historic level in any calendar year 
while they have National Forest timber under contract.
    (e) Tributary area means the geographic area from which unprocessed 
timber is delivered to a specific processing facility or complex. A 
tributary area is expanded when timber outside an established tributary 
area is hauled to the processing facility or complex.
    (f) Unprocessed timber, except western red cedar in the contiguous 
48 States, means trees or portions of trees having

[[Page 132]]

a net scale content not less than 33\1/3\ percent of the gross volume, 
or the minimum piece specification set forth in the timber sale 
contract, in material meeting the peeler and sawmill log grade 
requirements published in the January 1, 1980--Official Log Scaling and 
Grading Rules used by Log Scaling and Grading Bureaus on the West Coast; 
cants to be subsequently remanufactured exceeding 8\3/4\ inches in 
thickness; cants of any thickness reassembled into logs; and split or 
round bolts, except for aspen, or other roundwood not processed to 
standards and specifications suitable for end-product use. Unprocessed 
timber shall not mean pulp (utility) grade logs and Douglas-fir special 
cull logs or timber processed into the following:
    (1) Lumber and construction timbers, regardless of size, sawn on 
four sides;
    (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
    (3) Green veneer and plywood;
    (4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated for use as such;
    (5) Cants cut for remanufacture, 8\3/4\ inches in thickness or less;
    (6) Aspen bolts, not exceeding 4 feet in length.
    (g) Unprocessed western red cedar timber in the contiguous 48 States 
means trees or portions of trees of that species which have not been 
processed into--
    (1) Lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3 dimension 
or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of 
Number 3 Common or better;
    (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
    (3) Veneer and plywood;
    (4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated with preservatives for 
use as such and not intended to be further processed; or
    (5) Shakes and shingles; provided that lumber from private lands 
manufactured to the standards established in the lumber grading rules of 
the American Lumber Standards Association or the Pacific Lumber 
Inspection Bureau and manufactured lumber authorized to be exported 
under license by the Department of Commerce shall be considered 
processed.
    (h) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, 
association, or other legal entity and includes any subsidiary, 
subcontractor, parent company, or other affiliate. Business entities are 
considered affiliates for the entire calendar year when one controls or

or indirectly by a third person during any part of the calendar year.
    (i) Purchase occurs when a person is awarded a contract to cut 
National Forest timber or through the approval of a third party 
agreement by the Forest Service.
    (j) Purchaser means a person that has purchased a National Forest 
timber sale.

processed into any one of the following:
    (1) Lumber or construction timbers, except western red cedar, 
meeting current American Lumber Standards Grades or Pacific Lumber 
Inspection Bureau Export R or N list grades, sawn on 4 sides, not 
intended for remanufacture. To determine whether such lumber or 
construction timbers meet this grade and intended use standard, the 
shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment or 
order, and available for inspection upon the request of the Forest 
Service:
    (i) A legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a 
lumber inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the 
industry as setting a selling standard; and,
    (ii) A statement by the manufacturer certifying under the penalties 
provided in section 492 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the products in the shipment or 
order are intended to be used as shipped, are manufactured into 
products, or processed into pulp, and are not to be manufactured into 
other products. The certification statements shall be made in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section. The certification statements in 
paragraph (b) of this section are not required if the lumber or 
construction timbers described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or 
the pulpwood bolts described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section 
otherwise may be exported without regard to an intent to remanufacture 
or process into pulp. For instance, because the timber originates from 
private land from which timber may be exported.
    (2) Lumber, construction timbers, or cants for remanufacture, except 
western red cedar, meeting current American Lumber Standards Grades or 
Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R or N list clear grades, sawn 
on 4 sides, not to exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick. To determine 
whether such lumber, timbers, or cants meet this grading standard, the 
shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment or order 
and available for inspection, upon the request of the Forest Service, a 
legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a lumber 
inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the industry as 
setting a selling standard.
    (3) Lumber, construction timbers, or cants for remanufacture, except 
western red cedar, that do not meet the grades referred to in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section and are sawn on 4 sides, with wane less than \1/
4\ of any face, not exceeding 8\3/4\ inches (22.2 cm) thick.

(Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully understand that 
exporting unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands or 
unprocessed timber from private lands which is required to be processed 
domestically is a violation of this Act, its implementing regulations, 
and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the 
penalties and remedies provided for such violations.''
    (3) Pulpwood bolts. ``I certify that the pulpwood bolts in the 
shipment identified by my shipping order number ________ dated ________, 
are manufactured in accordance with the attached order from (buyer) of

knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions 
of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 
U.S.C. 620 et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully 
understand that exporting unprocessed timber originating from Federal 
lands or unprocessed timber originating from private lands which is 
required to be processed domestically is a violation of this Act, its 
implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), 
and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such 
violation.''

    (6) Exporters of other timber products originating from Federal 
lands not specifically listed in Sec. 223.187 which may develop export 
markets in the future may also require similar certification statements. 
Such statements will be provided by the Forest Service.

or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of 
Number 3 common or better, with a maximum cross section of 2,000 square 
centimeters (310 square inches) for any individual piece of processed 
western red cedar, regardless of grade. To determine whether such lumber 
meets these established standards, grades and size restrictions, the 
shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment, and 
available for inspection upon the request of the Forest Service, a 
legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a lumber 
inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the industry as 
setting a selling standard. Export restrictions governing western red 
cedar timber harvested from Federal, State or other public lands are 
found in 7(i) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 as amended (50 
U.S.C. appendix 2406(i)), and implementing regulations at 15 CFR 777.7.

substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief 
Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620b(b)(1)) and its implementing regulations. I 
make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the 
export and substitution restrictions of the Forest Resources 
Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) 
(Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully acknowledge and 
understand that to acquire western red cedar under the indirect 
substitution exemption in 16 U.S.C. 620b(b)(1) for purposes other than 
domestic processing into finished products will be a violation of this 
Act, its implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 
U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided 
for such violation.''
    (2) Signatory procedures. Certificates shall be on company

Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its 
implementing regulations. I fully understand that exporting unprocessed 
timber originating from Federal lands or unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands which is required to be processed domestically is a

unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved 
sourcing area for a period of not less than three (3) years. Signatories 
of this certificate who received an approved sourcing area, like all 
holders of sourcing areas, are subject to the prohibition against 
exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the 
sourcing area boundaries, pursuant to this paragraph.
    (g) Application for waiver within a sourcing area. To obtain a 
waiver of the

[[Page 141]]

prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for 
purchasing Federal timber described in paragraph (f) of this section, a 
person must have submitted a request for waiver, in writing, to the 
Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility 
being sourced is located, which must have been received by the Regional 
Forester on or before November 20, 1990, and which must have been signed 
by the person making such request or, in the case of a corporation, by 
its Chief Executive Officer. The request for waiver must be notarized 
and, in the case of a corporation, with its corporate seal affixed. The 
request shall be on company letterhead with its corporate seal affixed 
and must include:
    (1) An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving 
acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and 
Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the waiver request, for a 
period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such 
records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional 
Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.
    (2) A signed certification statement which reads as follows:

    ``I have engaged in exporting of unprocessed timber originating from 
private land located within the sourcing area for which I am applying. I 
desire to purchase directly from a department or agency of the United 
States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located within 
the desired sourcing area. I hereby request waiver of the prohibition 
against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing 
Federal timber required by the forest Resources Conservation and 
Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 
U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all 
exporting of such unprocessed private timber from within the desired 
sourcing area by February 20, 1991, and will not resume such exporting 
for a period of not less than three (3) years. I make this certification 
with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of this Act 
and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as 
certified will be a violation of Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 
620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me 
to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.''

Sec. 223.190  Sourcing area application procedures.

    (a) Subject to the restrictions described in Sec. 223.189 of this 
subpart and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
person who owns or operates a manufacturing facility and who exports 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands may apply for a 
sourcing area in accordance with the procedures of this section. 
However, an owner/operator of a manufacturing facility who exports 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands may not possess or 
acquire unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands unless the 
acquisition is within an approved sourcing area. A person who intends to 
acquire or become affiliated with a manufacturing facility that 
processes Federal timber and who is an exporter may apply for a sourcing 
area. Written proof of the intent to acquire or affiliate must be 
included in the sourcing area application, signed by the applicant and 
the person or, in the case of a corporation, the Chief Executive 
Officer, whose company the applicant intends to acquire or affiliate 
with. This certification must be on letterhead and must be notarized. A 
sourcing area application that the Secretary determines would be 
approved will be granted tentative approval pending final notification 
by the applicant of acquisition of or affiliation with the manufacturing 
facility. The tentative approval of the sourcing area will lapse unless 
the acquisition or affiliation occurs within 30 days of the tentative 
approval of the sourcing area. A sourcing area is not valid until final 
approval of the sourcing area. The direct substitution prohibition did 
not apply to a person who applied for a sourcing area on or before 
December 20, 1990. A request for modification of an existing sourcing 
area shall trigger a review pursuant to the procedures and restrictions 
in Sec. 223.191(e).
    (b) As provided in the Act, a person who has requested an exemption 
or waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-
month period, pursuant to Sec. 223.189 of this subpart, must have 
applied for the desired sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990.

[[Page 142]]

    (c) Applications. Sourcing area applications shall include:
    (1) A map of sufficient scale and detail to clearly show:
    (i) The applicant's desired sourcing area boundary. This boundary 
will include both the private and Federal lands from which the applicant 
intends to acquire unprocessed timber for sourcing its manufacturing 
facilities;
    (ii) The location of the timber manufacturing facilities owned or 
operated by the applicant within the proposed sourcing area where the 
person intends to process timber originating from Federal land;
    (iii) The location of private lands within and outside the desired 
sourcing area where the person has, within the 24 months immediately 
preceding the date of the application, acquired unprocessed timber 
originating from private land which was exported, sold, traded, 
exchanged, or otherwise conveyed to another person for the purpose of 
exporting such timber;
    (2) A list of other persons with timber manufacturing facilities 
located within the same general vicinity as the applicant's facilities;
    (3) Any other information the applicant may believe is appropriate 
to support approval of the requested sourcing area; and
    (4) A statement signed by the person certifying under the penalties 
provided in Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information provided in support 
of the application is true, complete, and accurate to the best of the 
applicant's knowledge. The statement shall read as follows:

    ``I certify under penalties of 16 U.S.C. 620d and 18 U.S.C. 1001, 
that the information provided in support of this application, is true, 
complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge concerning my timber 
purchasing and export patterns. I certify that the information provided 
concerning my timber purchasing and export patterns fully and accurately 
reflects, to the best of my knowledge, the boundaries of the sourcing 
area for which I am applying. I make this certification with full 
knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions 
of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 
U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I certify 
that I have not exported unprocessed timber originating from private 
lands within the boundaries of the sourcing area that is the subject of 
this application in the previous 24 months. I fully understand that, if 
this application is approved, exporting unprocessed private timber 
originating from within the approved sourcing area will be a violation 
of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) its implementing regulations, and 
the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the 
penalties and remedies provided for such violation.''

    (d) Confidential information. Applications are not considered 
confidential. However, if a person does submit confidential information 
as part of an application, the information should be marked 
confidential. Information so marked will be afforded the rights and 
protection provided under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (e) Where to submit the application. A sourcing area applicant shall 
send the application to the Office of Administrative Law Judges and 
shall, simultaneously, send a copy of the sourcing area application to 
the Forest Service Regional Forester of the region in which the 
manufacturing facility being sourced is located. Where the sourcing area 
application will cover purchases from more than one agency, application 
is to be made to the agency from which the applicant expects to purchase 
the preponderance of its Federal timber. The sourcing area applicant 
must also send a complete copy of the application to each agency 
concerned. The lead agency shall make the decision in consultation with, 
and upon co-signature of, the other agencies concerned.
    (f) Signatory procedures. Sourcing area applications must be signed 
by the person making the request, or in the case of a corporation, by 
its Chief Executive Officer, and must be notarized. The application 
shall be on company letterhead.
    (g) The sourcing area application and review process will be 
conducted pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication 
of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas 
Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 
1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M.
    (h) A final decision on a sourcing area application or a formal 
sourcing area review will be issued within four

[[Page 143]]

(4) months of the receipt of the application or initiation of the 
review.
    (i) The following criteria must be met for sourcing area approval:
    (1) The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial 
Officer must find that the proposed sourcing area is geographically and 
economically separate from any area that the applicant harvests or 
expects to harvest for export any unprocessed timber originating from 
private lands. In making such a finding, the Administrative Law Judge, 
or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall consider the timber purchasing 
patterns of the applicant on private and Federal lands equally with 
those of other persons in the same local vicinity and the relative 
similarity of such purchasing patterns.
    (2) The ``same local vicinity'' will normally be manufacturing 
facilities located within 30 miles of the community where the 
applicant's manufacturing facility is located, but may include more 
distant communities if manufacturing facilities in those communities 
depend on the same source of timber and have similar purchasing 
patterns.
    (3) The relative similarity of purchasing patterns of other mills 
shall be determined by considering the location and similarity of 
unprocessed timber being acquired by those facilities.
    (4) Lines defining the geographic area shall be based on major 
natural and cultural features, including, but not limited to, prominent 
ridge systems, main roads or highways, rivers, political subdivisions, 
and not characterized by random lines.
    (j) Comments. Persons may submit comments on sourcing area 
applications pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the 
Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing 
Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief 
Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. 
Persons submitting a comment must certify at the end of the comment, but 
before the signature, to the following: ``I certify that the information 
provided by me is true and accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and I 
understand that failure to provide true and accurate information could 
be violation of the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).''
    (k) Transporting or causing to be transported unprocessed private 
timber from outside of a sourcing area into a sourcing area by the 
holder of the sourcing area is prohibited as a violation of the sourcing 
area boundary. Such violation will cause a review of the sourcing area, 
and could subject the sourcing area holder to the penalties and remedies 
for violations of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief 
Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq., and its implementing regulations.
    (l) A person with an approved sourcing area may relinquish the 
sourcing area at any time provided the person certifies to the 
following:

    ``I am relinquishing the approved sourcing area, described in the 
Secretary's determination in FSAA ________ on ________, 19____. I 
understand that I may not export unprocessed timber originating from 
private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States 
during the fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating 
from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 
States in my possession or under contract, pursuant to the prohibition 
against substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage 
Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (``Act'') and its 
implementing regulations. I also understand that I may not purchase 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States, pursuant to the prohibitions 
against substitution in the Act and its implementing regulations. I make 
this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the Act and 
its implementing regulations and do fully understand that exporting 
unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States during a fiscal year in which I 
have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th 
meridian in the contiguous 48 States in possession or under contract, or 
purchasing unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 
100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having 
exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 
100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is a violation of the 
substitution provisions of the Act and the False Statements Act (18 
U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided 
for such violation.''


[[Page 144]]


    The certificate must be signed by the person making such 
certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive 
Officer; must be on company letterhead; and must be notarized.

Sec. 223.191  Sourcing area disapproval and review procedures.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an applicant whose 
sourcing area application was submitted by December 20, 1990, and was 
disapproved could either phase out of purchasing Federal timber or phase 
out of exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands 
within the sourcing area that would have been approved, as follows:
    (1) Phase-out of Federal timber purchasing. The applicant could 
purchase, in the 9-month period after receiving the application 
disapproval, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the 
disapproved sourcing area, in an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the 
annual average of such person's purchases of unprocessed Federal timber 
in such area during the 5 full fiscal years immediately prior to the 
date of submission of the application. In the 6-month period immediately 
following the 9-month period, such person could purchase not more than 
25 percent of such annual average, after which time the prohibitions 
against direct substitution, set forth in Sec. 223.189 of this subpart, 
shall apply; or
    (2) Phase-out of private timber exporting. The applicant could 
continue to purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands 
within the disapproved sourcing area without being subject to the phase-
out of Federal timber purchasing procedures described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, if the following requirements were met:
    (i) The applicant certified to the Regional Forester or the 
approving official to whom such authority has been delegated, within 90 
days after receiving the disapproval decision, as follows:

from private lands from the geographic area that would have been 
approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:

    ``I have engaged in the exporting of unprocessed private timber 
originating from private lands located within the geographic area the 
approving official would have approved as a sourcing area for my 
manufacturing facility. I desire to continue purchasing unprocessed 
Federal timber from within such area. I hereby certify that I will cease 
all exporting of unprocessed timber from private lands located within 
the area that would have been approved by [the applicant shall insert 
date 15 months from date of receipt of the disapproval decision]. I 
agree to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and 
disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands 
within the area involved in the certification, for a period of three (3) 
years beginning on the date of receipt of the disapproval notification, 
and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of 
the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been 
delegated. I make this certification with full knowledge and 
understanding of the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation 
and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and do 
fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will 
be a violation of the Act and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies for such violation. Further, I fully understand that such 
violation may subject me to the penalty of perjury pursuant to the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001). I certify that the information in this 
certificate is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge 
and belief.'';


or,

    (B) An applicant who has not exported unprocessed timber originating 
from private lands from the geographic area that the Secretary would 
have approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:

    ``I have not exported timber originating from private lands within 
both the sourcing area that the Secretary would have approved and the 
disapproved sourcing area in the past 24 months, pursuant to the Forest 
Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.), and I am accepting the area that the Secretary would have 
approved as my sourcing area. I certify that the information in this 
certificate is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge 
and belief.''

certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive 
Officer; must have been on company letterhead; must have been notarized; 
and must have had a corporate seal attached.
    (iii) The person signing such certification set forth in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i)(A) of this section must have provided to the Regional Forester 
the annual volume of timber exported by that person during the five (5) 
full fiscal years immediately preceding submission of the application, 
originating from private lands in the geographic area for which the 
application would have been approved.
    (iv) When the applicant submitted the certificate, the area the 
Secretary would have approved, as shown on the sourcing area map 
provided by the Secretary, became an approved sourcing area. If the 
certificate was not submitted, the sourcing area that would have been 
approved did not become an approved sourcing area.
    (3) The phase-out of Federal timber purchasing and the phase-out of 
private timber exporting procedures provided by paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section do not apply to persons submitting sourcing area 
applications after December 20, 1990, or to persons requesting review of 
disapproved sourcing areas.

following disapproval of a sourcing area, a person who elects to phase-
out of private timber exporting as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, may not:
    (i) Purchase more than 125 percent of the person's annual average 
purchases of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within 
the person's disapproved sourcing area during the five (5) full fiscal 
years immediately prior to submission of the application; and,
    (ii) Export unprocessed timber originating from private lands in the 
geographic area determined by the approving official for which the 
application would have been approved, in amounts that exceed 125 percent 
of the annual average of that person's exports of unprocessed timber 
from such private land during the five (5) full years immediately prior 
to submission of the application.
    (2) At the conclusion of the 15-month export phase-out period, the 
prohibition against exporting private timber originating from within the 
area shall be in full force and effect as long as the sourcing area 
remains approved, pursuant to this subpart F of this part 223.
    (c) Presentation of map to applicant whose sourcing area is 
disapproved. The area determined by the deciding official that would 
have been approved shall be drawn on a map and presented to the 
applicant by the deciding official with the notice of disapproval of the 
application.
    (d) Effect of prior certification to cease exporting. An applicant's 
previous certification to cease exporting beginning February 20, 1991, 
for a period of three (3) years from within the disapproved sourcing 
area pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) in Sec. 223.189 of this subpart 
shall remain in full force and effect for persons with approved and 
disapproved sourcing areas.
    (e) Review process and frequency. (1) Approved sourcing areas shall 
be reviewed not less often than every five (5) years. A tentative date 
for a review shall be included in the Administrative Law Judge's, or, on 
appeal, the Judicial Officer's determination or stated in writing by the 
Regional Forester following the determination. At least 60 days prior to 
the tentative review date, the Regional Forester or other such reviewing 
official shall notify the person holding the sourcing area of the 
pending review, publish notice of such review in newspapers of general 
circulation within the sourcing area, and invite comments, to be 
received no later than 30 days from the date of the notice, from all 
interested persons, including the person holding the sourcing area. For 
10 working days following the comment period, any person submitting a 
written comment and the person with the sourcing area may review the 
comments. If there is disagreement among the persons who submitted 
written comments regarding the proper sourcing area, the reviewing 
official

[[Page 146]]

shall convene an informal meeting convenient to the persons that all 
interested persons may attend. If an agreement cannot be reached among 
the persons, formal administrative adjudication shall occur. The 
Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall, on 
the record and after opportunity for a hearing, approve or disapprove 
the sourcing area being reviewed, pursuant to the Rules of Practice 
Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal 
Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation 
and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR 
part 1, subpart M.
    (2) Disapproved sourcing areas shall be reviewed using the process 
described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon resubmission of an 
application, provided the applicant has accepted the area the Secretary 
would have approved as a sourcing area pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (3) The Department reserves the right to schedule a review, at the 
request of the Forest Service or the person holding the sourcing area,

and identify unprocessed timber is a violation of the Act, and 
regulations issued under the Act, and the False Statements Act (18 
U.S.C. 1001); and
    (ix) Certify that the form has been read and understood.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided by law, a person who transfers 
unprocessed private timber to another person and meets all notice, 
certification, acknowledgement, distribution, reporting and record 
keeping requirements contained in this section shall be relieved from 
further liability for such timber with regard to the export and 
substitution restrictions pursuant to the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 223.195  Procedures for identifying and marking unprocessed timber.

    (a) Highway yellow paint. The use of highway yellow paint on 
unprocessed logs west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States 
shall be reserved for identifying logs requiring domestic manufacturing.
    (b) Preserving identification. All identifying marks placed on an 
unprocessed log to identify the National Forest System origin of that 
log and/or to identify the log as requiring domestic processing shall be 
retained on the log until the log is domestically processed. If the 
identifying marks are lost, removed, or become unreadable, they shall be 
replaced. If the log is cut into two or more segments, each segment 
shall be identified in the same manner as the original log.
    (1) A generic log hammer brand, known as a ``catch brand'', used to 
identify ownership, may be used to replace lost, removed, unreadable or 
otherwise missing brands where such use is authorized by the Regional 
Forester and approved by the Contracting Officer. Use of such a catch 
brand on a log or log segment will signify Federal origin.
    (2) The requirement to preserve identification of log pieces shall 
not apply to logs cut into two or more segments as a part of the mill 
in-feed process immediately before processing. Log segments that are 
returned to or placed in storage must be marked on both ends with yellow 
paint.
    (c) National Forest System logs. Except as otherwise provided in 
this subsection, all unprocessed logs originating from National Forest 
System timber sales west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 
States shall, before being removed from the timber sale area, be marked 
on each end as follows:
    (1) Painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less 
than three square inches in size; and,
    (2) Branded on each end with a hammer brand approved for use by the 
Forest Supervisor of the National Forest from which the logs originate. 
The brand pattern may not be used to mark logs from any other source for 
a period of 24 months after all logs have been removed from the sale 
area and until such brand pattern is released in writing by the Forest 
Supervisor.
    (d) Private logs. All unprocessed logs originating from private 
lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States that 
require domestic manufacturing pursuant to Sec. 223.194 of this subpart, 
shall be painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not 
less than three (3) square inches in size before removal from the 
harvest area. If private logs are acquired by a person who may not 
export such logs, the logs must be marked by the person acquiring the 
logs at the time of the acquisition.
    (e) Waiver of painting requirements. The log painting requirements 
pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section may be waived if 
the Chief of the Forest Service determines that alternate methods for 
identifying logs required to be domestically processed are equal to or 
better than the procedures required herein.
    (f) Waiver of branding requirements. Regional Foresters may waive 
the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
as follows:
    (1) Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4. On an individual timber sale basis, all 
or a portion of the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section may be waived, if:
    (i) Unprocessed logs from any origin are not known to have been 
exported

[[Page 151]]

by any person from the person's area of operations within the previous 
5; years.
    (ii) The person certifies as follows:

    ``I hereby request waiver of the requirements to brand each end of 
individual logs originating from the ________ timber sale, Forest 
Service contract number ________ pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195. I certify 
that I have not exported or sold for export unprocessed timber from 
private lands within my area of operations in five years. I certify that 
I understand, that if granted, the waiver applies only to unprocessed 
logs being processed within my area of operations. I certify that any 
unprocessed logs to which this waiver applies that are transferred, or 
sold for transfer, outside my area of operations will be branded on both 
ends in full compliance with 36 CFR 223.195. I make this certification 
with full knowledge and understanding of the requirement of the Forest 
Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 223. I 
fully understand that failure to abide by the terms of the waiver will 
be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies provided for such violation.'' ;


and,

    (iii) The person otherwise complies with the regulations relating to 
transfers of logs between persons.
    (iv) If the Regional Forester determines that unprocessed logs from 
my origin are being exported, or are known to have been exported within 
the previous 5 years, by any person from the person's area of 
operations, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
    (2) Regions 5 and 6. On an individual timber sale basis, the 
branding requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be 
waived for logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the 
large end may be waived if:
    (i) One end of each log is branded;
    (ii) The person certifies as follows:

    ``I hereby request waiver of the requirement to brand each end of 
individual logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the 
large end, originating from the ________ timber sale, U.S. contract 
number ________ pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195. I certify that I understand, 
if granted, that the waiver applies only to unprocessed logs being 
processed at ________, and further certify that any and all unprocessed 
logs to which waiver would apply that are transferred, or sold for 
transfer, will be branded on both ends in full compliance 36 CFR 
223.195. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding 
of the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage 
Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990; 16 U.S.C. 620, 
et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 223. I 
fully understand that failure to abide by the terms of the waiver will 
be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) and the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and 
remedies provided for such violation.'';


and,

    (iii) The purchaser otherwise complies with the regulations relating 
to transfers of logs between persons.
    (iv) If the Regional Forester determines that logs ten (10) inches 
or less in diameter inside bark on the large end are being exported in 
the Region, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
    (3) The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the testing of 
alternative methods of branding for consideration in future amendment of 
these regulations. Such alternative methods and logs marked under those 
methods shall be closely monitored.


<R05>
Sec. 223.196  Civil penalties for violation

    (a) Exporting Federal timber. If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, 
on the record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a 
person, with willful disregard for the prohibition in the Act exporting 
unprocessed Federal timber, exported or caused to be exported 
unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in violation of the 
Act, the Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty of not 
more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3 times the gross value of the 
unprocessed timber involved in the violation, whichever amount is 
greater.
    (b) Other violations. If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, on the 
record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a person 
has violated any provision of the Act, or any regulation issued under 
the Act relating to National Forest System lands, even though that the 
violation may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber 
in violation of such Act, the Secretary may:
    (1) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than 
$500,000, if the

[[Page 152]]

Secretary determines that the person committed such violation willfully;
    (2) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than 
$75,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person 
committeed such violation in disregard of such provision or regulation; 
or
    (3) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than 
$50,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person 
should have known that the action constituted a violation.
    (c) Penalties not exclusive and judicial review. A penalty assessed 
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall not be exclusive of any 
other penalty provided by law, and shall be subject to review in an 
appropriate United States district court.


<R05>
Sec. 223.197  Civil penalty assessment procedures.

    Adjudicatory procedures for hearing alleged violations of this Act 
and its implementing regulations and assessing penalties shall be 
conducted under the rules of practice governing formal adjudicatory 
proceedings instituted by the Secretary. Such procedures are found at 7 
CFR 1.130, et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 223.198  Administrative remedies.

    In addition to possible debarment action provided under subpart C of 
this part, the Chief of the Forest Service, or other official to whom 
such authority is delegated, may cancel any timber sale contract entered 
into with a person found to have violated the Act or regulations issued 
under the Act. Such a finding shall constitute a serious violation of 
contract terms pursuant to Sec. 223.116(a)(1) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 223.199  Procedures for cooperating with other agencies.

    The Regional Foresters may enter into agreements to cooperate with 
the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defense, and other 
Federal, State and local agencies for monitoring, surveillance and 
enforcing the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 223.200  Determinations of surplus species.

    (a) Determinations that specific quantities of grades and species 
are surplus to domestic manufacturing needs and withdrawals of such 
determinations shall be made in accordance with title 5, United States 
Code, section 553.
    (b) Review of a determination shall be made at least once in every 
3-year period. Notice of such review shall be published in the Federal 
Register. The public shall have no less than 30 days to submit comments 
on the review.
    (c) Alaska yellow cedar and Port Orford cedar, which the Secretary 
of Agriculture found to be surplus to domestic processing needs pursuant

continue in that status until new determinations are published.


<R05>
Sec. 223.201  Limitations on unprocessed timber harvested in Alaska.

    Unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands in Alaska may 
not be exported from the United States or shipped to other States 
without prior approval of the Regional Forester. This requirement is 
necessary to ensure the development and continued existence of adequate 
wood processing capacity in Alaska for the sustained utilization of 
timber from the National Forests which are geographically isolated from 
other processing facilities. In determining whether consent will be 
given for the export of timber, consideration will be given to, among 
other things, whether such export will:
    (a) Permit more complete utilization on areas being logged primarily 
for local manufacture,
    (b) Prevent loss or serious deterioration of logs unsalable locally 
because of an unforeseen loss of market,
    (c) Permit the salvage of timber damaged by wind, insects, fire or 
other catastrophe,
    (d) Bring into use a minor species of little importance to local 
industrial development, or

[[Page 153]]

    (e) Provide material required to meet urgent and unusual needs of 
the Nation. (16 U.S.C. 472a; 16 U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 616)


<R05>
Sec. 223.202  Information requirements.

    (a) The procedures in Sec. Sec. 223.189 and 223.192, and some of the 
procedures in Sec. 223.190 were approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) and assigned Control Number 0596-0114 upon issuance of the 
interim rule. Control Number 0596-0114 has been reapproved by OMB for 
use through May 31, 1997. OMB approved the information collection 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 223.191 and 223.203 for use through August 31, 
1995, and assigned them Control Number 0596-0115. OMB approved the 
information collection requirements in Sec. Sec. 223.48 and 223.87 for 
use through March 31, 1997 and assigned them Control Number 0596-0021; 
the information collection requirements in Sec. Sec. 223.48 and 223.87 
have been revised. OMB Control Numbers 0596-0114, 0596-0115, and 0596-
0021 have been consolidated under OMB Control Number 0596-0114.
    (b) The application and reporting procedures in Sec. Sec. 223.187, 
223.193, 223.194, 223.195, and some of the procedures in Sec. 223.190 of 
this final rule contain new record keeping and reporting requirements as 
defined in 5 CFR part 1320 and, therefore, impose additional paperwork 
burdens on the affected public. The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has approved these requirements, and assigned them Control Number 
0596-0114.


<R05>
Sec. 223.203  Indirect substitution exception for National Forest System timber from within Washington State.

inspection upon the request of the Regional Forester or other official 
to whom such authority has been delegated. I make this certification 
with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of the Act and 
do fully understand that if this application is approved, the amount of 
exception granted under this approval may not be exceeded in any one 
fiscal year, and do fully understand that if such exception is exceeded 
I will be in violation of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), and I may be 
subject to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation. 
Further, I do fully understand that such violation may subject me to the 
penalty of perjury pursuant to the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 
1001).'';

publication in the Federal Register.
    (5) Prospective applicants could review Department records upon 
request prior to the deadline for submitting applications. An applicant 
could voluntarily submit information documenting the amount of purchases 
of unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands 
within Washington State. The Department then determined which amount is 
higher, verified by either the Department's records or the applicant's 
records. The Department then determined the applicant's portion of the 
50 million board feet by determining the lesser of the amount verified 
by the records or 15 million board feet. Applicants could submit the 
information documenting the amount of purchases in the following manner:
    (i) Actual receipts for purchasing unprocessed timber from National 
Forest System lands within Washington State; or
    (ii) A statement by a certified public accountant of:
    (A) A summary by fiscal year for 1988, 1989 and 1990 of the 
applicant's acquisitions of timber originating from National Forest 
System lands in the State of Washington, listing total volume for each 
of the three fiscal years; and
    (B) The average volume for the three fiscal years. The volumes to be 
reported were the harvest volumes, except in the case of open sales. 
Advertised volumes had to be reported for open sales.
    (C) The certified public accountant must have certified to the 
following:

    ``I certify that under the penalties and remedies provided in 
Sec. 492 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the penalty of perjury provided 
in the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information 
provided in support of this application is, to the best of my knowledge 
and belief, a true, accurate, current, and complete statement of 
[applicant's company's name] National Forest System timber acquisitions 
originating from within the State of Washington for fiscal years 1988, 
1989 and/or 1990.''

must have been on the accountant's company letterhead, must have been 
notarized, and must have accompanied the applicant's application.
    (c) Selling and trading rights. The purchase limit right obtained 
under this rule may be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged with any 
other person subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Such rights may not be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged to 
persons already in possession of such rights:
    (2) Any person selling, trading, or exchanging any or all of the 
rights obtained under this rule shall advise the Regional Forester of 
the amount being traded and the name(s) of the person(s) acquiring such 
rights within 15 days of the transaction; and
    (3) No person may have or acquire more than 15 million board feet in 
one fiscal year.
    (d) Information collection. The application procedures in this 
section constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 
CFR part 1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0114.
    (e) Persons with approved shares. The application period for shares 
of the indirect substitution exception for acquiring unprocessed timber

                      Subpart A--Locatable Minerals


<R05>
Sec. 228.1  Purpose.

    It is the purpose of these regulations to set forth rules and 
procedures through which use of the surface of National Forest System 
lands in connection with operations authorized by the United States 
mining laws (30 U.S.C. 21-54), which confer a statutory right to enter 
upon the public lands to search for minerals, shall be conducted so as 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest System 
surface resources. It is not the purpose of these regulations to provide 
for the management of mineral resources; the responsibility for managing 
such resources is in the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 228.2  Scope.

    These regulations apply to operations hereafter conducted under the 
United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et 
seq.), as they affect surface resources on all National Forest System 
lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture to which 
such laws are applicable: Provided, however, That any area of National 
Forest lands covered by a special Act of Congress (16 U.S.C. 482a-482q) 
is subject to the provisions of this part and the provisions of the 
special act, and in the case of conflict the provisions of the special 
act shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 228.3  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part the following terms, respectively, 
shall mean:
    (a) Operations. All functions, work, and activities in connection 
with prospecting, exploration, development, mining or processing of 
mineral resources and all uses reasonably incident thereto, including 
roads and other means of access on lands subject to the regulations in 
this part, regardless of whether said operations take place on or off 
mining claims.
    (b) Operator. A person conducting or proposing to conduct 
operations.
    (c) Person. Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, 
or other legal entity.
    (d) Mining claim. Any unpatented mining claim or unpatented millsite 
authorized by the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended 
(30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.).
    (e) Authorized officer. The Forest Service officer to whom authority 
to review and approve operating plans has been delegated.


<R05>
Sec. 228.4  Plan of operations--notice of intent--requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a notice 
of intention to operate is required from any person proposing to conduct 
operations which might cause disturbance of surface resources. Such 
notice of intention shall be submitted to the District Ranger having 
jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted. If 
the District Ranger determines that such operations will likely cause 
significant disturbance of surface resources, the operator shall submit 
a proposed plan of operations to the District Ranger.
    (1) The requirements to submit a plan of operations shall not apply:
    (i) To operations which will be limited to the use of vehicles on 
existing public roads or roads used and maintained for National Forest 
purposes,
    (ii) To individuals desiring to search for and occasionally remove 
small mineral samples or specimens,
    (iii) To prospecting and sampling which will not cause significant 
surface resource disturbance and will not involve removal of more than a 
reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study,
    (iv) tT marking and monumenting a mining claim and
    (v) To subsurface operations which will not cause significant 
surface resource disturbance.
    (2) A notice of intent need not be filed:
    (i) Where a plan of operations is submitted for approval in lieu 
thereof,
    (ii) For operations excepted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
from the requirement to file a plan of operations,
    (iii) For operations which will not involve the use of mechanized 
earthmoving equipment such as bulldozers or backhoes and will not 
involve

[[Page 157]]

the cutting of trees. Each notice of intent to operate shall provide 
information sufficient to identify the area involved, the nature of the 
proposed operations, the route of access to the area of operations and 
the method of transport. If a notice of intent is filed, the District 
Ranger will, within 15 days of receipt thereof, notify the operator 
whether a plan of operations is required.
    (b) Any person conducting operations on the effective date of these 
regulations, who would have been required to submit a plan of operations 
under Sec. 228.4(a), may continue operations but shall within 120 days 
thereafter submit a plan of operations to the District Ranger having 
jurisdiction over the area within which operations are being conducted: 
Provided, however, That upon a showing of good cause the authorized 
officer will grant an extension of time for submission of a plan of 
operations, not to exceed an additional 6 months. Operations may 
continue according to the submitted plan during its review, unless the 
authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing irreparable damage to surface resources and advises 
the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. Upon 
approval of a plan of operations, operations shall be conducted in 
accordance with the approved plan. The requirement to submit a plan of 
operations shall not apply: (1) To operations excepted in Sec. 228.4(a) 
or (2) to operations concluded prior to the effective date of the 
regulations in this part.
    (c) The plan of operations shall include:
    (1) The name and legal mailing address of the operators (and 
claimants if they are not the operators) and their lessees, assigns, or 
designees.
    (2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the 
proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed 
roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations as 
set forth in Sec. 228.12 and the approximate location and size of areas 
where surface resources will be disturbed.
    (3) Information sufficient to describe or identify the type of 
operations proposed and how they would be conducted, the type and 
standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of 
transportation used or to be used as set forth in Sec. 228.12, the 
period during which the proposed activity will take place, and measures 
to be taken to meet the requirements for environmental protection in 
Sec. 228.8.
    (d) The plan of operations shall cover the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section, as foreseen for the entire operation for 
the full estimated period of activity: Provided, however, That if the 
development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible at the 
time of preparation of a plan, the operator shall file an initial plan 
setting forth his proposed operation to the degree reasonably 
foreseeable at that time, and shall thereafter file a supplemental plan 
or plans whenever it is proposed to undertake any significant surface 
disturbance not covered by the initial plan.
    (e) At any time during operations under an approved plan of 
operations, the authorized officer may ask the operator to furnish a 
proposed modification of the plan detailing the means of minimizing 
unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources. If the operator 
does not furnish a proposed modification within a time deemed reasonable 
by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to his 
immediate superior that the operator be required to submit a proposed 
modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer 
shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the 
supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon 
such recommendation, the immediate superior of the authorized officer 
shall determine:
    (1) Whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized 
officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations 
prior to approving the operating plan,
    (2) Whether the disturbance is or probably will become of such 
significance as to require modification of the operating plan in order 
to meet the requirements for environmental protection specified in 
Sec. 228.8 and

[[Page 158]]

    (3) Whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. 
Lacking such determination that unforeseen significant disturbance of 
surface resources is occurring or probable and that the disturbance can 
be minimized using reasonable means, no operator shall be required to 
submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. 
Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan until a 
modified plan is approved, unless the immediate superior of the 
authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing irreparable injury, loss or damage to surface 
resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid 
such damage.
    (f) Upon completion of an environmental analysis in connection with 
each proposed operating plan, the authorized officer will determine 
whether an environmental statement is required. Not every plan of 
operations, supplemental plan or modification will involve the 
preparation of an environmental statement. Environmental impacts will 
vary substantially depending on whether the nature of operations is 
prospecting, exploration, development, or processing, and on the scope 
of operations (such as size of operations, construction required, length 
of operations and equipment required), resulting in varying degrees of 
disturbance to vegetative resources, soil, water, air, or wildlife. The 
Forest Service will prepare any environmental statements that may be 
required.
    (g) The information required to be included in a notice of intent or 
a plan of operations, or supplement or modification thereto, has been 
assigned Office of Management and Budget Control 0596-0022. The public 
reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary 
from a few minutes for an activity involving little or no surface 
disturbance to several months for activities involving heavy capital 
investments and significant surface disturbance, with an average of 2 
hours per individual response. This includes time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other 
aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for 
reducing this burden, to Chief (2800), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 
96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090 and to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 
20503.

<R05>
Sec. 228.5  Plan of operations--approval.

    (a) Operations shall be conducted in accordance with an approved 
plan of operations, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section 
and in Sec. 228.4 (a), (b), and (e). A proposed plan of operation shall 
be submitted to the District Ranger, who shall promptly acknowledge 
receipt thereof to the operator. The authorized officer shall, within 
thirty (30) days of such receipt, analyze the proposal, considering the 
economics of the operation along with the other factors in determining 
the reasonableness of the requirements for surface resource protection, 
and;
    (1) Notify the operator that he has approved the plan of operations; 
or
    (2) Notify the operator that the proposed operations are such as not 
to require an operating plan; or
    (3) Notify the operator of any changes in, or additions to, the plan 
of operations deemed necessary to meet the purpose of the regulations in 
this part; or
    (4) Notify the operator that the plan is being reviewed, but that 
more time, not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days, is necessary to 
complete such review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is 
needed: Provided, however, That days during which the area of operations 
is inaccessible for inspection shall not be included when computing the 
sixty (60) day period; or
    (5) Notify the operator that the plan cannot be approved until a 
final environmental statement has been prepared and filed with the 
Council on Environmental Quality as provided in Sec. 228.4(f).
    (b) Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized 
officer will approve such operations as may be necessary for timely 
compliance with

[[Page 159]]

the requirements of Federal and State laws, so long as such operations 
are conducted so as to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by 
the authorized officer in accordance with the standards contained in 
Sec. 228.8.
    (c) A supplemental plan or plans of operations provided for in 
Sec. 228.4(d) and a modification of an approved operating plan as 
provided for in Sec. 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the 
authorized officer in the same manner as the initial plan of operations: 
Provided, however, That a modification of an approved plan of operations 
under Sec. 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the immediate 
superior of the authorized officer in cases where it has been determined 
that a modification is required.
    (d) In the provisions for review of operating plans, the Forest 
Service will arrange for consultation with appropriate agencies of the 
Department of the Interior with respect to significant technical 
questions concerning the character of unique geologic conditions and 
special exploration and development systems, techniques, and equipment, 
and with respect to mineral values, mineral resources, and mineral 
reserves. Further, the operator may request the Forest Service to 
arrange for similar consultations with appropriate agencies of the U.S. 
Department of the Interior for a review of operating plans.


<R05>
Sec. 228.6  Availability of information to the public.

    Except as provided herein, all information and data submitted by an 
operator pursuant to the regulations in this part shall be available for 
examination by the public at the Office of the District Ranger in 
accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR 1.1-1.6 and 36 CFR 200.5-200.10. 
Specifically identified information and data submitted by the operator 
as confidential concerning trade secrets or privileged commercial or 
financial information will not be available for public examination. 
Information and data to be withheld from public examination may include, 
but is not limited to, known or estimated outline of the mineral 
deposits and their location, attitude, extent, outcrops, and content, 
and the known or planned location of exploration pits, drill holes, 
excavations pertaining to location and entry pursuant to the United 
States mining laws, and other commercial information which relates to 
competitive rights of the operator.


<R05>
Sec. 228.7  Inspection, noncompliance.

    (a) Forest Officers shall periodically inspect operations to 
determine if the operator is complying with the regulations in this part 
and an approved plan of operations.
    (b) If an operator fails to comply with the regulations or his 
approved plan of operations and the noncompliance is unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing injury, loss or damage to surface resources the 
authorized officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the 
operator or his agent in person or by certified mail. Such notice shall 
describe the noncompliance and shall specify the action to comply and 
the time within which such action is to be completed, generally not to 
exceed thirty (30) days: Provided, however, That days during which the 
area of operations is inaccessible shall not be included when computing 
the number of days allowed for compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 228.8  Requirements for environmental protection.

    All operations shall be conducted so as, where feasible, to minimize 
adverse environmental impacts on National Forest surface resources, 
including the following requirements:

    (5) Rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife habitat.
    (h) Certification or other approval issued by State agencies or 
other Federal agencies of compliance with laws and regulations relating 
to mining operations will be accepted as compliance with similar or 
parallel requirements of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 228.9  Maintenance during operations, public safety.

    During all operations operator shall maintain his structures, 
equipment, and other facilities in a safe, neat and workmanlike manner. 
Hazardous sites or conditions resulting from operations shall be marked 
by signs, fenced or otherwise identified to protect the public in 
accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 228.10  Cessation of operations, removal of structures and equipment.

    Unless otherwise agreed to by the authorized officer, operator shall 
remove within a reasonable time following cessation of operations all 
structures, equipment and other facilities and clean up the site of 
operations. Other than seasonally, where operations have ceased 
temporarily, an operator shall file a statement with the District Ranger 
which includes:
    (a) Verification of intent to maintain the structures, equipment and 
other facilities,
    (b) The expected reopening date, and
    (c) An estimate of extended duration of operations. A statement 
shall be filed every year in the event operations are not reactivated. 
Operator shall maintain the operating site, structures, equipment and 
other facilities in a neat and safe condition during nonoperating 
periods.


<R05>
Sec. 228.11  Prevention and control of fire.

    Operator shall comply with all applicable Federal and State fire 
laws and regulations and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent 
and suppress fires on the area of operations and shall require his 
employees, contractors and subcontractors to do likewise.


<R05>
Sec. 228.12  Access.

    An operator is entitled to access in connection with operations, but 
no

[[Page 161]]

road, trail, bridge, landing area for aircraft, or the like, shall be 
constructed or improved, nor shall any other means of access, including 
but not limited to off-road vehicles, be used until the operator has 
received approval of an operating plan in writing from the authorized 
officer when required by Sec. 228.4(a). Proposals for construction, 
improvement or use of such access as part of a plan of operations shall 
include a description of the type and standard of the proposed means of 
access, a map showing the proposed route of access, and a description of 
the means of transportation to be used. Approval of the means of such 
access as part of a plan of operations shall specify the location of the 
access route, design standards, means of transportation, and other 
conditions reasonably necessary to protect the environment and forest 
surface resources, including measures to protect scenic values and to 
insure against erosion and water or air pollution.


<R05>
Sec. 228.13  Bonds.

    (a) Any operator required to file a plan of operations shall, when 
required by the authorized officer, furnish a bond conditioned upon 
compliance with Sec. 228.8(g), prior to approval of such plan of 
operations. In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal 
depository, as directed by the Forest Service, and maintain therein, 
cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the bond or 
negotiable securities of the United States having market value at the 
time of deposit of not less than the required dollar amount of the bond. 
A blanket bond covering nationwide or statewide operations may be 
furnished if the terms and conditions thereof are sufficient to comply 
with the regulations in this part.
    (b) In determining the amount of the bond, consideration will be 
given to the estimated cost of stabilizing, rehabilitating, and 
reclaiming the area of operations.
    (c) In the event that an approved plan of operations is modified in 
accordance with Sec. 228.4 (d) and (e), the authorized officer will 
review the initial bond for adequacy and, if necessary, will adjust the 
bond to conform to the operations plan as modified.
    (d) When reclamation has been completed in accordance with 
Sec. 228.8(g), the authorized officer will notify the operator that 
performance under the bond has been completed: Provided, however, That 
when the Forest Service has accepted as completed any portion of the 
reclamation, the authorized officer shall notify the operator of such 
acceptance and reduce proportionally the amount of bond thereafter to be 
required with respect to the remaining reclamation.

<R05>
Sec. 228.15  Operations within National Forest Wilderness.

    (a) The United States mining laws shall extend to each National 
Forest Wilderness for the period specified in the Wilderness Act and 
subsequent establishing legislation to the same extent they were 
applicable prior to the date the Wilderness was designated by Congress 
as a part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Subject to 
valid existing rights, no person shall have any right or interest in or 
to any mineral deposits which may be discovered through prospecting or 
other information-gathering activity after the legal date on which the 
United States mining laws cease to apply to the specific Wilderness.
    (b) Holders of unpatented mining claims validly established on any 
National Forest Wilderness prior to inclusion of such unit in the 
National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights 
provided by the United States mining laws as then applicable to the 
National Forest land involved. Persons locating mining claims in any 
National Forest Wilderness on or after the date on which said Wilderness 
was included in the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be 
accorded the rights provided by the

[[Page 162]]

United States mining laws as applicable to the National Forest land 
involved and subject to provisions specified in the establishing 
legislation. Persons conducting operations as defined in Sec. 228.3 in 
National Forest Wilderness shall comply with the regulations in this 
part. Operations shall be conducted so as to protect National Forest 
surface resources in accordance with the general purposes of maintaining 
the National Wilderness Preservation System unimpaired for future use 
and enjoyment as wilderness and to preserve its wilderness character, 
consistent with the use of the land for mineral location, exploration, 
development, drilling, and production and for transmission lines, water 
lines, telephone lines, and processing operations, including, where 
essential, the use of mechanized transport, aircraft or motorized 
equipment.
    (c) Persons with valid mining claims wholly within National Forest 
Wilderness shall be permitted access to such surrounded claims by means 
consistent with the preservation of National Forest Wilderness which 
have been or are being customarily used with respect to other such 
claims surrounded by National Forest Wilderness. No operator shall 
construct roads across National Forest Wilderness unless authorized in 
writing by the Forest Supervisor in accordance with Sec. 228.12.
    (d) On all mining claims validly established on lands within the

<R05>
Sec. 228.41  Scope.

    (a) Lands to which this subpart applies. This subpart applies to all 
National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain of the 
United States, including public domain lands being administered under 
the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010); to 
all National Forest System lands acquired pursuant to the Weeks Act of 
March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961); to all National Forest System lands with 
Weeks Act status as provided in the Act of September 2, 1958 (16 U.S.C. 
521a); and to public lands within the Copper River addition to the 
Chugach National Forest (16 U.S.C. 539a). For ease of reference and 
convenience to the reader, these lands are referred to, throughout this 
subpart, as National Forest lands.
    (b) Restrictions. Disposal of mineral materials from the following 
National Forest lands is subject to certain restrictions as described 
below:
    (1) Segregation or withdrawals in aid of other agencies. Disposal of 
mineral materials from lands segregated or withdrawn in aid of a 
function of another Federal agency, State, territory, county, 
municipality, water district, or other governmental subdivision or 
agency may be made only with the written consent of the governmental 
entity.
    (2) Segregated or withdrawn National Forest lands. Mineral materials 
may not be removed from segregated or withdrawn lands where removal is 
specifically prohibited by statute or by public land order. Where not 
specifically prohibited, removal of mineral materials may be allowed if 
the authorized officer determines that the removal is not detrimental to 
the values for which the segregation or withdrawal was made, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Where operations have been 
established prior to the effective date of this Subpart and where not 
prohibited by statute, they may be permitted to continue. Nothing in 
this subparagraph is intended to prohibit the exercise of valid existing 
rights.
    (3) Unpatented mining claims. Provided that claimants are given 
prior notice and it has been determined that removal will neither 
endanger nor materially interfere with prospecting, mining, or 
processing operations or uses reasonably incident thereto on the claims, 
disposal of mineral materials may be allowed from:
    (i) Unpatented mining claims located after July 23, 1955; and/or
    (ii) Unpatented mining claims located before July 23, 1955, and on 
which the United States has established the right to manage the 
vegetative and other surface resources in accordance with the Multiple 
Use Mining Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 601, 603, 611-615).
    (4) Acquired Bankhead-Jones lands. Mineral materials on lands which 
were acquired under the authority of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act 
of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010-1012), and which lie outside the 
exterior boundaries of National Forests, or on acquired lands which are 
being administered under the Act and which also lie outside the exterior 
boundaries of National Forests, may be disposed of under these 
regulations only to public authorities and agencies, and only on 
condition that the mineral materials are used for public purposes (7 
U.S.C. 1011(c)).
    (c) Mineral materials to which this subpart applies. This subpart 
applies to mineral materials which consist of petrified wood and common 
varieties of sand, gravel, stone, pumice, pumicite, cinders, clay, and 
other similar materials. Such mineral materials include deposits which, 
although they have economic value, are used for agriculture, animal 
husbandry, building, abrasion, construction, landscaping, and similar 
uses. This subpart also applies to other materials which may not be 
minerals but are produced using mining methods, such as peat. The 
categories of these materials, including representative examples, are:
    (1) Agricultural supply and animal husbandry materials. This 
category includes, but is not limited to, minerals and vegetative 
materials used as or for: Soil conditioners or amendments applied to 
physically alter soil properties

[[Page 164]]

such as direct applications to the soil of carbonate rocks, soil 
containing ``trace elements'' and peat; animal feed supplements; and 
other animal care products.
    (2) Building materials. Except for minerals identified as Uncommon 
Varieties, this category includes, but is not limited to, minerals used 
as or for: Paint fillers or extenders; flagstone, ashlar, rubble, 
mortar, brick, tile, pipe, pottery, earthenware, stoneware, terrazzo, 
and other nonstructural components in floors, walls, roofs, fireplaces, 
and the like; and similar building uses.
    (3) Abrasive materials. This category includes, but is not limited 
to, minerals used for: Filing; scouring; polishing; sanding; and 
sandblasting.
    (4) Construction materials. This category includes, but is not 
limited to, minerals such as sand, gravel, clay, crushed rock and 
cinders used as or for fill; borrow; rip-rap; ballast (including all 
ballast for railroad use); road base; road surfacing; concrete 
aggregate; clay sealants; and similar construction uses.
    (5) Landscaping materials: This category includes, but is not 
limited to minerals and peat used as or for: Chips, granules, sand, 
pebbles, scoria, cinders, cobbles, boulders, slabs, and other components 
in retaining walls, walkways, patios, yards, gardens, and the like; and 
similar landscaping uses.
    (d) Minerals not covered by this subpart. Mineral materials do not 
include any mineral used in manufacturing, industrial processing, or 
chemical operations for which no other mineral can be substituted due to 
unique properties giving the particular mineral a distinct and special 
value; nor do they include block pumice which in nature occurs in pieces 
having one dimension of two inches or more which is valuable and used 
for some application that requires such dimensions. Disposal of minerals 
not covered by this subpart is subject to the terms of the United States 
Mining Laws, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), on those portions of the 
National Forest System where those laws apply. Such minerals may 
include:
    (1) Mineral suitable and used as soil amendment because of a 
constituent element other than calcium or magnesium carbonate that 
chemically alters the soil;
    (2) Limestone suitable and used, without substantial admixtures, for 
cement manufacture, metallurgy, production of quicklime, sugar refining, 
whiting, fillers, paper manufacture, and desulfurization of stack gases;
    (3) Silica suitable and used for glass manufacture, production of 
metallic silicon, flux, and rock wool;
    (4) Alumino-silicates or clays having exceptional qualities suitable 
and used for production of aluminum, ceramics, drilling mud, taconite 
binder, foundry castings, and other purposes for which common clays 
cannot be used;
    (5) Gypsum suitable and used for wallboard, plaster, or cement.
    (6) Block pumice which occurs in nature in pieces having one 
dimension of two inches or more and which is valuable and used for some 
application that requires such dimensions; and
    (7) Stone recognized through marketing factors for its special and 
distinct properties of strength and durability making it suitable for 
structural support and used for that purpose.
    (e) Limitations on applicability. (1) The provisions of paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to any mining claims for 
which a Mineral Entry Final Certificate was issued on or before January 
16, 1991. Nor shall these provisions apply to any mining claim located 
on or before July 23, 1955, which has satisfied the marketability test 
for locatable minerals from on or before July 23, 1955, until the 
present date.
    (2) A use which qualifies a mineral as an uncommon variety under 
paragraph (d) overrides classification of that mineral as a common 
variety under paragraph (c) of this section.

contained in 36 CFR part 212, depending upon their planned extent of 
road use.
    (f) Reclamation. Requirements for reclamation of areas disturbed by 
mineral material operations must be included in contracts and permits, 
except for disposals from community sites and common-use areas.


<R05>
Sec. 228.48  Appraisal and measurement.

    (a) Appraisal. All mineral materials for sale must be appraised to 
determine fair market value. Appraisals must be

[[Page 167]]

based on knowledge of the extent of the deposit, quality of material, 
and economic value. A sale must not be made at less than the appraised 
value which may be expressed as either price per cubic yard or weight 
equivalent. In all cases the units of measurement must correspond to the 
units used in the appraisal. The authorized officer must estimate and 
record the amount and value of minerals to be disposed of by free-use 
permit.
    (b) Measurement. The amount of mineral material actually removed may 
be measured by volume, weight, truck tally, by combination of these 
methods, or by such other form of measurement as the authorized officer 
determines to be appropriate and in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 228.49  Reappraisal.

    If an extension of time is granted as provided in Sec. 228.53(b), 
the authorized officer must reappraise or reestimate the mineral 
materials covered by the contract or permit and which remain unexcavated 
at the time of extension. The recalculated unit value becomes the new 
unit value for the remaining unexcavated material; excavated and 
stockpiled material is not subject to reappraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 228.50  Production records.

    At least annually, the purchaser or permittee must furnish a record 
of the volume extracted, in cubic yards or weight equivalent, to the 
authorized officer. The units of measurement must correspond to the 
units used in the appraisal or estimate.


<R05>
Sec. 228.51  Bonding.

    (a) Bond requirements. Before operations may begin under any 
contract or permit, a bond must be furnished to the authorized officer 
to ensure performance of payment (as necessary), reclamation, and other 
conditions of the contract or permit, except as noted in paragraphs (a) 
(1) and (3) of this section, where the authorized officer may waive such 
bonding. If an extension of time is granted as provided in 
Sec. 228.53(b), the bond requirements must be recalculated and changed 
accordingly.
    (1) For advance payment contracts for 10,000 cubic yards or more in 
volume (or weight equivalent), a bond of not less than 10 percent of the 
total contract price or the value of the estimated annual production 
(whichever is less), plus the reclamation cost for the area covered by 
annual mining, is required. When the total volume is less than 10,000 
cubic yards, bond requirements, if any, are at the discretion of the 
authorized officer.
    (2) For any defered payment contract, a bond equalling the value of 
the estimated annual production plus the reclamation cost for the area 
covered by annual mining is required.
    (3) For free use, the authorized officer may require a reclamation 
bond which must be sufficient to cover the cost of reclamation of the 
anticipated annual work.
    (b) Types of bonding. A bond must be one of the following:
    (1) A bond of a corporate surety shown on the latest approved list 
issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and executed on an approved 
standard form;
    (2) A cash bond;
    (3) Negotiable securities of the United States;
    (4) An irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the Forest 
Service;
    (5) A performance bond required by other Forest Service contracts or 
permits, provided the bond covers the performance and reclamation 
requirements related to the removal of mineral material from a 
designated pit or area for use in the performance of the contract or 
permit; or
    (6) Any other types of bond specified in the Forest Service Manual.


<R05>
Sec. 228.52  Assignments.

    (a) Limitations. A purchaser or permittee may not assign the 
contract or permit, or any interest therein, without the written 
approval of the authorized officer.
    (b) Requirements of assignee. The authorized officer will not 
approve any proposed assignment involving contract or permit performance 
unless the assignee:

[[Page 168]]

    (1) Submits information necessary to assure the authorized officer 
of the assignee's ability to meet the same requirements as the original 
purchaser or permittee (assignor); and
    (2) Furnishes a bond or obtains a commitment from the previous 
surety to be bound by the assignment when approved.
    (c) Rights and obligations. Once the authorized officer approves an 
assignment, the assignee is entitled to all the rights and is subject to 
all of the obligations under the contract or permit, and the original 
purchaser or permittee may be released from any further responsiblity 
under the contract or permit.


<R05>
Sec. 228.53  Term.

    (a) Time allowed. Except as provided in Sec. 228.61(f), 
Sec. 228.62(b), and elsewhere in this paragraph, a contract or permit 
may not exceed 1 year from the effective date of the contract or permit 
unless a written extension is obtained. For those mineral materials sold 
under a duration of production contract or under a contract for the sale 
of all mineral material within a specified area, or under a construction 
contract where removal cannot reasonably take place before completion of 
other work under the same contract, the authorized officer will 
establish a reasonable time period for removal.
    (b) Extension of time. If it is shown that a delay in removal was 
due to causes beyond the control of the purchaser or permittee, the 
authorized officer may grant an extension, not to exceed 1 year, upon 
written request. Written requests for extensions of contracts must be 
received between 30 and 90 days before the expiration date of the 
contract. Written requests for extensions of permits must be received 
between 15 and 90 days before the permit expiration date. The authorized 
officer may grant a total of two extensions for contracts and permits.


<R05>
Sec. 228.54  Single entry sales or permits.

    The purchaser or permittee is required to reclaim a single entry 
source in accordance with an approved operating plan which describes 
operating procedures and reclamation measures, unless the requirement is 
waived by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 228.55  Cancellation or suspension.

    The authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or 
prospecting permit if the purchaser or permitte fails to comply with its 
terms and conditions. If the noncompliance is unnecessarily or 
unreasonably causing injury, loss, or damage to surface resources, the 
authorized officer may cancel or suspend the contract, permit, or 
prospecting permit immediately. In cases where noncompliance is of a 
less serious nature, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend a 
contract, permit, or prospecting permit it such noncompliance continues 
for 30 days after service of written notice by the authorized officer. 
If the noncompliance is not corrected, the authorized officer may attach 
the bond to ensure compliance with the provisions of the contract, 
permit, or prospecting permit.


<R05>
Sec. 228.56  Operating plans.

    Any surface-disturbing operation under a contract, permit, or 
prospecting permit is subject to prior approval by the authorized 
officer of an operating plan and to reasonable conditions as may be 
required to ensure proper protection of the environment and 
improvements, including timely reclamation of disturbed lands. 
Significant changes to operations require prior approval of an amended 
operating plan. The operating plan must include, as a minimum, a map and 
explanation of the nature of the access, anticipated activity, surface 
disturbance, and intended reclamation including removal or retention of 
structures and facilities. Operating plans must be submitted by the 
purchaser, permittee, or prospecting permittee, except as noted in 
Sec. 228.64(b).

                      Types and Methods of Disposal

    (a) Invitation for bid. Sales must be conducted as described below 
after inviting competitive bids through publication and posting. The 
authorized officer may not offer a competitive sale unless there is a 
right-of-way or other access to the sale area which is available to 
anyone qualified to bid.
    (b) Advertising--(1) Sales over 25,000 cubic yards. Mineral material 
sales offered by competitive bidding and which exceed 25,000 cubic yards 
must be advertised on the same day once a week for two consecutive weeks 
in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the material is 
located, and in a trade or industrial newspaper when considered 
appropriate. Notice of the sale must be posted in a conspicuous place in 
the office where bids are to be submitted. In addition, the authorized 
officer may send the advertisement directly to known interested persons. 
Bids may be received but not evaluated before the end of the advertising 
period, which may be extended at the discretion of the authorized 
officer.
    (2) Content of advertising. The advertisement of sale must specify 
the location by legal description of the tract or tracts or by any other 
means identify the location of the mineral material deposit being 
offered, the kind of material, estimated quantities, the unit of 
measurement, appraised price (which sets the minimum acceptable bid), 
time and place for receiving and opening of bids, minimum deposit 
required, major special constraints due to environmental considerations, 
available access, maintenance required over haul routes, traffic 
controls, required use permits, required qualifications of bidders, the 
method of bidding, bonding requirement, notice of the right to reject 
any or all bids, the office where a copy of the contract and additional 
information may be obtained, and additional information the authorized 
officer deems necessary.
    (3) Advertising smaller sales. Advertisement of mineral materials 
amounting to 25,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) or less 
must be published and/or posted. The methods of advertisement are at the 
discretion of the authorized officer.
    (c) Conduct of sales. (1) Bidding at competitive sales may be 
conducted by the submission of written sealed bids, oral bids, or a 
combination of both as directed by the authorized officer. In the event 
of a tie in high sealed bids, the highest bidder will be determined by 
oral auction among those tied bidders; when no oral bid is higher that 
the sealed bids, the selected bidder will be determined by lot, the 
purchase price being the amount of the tied bid. For all oral auctions, 
including those used to break sealed-bid ties, the high bidder must 
confirm the bid in writing immediately upon being declared the high 
bidder. The authorized officer must mail notification of the bidding 
results to all bidders within 10 days.
    (2) The authorized officer may require bidders to furnish evidence 
of qualification at the time of award or, if such evidence has already 
been furnished and is still valid, make appropriate reference to the 
record containing it.
    (3) When it is in the interest of the United States to do so, the 
authorized officer may reject any or all bids.

[[Page 170]]

    (d) Bid deposits and award of contract. Sealed bids must be 
accompanied by a deposit. For mineral materials offered at oral auction, 
bidders must make the deposit before opening of the bidding.
    (1) Bid deposits must be equal to 10 percent of the appraised value 
but not less than $100.00.
    (2) Bid deposits must be in the form of cash, money order, bank 
drafts, cashier's or certified checks made payable to the Forest 
Service, or bonds acceptable to the Forest Service (Sec. 228.51(b)).
    (3) Upon conclusion of the bidding, the authorized officer will 
return the deposits of all unsuccessful bidders. The successful bidder's 
deposit will be applied toward the purchase price. If the contract is 
not awarded to the high bidder due to an inability to perform the 
obligations of the contract, the deposit, less expenses and damages 
incurred by the United States, may be returned. The return of a deposit 
does not prejudice any other rights or remedies of the United States. 
The contract may be offered and awarded to the next successive qualified 
high bidder, or, at the discretion of the authorized officer, the sale 
may be either readvertised or negotiated if it is determined that a 
competitive sale is impracticable.
    (4) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the successful 
bidder must sign and return the contract, together with any required 
bond, unless the authorized officer has granted an extension for an 
additional 30 days. The bidder must apply for the extension in writing 
within the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to return 
the contract within the first 30-day period or within an approved 
extension, the bid deposit, less the costs of readvertising and damages, 
may be returned without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the 
United States.
    (5) All sales must be processed on Forest Service-approved contract 
forms. The authorized officer may add provisions to the contract to 
cover conditions peculiar to the sale area. Such additional provisions 
must be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the 
advertising period.


<R05>
Sec. 228.59  Negotiated or noncompetitive sales.

    (a) Volume limitations. When it is determined by the authorized 
officer to be in the public interest and when it is impracticable to 
obtain competition, mineral materials not exceeding 100,000 cubic yards 
in volume (or weight equivalent) may be sold in any one sale at not less 
than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, 
except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The 
authorized officer may not approve noncompetitive sales that exceed the 
total of 200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) made in any one 
State for the benefit of any applicant in any period of 12 consecutive 
months.
    (b) Government programs. In connection with a public works 
improvement project on behalf of a Federal, State, or local governmental 
agency, the authorized officer may sell to an applicant, at not less 
than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, a 
volume of mineral materials not to exceed 200,000 cubic yards (or weight 
equivalent) when the public exigency will not permit delays incident to 
advertising (30 U.S.C. 602).
    (c) Appropriation for highway purposes. For interstate and/or 
Federal aid highways, the Secretary of Transportation may appropriate 
any volume in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 107 and 317.
    (d) Use in development of Federal mineral leases. When it is 
determined to be impracticable to obtain competition and the mineral 
materials are to be used in connection with the development of mineral 
leases issued by the United States (Sec. 228.44), the authorized officer 
may sell to a leaseholder a volume of mineral material not to exceed 
200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) in one State in any period of 
12 consecutive months. No charge will be made for materials which must 
be moved in the process of extracting the mineral under lease, as long 
as the materials remain stockpiled within the boundaries of the leased 
area.
    (e) Exceptions. (1) The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize 
the noncompetitive sale of mineral materials in excess of the volume 
limitations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section when 
necessary to:

[[Page 171]]

    (i) Respond to an emergency affecting public health, safety or 
property;
    (ii) Prevent the curtailment of operations conducted under the 
United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et 
seq.) which generate large volumes of mineral materials as a by-product; 
or
    (iii) Respond to a critical public need for the prompt development 
of a mineral lease issued by the United States or a mining claim located 
under the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 
U.S.C. 22 et seq.).
    (2) Any noncompetitive sale of mineral materials in excess of the 
volume limitations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) shall be subject to 
such restrictions as the Chief of the Forest Service determines to be in 
the public interest.
    (3) Nothing in this paragraph shall otherwise alter the requirements 
of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

[49 FR 29784, July 24, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 10565, Apr. 2, 1987; 53 
FR 43691, Oct. 28, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 228.60  Prospecting permits.

    (a) Right conferred. On acquired National Forest lands, prospecting 
permits may be issued which grant the permittee the exclusive right to 
explore for and to demonstrate the existence of a suitable mineral 
material deposit when existing information is insufficient. After the 
demonstration of a suitable deposit and confirmation of this by the 
authorized officer, the permittee will have a preference right to apply 
for a negotiated sale.
    (b) Limitations. Mineral material may be removed from lands under a 
prospecting permit only to the extent necessary for testing and analysis 
or for the demonstration of the existence of a suitable deposit.
    (c) Environmental analysis. Prospecting permits will be issued only 
after submission by applicant and approval by the authorized officer of 
a detailed operating plan. The authorized officer may require a bond in 
accordance with Sec. 228.51. The authorized officer must ensure 
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.).
    (d) Acreage and permit limitations. A prospecting permit may not 
cover more than 640 acres. No individual or group may have an interest 
at any one time in more than three prospecting permits on Forest Service 
lands administered by one Forest Supervisor.
    (e) Duration and extension of permits. Prospecting permits may be 
issued for a period not to exceed 24 months, but they may be extended 
once for up to an additional 24 months if necessary to complete 
prospecting. Any application for extension must be submitted no later 
than 30 days before the expiration of the permit. The application for 
extension must provide evidence of diligence and state the reasons why 
additional time is considered necessary to complete prospecting work.
    (f) Refusal to extend permits. The authorized officer may reject 
applications for extension of prospecting permits for the following 
reasons:
    (1) Failure to perform. Failure of the permittee to perform 
prospecting or exploration work without adequate justification may 
result in the denial of an extension; or
    (2) Failure to apply. If an application for extension is not 
submitted within the specified period, the permit may expire without 
notice to the permittee.
    (3) Public interest. If the authorized officer determines that an 
extension may not be in the public interest, the application may be 
rejected.


<R05>
Sec. 228.61  Preference right negotiated sales.

    (a) Qualification for sale. When applying for a preference right 
negotiated sale, the permittee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the authorized officer that a suitable deposit of mineral material has 
been discovered within the area covered by the prospecting permit. 
Information concerning trade secrets and financial matters submitted by 
the permittee and identified as confidential will not be available for 
public examination except as otherwise agreed upon by the permittee.
    (b) Application for sale. The application must be submitted to the 
District Ranger's office on or before the expiration date of the 
prospecting permit or its extension. The authorized officer may grant 30 
additional days for submitting the application if requested in

[[Page 172]]

writing by the permittee before expiration of the prospecting permit or 
its extension.
    (c) Terms and conditions of contract. The terms and conditions will 
be evaluated on an individual case basis. Only those mineral materials 
specified in the contract may be removed by the purchaser. Before a 
preference right negotiated contract is awarded, the authorized officer 
must ensure that an environmental analysis is conducted. All contracts 
are subject to the conditions under Secs. 228.47 through 228.56.
    (d) Acreage limitations. The authorized officer will determine the 
amount of acreage in the preference right negotiated sale based on a 
presentation of the permittee's needs. The maximum acreage allowable to 
any individual or group must not exceed 320 acres on National Forest 
lands administered by one Forest Supervisor. The allowable acreage may 
be in one or more units which are not necessarily contiguous.
    (e) Volume limitations. Preference right negotiated sales are exempt 
from volume limitations.
    (f) Contract time allowable. A contract or a renewal must not exceed 
5 years; however, the purchaser may have renewal options at the end of 
each contract or renewal period. The authorized officer may renew a 
contract if it is determined that the renewal is not detrimental to the 
public interest and that the purchaser has demonstrated diligence in 
conducting operations. The authorized officer may cancel the contract, 
or the purchaser may forfeit the contract, if no substantial commercial 
production occurs during any continuous 2-year period after the award of 
the contract or if the contract terms and conditions are breached. 
However, if a delay is caused by conditions beyond the purchaser's 
control, the authorized officer may grant an extension equal to the lost 
time.
    (g) Contract renewal reappraisal. At the time of contract renewal, 
the authorized officer will reappraise the mineral material deposit in 
accordance with Sec. 228.49.


<R05>
Sec. 228.62  Free use.

    (a) Application. An application for a free-use permit must be made 
with the appropriate District Ranger's office.
    (b) Term. Permits may be issued for periods not to exceed 1 year and 
will terminate on the expiration date unless extended by the authorized 
officer as in Sec. 228.53(b). However, the authorized officer may issue 
permits to any local, State, Federal, or Territorial agency, unit or 
subdivision, including municipalities and county road districts, for 
periods up to 10 years.
    (c) Removal by agent. A free-use permittee may extract the mineral 
materials through a designated agent provided that the conditions of the 
permit are not violated. No part of the material may be used as payment 
for the services of an agent in obtaining or processing the material. A 
permit may be issued in the name of a designated agent for those 
entities listed in Sec. 228.62(d)(1), at the discretion of the 
authorized officer, provided there is binding agreement in which the 
entity retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 
conditions of the permit.
    (d) Conditions. Free-use permits may be issued for mineral materials 
to settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors for uses other than 
commercial purposes, resale, or barter (16 U.S.C. 477). Free-use permits 
may be issued to local, State, Federal, or Territorial agencies, units, 
or subdivisions, including municipalities, or any association or 
corporation not organized for profit, for other than commercial or 
industrial purposes or resale (30 U.S.C. 601). Free-use permits may not 
be issued when, in the judgment of the authorized officer, the applicant 
owns or controls an adequate supply of mineral material in the area of 
demand. The free-use permit, issued on a Forest Service-approved form, 
must include the basis for the free-use as well as the provisions 
governing the selection, removal, and use of the mineral materials. No 
mineral material may be removed until the permit is issued. The 
permittee must notify the authorized officer upon completion of mineral 
material removal. The permittee must complete the reclamation prescibed 
in the operating plan (Sec. 228.56).
    (1) A free-use permit may be issued to any local, State, Federal, or 
Territorial agency, unit, or subdivision, including

[[Page 173]]

municipalities and county road districts, without limitation on the 
number of permits or on the value of the mineral materials to be 
extracted or removed.
    (2) A free-use permit issued to a nonprofit association, 
corporation, or individual may not provide for the removal of mineral 
materials having a volume exceeding 5,000 cubic yards (or weight 
equivalent) during any period of 12 consecutive months.
    (e) Petrified wood. A free-use permit may be issued to amateur 
collectors and scientists to take limited quantities of petrified wood 
for personal use. The material taken may not be bartered or sold. Free-
use areas may be designated within which a permit may not be required. 
Removal of material from such areas must be in accord with rules issued 
by the authorized officer and posted on the area. Such rules must also 
be posted in the District Ranger's and Forest Supervisor's offices and 
be available upon request. The rules may vary by area depending on the 
quantity, quality, and accessibility of the material and the demand for 
it.


<R05>
Sec. 228.63  Removal under terms of a timber sale or other Forest Service contract.

    In carrying out programs such as timber sales that involve 
construction and maintenance of various physical improvements, the 
Forest Service may specify that mineral materials be mined, 
manufactured, and/or processed for incorporation into the improvement. 
Where the mineral material is located on National Forest lands and is 
designated in the contract calling for its use, no permit is required as 
long as an operating plan as described in Sec. 228.56 is required by the 
contract provisions. Title to any excavated material in excess of that 
needed to fulfill contract requirements revests in the United States 
without reimbursement to the contract holder or to agents or 
representatives of the contract holder. Such excess material may be 
disposed of under Secs. 228.58, 228.59, or 228.62.


<R05>
Sec. 228.64  Community sites and common-use areas.

    (a) Designation. Nonexclusive disposals may be made from the same 
deposit or areas designated by the authorized officer; the designation 
of such an area and any reclamation requirements must be based on an 
environmental analysis.
    (b) Pit plans. The Forest Service must prepare operating plans 
(Sec. 228.56) for the efficient removal of the material and for 
appropriate reclamation of community sites and common-use areas.
    (c) Reclamation. The Forest Service is responsible for reclamation 
of community sites and common-use areas.


<R05>
Sec. 228.65  Payment for sales.

    (a) Conditions. Mineral materials may not be removed from the sale 
area until all conditions of payment in the contract have been met.
    (b) Advance payment. (1) For negotiated and competitive sales the 
full amount may be paid before removal is begun under the contract or by 
installment at the discretion of the authorized officer. Installment 
payments must be based on the estimated removal rate specified in the 
operating plan and must be, as a minimum, the value of 1 month's 
removal. The first installment must be paid before removal operations 
are begun; remaining installments must be paid in advance of removal of 
the remaining materials as billed by the authorized officer. The total 
amount of the purchase price must be paid at least 60 days before the 
expiration date of the contract.
    (2) All advance payment contracts must provide for reappraisal of 
the mineral material at the time of contract renewal or extension.
    (3) Minimum annual production must be sufficient to return a payment 
to the United States equal to the first installment. In lieu of minimum 
production, there must be an annual payment in the amount of the first 
installment which will not be credited to future years' production. 
Payments for or in lieu of minimum annual production must be received by 
the authorized officer on or before the anniversary of the effective 
date of the contract.

[[Page 174]]

    (4) If the purchaser fails to make payments when due, the contract 
will be considered breached; the authorized officer will terminate the 
contract, and all previous payments will be forfeited without prejudice 
to any other rights and remedies of the United States. Forfeiture will 
not result when the purchaser is unable to meet the minimum annual 
production (volume or value) for reasons beyond the purchaser's control.
    (5) In order to determine payment amount, the purchaser must make a 
report of operations. The report must include the amount of mineral 
material removed, which must be verified by the authorized officer.
    (c) Deferred payments. The authorized officer may approve deferred 
payments for sales.
    (1) The purchaser may make payments monthly or quarterly which must 
be based on the in-place value (volume or weight equivalent) of material 
removed during the contract period. The units of measurement must 
correspond to the units used in the appraisal. The purchaser must make 
all payments before contract renewal.
    (2) The purchaser must deliver a bond which conforms to the 
provisions of Sec. 228.51(a)(2) to the authorized officer before 
operations are begun under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 228.66  Refunds.

    Upon termination of any contract, payments in excess of $10 may be 
refunded, less the costs incurred by the United States, under any of the 
following conditions:
    (a) Payment in excess of value. If the total payment exceeds the 
value of the mineral material removed, unless it is the minimum annual 
payment in lieu of production;
    (b) Insufficiency of material. If insufficient mineral material 
existed in the sale area to provide the quantity of material estimated 
to have been available;
    (c) Termination. (1) If the contract is terminated by the authorized 
officer for reasons which are beyond the purchaser's control; or
    (2) If the contract is terminated by mutual agreement. This refund 
provision is not a warranty that a specific quantity of material exists 
in the sale area.


<R05>
Sec. 228.67  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The following sections of this subpart contain information 
collection requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980 (5 CFR part 1320): Sec. 228.45, Qualifications of applicants; 
Sec. 228.51, Bonding; Sec. 228.52(b)(1), Requirements of assignee;

    (1) The authorized officer will deem operations to be compatible if 
the plan of operations includes all feasible measures which are 
necessary to prevent or minimize potential adverse impacts on the 
resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
and if the operations are conducted in accordance with the plan.
    (2) In evaluating the feasibility of mitigating measures, the 
authorized officer shall, at a minimum, consider the following:
    (i) The effectiveness and practicality of measures utilizing the 
best available technology for preventing or minimizing adverse impacts 
on the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The long- and short-term costs to the operator of utilizing 
such measures and the effect of these costs on the long- and short-term

which means a conveyance of all or a portion of the lessee's record 
title interest in a lease; and sublease which means a conveyance of a 
non-record interest in a lease, i.e., a conveyance of operating rights 
is normally a sublease and a sublease also is a subsidiary arrangement 
between the lessee (sublessor) and the sublessee, but a sublease does 
not include a transfer of a purely financial interest, such as 
overriding royalty interest or payment out of production, nor does it 
affect the relationship imposed by a lease between the lessee(s) and the 
United States.
    Transferee. A person to whom an interest in a lease issued by the 
United States has been transferred.

Sec. 228.102  Leasing analyses and decisions.

    (a) Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
In analyzing lands for leasing, the authorized Forest officer shall 
comply with the

[[Page 177]]

National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, implementing regulations at 
43 CFR parts 1500-1508, and Forest Service implementing policies and 
procedures set forth in Forest Service Manual chapter 1950 and Forest 
Service Handbook 1909.15.
    (b) Scheduling analysis of available lands. Within 6 months of April 
20, 1990, Forest Supervisors shall develop, in cooperation with the 
Bureau of Land Management and with public input, a schedule for 
analyzing lands under their jurisdiction that have not been already 
analyzed for leasing. The Forest Supervisors shall revise or make 
additions to the schedule at least annually. In scheduling lands for 
analysis, the authorized Forest officer shall identify and exclude from 
further review the following lands which are legally unavailable for 
leasing:
    (1) Lands withdrawn from mineral leasing by an act of Congress or by 
an order of the Secretary of the Interior;
    (2) Lands recommended for wilderness allocation by the Secretary of 
Agriculture;
    (3) Lands designated by statute as wilderness study areas, unless 
oil and gas leasing is specifically allowed by the statute designating 
the study area; and
    (4) Lands within areas allocated for wilderness or further planning 
in Executive Communication 1504, Ninety-Sixth Congress (House Document 
No. 96-119), unless such lands subsequently have been allocated to uses 
other than wilderness by an approved Forest land and resource management 
plan or have been released to uses other than wilderness by an act of 
Congress.
    (c) Leasing analyses. The leasing analysis shall be conducted by the 
authorized Forest officer in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR 
part 219 (Forest land and resource management planning) and/or, as 
appropriate, through preparation of NEPA documents. As part of the 
analysis, the authorized Forest oficer shall:
    (1) Identify on maps those areas that will be:
    (i) Open to development subject to the terms and conditions of the 
standard oil and gas lease form (including an explanation of the typical 
standards and objectives to be enforced under the standard lease terms);
    (ii) Open to development but subject to constraints that will 
require the use of lease stipulations such as those prohibiting surface 
use on areas larger than 40 acres or such other standards as may be 
developed in the plan for stipulation use (with discussion as to why the 
constraints are necessary and justifiable); and
    (iii) Closed to leasing, distinguishing between those areas that are 
being closed through exercise of management direction, and those closed 
by law, regulation, etc.
    (2) Identify alternatives to the areas listed in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, including that of not allowing leasing.
    (3) Project the type/amount of post-leasing activity that is 
reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of conducting a leasing program 
consistent with that described in the proposal and for each alternative.
    (4) Analyze the reasonable foreseeable impacts of post-leasing 
activity projected under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (d) Area or Forest-wide leasing decisions (lands administratively 
available for leasing). Upon completion of the leasing analysis, the 
Regional Forest shall promptly notify the Bureau of Land Management as 
to the area or Forest-wide leasing decisions that have been made, that 
is, identify lands which have been found administratively available for 
leasing.
    (e) Leasing decisions for specific lands. At such time as specific 
lands are being considered for leasing, the Regional Forester shall 
review the area or Forest-wide leasing decision and shall authorize the 
Bureau of Land Management to offer specific lands for lease subject to:
    (1) Verifying that oil and gas leasing of the specific lands has 
been adequately addressed in a NEPA document, and is consistent with the 
Forest land and resource management plan. If NEPA has not been 
adequately addressed, or if there is significant new information or 
circumstances as defined by 40 CFR 1502.9 requiring further 
environmental analysis, additional environment analysis shall be done 
before

[[Page 178]]

a leasing decision for specific lands will be made. If there is 
inconsistency with the Forest land and resource management plan, no 
authorization for leasing shall be given unless the plan is amended or 
revised.
    (2) Ensuring that conditions of surface occupancy identified in 
Sec. 228.102(c)(1) are properly included as stipulations in resulting 
leases.
    (3) Determining that operations and development could be allowed 
somewhere on each proposed lease, except where stipulations will 
prohibit all surface occupancy.

<R05>
Sec. 228.103  Notice of appeals of decisions.

    The authorized Forest officer shall promptly notify the Bureau of 
Land Management if appeals of either an area or Forest-wide leasing 
decision or a leasing decision for specific lands are filed during the 
periods provided for under 36 CFR part 217.


<R05>
Sec. 228.104  Consideration of requests to modify, waive, or grant exceptions to lease stipulations.

    (a) General. An operator submitting a surface use plan of operations 
may request the authorized Forest officer to authorize the Bureau of 
Land Management to modify (permanently change), waive (permanently 
remove), or grant an exception (case-by-case exemption) to a stipulation 
included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service. The person 
making the request is encouraged to submit any information which might 
assist the authorized Forest officer in making a decision.
    (b) Review. The authorized Forest officer shall review any 
information submitted in support of the request and any other pertinent 
information.
    (1) As part of the review, consistent with 30 U.S.C. 226 (f)-(g), 
the authorized Forest officer shall ensure compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.) and any other 
applicable laws, and shall ensure preparation of any appropriate 
environmental documents.
    (2) The authorized Forest officer may authorize the Bureau of Land 
Management to modify, waive, or grant an exception to a stipulation if:
    (i) The action would be consistent with applicable Federal laws;
    (ii) The action would be consistent with the current forest land and 
resource management plan;
    (iii) The management objectives which led the Forest Service to 
require the inclusion of the stipulation in the lease can be met without 
restricting operations in the manner provided for by the stipulation 
given the change in the present condition of the surface resources 
involved, or given the nature, location, timing, or design of the 
proposed operations; and
    (iv) The action is acceptable to the authorized Forest officer based 
upon a review of the environmental consequences.
    (c) Other agency stipulations. If a stipulation was included in a 
lease by the Forest Service at the request of another agency, the 
authorized Forest officer shall consult with that agency prior to 
authorizing modification, waiver, or exception.
    (d) Notice of decision. (1) When the review of a stipulation 
modification, waiver, or exception request has been completed and the 
authorized Forest officer has reached a decision, the authorized Forest 
officer shall promptly notify the operator and the appropriate Bureau of 
Land Management office, in writing, of the decision to grant, or grant 
with additional conditions, or deny the request.
    (2) Any decision to modify, waive, or grant an exception to a lease 
stipulation shall be subject to administrative appeal only in 
conjunction with an appeal of a decision on a surface use plan of 
operation or supplemental surface use plan of operation.

Sec. 228.105  Issuance of onshore orders and notices to lessees.

    (a) Onshore oil and gas orders. The Chief of the Forest Service may 
issue, or cosign with the Director, Bureau of Land Management, Onshore 
Oil and Gas Orders necessary to implement and supplement the regulations 
of this subpart.

[[Page 179]]

    (1) Adoption of Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 1. Until such time as 
another order is adopted and codified in the CFR, operators shall submit 
surface use plans of operations in accordance with Section III.G.4(b), 
Guidelines for preparing surface use program, of the Department of the 
Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 1, 48 
FR 48915-30 (Oct. 21, 1983), published as Appendix A to this subpart.
    (2) Adoption of additional onshore oil and gas orders. Additional 
onshore oil and gas orders shall be published in the Federal Register 
for public comment and codified in the CFR.
    (3) Applicability of onshore oil and gas orders. Onshore Oil and Gas 
Orders issued pursuant to this section are binding on all operations 
conducted on National Forest System lands, unless otherwise provided 
therein.
    (b) Notices to lessees, transferees, and operators. The authorized 
Forest officer may issue, or cosign with the authorized officer of the 
Bureau of Land Management, Notices to Lessees, Transferees, and 
Operators necessary to implement the regulations of this subpart. 
Notices to Lessees, Transferees, and Operators are binding on all 
operations conducted on the administrative unit of the National Forest 
System (36 CFR 200.2) supervised by the authorized Forest officer who 
issued or cosigned such notice.


<R05>
Sec. 228.106  Operator's submission of surface use plan of operations.

    (a) General. No permit to drill on a Federal oil and gas lease for 
National Forest System lands may be granted without the analysis and 
approval of a surface use plan of operations covering proposed surface 
disturbing activities. An operator must obtain an approved surface use 
plan of operations before conducting operations that will cause surface 
disturbance. The operator shall submit a proposed surface use plan of 
operations as part of an Application for a Permit to Drill to the 
appropriate Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the 
Forest Service, unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas 
Order in effect when the proposed plan of operations is submitted.
    (b) Preparation of plan. In preparing a surface use plan of 
operations, the operator is encouraged to contact the local Forest 
Service office to make use of such information as is available from the 
Forest Service concerning surface resources and uses, environmental 
considerations, and local reclamation procedures.
    (c) Content of plan. The type, size, and intensity of the proposed 
operations and the sensitivity of the surface resources that will be 
affected by the proposed operations determine the level of detail and 
the amount of information which the operator includes in a proposed plan 
of operations. However, any surface use plan of operations submitted by 
an operator shall contain the information specified by the Onshore Oil 
and Gas Order in effect when the surface use plan of operations is 
submitted.
    (d) Supplemental plan. An operator must obtain an approved 
supplemental surface use plan of operations before conducting any 
surface disturbing operations that are not authorized by a current 
approved surface use plan of operations. The operator shall submit a 
proposed supplemental surface use plan of operations to the appropriate 
Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the Forest Service, 
unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect 
when the proposed supplemental plan of operations is submitted. The 
supplemental plan of operations need only address those operations that 
differ from the operations authorized by the current approved surface 
use plan of operations. A supplemental plan is otherwise subject to the 
same requirements under this subpart as an initial surface use plan of 
operations.


<R05>
Sec. 228.107  Review of surface use plan of operations.

    (a) Review. The authorized Forest officer shall review a surface use 
plan of operations as promptly as practicable given the nature and scope 
of the proposed plan. As part of the review, the authorized Forest 
officer shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 
implementing regulations at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and the Forest 
Service implementing policies

[[Page 180]]

and procedures set forth in Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950 and 
Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 and shall ensure that:
    (1) The surface use plan of operations is consistent with the lease, 
including the lease stipulations, and applicable Federal laws;
    (2) To the extent consistent with the rights conveyed by the lease, 
the surface use plan of operations is consistent with, or is modified to 
be consistent with, the applicable current approved forest land and 
resource management plan;
    (3) The surface use plan of operations meets or exceeds the surface 
use requirements of Sec. 228.108 of this subpart; and
    (4) The surface use plan of operations is acceptable, or is modified 
to be acceptable, to the authorized Forest officer based upon a review 
of the environmental consequences of the operations.
    (b) Decision. The authorized Forest officer shall make a decision on 
the approval of a surface use plan of operations as follows:
    (1) If the authorized Forest officer will not be able to make a 
decision on the proposed plan within 3 working days after the conclusion 
of the 30-day notice period provided for by 30 U.S.C. 226(f), the 
authorized Forest officer shall advise the appropriate Bureau of Land 
Managemnt office and the operator as soon as such delay becomes 
apparent, either in writing or orally with subsequent written 
confirmation, that additional time will be needed to process the plan. 
The authorized Forest officer shall explain the reason why additional 
time is needed and project the date by which a decision on the plan will 
likely be made.
    (2) When the review of a surface use plan of operations has been 
completed, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly notify the 
operator and the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office, in 
writting, that:
    (i) The plan is approved as submitted:
    (ii) The plan is approved subject to specified conditions; or,
    (iii) The plan is disapproved for the reasons stated.

<R05>
Sec. 228.109  Bonds.

    (a) General. As part of the review of a proposed surface use plan of 
operations, the authorized Forest officer shall consider the estimated 
cost to the Forest Service to reclaim those areas that would be 
disturbed by operations and to restore any lands or surface waters 
adversely affected by the lease operations after the abandonment or 
cessation of operations on the lease. If at any time prior to or during 
the conduct of operations, the authorized Forest officer determines the 
financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land Management is not 
adequate to ensure complete and timely reclamation and restoration, the 
authorized Forest officer shall give the operator the option of either 
increasing the financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land 
Management or filing a separate instrument with the Forest Service in 
the amount deemed adequate by the authorized Forest officer to ensure 
reclamation and restoration.
    (b) Standards for estimating reclamation costs. The authorized 
Forest officer shall consider the costs of the operator's proposed 
reclamation program and the need for additional measures to be taken 
when estimating the cost to the Forest Service to reclaim the disturbed 
area.
    (c) Release of reclamation liability. An operator may request the 
authorized Forest officer to notify the Bureau of Land Management of 
reduced reclamation liability at any time after reclamation has

Sec. 228.113  Notice of noncompliance.

    (a) Issuance. When an authorized Forest officer finds that the 
operator is not in compliance with a reclamation or other standard, a 
stipulation included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, 
an approved surface use plan of operation, the regulations in this 
subpart, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable 
notice to lessees, transferees, and operators, the authorized Forest 
officer shall issue a notice of noncompliance.
    (1) Content. The notice of noncompliance shall include the 
following:
    (i) Identification of the reclamation requirements or other 
standard(s) with which the operator is not in compliance;
    (ii) Description of the measures which are required to correct the 
noncompliance;
    (iii) Specification of a reasonable period of time within which the 
noncompliance must be corrected;
    (iv) If the noncompliance appears to be material, identification of 
the possible consequences of continued noncompliance of the 
requirement(s) or standard(s) as described in 30 U.S.C. 226(g);
    (v) If the noncompliance appears to be in violation of the 
prohibitions set forth in 36 CFR part 261, identification of the 
possible consequences of continued noncompliance of the requirement(s) 
or standard(s) as described in 36 CFR 261.1b; and
    (vi) Notification that the authorized Forest officer remains willing 
and desirous of working cooperatively with the operator to resolve or 
remedy the noncompliance.
    (2) Extension of deadlines. The operator may request an extension of 
a deadline specified in a notice of noncompliance if the operator is 
unable to come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or 
standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance by the deadline 
because of conditions beyond the operator's control. The authorized 
Forest officer shall not extend a deadline specified in a notice of 
noncompliance unless the operator requested an extension and the 
authorized Forest officer finds that there was a condition beyond the 
operator's control, that such condition prevented the operator from 
complying with the notice of noncompliance by the specified deadline, 
and that the extension will not adversely affect the interests of the 
United States. Conditions which may be beyond the operator's control 
include, but are not limited to, closure of an area in accordance with 
36 CFR part 261, subparts B or C, or inaccessibility of an area of 
operations due to such conditions as fire, flooding, or snowpack.
    (3) Manner of service. The authorized Forest officer shall serve a 
notice of noncompliance or a decision on a request for extension of a 
deadline specified in a notice upon the operator in person, by certified 
mail or by telephone. However, if notice is initially provided in person 
or by telephone, the authorized Forest officer shall send the

[[Page 184]]

operator written confirmation of the notice or decision by certified 
mail.
    (b) Failure to come into compliance. If the operator fails to come 
into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) 
identified in a notice of noncompliance by the deadline specified in the 
notice, or an approved extension, the authorized Forest officer shall 
decide whether: The noncompliance appears to be material given the 
reclamation requirements and other standards applicable to the lease 
established by 30 U.S.C. 226(g), the regulations in this subpart, the 
stipulations included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, 
an approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable Onshore Oil 
and Gas Order, or an applicable Notice to lessees, transferees, and 
operators; the noncompliance is likely to result in danger to public 
health or safety or irreparable resource damage; and the noncompliance 
is resulting in an emergency.
    (1) Referral to compliance officer. When the operations appear to be 
in material noncompliance, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly 
refer the matter to the compliance officer. The referral shall be 
accompanied by a complete statement of the facts supported by 
appropriate exhibits. Apparent material noncompliance includes, but is 
not limited to, operating without an approved surface use plan of 
operations, conducting operations that have been suspended, failure to 
timely complete reclamation in accordance with an approved surface use 
plan of operations, failure to maintain an additional bond in the amount 
required by the authorized Forest officer during the period of 
operation, failure to timely reimburse the Forest Service for the cost 
of abating an emergency, and failing to comply with any term included in 
a lease, stipulation, or approved surface use plan of operations, the 
applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable Notice to 
lessees, transferees, and operators, relating to the protection of a 
threatened or endangered species.
    (2) Suspension of operations. When the noncompliance is likely to 
result in danger to public health or safety or in irreparable resource 
damage, the authorized Forest officer shall suspend the operations, in 
whole or in part.
    (i) A suspension of operations shall remain in effect until the 
authorized Forest officer determines that the operations are in 
compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified 
in the notice of noncompliance.
    (ii) The authorized Forest officer shall serve decisions suspending 
operations upon the operator in person, by certified mail, or by 
telephone. If notice is initially provided in person or by telephone,

shall submit a written statement to the compliance officer as to whether 
the authorized Forest officer agrees that the operator has come into 
compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the 
compliance officer's decision. If the authorized Forest officer 
disagrees with the operator, the written statement shall be accompanied 
by a complete statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits.
    (2) Additional procedures as to disputed material facts. If the 
compliance officer finds that the authorized Forest officer's response 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the decision as

[[Page 187]]

to whether the operator has come into compliance with the requirement(s) 
or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision, the 
compliance officer shall so notify the operator and authorized Forest

violation of requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the decision 
finding that the operator was in material noncompliance, the decision on 
the petition for withdrawal shall identify such requirement(s) or 
standard(s) and describe the measures that are required to correct the 
violation(s).
    (ii) If the compliance officer finds that the operator has 
subsequently come into compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s)

 Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 228--Guidelines for Preparing Surface 
                   Use Plans of Operation for Drilling

       I. Components of a Complete Application for Permit to Drill

    (a) Guidelines for Preparing Surface Use Program. In preparing this 
program, the lessee or operator shall submit maps, plats, and narrative 
descriptions which adhere closely to the following (maps and plats 
should be of a scale no smaller than 1:24,000 unless otherwise stated 
below):
    (1) Existing Roads. A legible map (USGS topographic, county road, 
Alaska Borough, or other such map), labeled and showing the access route 
to the location, shall be used for locating the proposed well site in 
relation to a town (village) or other locatable point, such as a highway 
or county road, which handles the majority of the through traffic to the 
general area. The proposed route to the location, including appropriate 
distances from the point where the access route exits established roads, 
shall be shown. All access roads shall be appropriately labeled. Any 
plans for improvement and/or a statement that existing roads will be 
maintained in the same or better condition shall be provided. Existing 
roads and newly constructed roads on surface under the jurisdiction of a 
Surface Management Agency shall be maintained in accordance with the 
standards of the Surface Management Agency.
    Information required by items (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of 
this subsection also may be shown on this map if appropriately labeled 
or on a separate plat or map.
    (2) Access Roads to Be Constructed and Reconstructed. All permanent 
and temporary access roads that are to be constructed, or reconstructed, 
in connection with the drilling of the proposed well shall be 
appropriately identified and submitted on a map or plat. Width, maximum 
grade, major cuts and fills, turnouts, drainage design, location and 
size of culverts and/or bridges, fence cuts and/or cattleguards, and 
type of surfacing material, if any, shall be stated for all 
construction. In addition, where permafrost exists, the methods for 
protection from thawing must be indicated. Modification of proposed road 
design may be required during the onsite inspection.
    Information also should be furnished to indicate where existing 
facilities may be altered or modified. Such facilities include gates, 
cattleguards, culverts, and bridges which, if installed or replaced, 
shall be designed to adequately carry anticipated loads.
    (3) Location of Existing Wells. It is recommended that this 
information be submitted on a map or plat and include all wells (water, 
injection or disposal, producing, and drilling) within a 1-mile radius 
of the proposed location.
    (4) Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities if Well is 
Productive.
    (i) On well pad--A map or plat shall be included showing, to the 
extent known or anticipated, the location of all production facilities 
and lines to be installed if the well is successfully completed for 
production.
    (ii) Off well pad--A map or plat shall be included showing to the 
extent known or anticipated, the existing or new production facilities 
to be utilized and the lines to be installed if the well is successfully 
completed

[[Page 189]]

for production. If new construction, the dimensions of the facility 
layout are to be shown.
    If the information required under (a) or (b) above is not known and 
cannot be accurately presented and the well subsequently is completed 
for production, the operator shall then comply with section IV of this 
Order.
    (5) Location and Type of Water Supply (Rivers, Creeks, Springs, 
Lakes, Ponds, and Wells). This information may be shown by quarter-
quarter section on a map or plat, or may be a written description. The 
source and transportation method for all water to be used in drilling 
the proposed well shall be noted if the source is located on Federal or 
Indian lands or if water is to be used from a Federal or Indian project. 
If the water is obtained from other than Federal or Indian lands, only 
the location need be identified. Any access roads crossing Federal or 
Indian lands that are needed to haul the water shall be described in 
items G.4.b. (1) and (2), as appropriate. If a water supply well is to 
be drilled on the lease, it shall be so stated under this item, and the 
authorized officer of the BLM may require the filing of a separate APD.
    (6) Construction Materials. The lessee or operator shall state the 
character and intended use of all construction materials such as sand, 
gravel, stone and soil material. If the materials to be used are 
Federally-owned, the proposed source shall be shown by either quarter-
quarter section on a map or plat, or a written description. The use of 
materials under BLM jurisdiction is governed by 43 CFR 3610.2-3. The 
authorized officer shall inform the lessee or operator if the materials 
may be used free of charge or if an application for sale is required. If 
the materials to be used are Indian owned or under the jurisdiction of 
any Surface Management Agency other than BLM, the specific tribe and or 
Area Superintendent of BIA, or the appropriate Surface Management Agency 
office shall be contacted to determine the appropriate procedure for use 
of the materials.
    (7) Methods for Handling Waste Disposal. A written description shall 
be given of the methods and locations proposed for safe containment and 
disposal of each type of waste material (e.g., cuttings, garbage, salts, 
chemicals, sewage, etc.) that results from the drilling of the proposed 
well. Likewise, the narrative shall include plans for the eventual 
disposal of drilling fluids and any produced oil or water recovered 
during testing operations.
    (8) Ancillary Facilities. The plans, or subsequent amendments to 
such plans, shall identify all ancillary facilities such as camps and 
airstrips as to their location, land area required, and the methods and 
standards to be employed in their construction. Such facilities shall be 
shown on a map or plat. The approximate center of proposed camps and the 
center line of airstrips shall be staked on the ground.
    (9) Well Site Layout. A plat of suitable scale (not less than 1 
inch=50 feet) showing the proposed drill pad and its location with 
respect to topographic features is required. Cross section diagrams of 
the drill pad showing any cuts and fills and the relation to topography 
are also required. The plat shall also include the approximate proposed 
location of the reserve and burn pits, access roads onto the pad, 
turnaround areas, parking area, living facilities, soil material 
stockpiles, and the orientation of the rig with respect to the pad and 
other facilities. Plans, if any to line the reserve pit should be 
detailed.
    (10) Plans for Reclamation of the Surface. The program for surface 
reclamation upon completion of the operation, such as configuration of 
the reshaped topography, drainage system, segregation of spoil 
materials, surface manipulations, waste disposal, revegetation methods, 
and soil treatments, plus other practices necessary to reclaim all 
disturbed areas, including any access roads or portions of well pads 
when no longer needed, shall be stated. An estimate of the time for 
commencement and completion of reclamation operations, dependent on 
weather conditions and other local uses of the area, shall be provided.
    (11) Surface Ownership. The surface ownership (Federal, Indian, 
State or private) at the well location, and for all lands crossed by 
roads which are to be constructed or upgraded, shall be indicated. Where 
the surface of the well site is privately owned, the operator shall 
provide the name, address, and telephone number of the surface owner, 
unless previously provided.
    (12) Other Information. The lessee or operator is encouraged to 
submit any additional information that may be helpful in processing the 
application.
    (13) Lessee's or Operator's Representative and Certification. The 
name, address, and telephone number of the lessee's or operator's field 
representative shall be included. The lessee or operator submitting the 
APD shall certify as follows:
    I hereby certify that I, or persons under my direct supervision, 
have inspected the proposed drill site and access route; that I am 
familiar with the conditions which currently exist; that the statements 
made in this plan are, to the best of my knowledge, true and correct; 
and that the work associated with operations proposed herein will be 
performed by __________ and its contractors and subcontractors in 
conformity with this plan and the terms and conditions under which it is 
approved. This statement is subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001 
for the filing of a false statement.

contiguous tract which is identified by the landowner and approved by 
the Service Representative as suitable for growing trees and scheduled 
for conversion to a Program practice.
    (e) To be eligible to receive cost-share funds under the Program, a 
landowner must agree to maintain Program practices for 10 years, unless 
otherwise specified by the Chief.


<R05>
Sec. 230.6  Landowner forest stewardship plan.

    (a) Prior to receiving approval to implement any Program practice 
identified in Sec. 230.7(a)(2)-(9) of this subpart, eligible landowners 
shall have an approved landowner forest stewardship plan. The landowner 
forest stewardship plan shall be prepared by a Resource Management 
Professional and approved by a Service Representative and shall identify 
and describe actions to be taken by the landowner to protect and manage 
soil, water, aesthetic qualities, recreation, timber, and fish and 
wildlife resources in a manner which is compatible with the objectives 
of the landowner.
    (b) A landowner forest stewardship plan shall be effective for not 
less than 10 years, but shall be reviewed at least every five years and 
may be revised as needed, subject to approval of the Service 
Representative.
    (c) To the extent deemed applicable by the Service Representative, 
where existing landowner management plans such as conservation plans, 
Tree Farm management plans, or similar plans meet or can be amended to 
meet Landowner Forest Stewardship Plan requirements, such plans shall 
satisfy the requirements of this section.
    (d) If a landowner sells or otherwise conveys land covered by a 
landowner forest stewardship plan, such plan shall remain in effect if 
agreed to by the new owner. New landowner objectives shall be 
incorporated through plan revision as needed. Where the new landowner 
does not agree to adopt the Landowner Forest Stewardship plan, the new 
landowner cannot obtain approval of new Program practices without 
preparation and approval of a new Landowner Forest Stewardship Plan.


<R05>

the local office of the State Forester who shall provide information 
necessary to make application.
    (b) The State Forester, or such official as the State Forester may 
designate, shall make basic eligibility determinations, including 
whether the applicant meets nonindustrial private forest land ownership 
criteria and minimum and maximum acreage criteria in accordance with 
Sec. 230.5 of this subpart, and approve Program practices. The landowner 
shall be notified of such determination in writing by mail.
    (c) The State Forester, or such official as the State Forester may 
designate, shall approve Program practices based on the following:
    (1) For approval of practices described in Sec. 230.7(a)(2)-(a)(9) 
of this subpart, verification that the landowner has an approved 
landowner forest stewardship plan.
    (2) A determination whether the practice is needed and feasible.
    (3) A determination that the practice is consistent with funding 
priorities established by the State Forester.
    (d) Applications shall not be approved unless cost-share funds are 
available. Approval of an application shall constitute an agreement by 
the United States and the landowner to cost-share approved practices 
upon acceptable performance.
    (e) Upon approval of Program practices, a Service Representative 
shall prepare a project outline that identifies the needed technical 
practices, specifications, and approximate time frame(s) for the 
implementation of the practice(s) to achieve the objectives of the 
landowner forest stewardship plan. Upon agreement by the landowner and 
the Service Representative to the requirements set forth in the project 
outline, the outline shall be attached to and become part of the

duration of the practice. Requirements of a project outline shall 
constitute the basis for determining acceptable performance upon 
practice completion.
    (f) Upon approval of Program practices, the landowner shall be 
notified of approved practices in writing. Such notice shall state that 
the landowner can begin implementing approved practices.


<R05>
Sec. 230.9  Payment to landowners.

    (a) To be eligible for cost-share payments, a landowner must 
complete each practice within eighteen months of approval. However, if 
practice(s) are not completed in eighteen months due

[[Page 195]]

to conditions beyond the landowner's control, a six month extension 
period may be granted by the Service Representative.
    (b) Upon certification by the Service Representative that a practice 
has been completed in accordance with specifications, the federal cost-
share payment will be calculated and disbursed to the landowner. Service 
Representatives shall have the right of access to the landowner's 
property to inspect practices for the duration of the practice 
maintenance period.
    (c) The amount of payment under the Program to any one landowner 
shall not exceed $10,000 in any given fiscal year. For each landowner 
participating in the Program, the payment limitation shall apply as 
follows:
    (1) Where husband and wife hold joint ownership, they shall be 
considered as a single landowner.
    (2) Where any number of individuals hold common ownership, they 
shall be considered as a single landowner.
    (3) Where the individual is a partner, corporate shareholder, or has 
an ownership interest in another private legal entity, the amount of 
payment to the individual shall be equivalent to the percentage of 
ownership the individual holds in such partnership, corporation or other 
private legal entity times the payment made to such partnership, 
corporation or other legal entity.
    (d) Levels of federal cost-share funds to be paid to landowners 
shall be set by the State Forester, but shall not exceed 75 percent of 
the actual costs incurred by a participating landowner. Non-Federal 
program funds and other donated assistance may be used to supplement 
cost-share assistance under the Program; however, the total of all funds 
and assistance shall not exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of 
practice implementation.
    (e) A practice may consist of one or more component activities. A 
landowner may receive partial payment for completed components on the 
condition that the landowner agrees to complete the remaining 
component(s) of the practice within the time period specified by the 
Service Representative, not to exceed eighteen months following approval 
to implement the practice, unless an extension is justified as provided 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Where performance actually rendered does not meet the minimum 
specifications of a practice due to factors beyond the landowner's 
control, the State Forester or designee may approve cost-share payment 
under one of the following conditions:
    (1) The landowner repeats applications of components previously 
implemented or establishes additional eligible components under such 
terms and conditions as the Service Representative may require, in which 
case, the State Forester shall approve additional cost-sharing for 
additional or repeated components to the extent such measures are needed 
to meet the objectives of the landowner forest stewardship plan; or
    (2) The landowner establishes to the satisfaction of the Service 
Representative that:
    (i) A reasonable effort was made to meet the minimum requirements; 
and
    (ii) The practice, as performed, adequately meets the objectives of 
the landowner forest stewardship plan.
    (g) Where the landowner has received cost-share assistance for site 
preparation and the establishment of trees has been unsuccessful due to 
factors beyond the landowner's control, the Service Representative shall 
require that trees be re-established and shall approve cost-share 
assistance for such activity.
    (h) If a landowner sells, conveys, or otherwise loses control of 
lands upon which there is a continuing obligation to maintain a practice 
and the new landowner does not agree to assume the responsibility for 
maintaining the practice, the landowner who was originally obligated to 
maintain the practice shall be liable to reimburse the United States for 
all cost-share payments on such practices.
    (i) In case of death or incompetency of any landowner, the State 
Forester shall approve cost-share payments to the successor if the 
successor agrees to maintain the practices for the duration of the 
required maintenance period.
    (j) Any landowner who may be entitled to any cost-share payment 
under this subpart may assign the right

[[Page 196]]

thereto, in whole or in part, under the following terms:
    (1) Payments may be assigned only for performance of a Program 
practice.
    (2) A payment which is made to a landowner may not be assigned to 
pay or secure any preexisting debt.
    (3) Neither the United States, the Forest Service, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, nor any disbursing agent shall be liable in any suit if 
payment is made to an assignor rather than to an assignee, and nothing 
in this section shall be construed to authorize any suit against the 
United States, the Forest Service, the Secretary or any disbursing agent 
if payment is not made to the assignee, or if payment is made to only 
one of several assignees.
    (k) No cost-share payment or portion thereof due and owing any 
landowner shall be subject to any claim arising under State law by any 
creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.


<R05>
Sec. 230.10  Prohibitions.

    (a) No cost-share funds shall be paid for the following:
    (1) Costs incurred before an application for cost-share assistance 
is approved;
    (2) The implementation of any practice(s) already required by law, 
regulation, or other authority; and
    (3) Repairs or normal upkeep or maintenance of any practice.
    (b) No cost-share assistance shall be paid for repeating practices 
on the same site by the same landowner which have been implemented under 
the Forestry Incentives Program (16 U.S.C. 2104) or any other Federal, 
State, or local government programs, or private sector programs, except 
where such practices are repeated due to a failure of a prior practice 
without fault of the landowner.


<R05>
Sec. 230.11  Recapture of payment.

    (a) If any landowner, successor, or assignee uses any scheme or 
device to unjustly benefit from this program, the cost-share funds shall 
be withheld or a refund of all or part of any Program payments otherwise 
due or paid that person shall be secured. A scheme or device includes, 
but is not limited to, coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, false 
claims, or any business dissolution, reorganization, revival, or other 
legal mechanism designed for or having the effect of evading the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (b) If any landowner or successor takes any action or fails to take 
action which results in the destruction or impairment of a prescribed 
practice for the duration of the practice, cost-share funds shall be 
withheld or a recapture of all or part of any Program payments otherwise 
due or paid shall be secured based on the extent and effect of 
destruction and impairment.
    (c) Nothing in this section requiring the withholding or refunding 
of cost-share funds shall preclude any penalty or liability otherwise 
imposed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 230.12  Reconsideration.

    Any landowner, successor, or assignee who is dissatisfied with any 
determination made under the Program may request reconsideration by the 
State Forester and, if the matter is still not resolved, by the Regional 
Forester. All requests for reconsideration shall be in writing and shall 
contain factual information explaining the basis for requesting 
reconsideration. All decisions upon reconsideration shall be issued in 
writing.


<R05>
Sec. 230.13  Information requirements.

practicable measures that are determined to be necessary to maintain 
consistency with the conservation of fish, wildlife, and their habitat 
as provided by this subpart.
    (e) Subject to valid existing rights, the responsible Forest Officer 
may terminate, suspend, restrict, or require modification of any 
activity if it is determined that such measures are required to conserve 
wildlife, fish, or their habitat within the areas of the Chugach 
National Forest subject to this subpart. Prior to taking action to 
terminate, suspend, restrict, or require modification of an activity 
under this section, the responsible Forest Officer shall give affected 
parties reasonable prior notice and an opportunity to comment, unless it 
is determined that doing so would likely result in irreparable harm to 
conservation of fish, wildlife, and their habitat.
    (f) Decisions made pursuant to this section are subject to appeal 
only as provided in 36 CFR parts 217 and 251, subpart C.
    (g) Nothing in this section affects subsistence activities carried

Sec. 241.23  Taking of fish and wildlife.

    (a) The taking of fish and wildlife by hunting, trapping, or fishing 
from lands subject to the rules of this subpart is authorized in 
accordance with applicable State and Federal law.
    (b) To the extent consistent with the conservation of fish and 
wildlife and their habitat in accordance with recognized scientific 
management principles, local rural residents who depend upon the Chugach 
National Forest for subsistence needs shall continue to have the 
opportunity to engage in a subsistence way of life on the lands to which 
this subpart applies pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.
    (c) To the extent consistent with the conservation of fish and 
wildlife and their habitat, the continuation of existing uses and the 
future establishment and use of temporary campsites, tent, platforms, 
shelters, and other temporary facilities and equipment directly and 
necessarily related to the taking of fish and wildlife may be authorized 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. However, the Forest 
Supervisor may restrict or prohibit facilities or uses in the Copper 
River-Rude River addition or Copper River-Bering River area if it is 
determined, after adequate notice to the affected parties, that the 
continuation of such facilities or uses would materially interfere with 
or adversely affect the conservation of fish and wildlife and their 
habitat.

<R05>
Sec. 242.5  Eligibility for subsistence use.

    (a) You may take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence 
uses only if you are an Alaska resident of a rural area or rural 
community. The regulations in this part may further limit your 
qualifications to harvest fish or wildlife resources for subsistence 
uses. If you are not an Alaska resident or are a resident of a non-rural 
area or community listed in Sec. 242.23, you may not take fish or 
wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in 
this part.
    (b) Where the Board has made a customary and traditional use 
determination regarding subsistence use of a specific fish stock or 
wildlife population, in accordance with, and as listed in, Sec. 242.24, 
only those Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities 
designated by the Board are eligible for subsistence taking of that 
population or stock on public lands for subsistence uses under the 
regulations in this part. If you do not live in one of those areas or 
communities, you may not take fish or wildlife from that population or 
stock, on public lands under the regulations in this part.
    (c) Where customary and traditional use determinations for a fish 
stock or wildlife population within a specific area have not yet been 
made by the Board (e.g. ``no determination''), all Alaskans who are 
residents of rural areas or communities may harvest for subsistence from 
that stock or population under the regulations in this part.
    (d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility 
of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National 
Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and 
National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.


<R05>
Sec. 242.6  Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports.

    (a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for 
subsistence uses, you must be a rural Alaska resident and:
    (1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping 
licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish) unless Federal 
licenses are required or unless otherwise provided for in subpart D of 
this part;
    (2) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent Federal 
permits (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated 
Harvester Permit) required by subpart D of this part; and
    (3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, 
harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these 
documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the 
requirements in subpart D of this part.
    (b) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you 
must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must 
comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this 
section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in 
subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and 
transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal 
law enforcement agent, you

[[Page 204]]

must also produce any licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags or other 
documents required by this section. If you are engaged in taking fish 
and wildlife under these regulations, you must allow State or Federal 
law enforcement agents to inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or 
capable of being used to take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife 
in your possession.
    (c) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other 
required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You 
must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D 
of this part.
    (d) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, 
you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations 
specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required 
by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for 
particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a 
specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is 
a violation of these regulations. Community harvests are reviewed 
annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.
    (e) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State 
licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an 
incorrect harvest report.


<R05>
Sec. 242.7  Restriction on use.

    (a) You may not trade or sell fish and wildlife, taken pursuant to 
the regulations in this part, except as provided for in Secs. 242.25, 
242.26, and 242.27.
    (b) You may not use, sell, or trade fish and wildlife, taken 
pursuant to the regulations in this part, in any significant commercial 
enterprise.


<R05>
Sec. 242.8  Penalties.

    If you are convicted of violating any provision of 50 CFR Part 100 
or 36 CFR Part 242, you may be punished by a fine or by imprisonment in 
accordance with the penalty provisions applicable to the public land 
where the violation occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 242.9  Information collection requirements.

    (a) The rules in this part contain information collection 
requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval 
under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest 
activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be 
required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid 
OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.
    (1) Section 242.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and 
reports. The information collection requirements contained in Sec. 242.6 
(Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Hunter 
Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not 
authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. Identity 
and location of residence are required to determine if you are eligible 
for a permit and a report of success is required after a harvest 
attempt. These requirements are not duplicative with the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The regulations in Sec. 242.6 require 
this information before a rural Alaska resident may engage in 
subsistence uses on public lands. The Department estimates that the 
average time necessary to obtain and comply with this permit information 
collection requirement is 0.25 hours.
    (2) Section 242.20, Request for reconsideration. The information 
collection requirements contained in Sec. 242.20 provide a standardized 
process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the 
Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but 
required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a 
request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.
    (3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in 
this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State 
regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of 
Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible and 
information gained from these reports are systematically available to 
Federal managers by routine

[[Page 205]]

computer access requiring less than one hour.
    (b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other 
aspect of the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, N.W., MS 224 ARLSQ, 
Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Desk Officer for the Interior 
Department, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information 
requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory Committees or additional 
Regional Councils, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 
are established under subpart B of this part. Such requirements will be 
submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.

customary and traditional subsistence uses of specific fish and wildlife 
populations;
    (iv) Allocate subsistence uses of fish and wildlife populations on 
public lands;
    (v) Ensure that the taking on public lands of fish and wildlife for 
nonwasteful subsistence uses shall be accorded priority over the taking 
on such lands of fish and wildlife for other purposes;
    (vi) Close public lands to the non-subsistence taking of fish and 
wildlife;
    (vii) Establish priorities for the subsistence taking of fish and 
wildlife on public lands among rural Alaska residents;
    (viii) Restrict or eliminate taking of fish and wildlife on public 
lands;
    (ix) Determine what types and forms of trade of fish and wildlife 
taken for subsistence uses constitute allowable customary trade;

[[Page 206]]

    (x) Authorize the Regional Councils to convene;
    (xi) Establish a Regional Council in each subsistence resource 
region and recommend to the Secretaries, appointees to the Regional 
Councils, pursuant to the FACA;

entities, and other persons and organizations, including international 
entities to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Federal 
subsistence management program;
    (xvi) Develop alternative permitting processes relating to the 
subsistence taking of fish and wildlife to ensure continued 
opportunities for subsistence;
    (xvii) Evaluate whether hunting, fishing, or trapping activities 
which occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands 
interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public 
lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the 
subsistence priority, and after appropriate consultation with the State 
of Alaska, the Regional Councils, and other Federal agencies, make a 
recommendation to the Secretaries for their action;
    (xviii) Identify, in appropriate specific instances, whether there 
exists additional Federal reservations, Federal reserved water rights or 
other Federal interests in lands or waters, including those in which the 
United States holds less than a fee ownership, to which the Federal 
subsistence priority attaches, and make appropriate recommendation to 
the Secretaries for inclusion of those interests within the Federal 
Subsistence Management Program; and
    (xix) Take other actions authorized by the Secretaries to implement 
Title VIII of ANILCA.
    (5) The Board may implement one or more of the following harvest and

Sec. 242.15  Rural determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine if an area or community in Alaska is 
rural. In determining whether a specific area of Alaska is rural, the 
Board shall use the following guidelines:
    (1) A community or area with a population of 2500 or less shall be 
deemed to be rural unless such a community or area possesses significant 
characteristics of a non-rural nature, or is considered to be socially 
and economically a part of an urbanized area.
    (2) Communities or areas with populations above 2500 but not more 
than 7000 will be determined to be rural or non-rural.
    (3) A community with a population of more than 7000 shall be 
presumed non-rural, unless such a community or area possesses 
significant characteristics of a rural nature.
    (4) Population data from the most recent census conducted by the 
United States Bureau of Census as updated by the Alaska Department of 
Labor shall be utilized in this process.
    (5) Community or area characteristics shall be considered in 
evaluating a community's rural or non-rural status. The characteristics 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Use of fish and wildlife;
    (ii) Development and diversity of the economy;
    (iii) Community infrastructure;
    (iv) Transportation; and
    (v) Educational institutions.
    (6) Communities or areas which are economically, socially and 
communally integrated shall be considered in the aggregate.
    (b) The Board shall periodically review rural determinations. Rural 
determinations shall be reviewed on a ten year cycle, commencing with 
the publication of the year 2000 U.S. census. Rural determinations may 
be reviewed out-of-cycle in special circumstances. Once the Board makes 
a determination that a community has changed from rural to non-rural, a 
waiting period of five years shall be required before the non-rural 
determination becomes effective.
    (c) Current determinations are listed at Sec. 242.23.


<R05>
Sec. 242.16  Customary and traditional use determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine which fish stocks and wildlife 
populations have been customarily and traditionally used for 
subsistence. These determinations shall identify the specific 
community's or area's use of specific fish stocks and wildlife 
populations. For areas managed by the National Park Service, where 
subsistence uses are allowed, the determinations may be made on an 
individual basis.
    (b) A community or area shall generally exhibit the following 
factors, which exemplify customary and traditional use. The Board shall 
make customary and traditional use determinations based on application 
of the following factors:
    (1) A long-term consistent pattern of use, excluding interruptions 
beyond the control of the community or area;
    (2) A pattern of use recurring in specific seasons for many years;
    (3) A pattern of use consisting of methods and means of harvest 
which are characterized by efficiency and economy of effort and cost, 
conditioned by local characteristics;
    (4) The consistent harvest and use of fish or wildlife as related to 
past methods and means of taking; near, or reasonably accessible from 
the community or area;
    (5) A means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing fish or 
wildlife

[[Page 210]]

which has been traditionally used by past generations, including 
consideration of alteration of past practices due to recent 
technological advances, where appropriate;
    (6) A pattern of use which includes the handing down of knowledge of 
fishing and hunting skills, values and lore from generation to 
generation;
    (7) A pattern of use in which the harvest is shared or distributed 
within a definable community of persons; and
    (8) A pattern of use which relates to reliance upon a wide diversity 
of fish and wildlife resources of the area and which provides 
substantial cultural, economic, social, and nutritional elements to the 
community or area.
    (c) The Board shall take into consideration the reports and 
recommendations of any appropriate Regional Council regarding customary 
and traditional uses of subsistence resources.
    (d) Current determinations are listed in Sec. 242.24.


<R05>
Sec. 242.17  Determining priorities for subsistence uses among rural Alaska residents.

    (a) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the subsistence taking of 
fish and wildlife on public lands in order to protect the continued 
viability of such populations, or to continue subsistence uses, the 
Board shall establish a priority among the rural Alaska residents after 
considering any recommendation submitted by an appropriate Regional 
Council.
    (b) The priority shall be implemented through appropriate 
limitations based on the application of the following criteria to each 
area, community, or individual determined to have customary and 
traditional use, as necessary:
    (1) Customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the 
mainstay of livelihood;
    (2) Local residency; and
    (3) The availability of alternative resources.
    (c) If allocation on an area or community basis is not achievable, 
then the Board shall allocate subsistence opportunity on an individual 
basis through application of the criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(3) of this section.
    (d) In addressing a situation where prioritized allocation becomes 
necessary, the Board shall solicit recommendations from the Regional 
Council in the area affected.

<R05>
Sec. 242.19  Closures and other special actions.

    (a) The Board may make or direct restriction, closure, or opening 
for the taking of fish and wildlife for non-subsistence uses on public 
lands when necessary to assure the continued viability of particular 
fish or wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of a fish or 
wildlife population, or for reasons of public safety or administration.
    (b) After consulting with the State of Alaska, providing adequate 
notice to the public, and holding at least one public hearing in the 
vicinity of the affected communities, the Board may make or direct 
temporary openings or closures to subsistence uses of a particular fish 
or wildlife population on public lands to assure the continued viability 
of a fish or wildlife population, or for reasons of public safety or 
administration. A temporary opening or closure will not extend beyond 
the regulatory year for which it is promulgated.
    (c) In an emergency situation, the Board may direct immediate 
openings or closures related to subsistence or non-subsistence uses of 
fish and wildlife on public lands, if necessary to assure the continued 
viability of a fish or wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses 
of fish or wildlife, or for public safety reasons. The Board shall 
publish notice and reasons justifying the emergency closure in the 
Federal Register and in newspapers of any area affected. The emergency 
closure shall be effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 
days, and may not be extended unless it is determined by the Board, 
after notice and hearing, that such closure should be extended.
    (d) The Board may make or direct a temporary change to open or 
adjust the seasons or to increase the bag limits for subsistence uses of 
fish and wildlife populations on public lands. An affected rural 
resident, community, Regional Council, or administrative agency may 
request a temporary change in seasons or bag limits. Prior to 
implementing a temporary change, the Board shall consult with the State, 
shall comply with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 551-559 (Administrative 
Procedure Act or APA), and shall provide

adequate notice and opportunity to comment. The length of any temporary 
change shall be confined to the minimum time period or bag limit 
determined by the Board to be necessary to satisfy subsistence uses. In 
addition, a temporary change may be made only after the Board determines 
that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the 
conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations. The decision of 
the Board shall be the final administrative action.
    (e) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to direct 
temporary or emergency closures on public lands managed by the agency 
remain unaffected by the regulations in this part, which authorize the 
Board to make or direct restrictions, closures, or temporary changes for 
subsistence uses on public lands.
    (f) You may not take fish and wildlife in violation of a 
restriction, closure, opening, or temporary change authorized by the 
Board.

regulations must comply with all reporting provisions which the Board 
may require.
    (e) Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags or other documents 
required by this section must be produced by individuals upon the 
request of a State or Federal law enforcement agent. Persons engaged in 
taking fish and wildlife under these regulations must allow State or 
Federal law enforcement agents to inspect any apparatus designed to be 
used, or capable of being used to take fish or wildlife, or any fish or 
wildlife in possession.
    (f) The Board may implement harvest reporting systems or permit 
systems where:
    (1) The fish and wildlife is taken by an individual who is required 
to obtain and possess pertinent State harvest permits, tickets, or tags, 
or Federal permits, harvest tickets, or tags;
    (2) A qualified subsistence user may designate another qualified 
subsistence user to take fish and wildlife on his or her behalf; or
    (3) The fish and wildlife is taken by individuals or community 
representatives permitted a one-time or annual harvest for special 
purposes including ceremonies and potlatches;
    (4) The fish and wildlife is taken by representatives of a community 
permitted to do so in a manner consistent with the community's customary 
and traditional practices.
    (g) When the taking of fish and wildlife is in accordance with 
Sec. 242.6, the permittee must comply with all of the reporting 
requirements of the permit. Individuals designated on a permit to take 
fish and wildlife are required to have that permit in their possession 
during the taking and to comply with all requirements of the permit, 
regulations in subpart A Sec. 242.6 pertaining to validation and 
reporting, and to regulations in

[[Page 226]]

subpart D pertaining to methods and means, possession and 
transportation, and utilization.
    (h) When a community takes fish and wildlife in accordance with 
Sec. 242.6(f) (3) and (4), the harvest activity must be reported in 
accordance with regulations specified for that community in subpart D, 
and as required by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be 
responsible for particular reporting requirements in the conditions 
permitting a specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these 
conditions is a violation of these regulations. Community harvests are 
reviewed annually under subpart D regulations.

36 CFR part 242 may be punished by a fine or by imprisonment in 
accordance with the penalty provisions applicable to the public land 
where the violation occurred.

Sec. 242.9  Information collection requirements.

    (a) These rules contain information collection requirements subject 
to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501-
3520. They apply to subsistence uses on public lands in Alaska.
    (1) Section 242.20, Request for reconsideration. The information 
collection requirements contained in this section provide a standardized 
process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the 
Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but 
required to receive a final determination by the Board. The Department 
of the Interior estimates that a request for reconsideration will take 4 
hours to prepare and submit.
    (2) Section 242.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and 
reports. The information collection requirements contained in this 
section provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not 
authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. These 
regulations require this information before a rural Alaska resident may 
engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The Department estimates 
that the average time necessary to obtain and comply with this permit 
information collection requirement is 15 minutes.
    (3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in 
this part imposed upon subsistence uses are those adopted from State 
regulations. The information collection requirements must be satisfied 
before rural Alaska residents may engage in subsistence uses on public 
lands. The Department estimates that the average burden imposed upon 
individuals will be 8 minutes.
    (b) Direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of 
the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street NW., MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; 
and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 
(1018-0075), Washington, DC 20503. Additionally, information 
requirements will be imposed when the Regional Councils, subject to the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B. 
Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their 
implementation.

Sec. 242.15  Rural determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine if an area or community in Alaska is 
rural. In determining whether a specific area of Alaska is rural, the 
Board shall use the following guidelines.
    (1) A community or area with a population of 2500 or less shall be 
deemed to be rural unless such a community or area possesses significant 
characteristics of a non-rural nature, or is considered to be socially 
and economically a part of an urbanized area.
    (2) Communities or areas with populations above 2500 but not more 
than 7000 will be determined to be rural or non-rural.
    (3) A community with a population of more than 7000 shall be 
presumed non-rural, unless such a community or area possesses 
significant characteristics of a rural nature.
    (4) Population data from the most recent census conducted by the 
United States Bureau of Census as updated by the Alaska Department of 
Labor shall be utilized in this process.
    (5) Community or area characteristics shall be considered in 
evaluating a community's rural or non-rural status. The characteristics 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Use of fish and wildlife;
    (ii) Development and diversity of the economy;
    (iii) Community infrastructure;
    (iv) Transportation; and
    (v) Educational institutions.
    (6) Communities or areas which are economically, socially and 
communally integrated shall be considered in the aggregate.
    (b) The Board shall periodically review rural determinations. Rural 
determinations shall be reviewed on a ten year cycle, commencing with 
the publication of the year 2000 U.S. census. Rural determinations may 
be reviewed out-of-cycle in special circumstances. Once the Board makes 
a determination that a community has changed from rural to non-rural, a 
waiting period of five years shall be required before the non-rural 
determination becomes effective.
    (c) Current determinations are listed at Sec. 242.23.

Sec. 242.16  Customary and traditional use determination process.

    (a) The Board shall determine which fish stocks and wildlife 
populations have been customarily and traditionally used for 
subsistence. These determinations shall identify the specific 
community's or area's use of specific fish stocks and wildlife 
populations. For areas managed by the National Park Service, where 
subsistence uses are allowed, the determinations may be made on an 
individual basis.
    (b) A community or area shall generally exhibit the following 
factors, which exemplify customary and traditional use. The Board shall 
make customary and traditional use determinations based on application 
of the following factors:
    (1) A long-term consistent pattern of use, excluding interruptions 
beyond the control of the community or area;
    (2) A pattern of use recurring in specific seasons for many years;
    (3) A pattern of use consisting of methods and means of harvest 
which are characterized by efficiency and economy of effort and cost, 
conditioned by local characteristics;
    (4) The consistent harvest and use of fish or wildlife as related to 
past methods and means of taking; near, or reasonably accessible from 
the community or area;
    (5) A means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing fish or 
wildlife which has been traditionally used by past generations, 
including consideration of alteration

[[Page 230]]

of past practices due to recent technological advances, where 
appropriate;
    (6) A pattern of use which includes the handing down of knowledge of 
fishing and hunting skills, values and lore from generation to 
generation;
    (7) A pattern of use in which the harvest is shared or distributed 
within a definable community of persons; and
    (8) A pattern of use which relates to reliance upon a wide diversity 
of fish and wildlife resources of the area and which provides 
substantial cultural, economic, social, and nutritional elements to the 
community or area.
    (c) The Board shall take into consideration the reports and 
recommendations of any appropriate Regional Council regarding customary 
and traditional uses of subsistence resources.
    (d) Current determinations are listed in Sec. 242.24.

Sec. 242.17  Determining priorities for subsistence uses among rural 
          Alaska residents.

    (a) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the subsistence taking of 
fish and wildlife on public lands in order to protect the continued 
viability of such populations, or to continue subsistence uses, the 
Board shall establish a priority among the rural Alaska residents after 
considering any recommendation submitted by an appropriate Regional 
Council.
    (b) The priority shall be implemented through appropriate 
limitations based on the application of the following criteria to each 
area, community, or individual determined to have customary and 
traditional use, as necessary:
    (1) Customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the 
mainstay of livelihood;
    (2) Local residency; and
    (3) The availability of alternative resources.
    (c) If allocation on an area or community basis is not achievable, 
then the Board shall allocate subsistence opportunity on an individual 
basis through application of the above criteria.
    (d) In addressing a situation where prioritized allocation becomes 
necessary, the Board shall solicit recommendations from the Regional 
Council in the area affected.

final regulations pertaining to subpart C in the Federal Register. A 
Board decision to change a community's or area's status from rural to 
non-rural will not become effective until five years after the decision 
has been made.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Proposals for changes to subparts A and B shall be accepted by 
the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR 14.1-4.

Sec. 242.19  Closures and other special actions.

    (a) The Board may make or direct restriction or closure of the 
taking of fish and wildlife for non-subsistence uses on public lands 
when necessary to assure the continued viability of particular fish or 
wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of a fish or wildlife 
population, or for reasons of public safety or administration.
    (b) After consulting with the State of Alaska, providing adequate 
notice to the public, and holding at least one public hearing in the 
vicinity of the affected communities, the Board may make or direct 
temporary closures to subsistence uses of a particular fish or wildlife 
population on public lands to assure the continued viability of a fish 
or wildlife population, or for reasons of public safety or 
administration. A temporary closure will not extend beyond the 
regulatory year in which it is promulgated.
    (c) In an emergency situation, the Board may direct immediate 
closures related to subsistence or non-subsistence uses of fish and 
wildlife on public lands, if necessary to assure the continued viability 
of a fish or wildlife population, or for public safety reasons. The 
Board shall publish notice and reasons justifying the emergency closure 
in the Federal Register and in newspapers of any area affected. The 
emergency closure shall be effective when directed by the Board, may not 
exceed 60 days, and may not be extended unless it is determined by the 
Board, after notice and hearing, that such closure should be extended.
    (d) The Board may make or direct a temporary change to open or 
adjust the seasons or to increase the bag limits for subsistence uses of 
fish and wildlife populations on public lands. An affected rural 
resident, community, Regional Council, or administrative agency may 
request a temporary change in seasons or bag limits. Prior to 
implementing a temporary change, the Board shall consult with the State, 
shall comply with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 551-559 (Administrative 
Procedures Act or APA), and shall provide adequate notice and 
opportunity to comment. The length of any temporary change shall be 
confined to the minimum time period or bag limit determined by the Board 
to be necessary to satisfy subsistence uses. In addition, a temporary 
change may be made only after the Board determines that the proposed 
temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of healthy 
fish and wildlife populations. The decision of the Board shall be the 
final administrative action.
    (e) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to direct 
temporary or emergency closures on public lands managed by the agency 
remain unaffected by these regulations, which authorize the Board to 
make or direct restrictions, closures, or temporary changes for 
subsistence uses on public lands.
    (f) Taking fish and wildlife in violation of a restriction, or 
temporary change authorized by the Board is prohibited.

the Board.
    (c) To file a request for reconsideration, the requestor must notify 
the Board in writing within sixty (60) days of the effective date or 
date of publication of the notice, whichever is earliest, for which 
reconsideration is requested.
    (d) It is the responsibility of a requestor to provide the Board

    (5) A statement of how the requestor would like the action changed.
    (e) Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Board shall 
transmit a copy of such request to any appropriate Regional Council for 
review and recommendation. The Board shall consider any Regional Council 
recommendations in making a final decision.
    (f) If the request is justified, the Board shall implement a final 
decision on a request for reconsideration after compliance with 5 U.S.C.

obtained anywhere in the State under Federal and State regulations 
equals or exceeds the harvest limit in that Unit.
    (2) An animal taken under Federal or State regulations by any member 
of a community with an established community harvest limit for that

regulatory year.
    (6) A harvest limit applies to the number of animals that can be 
taken during a regulatory year; however, harvest limits for grouse, 
ptarmigan, and caribou (in some Units) are regulated by the number that 
may be taken per day. Harvest limits of grouse and ptarmigan are also 
regulated by the number that can be held in possession.

user to take wildlife on his or her behalf in accordance with 
Sec. 242.6, the permit shall be furnished in place of a signed 
statement.
    (8) A rural Alaska resident who has been designated to take wildlife 
on behalf of another rural Alaska resident in accordance with 
Sec. 242.6, shall promptly deliver the wildlife to that rural Alaska

restricted to one sex in the local area, you may not possess or 
transport the carcass of an animal taken in that area unless sufficient 
portions of the external sex organs remain attached to indicate 
conclusively the sex of the animal; however, this paragraph (c)(10)(ii) 
does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has been butchered and 
placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption upon arrival at 
the location where it is to be consumed.
    (iii) If a moose harvest limit includes an antler size or 
configuration restriction, you may not possess or transport the moose 
carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or its 
parts. If you possess a set of antlers with less than the required 
number of brow tines on one antler, you must leave the antlers naturally 
attached to the unbroken, uncut skull plate; however, this paragraph 
(c)(10)(iii) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have 
been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for 
consumption after arrival at the place where it is to be stored or 
consumed.
    (11) You must leave all edible meat from caribou and moose harvested

their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under Federal subsistence 
management regulations to support personal and family needs is permitted 
as customary trade, so long as it does not constitute a significant 
commercial enterprise. The Board may recognize regional differences and 
define customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.
    (12) Individuals, businesses, or organizations may not purchase 
subsistence-taken fish, their parts, or their eggs for use in, or resale 
to, a significant commercial enterprise.

Sec. 251.9  Management of Municipal Watersheds.

    (a) The Forest Service shall manage National Forest watersheds that 
supply municipal water under multiple use prescriptions in forest plans 
(36 CFR part 219). When a municipality desires protective actions or 
restrictions of use not specified in the forest plan, within agreements, 
and/or special use authorizations, the municipality must apply to the 
Forest Service for consideration of these needs.
    (b) When deemed appropriate by the Regional Forester, requested 
restrictions and/or requirements shall be incorporated in the forest 
plan without written agreements. Written agreements with municipalities 
to assure protection of water supplies are appropriate when requested by 
the municipality and deemed necessary by the Regional Forester. A 
special use authorization may be needed to effect these agreements.
    (c) In preparing any municipal watershed agreement for approval by 
the Regional Forester or issuing special use authorization to protect 
municipal water supplies, the authorized forest officer shall specify 
the types of uses, if any, to be restricted; the nature and extent of 
any restrictions; any special land management protective measures and/or 
any necesary standards and guidelines needed to protect water quality or 
quantity; and any resources that are to be provided by the municipality.
    (d) A special use authorization (36 CFR 251.54) is required if the 
municipality is to use the subject lands, restrict public access, or 
control resource uses within the watershed. Special use authorizations 
issued pursuant to this section are subject to the same fee waivers, 
conditions, and procedures applicable to all other special uses as set 
forth in subpart B of this part.
    (e) Any municipal wateshed management agreements, special use 
authorizations, requirements, and/or restrictions shall be consistent 
with forest plans, or amendments and revisions thereto.

<R05>
Sec. 251.14  Conditions, rules and regulations to govern exercise of timber rights reserved in conveyance to the United States.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, in conveyance of lands to the United States under authorized 
programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter 
upon the conveyed lands and to cut and remove timber and timber 
products, said reservations shall be subject to the following 
conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in and made a 
part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such 
reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:
    (1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights, hereinafter 
called operator, shall give prior written notice to Forest Service and 
shall submit satisfactory evidence of authority to exercise such rights. 
Operator shall repair, replace, or restore any improvements owned by the 
United States or its permittees, damaged or destroyed by the timber 
operations and he shall restore the land to a condition safe and 
reasonably serviceable for authorized programs of Forest Service.
    (2) In cutting and removing timber and timber products and in 
locating, constructing and using mills, logging roads, railroads, 
chutes, landings, camps, or other improvements, no unnecessary damage 
shall be done to the air, water and soil resources, and to young growth 
or to trees left standing. All survey monuments and witness trees shall 
be preserved.
    (3) All trees, timber or timber products of species or sizes not 
specifically reserved which are unnecessarily cut, damaged, or destroyed 
by operator shall be paid for at double the usual rates charged in the 
locality for sales of similar National Forest timber and timber 
products.
    (4) Slash and debris resulting from the cutting, removal, or 
processing of timber or timber products, or from construction 
operations, shall be disposed of or otherwise treated by methods 
acceptable to the Forest Service. Such treatment or disposal shall 
comply with known air and water quality criteria and standards and 
include necessary preparatory work such as fireline constructing and 
snag falling. The timing of log removal and preparatory work shall not 
unnecessarily delay slash disposal or treatment.
    (5) Operator is authorized to construct and maintain buildings, 
facilities, and other improvements, including roads needed to log the 
reserved timber. Construction and maintenance plans, designs, and 
location shall be approved in writing by Forest Service before 
construction is started.
    (6) All buildings, camps, equipment, and other structures or 
improvements shall be removed from the lands within 6 months from date 
of completion or abandonment of the operation, unless relieved by Forest 
Service by issuance of a special-use permit. Otherwise such buildings, 
camps, equipment, and other structures or improvements shall become the 
property of the United States, but this does not relieve operator of 
liability for the cost of removal and restoration of the site.
    (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt operator 
from any requirements of the laws of the States in which situated; nor 
from compliance with or conformity to any requirement of any law which 
later may be enacted and which otherwise would be applicable.
    (8) While operations are in progress, operator, his employees, any 
subcontractors, and their employees, shall take all reasonable and 
practicable action in the prevention and suppression of fire, and shall 
be available for service in the suppression of all fires within the 
reserved area. On any fire not caused by negligence on the part of the 
operator, Forest Service shall pay operator at fire-fighting rates 
common in the area or at prior agreed rates for equipment or manpower 
furnished by operator.
    (9) Only one cutting shall be made on any portion of the area on 
which timber is reserved. Forest Service may permit the cutting of 
special products,

[[Page 307]]

or products the cutting of which is seasonal, on any portion of the area 
in advance of the cutting of the chief products of the reserved timber. 
Each reservation of timber shall include a specific period of time 
within which material may be removed.
    (10) Forest Service shall have the right to use any road constructed 
under the authority of this timber reservation for any and all purposes 
in connection with the protection and administration of the National 
Forest.
    (11) Operator shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent 
pollution of the air, soil, and water, in operation hereunder.
    (12) All activities by operator in the reserved area shall be 
conducted in a safe, orderly, and workmanlike manner.
    (13) For the protection of streamcourses, the following measures 
shall be observed by operator: Culverts or bridges will be required on 
temporary roads at all points where it is necessary to cross 
streamcourses. Such facilities shall be of sufficient size and design to 
provide unobstructed flow of water. Equipment will not be operated in 
streamcourses except at designated crossings and as essential to 
construction or removal of culverts and bridges. Any stream that is 
temporarily diverted must be restored to the natural course as soon as 
practicable, and in any event prior to a major runoff season.
    (14) Operator shall perform currently as weather and soil conditions 
permit, the following erosion control work on portions of the reserved 
area where logging is in progress or has been completed: Construct 
cross-ditches and water-spreading ditches where staked or otherwise 
marked on the ground by Forest Service; after a temporary road has 
served operator's purpose, operator shall remove culverts and bridges, 
eliminate ditches, out-slope and cross-drain roadbed and remove ruts and 
berms to the extent necessary to stabilize fills and otherwise minimize 
erosion; operator shall avoid felling into, yarding in, or crossing 
natural meadows; and operations will not take place when soil and water 
conditions are such that excessive damage will result.
    (b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (14) of this section shall not apply to reservations 
contained in conveyances of land to the United States under the Act of 
March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82, 16 U.S.C. 555).
    (c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision 
thereof, reserves timber rights for the cutting and removal of timber 
and timber products, in the conveyance of land to the United States 
under authorized programs of the Forest Service and there are provisions 
in the laws of such State or in conditions, rules and regulations 
promulgated by such State, agency or political subdivision thereof, 
which the Chief, Forest Service, determines are adequate to protect the 
interest of the United States in the event of the exercise of such 
reservation, the Chief, Forest Service, is hereby authorized, in his 
discretion, to subject the exercise of the reservation to such statutory 
provisions or such conditions, rules, and regulations in lieu of the the 
conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (14) of this section. In that event, such statutory provisions 
or such conditions, rules and regulations shall be expressed in and made 
a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and the 
reservation shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto.

All regulations heretofore issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to 
govern the exercise of timber rights reserved in conveyance of lands to 
the United States under authorized programs of Forest Service shall 
continue to be effective in the cases to which they are applicable, but 
are hereby superseded as to timber rights hereafter reserved in 
conveyances under such programs.

<R05>
Sec. 251.15  Conditions, rules and regulations to govern exercise of mineral rights reserved in conveyances to the United States.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, in conveyances of lands to the United States under authorized 
programs of

[[Page 308]]

the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter upon the 
conveyed lands and to prospect for, mine and remove minerals, oil, gas, 
or other inorganic substances, said reservations shall be subject to the 
following conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in 
and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such 
reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:
    (1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights shall give 
prior written notice to the Forest Service and shall submit satisfactory 
evidence of authority to exercise such rights. Only so much of the 
surface of the lands shall be occupied, used, or disturbed as is 
necessary in bona fide prospecting for, drilling, mining (including the 
milling or concentration of ores), and removal of the reserved minerals, 
oil, gas, or other inorganic substances.
    (2)(i) None of the lands in which minerals are reserved shall be so 
used, occupied, or disturbed as to preclude their full use for 
authorized programs of the Forest Service until the record owner of the 
reserved rights, or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, shall 
have applied for and received a permit authorizing such use, occupancy, 
or disturbance of those specifically described parts of the lands as may 
reasonably be necessary to exercise of the reserved rights.
    (ii) Said permit shall be issued upon agreement as to conditions 
necessary to protect the interest of the United States including such 
conditions deemed necessary to provide for the safety of the public and 
other users of the land, and upon initial payment of the annual fee, 
which shall be at the rate of $2 per acre or fraction of acre included 
in the permit.
    (iii) The permit shall also provide that the record owner of the 
reserved right or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, will 
repair or replace any improvements damaged or destroyed by the mining 
operations and restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably 
serviceable for authorized programs of the Forest Service, and shall 
provide for a bond in sufficient amount as determined necessary by the 
Forest Service to guarantee such repair, replacement or restoration.
    (iv) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
aforesaid permit shall be cause for termination of all rights to use, 
occupy, or disturb the surface of the lands covered thereby, but in 
event of such termination a new permit shall be issued upon application 
when the causes for termination of the preceding permit have been 
satisfactorily remedied and the United States reimbursed for any 
resultant damage to it.
    (3) All structures, other improvements, and materials shall be 
removed from the lands within one year after date of termination of the 
aforementioned permit. Should the holder of the permit fail to do so 
within the specified time, the Forest Service may remove, destroy or 
otherwise dispose of said structures, other improvements, and materials 
at the permittee's expense, or in lieu thereof, may upon written notice 
to the permittee, assume title thereto in the name of the United States.
    (4) Timber and/or young growth cut or destroyed in connection with 
exercise of the reserved right shall be paid for at rates determined by 
the Forest Service to be fair and equitable for comparable timber and/or 
young growth in the locality. All slash resulting from cutting or 
destruction of timber or young growth shall be disposed of as required 
by the Forest Service.
    (5) In the prospecting for, mining, and removal of reserved 
minerals, oil, gas, or other inorganic substances all reasonable 
provisions shall be made for the disposal of tailings, dumpage, and 
other deleterious materials or substances in such manner as to prevent 
obstruction, pollution, or deterioration of water resources.
    (6) Nothing herein contained shall be construed to exempt operators 
or the mining operations from any requirements of applicable State laws 
nor from compliance with or conformity to any requirement of any law 
which later may be enacted and which otherwise would be applicable.
    (7) While any activities and/or operations incident to the exercise 
of the reserved rights are in progress, the operators, contractors, 
subcontractors,

[[Page 309]]

and any employees thereof shall use due diligence in the prevention and 
suppression of fires, and shall comply with all rules and regulations 
applicable to the land.
    (b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (7) of this section shall not apply to reservations 
contained in conveyances of lands to the United States under the Act of 
March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82; 16 U.S.C. 555).
    (c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision 
thereof, reserves minerals, oil, gas, or other inorganic substances, in 
the conveyance of land to the United States under authorized programs of 
the Forest Service and there are provisions in the laws of such State or 
in conditions, rules and regulations promulgated by such State, agency 
or political subdivision thereof, which the Chief, Forest Service, 
determines are adequate to protect the interest of the United States in 
the event of the exercise of such reservation, the Chief, Forest 
Service, is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to subject the 
exercise of the reservation to such statuatory provisions or such 
conditions, rules and regulations in lieu of the conditions, rules and 
regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (7) of this section. 
In that event, such statuatory provisions or such conditions, rules and 
regulations shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of 
conveyance to the United States and the reservation shall be exercised 
thereunder and in obedience thereto.

All regulations heretofore issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to 
govern the exercise of mineral rights reserved in conveyances of lands 
to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service 
shall continue to be effective in the cases to which they are 
applicable, but are hereby superseded as to mineral rights hereafter 
reserved in conveyances under such programs.

Sec. 251.54  Proposal and application requirements and procedures.

    (a) Early notice. When an individual or entity proposes to occupy 
and use National Forest System lands, the proponent is required to 
contact the Forest Service office(s) responsible for the management of 
the affected land as early as possible in advance of the proposed use.
    (b) Filing proposals. Proposals for special uses must be filed in 
writing with or presented orally to the District Ranger or Forest 
Supervisor having jurisdiction over the affected land (Sec. 200.2 of 
this chapter), except as follows:
    (1) Proposals for projects on lands under the jurisdiction of two or

must be filed with the State Office, Bureau of Land Management, pursuant 
to regulations at 43 CFR part 2882.
    (c) Rights of proponents. A proposal to obtain a special use 
authorization does not grant any right or privilege to use National 
Forest System lands. Rights or privileges to occupy and use National 
Forest System lands under this subpart are conveyed only through 
issuance of a special use authorization.
    (d) Proposal content--(1) Proponent identification. Any proponent 
for a special use authorization must provide the proponent's name and 
mailing address, and, if the proponent is not an individual, the name 
and address of the proponent's agent who is authorized to receive notice 
of actions pertaining to the proposal.
    (2) Required information--(i) Noncommercial group uses. Paragraphs 
(d)(3) through (d)(5) of this section do not apply to proposals for 
noncommercial group uses. A proponent for noncommercial group uses shall 
provide the following:

and

[[Page 316]]

    (E) The name of the person or persons 21 years of age or older who 
will sign a special use authorization on behalf of the proponent.
    (ii) All other special uses. At a minimum, proposals for special 
uses other than noncommercial group uses must include the information 
contained in paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this section. In 
addition, if requested by an authorized officer, a proponent in one of 
the following categories must furnish the information specified for that 
category:
    (A) If the proponent is a State or local government agency: a copy 
of the authorization under which the proposal is made;
    (B) If the proponent is a public corporation: the statute or other 
authority under which it was organized;
    (C) If the proponent is a Federal Government agency: the title of

    (D) If the proponent is a private corporation:
    (1) Evidence of incorporation and its current good standing;
    (2) If reasonably obtainable by the proponent, the name and address 
of each shareholder owning three percent or more of the shares, together 
with the number and percentage of any class of voting shares of the 
entity which such shareholder is authorized to vote;
    (3) The name and address of each affiliate of the entity;

number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that 
entity owned, either directly or indirectly by the affiliate; or
    (E) If the proponent is a partnership, association, or other 
unincorporated entity: a certified copy of the partnership agreement or 
other similar document, if any, creating the entity, or a certificate of 
good standing under the laws of the State.
    (3) Technical and financial capability. The proponent is required to 
provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the authorized officer that the 
proponent has, or prior to commencement of construction will have, the 
technical and financial capability to construct, operate, maintain, and 
terminate the project for which an authorization is requested, and the 
proponent is otherwise acceptable.
    (4) Project description. Except for requests for planning permits 
for a major development, a proponent must provide a project description, 
including maps and appropriate resource information, in sufficient 
detail to enable the authorized officer to determine the feasibility of 
a proposed project or activity, any benefits to be provided to the 
public, the safety of the proposal, the lands to be occupied or used, 
the terms and conditions to be included, and the proposal's compliance 
with applicable laws, regulations, and orders.
    (5) Additional information. The authorized officer may require any 
other information and data necessary to determine feasibility of a 
project or activity proposed; compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and orders; compliance with requirements for associated 
clearances, certificates, permits, or licenses; and suitable terms and 
conditions to be included in the authorization. The authorized officer 
shall make requests for any additional information in writing.
    (e) Pre-application actions. (1) Initial screening. Upon receipt of 
a request for any proposed use other than for noncommercial group use, 
the authorized officer shall screen the proposal to ensure that the use 
meets the following minimum requirements applicable to all special uses:
    (i) The proposed use is consistent with the laws, regulations, 
orders, and policies establishing or governing National Forest System 
lands, with other applicable Federal law, and with applicable State and 
local health and sanitation laws.
    (ii) The proposed use is consistent or can be made consistent with 
standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource 
management plan prepared under the National Forest Management Act and 36 
CFR part 219.

[[Page 317]]

    (iii) The proposed use will not pose a serious or substantial risk 
to public health or safety.
    (iv) The proposed use will not create an exclusive or perpetual 
right of use or occupancy.
    (v) The proposed use will not unreasonably conflict or interfere 
with administrative use by the Forest Service, other scheduled or 
authorized existing uses of the National Forest System, or use of 
adjacent non-National Forest System lands.
    (vi) The proponent does not have any delinquent debt owed to the 
Forest Service under terms and conditions of a prior or existing 
authorization, unless such debt results from a decision on an 
administrative appeal or from a fee review and the proponent is current 
with the payment schedule.
    (vii) The proposed use does not involve gambling or providing of 
sexually oriented commercial services, even if permitted under State 
law.
    (viii) The proposed use does not involve military or paramilitary 
training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless 
such training or exercises are federally funded.
    (ix) The proposed use does not involve disposal of solid waste or 
disposal of radioactive or other hazardous substances.
    (2) Results of initial screening. Any proposed use other than a 
noncommercial group use that does not meet all of the minimum 
requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section shall not 
receive further evaluation and processing. In such event, the authorized 
officer shall advise the proponent that the use does not meet the 
minimum requirements. If the proposal was submitted orally, the 
authorized officer may respond orally. If the proposal was made in 
writing, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent in writing 
that the proposed use does not meet the minimum requirements and shall 
simultaneously return the request.
    (3) Guidance and information to proponents. For proposals for 
noncommercial group use as well as for those proposals that meet the 
minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix), the authorized 
officer, to the extent practicable, shall provide the proponent guidance 
and information on the following:
    (i) Possible land use conflicts as identified by review of forest 
land and resource management plans, landownership records, and other 
readily available sources;
    (ii) Proposal and application procedures and probable time 
requirements;
    (iii) Proponent qualifications;
    (iv) Applicable fees, charges, bonding, and/or security 
requirements;
    (v) Necessary associated clearances, permits, and licenses;
    (vi) Environmental and management considerations;
    (vii) Special conditions; and
    (viii) identification of on-the-ground investigations which will 
require temporary use permits.
    (4) Confidentiality. If requested by the proponent, the authorized 
officer, or other Forest Service official, to the extent reasonable and 
authorized by law, shall hold confidential any project and program 
information revealed during pre-application contacts.
    (5) Second-level screening of proposed uses. A proposal which passes 
the initial screening set forth in paragraph (e)(1) and for which the 
proponent has submitted information as required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
of this section, proceeds to second-level screening and consideration. 
In order to complete this screening and consideration, the authorized 
officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a 
full description of the proposed use and its effects. An authorized 
officer shall reject any proposal, including a proposal for commercial 
group uses, if, upon further consideration, the officer determines that:
    (i) The proposed use would be inconsistent or incompatible with the 
purposes for which the lands are managed, or with other uses; or
    (ii) The proposed use would not be in the public interest; or
    (iii) The proponent is not qualified; or
    (iv) The proponent does not or cannot demonstrate technical or 
economic feasibility of the proposed use or the financial or technical 
capability to undertake the use and to fully comply with the terms and 
conditions of the authorization; or

[[Page 318]]

    (v) There is no person or entity authorized to sign a special use 
authorization and/or there is no person or entity willing to accept 
responsibility for adherence to the terms and conditions of the 
authorization.
    (6) NEPA compliance for second-level screening process. A request 
for a special use authorization that does not meet the criteria 
established in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(v) of this section 
does not constitute an agency proposal as defined in 40 CFR 1508.23 and, 
therefore, does not require environmental analysis and documentation.
    (f) Special requirements for certain proposals. (1) Oil and gas 
pipeline rights-of-way. These proposals must include the citizenship of 
the proponent(s) and disclose the identity of its participants as 
follows:
    (i) Citizens of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations 
of which deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of 
the United States, shall not own an appreciable interest in any oil and 
gas pipeline right-of-way or associated permit; and
    (ii) The authorized officer shall notify the House Committee on 
Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
promptly upon receipt of a proposal for a right-of-way for a pipeline 
twenty-four (24) inches or more in diameter, and no right-of-way for 
such a pipeline shall be granted until sixty (60) days (not counting 
days on which the House of Representatives or the Senate has adjourned 
for more than three (3) days) after a notice of intention to grant the 
right-of-way, together with the authorized officer's detailed findings 
as to terms and conditions the officer proposes to impose, has been 
submitted to such committees, unless each committee by resolution waives 
the waiting period.
    (2) Electric power transmission lines 66 KV or over. Any proposal 
for authority to construct and maintain a facility for the generation of 
electric power and energy or for the transmission or distribution of 
electric power and energy of 66 kilovolts or higher under this section 
must be referred to the Secretary of Energy for consultation.
    (3) Major development. Proponents of a major development may submit 
a request for a planning permit of up to 10 years in duration. Requests 
for a planning permit must include the information contained in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. Upon completion of a 
master development plan developed under a planning permit, proponents 
may then submit a request for a long-term authorization to construct and 
operate the development. At a minimum, a request for a long-term permit 
for a major development must include the information contained in 
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(5) of this section. 
Issuance of a planning permit does not prejudice approval or denial of a 
subsequent request for a special use permit for the development.
    (g) Application processing and response. (1) Acceptance of 
applications. Except for proposals for noncommercial group uses, if a 
request does not meet the criteria of both screening processes or is 
subsequently denied, the proponent must be notified with a written 
explanation of the rejection or denial and any written proposal returned 
to the proponent. If a request for a proposed use meets the criteria of 
both the initial and second-level screening processes as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the 
proponent that the agency is prepared to accept a written formal 
application for a special use authorization and shall, as appropriate or 
necessary, provide the proponent guidance and information of the type 
described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(viii) of this section.
    (2) Processing applications. (i) Upon acceptance of an application 
for a special use authorization other than a planning permit, the 
authorized officer shall evaluate the proposed use for the requested 
site, including effects on the environment. The authorized officer may 
request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full 
description of the proposed use and its effects.
    (ii) Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public 
shall receive adequate notice and an opportunity to comment upon a 
special use proposal accepted as a formal application in accordance with 
Forest Service NEPA procedures.

[[Page 319]]

    (iii) The authorized officer shall give due deference to the 
findings of another agency such as a Public Utility Commission, the 
Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, or the Interstate Commerce 
Commission in lieu of another detailed finding. If this information is 
already on file with the Forest Service, it need not be refiled, if 
reference is made to the previous filing date, place, and case number.
    (iv) Applications for noncommercial group uses must be received at 
least 72 hours in advance of the proposed activity. Applications for 
noncommercial group uses shall be processed in order of receipt, and the 
use of a particular area shall be allocated in order of receipt of fully 
executed applications, subject to any relevant limitations set forth in 
this section.
    (v) For applications for planning permits, including those issued 
for a major development as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section, the authorized officer shall assess only the applicant's 
financial and technical qualifications and determine compliance with 
other applicable laws, regulations, and orders. Planning permits may be 
categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental assessment 
or environmental impact statement pursuant to Forest Service Handbook 
1909.15 (36 CFR 200.4).
    (3) Response to applications for noncommercial group uses. (i) All 
applications for noncommercial group uses shall be deemed granted and an 
authorization shall be issued for those uses pursuant to the 
determination as set forth below, unless applications are denied within 
48 hours of receipt. Where an application for a noncommercial group use 
has been granted or is deemed to have been granted and an authorization 
has been issued under this paragraph, an authorized officer may revoke 
that authorization only as provided under Sec. 251.60(a)(1)(i).
    (ii) An authorized officer shall grant an application for a special 
use authorization for a noncommercial group use upon a determination 
that:
    (A) Authorization of the proposed activity is not prohibited by the 
rules at 36 CFR part 261, subpart B, or by Federal, State, or local law 
unrelated to the content of expressive activity;
    (B) Authorization of the proposed activity is consistent or can be 
made consistent with the standards and guidelines in the applicable 
forest land and resource management plan required under the National 
Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219;
    (C) The proposed activity does not materially impact the 
characteristics or functions of the environmentally sensitive resources 
or lands identified in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, chapter 30;
    (D) The proposed activity will not delay, halt, or prevent 
administrative use of an area by the Forest Service or other scheduled 
or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands, 
including but not limited to uses and activities authorized under parts 
222, 223, 228, and 251 of this chapter;
    (E) The proposed activity does not violate State and local public 
health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site. Issues 
addressed by State and local public health laws and regulations as 
applied to the proposed site include but are not limited to:
    (1) The sufficiency of sanitation facilities;
    (2) The sufficiency of waste-disposal facilities;
    (3) The availability of sufficient potable drinking water;
    (4) The risk of disease from the physical characteristics of the 
proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site; 
and
    (5) The risk of contamination of the water supply;
    (F) The proposed activity will not pose a substantial danger to 
public safety. Considerations of public safety must not include concerns 
about possible reaction to the users' identity or beliefs from non-
members of the group that is seeking an authorization and shall be 
limited to the following:
    (1) The potential for physical injury to other forest users from the 
proposed activity;
    (2) The potential for physical injury to users from the physical 
characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated 
with the proposed site;
    (3) The potential for physical injury to users from scheduled or 
existing

[[Page 320]]

uses or activities on National Forest System lands; and
    (4) The adequacy of ingress and egress in case of an emergency;
    (G) The proposed activity does not involve military or paramilitary 
training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless 
such training or exercises are federally funded; and
    (H) A person or persons 21 years of age or older have been 
designated to sign and do sign a special use authorization on behalf of 
the applicant.
    (iii) If an authorized officer denies an application because it does 
not meet the criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) 
of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in 
writing of the reasons for the denial. If an alternative time, place, or 
manner will allow the applicant to meet the eight evaluation criteria, 
an authorized officer shall offer that alternative. If an application is 
denied solely under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section and all 
alternatives suggested are unacceptable to the applicant, the authorized 
officer shall offer to have completed the requisite environmental and 
other analyses for the requested site. A decision to grant or deny the 
application for which an environmental assessment or an environmental 
impact statement is prepared is subject to the notice and appeal 
procedures at 36 CFR part 215 and shall be made within 48 hours after 
the decision becomes final under that appeal process. A denial of an 
application under paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this 
section constitutes final agency action and is immediately subject to 
judicial review.
    (4) Response to all other applications. Based on evaluation of the 
information provided by the applicant and other relevant information 
such as environmental findings, the authorized officer shall decide 
whether to approve the proposed use, approve the proposed use with 
modifications, or deny the proposed use. A group of applications for 
similar uses having minor environmental impacts may be evaluated with 
one analysis and approved in one decision.
    (5) Authorization of a special use. Upon a decision to approve a 
special use or a group of similar special uses, the authorized officer 
may issue one or more special use authorizations as defined in 
Sec. 251.51 of this subpart.

Sec. 251.55  Nature of interest.

    (a) A holder is authorized only to occupy such land and structures 
and conduct such activities as is specified in the special use 
authorization. The holder may sublet the use and occupancy of the 
premises and improvements authorized only with the prior written 
approval of the authorized officer, but the holder shall continue to be 
responsible for compliance with all conditions of the special use 
authorization.
    (b) All rights not expressly granted are retained by the United 
States, including but not limited to (1) continuing rights of access to 
all National Forest System land (including the subsurface and air 
space); (2) a continuing right of physical entry to any part of the 
authorized facilities for inspection, monitoring, or for any other 
purposes or reason consistent with any right or obligation of the United 
States under any law or regulation; and (3) the right to require common 
use of the land or to authorize the use by others in any way not 
inconsistent with a holder's existing rights and privileges after 
consultation with all parties and agencies involved. When costs can be 
feasibly allocated and have not been amortized, a new holder may be 
required to compensate existing holders for an equitable proportion of 
the original costs or other expense associated with the common use.
    (c) Special use authorizations are subject to all outstanding valid 
rights.
    (d) Each special use authorization will specify the lands to be used 
or occupied which shall be limited to that which the authorized officer 
determines: (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized; (2) to be 
necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, and full 
utilization of the authorized facilities or the conduct of authorized 
activities; and, (3) to be necessary to protect the public health and 
safety and the environment.

[[Page 321]]

    (e) The holder will secure permission under applicable law, and pay 
in advance, the value as determined by the authorized officer for any 
mineral and vegetative materials (including timber) to be cut, removed, 
used, or destroyed by the holder from the authorized use area or other 
National Forest System land. The authorized officer may, in lieu of 
requiring an advance payment, require the holder to stockpile or stack 
the material at designated locations for later disposal by the United 
States.


<R05>
Sec. 251.56  Terms and conditions.

    (a) General. (1) Each special use authorization must contain:
    (i) Terms and conditions which will:
    (A) Carry out the purposes of applicable statutes and rules and 
regulations issued thereunder;
    (B) Minimize damage to scenic and esthetic values and fish and 
wildlife habitat and otherwise protect the environment;
    (C) Require compliance with applicable air and water quality 
standards established by or pursuant to applicable Federal or State law; 
and
    (D) Require compliance with State standards for public health and 
safety, environmental protection, and siting, construction, operation, 
and maintenance if those standards are more stringent than applicable 
Federal standards.
    (ii) Such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems 
necessary to:
    (A) Protect Federal property and economic interests;
    (B) Manage efficiently the lands subject to the use and adjacent 
thereto;
    (C) Protect other lawful users of the lands adjacent to or occupied 
by such use;
    (D) Protect lives and property;
    (E) Protect the interests of individuals living in the general area 
of the use who rely on the fish, wildlife, and other biotic resources of 
the area for subsistence purposes;
    (F) Require siting to cause the least damage to the environment, 
taking into consideration feasibility and other relevant factors; and
    (G) Otherwise protect the public interest.
    (2) Authorizations for use of National Forest System lands may be 
conditioned to require State, county, or other Federal agency licenses, 
permits, certificates, or other approval documents, such as a Federal 
Communication Commission license, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
license, a State water right, or a county building permit.
    (b) Duration and renewability--(1) Requirements. If appropriate, 
each special use authorization will specify its duration and 
renewability. The duration shall be no longer than the authorized 
officer determines to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of the 
authorization and to be reasonable in light of all circumstances 
concerning the use, including (i) resource management direction 
contained in land management and other plans; (ii) public benefits 
provided; (iii) cost and life expectancy of the authorized facilities; 
(iv) financial arrangements for the project; and (v) the life expectancy 
of associated facilities, licenses, etc. Except for special use 
authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 
1986, authorizations exceeding 30 years shall provide for revision of 
terms and conditions at specified intervals to reflect changing times 
and conditions.
    (2) Ski area permits. (i) For authorizations issued under the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer 
normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon 
consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized 
officer finds that the ski area development meets the following 
standards:
    (A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site 
investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 
years;
    (B) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing investment of 
capital is in ski-related facilities;
    (C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of 
ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation 
and maintenance costs;
    (D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, 
located predominately on land authorized under a permit;

[[Page 322]]

    (E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a 
Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or 
operation;
    (F) The United States is not the owner of the principal facilities 
within the authorized ski area.
    (ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area 
when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized 
officer's discretion:
    (A) Analysis of the information submitted by the applicant indicates 
that a shorter term is sufficient for financing of the ski area;
    (B) The ski area development, whether existing or proposed, does not 
meet the standards of paragraph (2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section; 
or
    (C) A 40-year authorization would be inconsistent with the approved 
forest land and resource management plan governing the area (36 CFR part 
219).
    (c) Preconstruction approvals. Forest Service approval of location, 
design and plans (or standards, if appropriate) of all developments 
within the authorized area will be required prior to construction.
    (d) Liability. Holders shall pay the United States for all injury, 
loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in accordance with 
existing Federal and State laws.
    (1) Holders shall also indemnify the United States for any and all 
injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, the United 
States may suffer as a result of claims, demands, losses, or judgments 
caused by the holder's use or occupancy.
    (2) Holders of special use authorizations for high risk use and 
occupancy, such as, but not limited to, powerlines and oil and gas 
pipelines, shall be held liable for all injury, loss, or damage, 
including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder's use or 
occupancy, without regard to the holder's negligence, provided that 
maximum liability shall be specified in the special use authorization as 
determined by a risk assessment, prepared in accordance with established 
agency procedures, but shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one 
occurrence. Liability for injury, loss, or damage, including fire 
suppression costs, in excess of the specified maximum shall be 
determined by the laws governing ordinary negligence of the jurisdiction 
in which the damage or injury occurred.
    (e) Bonding. An authorized officer may require the holder of a 
special use authorization for other than a noncommercial group use to 
furnish a bond or other security to secure all or any of the obligations 
imposed by the terms of the authorization or by any applicable law, 
regulation or order.
    (f) Special terms and conditions-- (1) Public service enterprises. 
Special use permits authorizing the operation of public service 
enterprises shall require that the permittee charge reasonable rates and 
furnish such services as may be necessary in the public interest, except 
where such rates and services are regulated by Federal, State or 
municipal agencies having jurisdiction.
    (2) Common carriers. Oil and gas pipelines and related facilities 
authorized under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 
449, as amended (30 U.S.C. 185), shall be constructed, operated and 
maintained as common carriers. The owners or operators of pipelines 
shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all 
oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without regard to whether such oil 
or gas was produced on Federal or nonfederal lands. In the case of oil 
or gas produced from Federal lands or from the resources on the Federal 
lands in the vicinity of the pipeline, the Secretary may, after a full 
hearing with due notice thereof to interested parties and a proper 
finding of facts, determine the proportionate amounts to be accepted, 
conveyed, transported, or purchased. The common carrier provisions of 
this section shall not apply to any natural gas pipeline operated (i) by 
any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 
821, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 717) or (ii) by any public utility subject 
to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having 
jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural 
gas to consumers within the State or municipality. Where natural gas not 
subject to State regulatory or conservation laws governing its purchase 
by pipeline companies is offered for sale, each pipeline company shall 
purchase, without

[[Page 323]]

discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the vicinity of the 
pipeline.
    (g) Conversion of Ski Area Authorizations. (1) The Forest Service 
shall request that all existing permit holders convert existing 
authorizations for ski areas to a new authorization issued pursuant to 
the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act.
    (2) Any current holder of a ski area permit who wishes to convert an 
existing permit to one issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area 
Permit Act must submit a written request for the new authorization to 
the authorized officer.
    (3) With the consent of the holder, the authorized officer shall 
convert the authorization if:
    (i) The holder is in compliance with the existing authorization;
    (ii) All fees currently due under the existing authorization are 
paid in full; and
    (iii) Any proposed modifications of terms and conditions of the 
existing authorization included in a request for conversion meet the 
standards of paragraphs (2)(i) (A) through (F) of this section and the 
relevant requirements of this subpart.
    (4) A holder retains the right to decline a new authorization 
offered pursuant to this paragraph and to continue to operate under the 
terms of the existing permit. However, pursuant to the rules at 
Sec. 251.61 of this subpart, major modifications of existing permits 
shall require conversion to a permit issued under the authority of the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act, unless the holder provides 
compelling justification for retaining the existing permit.

<R05>
Sec. 251.57  Rental fees.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part or when specifically 
authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture, special use authorizations 
shall require the payment in advance of an annual rental fee as 
determined by the authorized officer.
    (1) The fee shall be based on the fair market value of the rights 
and privileges authorized, as determined by appraisal or other sound 
business management principles.
    (2) Where annual fees of one hundred dollars ($100) or less are 
assessed, the authorized officer may require either annual payment or a 
payment covering more than one year at a time. If the annual fee is 
greater than one hundred dollars ($100), holders who are private 
individuals (that is, acting in an individual capacity), as opposed to 
those who are commercial, other corporate, or business or government 
entities, may, at their option, elect to make either annual payments or 
payments covering more than one year.
    (b) All or part of the fee may be waived by the authorized officer, 
when equitable and in the public interest, for the use and occupancy of 
National Forest System land in the following circumstances:
    (1) The holder is a State or local government or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof, excluding municipal utilities and cooperatives 
whose principal source of revenue from the authorized use is customer 
charges; or
    (2) The holder is a nonprofit association or nonprofit corporation, 
which is not controlled or owned by profit-making corporations or 
business enterprises, and which is engaged in public or semi-public 
activity to further public health, safety, or welfare, except that free 
use will not be authorized when funds derived by the holder through the 
authorization are used to increase the value of the authorized 
improvements owned by the holder, or are used to support other 
activities of the holder; or
    (3) The holder provides without charge, or at reduced charge, a 
valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary; or
    (4) When the rental fee is included in the fees for an authorized 
use or occupancy for which the United States is already receiving 
compensation; or
    (5) When a right-of-way is authorized in reciprocation for a right-
of-way conveyed to the United States; or
    (6) For rights-of-way involving cost-share roads or reciprocal 
right-of-way agreements.

[[Page 324]]

    (c) No rental fee will be charged when the holder is the Federal 
government.
    (d) No fee shall be charged when the authorization is for a 
noncommercial group use as defined in Sec. 251.51 of this subpart.
    (e) Special use authorizations issued under Sec. 251.53(g) of this 
part may require as all or a part of the consideration the 
reconditioning and maintenance of the government-owned or controlled 
structures, improvements, and land to a satisfactory standard. The total 
consideration will be based upon the fair market value of the rights and 
privileges authorized.
    (f) Special use authorizations involving government-owned or 
controlled buildings, structures, or other improvements which require 
caretakers' services, or the furnishing of special services such as 
water, electric lights, and clean-up, may require the payment of an 
additional fee or charge to cover the cost of such services.
    (g) Except where specified otherwise by terms of a special use 
authorization, rental fees may be initiated or adjusted whenever 
necessary: (1) As a result of fee review, reappraisal; or (2) upon a 
change in the holder's qualifications under paragraph (b) of this 
section; and (3) notice is given prior to initiating or adjusting rental 
fees.
    (h) Each ski area authorization issued under the authority of the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act shall include a clause that provides 
that the Forest Service may adjust and calculate future rental fees to 
reflect Agency revisions to the existing system for determining fees 
based on fair market value or to comply with any new fee system for 
determining fees based on fair market value that may be adopted after 
issuance of the authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 251.59  Transfer of authorized improvements.

    If the holder, through death, voluntary sale, transfer, or through 
enforcement of a valid legal proceeding or operation of law, ceases to 
be the owner of the authorized improvements, the authorization 
terminates upon change of ownership. Except for easements issued under 
authorities other than Sec. 251.53(e) and leases and easements under 
Sec. 251.53(l) of this subpart, the new owner of the authorized 
improvements must apply for and receive a new special use authorization. 
The new owner must meet requirements under applicable regulations of 
this subpart and agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
authorization and any new terms and conditions warranted by existing or 
prospective circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 251.60  Termination, revocation, and suspension.

    (a) Grounds for termination, revocation, and suspension. (1) 
Noncommercial group uses. (i) Revocation or suspension. An authorized 
officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for a 
noncommercial group use only under one of the following circumstances:
    (A) Under the criteria for which an application for a special use 
authorization may be denied under Sec. 251.54(h)(1);
    (B) For noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations or the 
terms and conditions of the authorization;
    (C) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges 
granted; or
    (D) With the consent of the holder.
    (ii) Administrative or judicial review. Revocation or suspension of 
a special use authorization under this paragraph constitutes final 
agency action and is immediately subject to judicial review.
    (iii) Termination. A special use authorization for a noncommercial 
group use terminates when it expires by its own terms. Termination of a 
special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency 
action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
    (2) All other special uses. (i) Revocation or suspension. An 
authorized officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for 
all other special uses, except an easement issued pursuant to 
Sec. 251.53 (e) and (l):

[[Page 325]]

    (A) For noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or the 
terms and conditions of the authorization;
    (B) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges 
granted;
    (C) With the consent of the holder; or
    (D) At the discretion of the authorized officer for specific and 
compelling reasons in the public interest.
    (ii) Administrative review. Except for revocation or suspension of 
an easement issued pursuant to Sec. 251.53 (e) and (l) of this subpart, 
a suspension or revocation of a special use authorization under this 
paragraph is subject to administrative appeal and review in accordance 
with 36 CFR part 251, subpart C, of this chapter.
    (iii) Termination. For all special uses except noncommercial group 
uses, a special use authorization terminates when, by its terms, a fixed 
or agreed-upon condition, event, or time occurs. Termination of a 
special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency 
action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the authorized officer is that 
person who issues the authorization or that officer's successor.
    (c) A right-of-way authorization granted to another Federal agency 
will be limited, suspended, revoked, or terminated only with that 
agency's concurrence.
    (d) A right-of-way authorization serving another Federal agency will 
be limited, suspended, revoked, or terminated only after advance notice 
to, and consultation with, that agency.
    (e) Except when immediate suspension pursuant to paragraph (f) of 
this section is indicated, the authorized officer shall give the holder 
written notice of the grounds for suspension or revocation under 
paragraph (a) of this section and reasonable time to cure any 
noncompliance, prior to suspension or revocation pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (f) Immediate suspension of a special use authorization, in whole or 
in part, may be required when the authorized officer deems it necessary 
to protect the public health or safety or the environment. In any such 
case, within 48 hours of a request of the holder, the superior of the 
authorized officer shall arrange for an on-site review of the adverse 
conditions with the holder. Following this review, the superior officer 
shall take prompt action to affirm, modify, or cancel the suspension.
    (g) The authorized officer may suspend or revoke easements issued 
pursuant to Sec. 251.53 (e) and (l) of this subpart under the Rules of 
Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings 
instituted by the Secretary under 7 CFR 1.130 through 1.151. No 
administrative proceeding shall be required if the easement, by its 
terms, provides that it terminates on the occurrence of a fixed or 
agreed-upon condition, event, or time.
    (h)(1) The Chief may revoke any easement granted under the 
provisions of the Act of October 13, 1964, 78 Stat. 1089, 16 U.S.C. 534:
    (i) By consent of the owner of the easement;
    (ii) By condemnation; or
    (iii) Upon abandonment after a 5-year period of nonuse by the owner 
of the easement.
    (2) Before any such easement is revoked for nonuse or abandonment, 
the owner of the easement shall be given notice and, upon the owner's 
request made within 60 days after receipt of the notice, an opportunity 
to present relevant information in accordance with the provisions of 36 
CFR part 251, subpart C, of this chapter.
    (i) Upon revocation or termination of a special use authorization, 
the holder must remove within a reasonable time the structures and 
improvements and shall restore the site to a condition satisfactory to 
the authorized officer, unless the requirement to remove structures or 
improvements is otherwise waived in writing or in the authorization. If 
the holder fails to remove the structures or improvements within a 
reasonable period, as determined by the authorized officer, they shall 
become the property of the United States, but holder shall remain liable 
for the costs of removal and site restoration.

Sec. 251.61  Modifications.

    (a) A holder shall file a new or amended application for a special 
use authorization to cover new, changed, or additional use(s) or area.
    (1) In approving or denying changes or modifications, the authorized 
officer shall consider among other things, the findings or 
recommendations of other involved agencies and whether the terms and 
conditions of the existing authorization may be continued or revised, or 
a new authorization issued.
    (2) Changes during construction, or at any other time, from the 
approved plans or the location shown in the application or authorization 
shall be allowed only with the prior approval of the authorized officer.
    (b) A holder may be required to furnish as-built plans, map(s), or 
survey(s) upon completion of construction.
    (c) A holder shall obtain prior approval from the authorized officer 
for modifications to approved uses that involve any activity impacting 
the environment, other users, or the public.

Sec. 251.62  Acceptance.

    Except for an easement, a special use authorization shall become 
effective when signed by both the applicant and the authorized officer. 
The authorization must be signed by the applicant and returned to the 
authorized officer within 60 days of its receipt by the applicant, 
unless extended by the authorized officer. Refusal of an applicant to 
sign and accept a special use authorization within the time allowed, and 
before its final approval and signature by an authorized officer, shall 
terminate an application and constitute denial of the requested use and 
occupancy.

Sec. 251.63  Reciprocity.

    If it is determined that a right-of-way shall be needed by the 
United States across nonfederal lands directly or indirectly owned or 
controlled by an applicant for a right-of-way across Federal lands, the 
authorized officer may condition a special use authorization to require 
the holder to grant the United States the needed right-of-way.


<R05>
Sec. 251.64  Renewals.

    (a) When a special use authorization provides for renewal, the 
authorized officer shall renew it where such renewal is authorized by 
law, if the project or facility is still being used for the purpose(s) 
previously authorized and is being operated and maintained in accordance 
with all the provisions of the authorization. In making such renewal, 
the authorized officer may modify the terms, conditions, and special 
stipulations to reflect any new requirements imposed by current Federal 
and State land use plans, laws, regulations or other management 
decisions. Special uses may be reauthorized upon expiration so long as 
such use remains consistent with the decision that approved the expiring 
special use or group of uses. If significant new information or 
circumstances have developed, appropriate environmental analysis must 
accompany the decision to reauthorize the special use.
    (b) When a special use authorization does not provide for renewal, 
it is discretionary with the authorized officer, upon request from the 
holder and prior to its expiration, whether or not the authorization 
shall be renewed. A renewal pursuant to this section shall comply with 
the same provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (2) At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, the Deciding Officer 
may prepare one responsive statement to multiple appeals.
    (c) Requests for additional information. Except in discretionary 
review conducted pursuant to Sec. 251.100 and second level appeals of 
decisions made by the District Ranger pursuant to Sec. 251.87(c) of this 
subpart, the Reviewing Officer may ask any party to an appeal for 
additional information as deemed necessary to decide the appeal. Such 
requests will be limited to obtaining and evaluating information needed 
to clarify issues raised. The Reviewing Officer shall notify all parties 
of the request for information, provide it to all parties, give 
opportunity to comment, and extend time periods if necessary to allow 
for submission of the information.

<R05>
Sec. 251.96  Intervention.

    (a) A request to intervene in an appeal may be made at any time 
prior to the closing of the appeal record (Sec. 251.98) at the first 
level of appeal (Sec. 251.87). Requests to intervene in an appeal at the 
discretionary review level (Sec. 251.87(d)) shall be denied.
    (b) To request intervention in a first-level appeal under this 
subpart, a party, at a minimum, must:
    (1) Submit a written petition to intervene to the Reviewing Officer,
    (2) Be, as defined at Sec. 251.81 of this subpart, an applicant for 
or holder of a written instrument issued by the Forest Service that is 
the subject of or affected by the appeal, and have an interest that 
could be directly affected by a decision on the appeal, and
    (3) Show, in the request for intervention, how the decision on the 
appeal would directly affect petitioner's interests.
    (c) The Reviewing Officer determines whether a party requesting 
intervention meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. In 
granting intervention, the Reviewing Officer must give notice to all 
other parties to the appeal.
    (d) A granting or denial of intervention is not subject to appeal to 
a higher level.
    (e) Appellants and intervenors must concurrently furnish copies of 
all submissions to each other as well as the Deciding Officer. Failure 
to provide each other copies may result in removal of a submission from 
the appeal record. At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, 
appellants may be given additional time to review and comment on initial 
submissions by intervenors.
    (f) An intervenor cannot continue an appeal if the appellant 
withdraws the appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 251.97  Oral presentation.

    (a) Purpose. An oral presentation provides an additional opportunity 
for an appellant, and other parties to an appeal, to present their 
viewpoints to the Reviewing Officer. The purpose is to restate, 
emphasize, and/or clarify information related to an appeal. Oral 
presentations are to be conducted in an informal manner and shall not be 
subject to formal rules of procedure such as those applicable to 
judicial proceedings.

[[Page 335]]

    (b) Requests. Only an appellant may request and be granted an oral 
presentation. An appellant may request an oral presentation at any time 
prior to closing of the appeal record (Sec. 251.98). A Reviewing Officer 
shall automatically grant an oral presentation if the appellant 
requested the presentation as part of the notice of appeal.
    (c) Participation. At the discretion of the Reviewing Officer, oral 
presentations may be open to public attendance, but participation is 
limited to parties to the appeal. The Reviewing Officer shall advise all 
parties to the appeal, including the Deciding Officer, of the place, 
time, and date of the oral presentation, and how the oral presentation 
will be conducted. All parties to an appeal shall be invited to 
participate. Appellants and intervenors must bear any expense involved 
in making an oral presentation in person or by telephone.
    (d) Limitation. Oral presentations shall be held only at the first 
level of appeal (Sec. 251.87(b)).


<R05>
Sec. 251.98  Appeal record.

    The following rules apply only to the appeal record for appeals at 
the first level (Sec. 251.87 (a), (b)):
    (a) It is the responsibility of the Reviewing Officer to maintain in 
one location the documents related to the appeal.
    (b) The record consists of the documents filed with the Reviewing 
Officer including, but not limited to, the notice of appeal, responsive 
statement, replies to submissions by various parties to the appeal, 
orders and determinations made on the conduct of the appeal, and 
correspondence.
    (c) The Reviewing Officer has discretion to remove from the record 
documents that were not sent to all parties to an appeal.
    (d) Unless the Reviewing Officer has ordered otherwise, the appeal 
record closes with the expiration of the time period for filing of the 
reply(ies) to the responsive statement, or at the conclusion of an oral 
presentation, if there is one. The Reviewing Officer shall notify all 
parties to an appeal of the closure of the record.
    (e) The appeal record is open to public inspection.
    (f) In appeals involving initial decisions of the Chief 
(Sec. 251.87(a)), the establishment of an administrative record as 
defined in paragrapn (a) of this section shall not begin unless the 
Secretary elects to review the appeal. Except for the initial notice of 
appeal, any filings made previous to the Secretary's election to review 
will not be accepted.

<R05>
Sec. 251.99  Appeal decision.

    (a) The Reviewing Officer shall base the appeal decision on the 
appeal record and applicable laws, regulations, orders, policies, and 
procedures.
    (b) The Reviewing Officer shall affirm or reverse the original 
decision whole or in part and include the reason(s) for the decision. 
The Reviewing Officer may also include in the appeal decision 
instructions for further action by the Deciding Officer.
    (c) At the first level of appeal, the Reviewing Officer shall make 
and issue an appeal decision within 30 days of the date the record is 
closed.
    (d) At the second level of appeal provided in Sec. 251.87(c), the 
Reviewing Officer shall make and issue an appeal decision within 30 days 
of the date the record is received from the first level Reviewing 
Officer.
    (e) The Reviewing Officer shall send a copy of all appeal decisions 
to all participants.
    (f) Unless the next higher officer exercises the discretion to 
review an appeal decision as provided in Secs. 251.87(e) and 251.100 of 
this subpart, the appeal decision is the final administrative decision 
of the Department of Agriculture and is not subject to further review 
under this subpart or part 217 of this chapter.

[54 FR 3362, Jan. 23, 1989, as amended at 54 FR 34510, Aug. 21, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 251.100  Discretionary review.

    (a) Petitions or requests for discretionary review shall not, in and 
of themselves, give rise to a decision to exercise discretionary review. 
In electing to exercise discretion, a Reviewing Officer should consider, 
but is not limited to, such factors as controversy

[[Page 336]]

surrounding the decision, the potential for litigation, and whether the 
appeal decision is precedential in nature or establishes new policy.
    (b) As provided for in Secs. 251.87(d) and (e), 251.91(k), and 
251.92, stay decisions rendered by a Forest Supervisor, certain 
dismissal decisions rendered by Forest Service line officers, and first-
level appeal decisions rendered by Regional Foresters and the Chief 
(Sec. 251.99), are subject to discretionary review at the next highest 
administrative level. Within one day following the date of a decision 
subject to such discretionary review, the Reviewing Officer shall 
forward a copy of the decision and the initial decision upon which the 
appeal is predicated to the next higher officer.
    (c) The next higher level officer shall have 15 calendar days from 
date of receipt to decide whether or not to review an appeal decision 
and may call for or use the appeal record in deciding whether or not to 
review the appeal decision. If the record is requested, the 15-day 
period is suspended at that point. The lower level Reviewing Officer 
shall forward it within 5 days of the request. Upon receipt, the higher 
level officer shall have 15 days to decide whether or not to review the 
lower level decision. If that officer takes no action by the expiration 
of the discretionary review period, appellants shall be notified by the 
discretionary level officer that the appeal decision of the Reviewing 
Officer stands as the final administrative review decision of the 
Department of Agriculture.
    (d) When an official exercises the discretion in Sec. 251.87(d) or 
Sec. 251.87(e) of this subpart to review a dismissal or appeal decision, 
the discretionary review shall be made on the existing appeal record and 
the lower level Reviewing Officer's appeal decision. The record shall 
not be reopened to accept additional submissions from any source, 
including the Reviewing Officer whose appeal decision is being reviewed.
    (e) When an official exercises discretion to review an appeal 
decision, a Reviewing Officer may extend a stay, in whole or in part, 
during pendency of the discretionary review.
    (f) The second level Reviewing Officer shall conclude the review 
within 30 days of the date of notice issued to an appellant that the 
lower level decision will be reviewed.
    (g) If a discretionary review decision is not issued by the end of 
the 30-day review period, appellants and intervenors shall be deemed to 
have exhausted their administrative remedies for purposes of judicial 
review. In such case, appellants, intervenors, and the lower level 
Reviewing Officer shall be notified by the discretionary level officer.
    (h) The Reviewing Officer shall provide a copy of the decision to 
all appellants, intervenors, the Deciding Officer, and the lower level 
Reviewing Officer.

[54 FR 3362, Jan. 23, 1989, as amended at 54 FR 34510, Aug. 21, 1989; 55 
FR 7896, Mar. 6, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 251.101  Policy in event of judicial proceedings.

    It is the position of the Department of Agriculture that any filing 
for Federal judicial review of and relief from a decision appealable 
under this subpart is premature and inappropriate, unless the appellant 
has first sought to resolve the dispute by invoking and exhausting the 
procedures of this subpart. This position may be waived only upon a 
written finding by the Chief.


<R05>
Sec. 251.102  Applicability and effective date.

    (a) Except where applicants or holders elect the decision review 
procedures of part 217 of this chapter, appealable decisions arising 
from the issuance, approval, and administration of written instruments 
authorizing occupancy and use of National Forest System lands made on or 
after February 22, 1989, shall be subject to the procedures of this 
part.
    (b) Decisions made before February 22, 1989, arising from the 
issuance, approval, and administration of written instruments 
authorizing occupancy and use of National Forest System lands shall be 
subject to appeal under the provisions of 36 CFR 211.18.

                 Subpart D--Access to Non-Federal Lands

    Source: 56 FR 27417, June 14, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 251.110  Scope and application.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart set forth the procedures by 
which landowners may apply for access across National Forest System 
lands and the terms and conditions that govern any special use or other 
authorization that is issued by the Forest Service to permit such 
access.
    (b) These regulations apply to access across all National Forest 
System lands, including Congressionally designated areas, and supplement 
the regulations in subpart B of this part, and in parts 212 and 293 of 
this chapter. The regulations of this subpart do not affect rights-of-
way established under authority of R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932); rights-of-
way transferred to States under 23 U.S.C. 317; access rights outstanding 
in third parties at the time the United States acquired the land; or the 
rights reserved in conveyances to the United States and in other 
easements granted by an authorized officer of the Forest Service. Except 
for the aforementioned rights-of-way, currently valid special-use 
authorizations will become subject to the rules of this subpart upon 
expiration, termination, reversion, modification, or reauthorization.
    (c) Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this part and 
in parts 212 and 293 of this chapter, as appropriate, landowners shall 
be authorized such access as the authorized officer deems to be adequate 
to secure them the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land.
    (d) ln those cases where a landowner's ingress or egress across 
National Forest System lands would require surface disturbance or would 
require the use of Government-owned roads, trails, or transportation 
facilities not authorized for general public use, the landowner must 
apply for and receive a special-use or road-use authorization 
documenting the occupancy and use authorized on National Forest System 
lands or facilities and identifying the landowner's rights, privileges, 
responsibilities, and obligations.
    (e) Where ingress and egress will require the use of existing 
Government-owned roads, trails, or other transportation facilities which 
are open and available for general public use, use by the landowner 
shall be in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.
    (f) The rules of this subpart do not apply to access within 
conservation system units in Alaska which are subject to title XI of the 
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101), except 
for access to inholdings authorized by section 1110(b) of that Act.
    (g) Where there is existing access or a right of access to a 
property over non-National Forest land or over public roads that is 
adequate or that can be made adequate, there is no obligation to grant 
additional access through National Forest System lands.


<R05>
Sec. 251.111  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions in subpart B of this part, the 
following terms apply to this subpart:
    Access means the ability of landowners to have ingress and egress to 
their lands. It does not include rights-of-way for power lines or other 
utilities.
    Adequate access means a route and method of access to non-Federal 
land that provides for reasonable use and enjoyment of the non-Federal 
land consistent with similarly situated non-Federal land and that 
minimizes damage or disturbance to National Forest System lands and 
resources.
    Congressionally designated area means lands which are within the 
boundaries of a component of the National Wilderness Preservation 
System, National Wild and Scenic River System, National Trails System, 
and also National Monuments, Recreation, and Scenic Areas within the 
National Forest System, and similar areas designated by Federal statute.
    Landowner(s) means the owner(s) of non-Federal land or interests in 
land within the boundaries of the National Forest System.

[[Page 338]]


<R05>
Sec. 251.112  Application requirements.

    (a) A landowner shall apply for access across National Forest System 
lands in accordance with the application requirements of Sec. 251.54 of 
this part. Such application shall specifically include a statement of 
the intended mode of access to, and uses of, the non-Federal land for 
which the special-use authorization is requested.
    (b) The application shall disclose the historic access to the 
landowner's property and any rights of access which may exist over non-
federally owned land and shall provide reasons why these means of access 
do not provide adequate access to the landowners property.
    (c) The information required to apply for access across National 
Forest lands under this subpart is approved for use under subpart B of 
this part and assigned OMB control number 0596-0082.


<R05>
Sec. 251.113  Instrument of authorization.

    To grant authority to construct and/or use facilities and structures 
on National Forest System lands for access to non-Federal lands, the 
authorized officer shall issue a special-use authorization in 
conformance with the provisions of subpart B of this part or a road-use 
permit. In cases where Road Rights-of-way Construction And Use 
Agreements are in effect, the authorized officer may grant an easement 
in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 251.114  Criteria, terms and conditions.

    (a) In issuing a special-use authorization for access to non-Federal 
lands, the authorized officer shall authorize only those access 
facilities or modes of access that are needed for the reasonable use and 
enjoyment of the land and that minimize the impacts on the Federal 
resources. The authorizing officer shall determine what constitutes 
reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands based on contemporaneous uses 
made of similarly situated lands in the area and any other relevant 
criteria.
    (b) Landowners must pay an appropriate fee for the authorized use of 
National Forest System lands in accordance with Sec. 251.57 of this 
part.
    (c) A landowner may be required to provide a reciprocal grant of 
access to the United States across the landowner's property where such 
reciprocal right is deemed by the authorized officer to be necessary for 
the management of adjacent Federal land. In such case, the landowner 
shall receive the fair market value of the rights-of-way granted to the 
United States. If the value of the rights-of-way obtained by the 
Government exceeds the value of the rights-of-way granted, the 
difference in value will be paid to the landowner. If the value of the 
rights-of-way across Government land exceeds the value of the rights-of-
way across the private land, an appropriate adjustment will be made in 
the fee charged for the special-use authorization as provided in 
Sec. 251.57(b)(5) of this part.
    (d) For access across National Forest System lands that will have 
significant non-Forest user traffic, a landowner may be required to 
construct new roads or reconstruct existing roads to bring the roads to 
a safe and adequate standard. A landowner also may be required to 
provide for the operation and maintenance of the road. This may be done 
by arranging for such road to be made part of the local public road 
system, or formation of a local improvement district to assume the 
responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the road as either 
a private road or as a public road, as determined to be appropriate by 
the authorizing officer.
    (e) When access is tributary to or dependent on forest development 
roads, and traffic over these roads arising from the use of landowner's 
lands exceeds their safe capacity or will cause damage to the roadway, 
the landowner(s) may be required to obtain a road-use permit and to 
perform such reconstruction as necessary to bring the road to a safe and 
adequate standard to accommodate such traffic in addition to the 
Government's traffic. In such case, the landowner(s) also shall enter 
into a cooperative maintenance arrangement with the Forest Service to 
ensure that the landowner's commensurate maintenance responsibilities 
are met or shall make arrangements to have the jurisdiction and 
maintenance responsibility for the

[[Page 339]]

road assumed by the appropriate public road authority.
    (f) In addition to ensuring that applicable terms and conditions of 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met, the authorizing 
officer, prior to issuing any access authorization, must also ensure 
that:
    (1) The landowner has demonstrated a lack of any existing rights or 
routes of access available by deed or under State or common law;
    (2) The route is so located and constructed as to minimize adverse 
impacts on soils, fish and wildlife, scenic, cultural, threatened and 
endangered species, and other values of the Federal land;
    (3) The location and method of access is as consistent as reasonably 
possible with the management of any congressionally designated area and 
is consistent with Forest Land and Resource Management Plans or the 
plans are amended to accommodate the access grant, and;
    (4) When access routes exist across the adjacent non-Federal lands 
or the best route as determined by the authorizing officer is across 
non-Federal lands, the applicant landowner has demonstrated that all 
legal recourse to obtain reasonable access across adjacent non-Federal 
lands has been exhausted or has little chance of success.
    (g) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the 
following factors shall be considered in authorizing access to non-
federally owned lands over National Forest System lands which are 
components of the National Wilderness Preservation System:
    (1) The use of means of ingress and egress which have been or are 
being customarily used with respect to similarly situated non-Federal 
land used for similar purposes;
    (2) The combination of routes and modes of travel, including 
nonmotorized modes, which will cause the least lasting impact on the 
wilderness but, at the same time, will permit the reasonable use of the 
non-federally owned land;
    (3) The examination of a voluntary acquisition of land or interests 
in land by exchange, purchase, or donation to modify or eliminate the 
need to use wilderness areas for access purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 254.1  Scope and applicability.

    (a) These rules set forth the procedures for conducting exchanges of 
National Forest System lands. The procedures in these rules may be 
supplemented by instructions issued to Forest Service officers in 
Chapter 5400 of the Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbooks 
5409.12 and 5409.13.
    (b) These rules apply to all National Forest System exchanges of 
land or interests in land, including but not limited to minerals, water 
rights, and timber, except those exchanges made under the authority of 
Small Tracts Act of January 12, 1983 (16 U.S.C. 521c-521i) (36 CFR part 
254, subpart C), and as otherwise noted. These rules also apply to other 
methods of acquisition, where indicated.
    (c) The application of these rules to exchanges made under the 
authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 
U.S.C. 1621), or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 
U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to those provisions which do not conflict 
with the provisions of these Acts.
    (d) Unless the parties to an exchange otherwise agree, land 
exchanges for which the parties have agreed in writing to initiate prior 
to April 7, 1994, will proceed in accordance with the rules and 
regulations in effect at the time of the agreement.
    (e) Except for exchanges requiring cash equalization payments made 
available through the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 460[1]9), the boundaries of a national forest are 
automatically extended to encompass lands acquired under the Weeks Act 
of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), provided the acquired 
lands are contiguous to existing national forest boundaries and total no 
more than 3,000 acres in each exchange.
    (f) Exchanges under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, or the General 
Exchange Act of March 20, 1922, may involve land-for-timber (non-Federal 
land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber), or timber-for-land 
(the exchange of the rights to non-Federal timber for Federal land), or 
tripartite land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to 
Federal timber cut by a third party in behalf of the exchange parties).
    (g) Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands are 
authorized by a number of statutes, depending upon the status 
(conditions of ownership) of such lands and the purpose for which an 
exchange is to be made. The status of National Forest System land is 
determined by the method by which the land or interests therein became 
part of the National Forest System. Unless otherwise provided by law, 
lands acquired by the United States in exchanges assume the same status 
as the Federal lands conveyed.
    (h) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended 
(43 U.S.C. 1701), is supplemental to all applicable exchange laws, 
except the cash equalization provisions of the Sisk Act of December 4, 
1967, as amended (16 U.S.C. 484a).


<R05>
Sec. 254.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the 
meanings set forth in this section.
    Acquisition means the attainment of lands or interests in lands by 
the Secretary, acting on behalf of the United States, by exchange, 
purchase, donation, or eminent domain.
    Adjustment to relative values means compensation for exchange-
related costs, or other responsibilities or requirements assumed by one 
party, which ordinarily would be borne by the other party. These 
adjustments do not alter the agreed upon value of the lands involved in 
an exchange.
    Agreement to initiate means a written, nonbinding statement of 
present intent to initiate and pursue an exchange, which is signed by 
the parties and which may be amended by consent of the parties or 
terminated at any time upon written notice by any party.
    Appraisal or appraisal report means a written statement 
independently and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting 
forth an opinion as to the market value of the lands or interests in 
lands as of a specific date(s), supported by the presentation and 
analysis of relevant market information.
    Approximately equal value means a comparative estimate of value of 
the

[[Page 341]]

lands involved in an exchange which have readily apparent and 
substantially similar elements of value, such as location, size, use, 
physical characteristics, and other amenities.
    Arbitration is a process to resolve a disagreement among the parties 
as to appraised value, performed by an arbitrator appointed by the 
Secretary from a list recommended by the American Arbitration 
Association.
    Assembled land exchange means an exchange of Federal land for a 
package of multiple ownership parcels of non-Federal land consolidated 
for purposes of one land exchange transaction.
    Authorized officer means a Forest Service line or staff officer who 
has been delegated the authority and responsibility to make decisions 
and perform the duties described in this subpart.
    Bargaining is a process other than arbitration, by which parties 
attempt to resolve a dispute concerning the appraised value of the lands 
involved in an exchange.
    Federal lands means any lands or interests in lands, such as mineral

most probable and legal use of a property, based on market evidence, as 
of the date of valuation.
    Lands means any land and/or interests in land.
    Market value means the most probable price in cash, or terms

and the price is not affected by undue influence.
    Mineral laws means the mining and mineral leasing laws applicable to 
Federally owned lands and minerals reserved from the public domain for 
national forest purposes and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C.

<R05>
Sec. 254.3  Requirements.

    (a) Discretionary nature of exchanges. The Secretary is not required 
to exchange any Federal lands. Land exchanges are discretionary, 
voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal 
parties. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding exchange 
agreement, any party may withdraw from and terminate an exchange 
proposal at any time during the exchange process.
    (b) Determination of public interest. The authorized officer may 
complete an exchange only after a determination is made that the public 
interest will be well served.
    (1) Factors to consider. When considering the public interest, the 
authorized officer shall give full consideration to the opportunity to 
achieve better management of Federal lands and resources, to meet the 
needs of State and local residents and their economies, and to secure 
important objectives, including but not limited to: protection of fish 
and wildlife habitats, cultural resources, watersheds, and wilderness 
and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreation opportunities and public 
access; consolidation of lands and/or interests in lands, such as 
mineral and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management 
and development; consolidation of split estates; expansion of 
communities; accommodation of existing or planned land use 
authorizations (Sec. 254.4(c)(4); promotion of multiple-use values; 
implementation of applicable Forest Land and Resource Management Plans; 
and fulfillment of public needs.
    (2) Findings. To determine that an exchange well serves the public 
interest, the authorized officer must find that--
    (i) The resource values and the public objectives served by the non-
Federal lands or interests to be acquired must equal or exceed the 
resource values and the public objectives served by the Federal lands to 
be conveyed, and
    (ii) The intended use of the conveyed Federal land will not 
substantially conflict with established management objectives on 
adjacent Federal lands, including Indian Trust lands.
    (3) Documentation. The findings and the supporting rationale shall 
be documented and made part of the administrative record.
    (c) Equal value exchanges. Except as provided in Sec. 254.11 of this 
subpart, lands or interests to be exchanged must be of equal value or 
equalized in accordance with the methods set forth in Sec. 254.12 of 
this subpart. An exchange of lands or interests shall be based on market 
value as determined by the Secretary through appraisal(s), through 
bargaining based on appraisal(s), through other acceptable and commonly 
recognized methods of determining market value, or through arbitration.
    (d) Same-State exchanges. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the 
Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange must be located 
within the same State.
    (e) Congressional designations. Upon acceptance of title by the 
United States, lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior by 
exchange under the authority granted by the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976, as amended, which are within the boundaries of 
any unit of the National Forest System, the National Wild and Scenic 
Rivers System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness 
Preservation System, or any other system established by Act of Congress; 
or the boundaries of any national conservation area or national 
recreation area established by Act of Congress, immediately are reserved 
for and become a part of the unit or area in which they are located, 
without further action by the Secretary of the Interior, and, 
thereafter, shall be managed in accordance with all laws, rules, 
regulations, and land resource management plans applicable to such unit 
or area.
    (f) Land and resource management planning. The authorized officer 
shall consider only those exchange proposals that are consistent with 
land and resource management plans (36 CFR part 219). Lands acquired by 
exchange that are located within areas having an administrative 
designation established through the land management planning process 
shall automatically become part of the area within which they are 
located, without further action by the Forest Service, and shall be 
managed in accordance with the laws,

[[Page 343]]

rules, regulations, and land and resource management plan applicable to 
such area.
    (g) Environmental analysis. After an agreement to initiate an 
exchange is signed, the authorized officer shall undertake an 
environmental analysis in accordance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4371), the Council on Environmental 
Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and Forest Service 
environmental policies and procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 
1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). In making this analysis, the 
authorized officer shall consider timely written comments received in 
response to the exchange notice published pursuant to Sec. 254.8 of this 
subpart.
    (h) Reservations or restrictions in the public interest. In any 
exchange, the authorized officer shall reserve such rights or retain 
such interests as are needed to protect the public interest or shall 
otherwise restrict the use of Federal lands to be exchanged, as 
appropriate. The use or development of lands conveyed out of Federal 
ownership are subject to any restrictions imposed by the conveyance 
documents and all laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and 
local governing bodies.
    (i) Hazardous substances.
    (1) Federal lands. The authorized officer shall determine whether 
hazardous substances are known to be present on the Federal lands 
involved in the exchange and shall provide notice of known storage, 
release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal lands in the 
contract agreement and in the conveyance document, pursuant to 40 CFR 
part 373 and 42 U.S.C. 9620. For purposes of this section, the notice of 
hazardous substances on involved Federal lands in an agreement to 
initiate an exchange or an exchange agreement meets the requirements for 
notices established in 40 CFR part 373. Unless the non-Federal party is 
a potentially responsible party under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a) and participated 
as an owner, or in the operation, arrangement, generation, or 
transportation of the hazardous substances found on the Federal land, 
the conveyance document from the United States must contain a covenant 
warranting that all remedial action necessary to protect human health 
and the environment with respect to any such substances remaining on the 
property has been taken before the date of transfer and that any 
additional remedial action found necessary after the transfer shall be 
conducted by the United States, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3). The 
conveyance document must also reserve to the United States the right of 
access to the conveyed property if remedial or corrective action is 
required after the date of transfer. Where the non-Federal party is a 
potentially responsible party with respect to the property, it may be 
appropriate to enter into an agreement as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 
9607(e) whereby that party would indemnify the United States and hold 
the United States harmless against any loss or cleanup costs after 
conveyance.
    (2) Non-Federal lands. The non-Federal party shall notify the 
authorized officer of any hazardous substances known to have been 
released, stored, or disposed of on the non-Federal land, pursuant to 
Sec. 254.4 of this subpart. Notwithstanding such notice, the authorized 
officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be 
present on the non-Federal land involved in an exchange. If hazardous 
substances are known or believed to be present on the non-Federal land, 
the authorized officer shall reach an agreement with the non-Federal 
party regarding the responsibility for appropriate response action 
concerning the hazardous substances before completing the exchange. The 
terms of this agreement and any appropriate ``hold harmless agreement'' 
shall be included in an exchange agreement, pursuant to Sec. 254.14 of 
this subpart.
    (j) Legal description of properties. All lands subject to an 
exchange must be properly described on the basis of either a survey 
executed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and 
standards of the United States or, if those laws and standards cannot be 
applied, the lands shall be properly described and clearly locatable by 
other means as may be prescribed or allowed by law.
    (k) Special review. Except as provided in this paragraph, land 
acquisitions of

[[Page 344]]

$150,000 or more in value made under the authority of the Weeks Act of 
March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), must be submitted to Congress 
for oversight review, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1976, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 521b). However, minor and insignificant changes in 
land acquisition proposals need not be resubmitted for congressional 
oversight, provided the general concept of and basis for the acquisition 
remain the same.


<R05>
Sec. 254.4  Agreement to initiate an exchange.

    (a) Exchanges may be proposed by the Forest Service or by any 
person, State, or local government. Initial exchange proposals should be 
directed to the authorized officer responsible for the management of 
Federal lands proposed for exchange.
    (b) To assess the feasibility of an exchange proposal, the 
prospective parties may agree to obtain a preliminary estimate of the 
values of the lands involved in the proposal. A qualified appraiser must 
prepare the preliminary estimate.
    (c) If the authorized officer agrees to proceed with an exchange 
proposal, all prospective parties shall execute a nonbinding agreement 
to initiate an exchange. At a minimum, the agreement must include:
    (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange 
and the status of their ownership or ability to provide title to the 
land;
    (2) A description of the lands or interest in lands being considered 
for exchange;
    (3) A statement by a party, other than the United States and State 
and local governments, that such party is a citizen of the United States 
or a corporation or other legal entity subject to the laws of the United 
States or a State thereof;
    (4) A description of the appurtenant rights proposed to be exchanged 
or reserved; any authorized uses, including grants, permits, easements, 
or leases; and any known unauthorized uses, outstanding interests, 
exceptions, covenants, restrictions, title defects or encumbrances;
    (5) A time schedule for completing the proposed exchange;
    (6) An assignment of responsibility for performance of required 
functions and for costs associated with processing the exchange;
    (7) A statement specifying whether compensation for costs assumed 
will be allowed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 254.7 of this 
subpart;
    (8) Notice of any known release, storage, or disposal of hazardous 
substances on involved Federal or non-Federal lands and any commitments 
regarding responsibility for removal or other remedial actions 
concerning such substances on involved non-Federal lands (Sec. 254.3(i) 
and Sec. 254.14);
    (9) A grant of permission by each party to physically examine the 
lands offered by the other party;
    (10) The terms of any assembled land exchange arrangement, pursuant 
to Sec. 254.5 of this subpart;
    (11) A statement as to the arrangements for relocation of any 
tenants occupying non-Federal lands pursuant to Sec. 254.15 of this 
subpart;
    (12) A notice to an owner-occupant of the voluntary basis for the 
acquisition of the non-Federal lands, pursuant to Sec. 254.15 of this 
subpart; and
    (13) A statement as to the manner in which documents of conveyance 
will be exchanged, should the exchange proposal be successfully 
completed.
    (d) Unless the parties agree to some other schedule, no later than 
90 days from the date of the executed agreement to initiate an exchange, 
the parties shall arrange for appraisals which are to be completed 
within timeframes and under such terms as are negotiated. In the absence 
of current market information reliably supporting value, the parties may 
agree to use other acceptable and commonly recognized methods to 
estimate value.
    (e) An agreement to initiate may be amended by consent of the 
parties or terminated at any time upon written notice by any party.
    (f) Entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange does not 
legally bind any party to proceed with processing or to consummate a 
proposed exchange, or to reimburse or pay damages to any party to a 
proposed exchange that is not consummated or to anyone doing business 
with any such party.

[[Page 345]]

    (g) The withdrawal from an exchange proposal by an authorized 
officer at any time prior to the notice of decision, pursuant to 
Sec. 254.13 of this subpart, is not appealable under 36 CFR part 215 or 
36 CFR part 251, subpart C.

[59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1984, as amended at 64 FR 25822, May 13, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 254.5  Assembled land exchanges.

    (a) Whenever the authorized officer determines it to be practicable, 
an assembled land exchange arrangement may be used to facilitate 
exchanges and reduce costs.
    (b) The parties to an exchange may agree to such an arrangement 
where multiple ownership parcels of non-Federal lands are consolidated 
into a package for the purpose of completing one exchange transaction.
    (c) An assembled land exchange arrangement must be documented in the 
agreement to initiate an exchange, pursuant to Sec. 254.4 of this 
subpart.
    (d) Value of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an 
assembled land exchange arrangement shall be estimated pursuant to 
Sec. 254.9 of this subpart.

[59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1994; 59 FR 15501, Apr. 1, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 254.6  Segregative effect.

    (a) If a proposal is made to exchange Federal lands, the authorized 
officer may request the appropriate State Office of the Bureau of 
Management (BLM) to segregate the Federal lands by a notation on the 
public land records. Subject to valid existing rights, the Federal lands 
shall be segregated from appropriation under the public land laws and 
mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years from the date of record 
notation.
    (b) Any interests of the United States in the non-Federal lands that 
are covered by the exchange proposal may be noted and segregated from 
appropriation under the mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years 
from the date of notation.
    (c) The segregative effect terminates as follows:
    (1) Automatically, upon issuance of a patent or other document of 
conveyance to the affected lands;
    (2) On the date and time specified in an opening order, published in 
the Federal Register by the appropriate BLM State Office, if a decision 
is made not to proceed with the exchange or upon removal of any lands 
from the exchange proposal; or
    (3) Automatically, at the end of the segregation period not to 
exceed 5 years from the date of notation on the public land records, 
whichever occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 254.7  Assumption of costs.

    (a) Generally, each party to an exchange will bear their own costs 
of the exchange. However, if the authorized officer finds it is in the 
public interest as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an 
agreement to initiate an exchange may provide that:
    (1) One or more of the parties may assume, without compensation, all 
or part of the costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the 
authorized officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other 
parties; or
    (2) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
parties may agree to make adjustments to the relative values involved in 
an exchange transaction, in order to compensate parties for assuming 
costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the authorized 
officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other parties. These 
costs or services may include but are not limited to: land surveys; 
appraisals; mineral examinations; timber cruises; title searches; title 
curative actions; cultural resource surveys and mitigation; hazardous 
substance surveys and controls; removal of encumbrances; arbitration, 
including all fees; bargaining; cure of deficiencies preventing highest 
and best use of the land; conduct of public hearings; assemblage of non-
Federal parcels from multiple ownerships; and the expenses of complying 
with laws, regulations, and policies applicable to exchange 
transactions, or which are necessary to bring the Federal and non-
Federal lands involved in the exchange to their highest and best use for 
appraisal and exchange purposes.
    (b) As a condition of an agreement to initiate, the authorized 
officer may agree to assume without compensation

[[Page 346]]

costs ordinarily borne by the non-Federal party or to compensate the 
non-Federal party for assuming Federal costs only on an exceptional 
basis when it is clearly in the public interest and when the authorized 
officer determines and documents that each of the following 
circumstances exist:
    (1) The amount of such cost assumed or compensation is reasonable 
and accurately reflects the value of the cost or service provided, or 
any responsibility and requirement assumed;
    (2) The proposed exchange is a high priority of the agency;
    (3) The land exchange must be expedited to protect important Federal 
resource values, such as congressionally designated areas or endangered 
species habitat;
    (4) Cash equalization funds are available for compensation of the 
non-Federal party; and
    (5) There are no other practicable means available to the authorized 
officer for meeting Federal exchange processing costs, responsibilities, 
or requirements.
    (c) The total amount of an adjustment agreed to as compensation for 
costs pursuant to this section shall not exceed the limitations set 
forth in Sec. 254.12(b) of this subpart.

[59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1994; 59 FR 15501, Apr. 1, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 254.8  Notice of exchange proposal.

    (a) Upon entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange, the 
authorized officer shall publish a notice once a week for four 
consecutive weeks in newspapers of general circulation in the counties 
in which the Federal and non-Federal lands or interests proposed for 
exchange are located. The authorized officer shall notify authorized 
users, the jurisdictional State and local governments, and the 
congressional delegation and shall make other distribution of the notice 
as appropriate. At a minimum, the notice shall include:
    (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange;
    (2) A description of the Federal and non-Federal lands being 
considered for exchange;
    (3) A statement as to the effect of segregation from appropriation 
under the public land laws and mineral laws, if applicable;
    (4) An invitation to the public to submit in writing any comments on 
or concerns about the exchange proposal, including advising the agency 
as to any liens, encumbrances, or other claims relating to the lands 
being considered for exchange; and
    (5) The deadline by which comments must be received, and the name, 
title, and address of the official to whom comments must be sent and 
from whom additional information may be obtained.
    (b) To be assured of consideration in the environmental analysis of 
the proposed exchange, all comments must be made in writing to the 
authorized officer and postmarked or delivered within 45 days after the 
initial date of publication.
    (c) The authorized officer is not required to republish legal 
descriptions of any lands that may be excluded from the final exchange 
transaction, provided such lands were identified in the notice of 
exchange proposal. In addition, minor corrections of land descriptions 
and other insignificant changes do not require republication.


<R05>
Sec. 254.9  Appraisals.

    The Federal and non-Federal parties to an exchange shall comply with 
the appraisal standards as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, and, to the extent appropriate, with the Uniform Appraisal 
Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions: Interagency Land Acquisition 
Conference 1992 (Washington, DC, 1992), ISBN 0-16-038050-2 when 
appraising the values of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in 
an exchange.
    (a) Appraiser qualifications.
    (1) A qualified appraiser(s) shall provide to the authorized officer 
appraisals estimating the market value of Federal and non-Federal 
properties involved in an exchange. A qualified appraiser may be an 
employee or a contractor to the Federal or non-Federal exchange parties. 
At a minimum, a qualified appraiser shall be an individual agreeable to 
all parties and approved by the authorized officer, who is competent, 
reputable, impartial, and

[[Page 347]]

has training and experience in appraising property similar to the 
property involved in the appraisal assignment.
    (2) Qualified appraisers shall possess qualifications consistent 
with State regulatory requirements that meet the intent of Title XI, 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 
(FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 3331). In the event a State or Territory does not 
have approved policies, practices, and procedures regulating the 
activities of appraisers, the Forest Service may establish appraiser 
qualification standards commensurate with those generally adopted by 
other States or Territories meeting the requirements of FIRREA.
    (b) Market value.
    (1) In estimating market value, the appraiser shall:
    (i) Determine the highest and best use of the property to be 
appraised;
    (ii) Estimate the value of the lands and interests as if in private 
ownership and available for sale in the open market;
    (iii) Include historic, wildlife, recreation, wilderness, scenic, 
cultural, or other resource values or amenities as reflected in prices 
paid for similar properties in the competitive market;
    (iv) Consider the contributory value of any interest in land such as 
water rights, minerals, or timber, to the extent they are consistent 
with the highest and best use of the property; and
    (v) If stipulated in the agreement to initiate in accordance with 
Sec. 254.4 of this subpart, estimate separately the value of each 
property optioned or acquired from multiple ownerships by the non-
Federal party for purposes of exchange, pursuant to Sec. 254.5 of this 
subpart. In this case, the appraiser also must estimate the value of the 
Federal and non-Federal properties in a similar manner.
    (2) In estimating market value, the appraiser may not independently 
add the separate values of the fractional interests to be conveyed, 
unless market evidence indicates the following:
    (i) The various interests contribute their full value (pro rata) to 
the value of the whole; and
    (ii) The valuation is compatible with the highest and best use of 
the property.
    (3) In the absence of current market information reliably supporting 
value, the authorized officer may use other acceptable and commonly 
recognized methods to determine market value.
    (c) Appraisal report standards. Appraisals prepared for exchange 
purposes must contain the following minimum information:
    (1) A summary of facts and conclusions;
    (2) The purpose and/or the function of the appraisal, a definition 
of the estate being appraised, and a statement of the assumptions and 
limiting conditions affecting the appraisal assignment, if any;
    (3) An explanation of the extent of the appraiser's research and 
actions taken to collect and confirm information relied upon in 
estimating value;
    (4) An adequate description of the physical characteristics of the 
land being appraised; a statement of all encumbrances; title 
information; location, zoning, and present use; an analysis of highest 
and best use; and at least a 5-year sales history of the property;
    (5) A disclosure of any condition that is observed during the 
inspection of the property or becomes known to the appraiser through the 
normal research which would lead the appraiser to believe that hazardous 
substances may be present on the property being appraised;
    (6) A comparative market analysis and, if more than one method of 
valuation is used, an analysis and reconciliation of the methods used to 
support the appraiser's estimate of value;
    (7) A description of comparable sales, including a description of 
all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to 
the transaction, source and method of financing, effect of any favorable 
financing on sale price, and verification by a party involved in the 
transaction;
    (8) An estimate of market value;
    (9) The effective date of valuation, date of appraisal, signature, 
and certification of the appraiser;
    (10) A certification by the appraiser to the following:
    (i) The appraiser has personally contacted the property owner or 
designated representative and offered the

[[Page 348]]

owner an opportunity to be present during inspection of the property;
    (ii) The appraiser has personally examined the subject property and 
all comparable sale properties relied upon in the report;
    (iii) The appraiser has no present or prospective interest in the 
appraised property; and
    (iv) The appraiser has not received compensation that was contingent 
on the analysis, opinions, or conclusions contained in the appraisal 
report; and
    (11) Copies of relevant written reports, studies, or summary 
conclusions prepared by others in association with the appraisal 
assignment which were relied upon by the appraiser to estimate value, 
which may include, but is not limited to, current title reports, mineral 
reports, or timber cruises prepared by qualified specialists.
    (d) Appraisal review.
    (1) Appraisal reports shall be reviewed by a qualified review 
appraiser meeting the qualifications set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Statements of value prepared by agency appraisers are not 
subject to this review.
    (2) The review appraiser shall determine whether the appraisal 
report:
    (i) Is complete, logical, consistent, and supported by market 
analysis;
    (ii) Complies with the standards prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section; and
    (iii) Reasonably estimates the probable market value of the lands 
appraised.
    (3) The review appraiser shall prepare a written review report, 
containing at a minimum:
    (i) A description of the review process used;
    (ii) An explanation of the adequacy, relevance, and reasonableness 
of the data and methods used by the appraiser to estimate value;
    (iii) The review appraiser's conclusions regarding the appraiser's 
estimate of market value; and
    (iv) A certification by the review appraiser to the following:
    (A) The review appraiser has no present or prospective interest in 
the property which is the subject of the review report; and
    (B) The review appraiser has not received compensation that was 
contingent upon approval of the appraisal report.


<R05>
Sec. 254.10  Bargaining; arbitration.

    (a) Unless the parties to an exchange agree in writing to suspend or 
modify the deadlines contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of 
this section, the parties shall adhere to the following:
    (1)(i) Within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) 
for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an 
exchange may agree on the appraised values or may initiate a process of 
bargaining or some other process to determine values. Bargaining or any 
other process must be based on an objective analysis of the valuation in 
the appraisal report(s) and is a means of reconciling differences in 
such report(s). Bargaining or another process to determine values may 
involve one or more of the following actions:
    (A) Submission of the disputed appraisal(s) to another qualified 
appraiser for review:
    (B) Request for additional appraisals;
    (C) Involvement of an impartial third party to facilitate resolution 
of the value disputes, or
    (D) Use of some other acceptable and commonly recognized practice 
for resolving value disputes.
    (ii) Any agreement based upon bargaining must be in writing and made 
part of the administrative record of the exchange. Such agreement must 
contain a reference to all relevant appraisal information and state how 
the parties reconciled or compromised appraisal information to arrive at 
an agreement based on market value.
    (2) If within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) 
for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an 
exchange cannot agree on values but wish to continue with the land 
exchange, the appraisal(s), at the initiative of either party, must be 
submitted to arbitration, unless, in lieu of arbitration, the parties 
have employed a process of bargaining or some other process to determine 
values. If arbitration occurs, it must be conducted in accordance with 
the real estate valuation arbitration rules of the American Arbitration 
Association. The Secretary or an official

[[Page 349]]

to whom such authority has been delegated shall appoint an arbitrator 
from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association.
    (3) Within 30 days after completion of arbitration, the parties 
involved in the exchange must determine whether to proceed with the 
exchange, modify the exchange to reflect the findings of the arbitration 
or any other factors, or withdraw from the exchange. A decision to 
withdraw from the exchange may be made upon written notice by either 
party at this time or at any other time prior to entering into a binding 
exchange agreement.
    (4) If the parties agree to proceed with an exchange after 
arbitration, the values established by arbitration are binding upon all 
parties for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of the 
arbitration decision.
    (b) Arbitration is limited to the disputed valuation of the lands 
involved in a proposed exchange and an arbitrator's award decision is 
limited to the value estimate(s) of the contested appraisal(s). An 
arbitrator may not include in an award decision recommendations 
regarding the terms of a proposed exchange, nor may an arbitrator's 
award decision infringe upon the authority of the Secretary to make all 
decisions regarding management of Federal lands and to make public 
interest determinations.

the proposed exchange will be expedited;
    (2) The value of the lands to be conveyed out of Federal ownership 
is not more than $150,000 as based upon a statement of value prepared by 
a qualified appraiser and accepted by an authorized officer;

Sec. 254.12  Value equalization; cash equalization waiver.

    (a) To equalize the agreed upon values of the Federal and non-
Federal lands involved in an exchange, either with or without 
adjustments of relative values as compensation for various costs, the 
parties to an exchange may agree to:
    (1) Modify the exchange proposal by adding or excluding lands; and/
or
    (2) Use cash equalization, after making all reasonable efforts to 
equalize values by adding or deleting lands.
    (b) The combined amount of any cash equalization payment and/or the 
amount of adjustments agreed to as compensation for costs under 
Sec. 254.7 of this subpart may not exceed 25 percent of the value of the 
Federal lands to be conveyed.
    (c) The Secretary of Agriculture may not waive cash equalization 
payment due the United States, but the parties may agree to waive cash 
equalization payment due the non-Federal party. The amount to be waived 
may not exceed 3 percent of the value of the lands being exchanged out 
of Federal ownership or $15,000, whichever is less.
    (d) A cash equalization payment may be waived only after the 
authorized officer certifies, in writing, that the waiver will expedite 
the exchange and that the public interest will be best served by the 
waiver.

the congressional delegation, and individuals who requested notification 
or filed written objections, and others as appropriate.
    (b) For a period of 45 days after the date of publication of a 
notice of the availability of a decision to approve or disapprove an 
exchange proposal, the decision shall be subject to appeal as provided 
under 36 CFR part 215 or, for eligible parties, under 36 CFR part 251, 
subpart C.

    (a) The parties to a proposed exchange may enter into an exchange 
agreement subsequent to a decision by the authorized officer to approve 
the exchange, pursuant to Sec. 254.13 of this subpart. Such an agreement 
is required if hazardous substances are present on the non-Federal

    (7) The agreement is not terminated by mutual consent or upon such 
terms as may be provided in the agreement.
    (c) In the event of a failure to perform or to comply with the terms 
of an exchange agreement, the noncomplying party is liable for all costs 
borne by the other party as a result of the proposed exchange, 
including, but not limited to, land surveys, appraisals, mineral 
examinations, timber cruises, title searches, title curative actions, 
cultural resource surveys and mitigation, hazardous substance surveys 
and controls, removal of encumbrances, arbitration, curing deficiencies 
preventing highest and best use of the land, and any other expenses 
incurred in processing the proposed land exchange.

Sec. 254.15  Title standards.

    (a) Title evidence.
    (1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General 
Counsel, evidence of title for the non-Federal lands being conveyed to 
the United

[[Page 351]]

States must be in recordable form and in conformance with the Department 
of Justice regulations and ``Standards for the Preparation of Title 
Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States'' in effect at the 
time of conveyance.
    (2) The United States is not required to furnish title evidence for 
the Federal lands being exchanged.
    (b) Conveyance documents.
    (1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General 
Counsel, all conveyances to the United States must be prepared, 
executed, and acknowledged in accordance with the Department of Justice 
regulations and ``Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in 
Land Acquisitions by the United States'' in effect at the time of 
conveyance.
    (2) Conveyances of lands from the United States are made by patent, 
quitclaim deed, or deed and without express or implied warranties, 
except as to hazardous substances pursuant to Sec. 254.3 of this 
subpart.
    (c) Title encumbrances.
    (1) Non-Federal lands.
    (i) Title to the non-Federal lands must be acceptable to the United 
States. For example, encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, 
mortgages, and other objections or title defects shall be eliminated, 
released, or waived in accordance with requirements of the preliminary 
title opinion of the USDA Office of the General Counsel or the 
Department of Justice, as appropriate.
    (ii) The United States shall not accept lands in which there are 
reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and 
management of the land by the United States or would otherwise be 
inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which, 
the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal 
landowner are subject to the appropriate rules and regulations of the 
Secretary, except upon special finding by the Chief, Forest Service in 
the case of States, agencies, or political subdivisions thereof (36 CFR 
part 251, subpart A).
    (iii) Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party which is 
not a part of the exchange proposal, should be removed by the non-
Federal party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless 
the authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange 
previously agree upon a specified period to remove the personal 
property. If the personal property is not removed prior to acceptance of 
title or within the otherwise prescribed time, it shall be deemed 
abandoned and shall become vested in the United States.
    (iv) The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements 
for the relocation of any tenants. Qualified tenants occupying non-
Federal lands affected by a land exchange may be entitled to relocation 
benefits under 49 CFR 24.2. Unless otherwise provided by law or 
regulation (49 CFR 24.101(a)(1)), relocation benefits are not applicable 
to owner-occupants involved in exchanges with the United States provided 
the owner-occupants are notified in writing that the non-Federal lands 
are being acquired by the United States on a voluntary basis.
    (2) Federal lands. If Federal lands proposed for exchange are 
occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third 
party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such 
authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach 
agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under 
the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease. The non-Federal 
exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to 
issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by 
the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the 
authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the 
authorized use or shall determine whether the public interest will be 
best served by terminating such use pursuant to 36 CFR 251.60.


<R05>
Sec. 254.16  Case closing.

    (a) Title transfers. Unless otherwise agreed, and notwithstanding 
the decision in United States v. Schurz, 102 U.S. 378 (1880), or any 
other law or ruling to the contrary, title to both the non-Federal and 
Federal lands pass simultaneously and are deemed accepted by the United 
States and the non-Federal

[[Page 352]]

landowner, respectively, when the documents of conveyance are recorded 
in the county clerk's or other local recorder's office. Before 
recordation, all instructions, requirements, and conditions set forth by 
the United States and the non-Federal landowner must be met. The minimum 
requirements and conditions necessary for recordation include the 
following, as appropriate:
    (1) The determination by the authorized officer that the United 
States will receive possession, acceptable to it, of such lands;
    (2) The issuance of title evidence as of the date of recordation 
which conforms to the instructions and requirements of the USDA Office 
of the General Counsel's preliminary title opinion; and
    (3) Continuation searches disclosing no matters of record that would 
require any change in the aforementioned title evidence as issued.
    (b) Automatic segregation of lands. Subject to valid existing 
rights, non-Federal lands acquired through exchange by the United States 
automatically are segregated from appropriation under the public land 
laws and mineral laws until midnight of the 90th day after acceptance of 
title by the United States, and the public land records must be noted 
accordingly. Thereafter, the lands will be open automatically to 
operation of the public land laws and mineral laws, except to the extent 
otherwise provided by law, unless action is taken pursuant to 43 CFR 
part 2300 to initiate a withdrawal within the 90-day period.

<R05>
Sec. 254.30  Purpose.

    These regulations set forth procedures by which the Secretary of 
Agriculture may resolve land disputes and management problems pursuant 
to Pub. L. 97-465, commonly called the Small Tracts Act, by conveying, 
through sale, exchange, or interchange, three categories of tracts of 
land: Parcels encroached on, road rights-of-way, and mineral survey 
fractions. Implementation of these regulations does not constitute 
authorization of nor consent to adverse possession against lands 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 254.31  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this subpart,
    An applicant is a person who occupies or has improvements on 
National Forest System land under claim of title or color of title, or 
who owns land abutting or underlying a road right-of-way, or who owns 
land interspersed with or adjacent to mineral survey fractions.
    Approximately equal value is a comparative estimate of value of 
lands involved in an interchange where elements of value, such as 
physical characteristics and other amenities, are readily apparent and 
substantially similar.
    Claim of title is a claim of land as a person's own, based on any 
reasonable evidence which establishes the person's actual use of the 
land as though the person had full title thereto from the time the 
person obtained ownership of abutting land.
    Color of title arises from an instrument purporting to convey title 
to a tract of land.
    Encroachments are improvements occupied or used on National Forest 
System land under claim of title or color of title.
    Exchange is a discretionary, voluntary transaction involving mutual 
transfers of land or interests in land between the Secretary of 
Agriculture acting by and through the Forest Service and a nonfederal 
entity.
    Good faith is honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of 
circumstances which ought to put a prudent person upon inquiry.
    Improvements mean an addition to property costing labor or capital 
which affects its value. The term generally includes fixtures, 
structures and attendant facilities, or buildings.
    Interchange is a land transfer in which the Secretary and another 
person exchange lands or interests in lands of approximately equal value 
without a formal appraisal.
    Mineral survey fractions are small parcels of National Forest System 
lands interspersed with or adjacent to lands transferred out of Federal 
ownership under the mining laws.
    Person includes any nonfederal entity such as a State or any 
political subdivision as well as any individual or business entity.
    Secretary refers to the Secretary of the United States Department of 
Agriculture.


<R05>
Sec. 254.32  Encroachments.

    (a) Conveyances under this subpart are limited to tracts of 10 acres 
or less to resolve encroachments by persons:
    (1) To whom no advance notice was given that the improvements 
encroached or would encroach, and
    (2) Who in good faith relied on an erroneous survey, title search, 
or other land description which did not reveal such encroachment.
    (b) Forest Service officials shall consider the following factors 
when determining whether to convey lands upon which encroachments exist:
    (1) The location of the property boundaries based on historical 
location and continued acceptance and maintenance,
    (2) Factual evidence of claim of title or color of title,
    (3) Notice given to persons encroaching on National Forest System 
lands,
    (4) Degree of development in the encroached upon area, and

[[Page 355]]

    (5) Creation of an uneconomic remnant.


<R05>
Sec. 254.33  Road rights-of-way.

    (a) Reserved or acquired road right-of-way parcels subject to 
conveyance under this subpart are limited to those which are 
substantially surrounded by lands not owned by the United States.
    (b) Forest Service officials shall consider public road system 
right-of-way needs based on National Forest transportation planning and 
State and local law before making any conveyance of rights-of-way.
    (c) Reimbursement will be required for the value of any improvements 
made by the United States or other highway authorities, unless waived by 
the Chief of the Forest Service.


<R05>
Sec. 254.34  Mineral survey fractions.

    (a) Mineral survey fractions subject to conveyance under this 
subpart are limited to those tracts which:
    (1) Cannot be efficiently administered because of size, shape, or 
location;
    (2) Are occupied or could be occupied or used by adjoining owners; 
and
    (3) When sold separately or aggregated in one transaction, do not 
exceed 40 acres.
    (b) Forest Service officials shall consider the following criteria 
in determining whether to convey mineral survey fractions under this 
subpart:
    (1) The mineral survey fractions are interspersed among and are more 
or less an integral part of private land holdings;
    (2) The feasibility and cost of surveying the parcels in order to 
manage them effectively;
    (3) The size, shape, and location of the parcels as they affect 
management, utility, access, occupancy or use of the parcels or the 
lands with which they are interspersed.


<R05>
Sec. 254.35  Limitations.

    (a) Lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the 
National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, and 
National Monuments are excluded from any conveyance under these 
provisions.
    (b) Lands within National Recreation Areas may not be conveyed by 
sale under this subpart.
    (c) The value of Federal lands conveyed in any transaction, pursuant 
to this subpart, shall not exceed $150,000.
    (d) Compensation for lands conveyed shall be of at least equal 
value, or in the case of interchange, of approximately equal value, and 
may be in the form of land, interest in land (including minerals), or 
cash, or any combination thereof.
    (e) The sale, exchange, or interchange of lands or interest in lands 
under these rules are discretionary and shall be made only if found to 
be in the public interest.
    (f) The abutting landowner(s) shall have the first right of 
acquisition.
    (g) The area of land conveyed shall be limited to the minimum 
necessary to resolve encroachment or land management problems.

livestock, or if the name of the owner is unknown, such livestock may be 
impounded any time 15 days after the date a notice of intent to impound 
livestock is first published in a local newspaper and posted at the

Sec.
290.1  Purpose and scope.
290.2  Definitions.
290.3  Nomination, evaluation, and designation of significant caves.
290.4  Confidentiality of cave location information.
290.5  Collection of information.

    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 4301-4309; 102 Stat. 4546.

    Source: 59 FR 31152, June 17, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 290.1  Purpose and scope.

    The rules of this part implement the requirements of the Federal 
Cave Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 4301-4309), hereafter referred 
to as the ``Act''. The rules apply to cave management on National Forest 
System lands. These rules, in conjunction with rules in part 261 of this 
chapter, provide the basis for identifying and managing significant 
caves on National Forest System lands in accordance with the Act. 
National Forest System lands will be managed in a manner which, to the 
extent practical, protects and maintains significant cave resources in 
accordance with the policies outlined in the Forest Service Directive 
System and the management direction contained in the individual forest 
plans.


<R05>
Sec. 290.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the terms listed in this section have 
the following meaning:
    Authorized officer means the Forest Service employee delegated the 
authority to perform the duties described in this part.
    Cave means any naturally occurring void, cavity, recess, or system 
of interconnected passages beneath the surface of the earth or within a 
cliff or ledge and which is large enough to permit a person to enter, 
whether the entrance is excavated or naturally formed. Such term shall 
include any natural pit, sinkhole, or other opening which is an 
extension of a cave entrance or which is an integral part of the cave.
    Cave resources mean any materials or substances occurring in caves 
including, but not limited to, biotic, cultural, mineralogic, 
paleontologic, geologic, and hydrologic resources.
    National Forest System lands means all national forest lands 
reserved or withdrawn from the public domain, acquired through purchase, 
exchange, or donation, national grasslands and land utilization 
projects, and other lands, waters, or interests administered by the 
Forest Service.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Agriculture.
    Significant cave means a cave located on National Forest System 
lands that has been determined to meet the criteria in Sec. 290.3 (c) or 
(d) and has been designated in accordance with Sec. 290.3(e).


<R05>
Sec. 290.3  Nomination, evaluation, and designation of significant caves.

    (a) Nominations for initial and subsequent listings. The authorized 
officer will give governmental agencies and the public, including those 
who utilize caves for scientific, educational, or recreational purposes, 
the opportunity to nominate caves. The authorized officer shall give 
public notice, including a notice published in the Federal Register, 
calling for nominations for the initial listing and setting forth the 
procedures for preparing and submitting the nominations. Nominations for 
subsequent listings will be accepted from governmental agencies and the 
public by the Forest Supervisor where the cave is located as new cave 
discoveries are made. Caves nominated but not approved for designation 
may be renominated as additional documentation or new information 
becomes available.
    (b) Evaluation for initial and subsequent listings. The evaluation 
of the nominations for significant caves will be carried out in 
consultation with individuals and organizations interested in the 
management and use of caves and cave resources, within the limits 
imposed by the confidentiality provisions of Sec. 290.4. Nominations 
shall be evaluated using the criteria in Sec. 290.3 (c) and (d).
    (c) Criteria for significant caves. A significant cave on National 
Forest System lands shall possess one or more of the following features, 
characteristics, or values.

[[Page 378]]

    (1) Biota. The cave provides seasonal or yearlong habitat for 
organisms or animals, or contains species or subspecies of flora or 
fauna native to caves, or are sensitive to disturbance, or are found on 
State or Federal sensitive, threatened, or endangered species lists.
    (2) Cultural. The cave contains historic properties or archeological 
resources (as defined in Parts 800.2 and 296.3 of this chapter 
respectively, or in 16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.), or other features included 
in or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places 
because of their research importance for history or prehistory, 
historical associations, or other historical or traditional 
significance.
    (3) Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic. The cave possesses one or 
more of the following features:
    (i) Geologic or mineralogic features that are fragile, represent 
formation processes that are of scientific interest, or that are 
otherwise useful for study.
    (ii) Deposits of sediments or features useful for evaluating past 
events.
    (iii) Paleontologic resources with potential to contribute useful 
educational or scientific information.
    (4) Hydrologic. The cave is a part of a hydrologic system or 
contains water which is important to humans, biota, or development of 
cave resources.
    (5) Recreational. The cave provides or could provide recreational 
opportunities or scenic values.
    (6) Educational or scientific. The cave offers opportunities for 
educational or scientific use; or, the cave is virtually in a pristine 
state, lacking evidence of contemporary human disturbance or impact; or, 
the length, volume, total depth, pit depth, height, or similar 
measurements are notable.
    (d) Specially designated areas. All caves located within special 
management areas, such as Special Geologic Areas, Research Natural 
Areas, or National Monuments, that are designated wholly or in part due 
to the cave resources found therein are determined to be significant.
    (e) Designation and documentation. If the authorized officer 
determines that a cave nominated and evaluated under paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c) 
of this section, the authorized officer shall designate the cave as 
significant. The authorized officer will notify the nominating party of 
the results of the evaluation and designation. Each forest will retain 
appropriate documentation for all significant caves located within its 
administrative boundaries. At a minimum, this documentation shall 
include a statement of finding signed and dated by the authorized 
officer and the information used to make the determination. This 
documentation will be retained as a permanent record in accordance with 
the confidentiality provision in Sec. 290.4.
    (f) Undiscovered passages. If a cave is determined to be 
significant, its entire extent on federal land, including passages not 
mapped or discovered at the time of the determination, is deemed 
significant. This includes caves that extend from lands managed by any 
other Federal agency into National Forest System lands, as well as caves 
initially believed to be separate for which interconnecting passages are 
discovered after significance is determined.
    (g) Decision final. The decision to designate or not designate a 
cave as significant is made at the sole discretion of the authorized 
officer based upon the criteria in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section and is not subject to further administrative review of appeal 
under Parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 290.4  Confidentiality of cave location information.

    (a) Information disclosure. No Forest Service employee shall 
disclose any information that could be used to determine the location of 
a significant cave or a cave nominated for designation, unless the 
authorized officer determines that disclosure will further the purposes 
of the Act and will not create a substantial risk of harm, theft, or 
destruction to cave resources.
    (b) Requesting confidential information. Notwithstanding paragraph 
(a) of this section, the authorized officer may make confidential cave 
information available to Federal or State governmental agencies, bona 
fide educational or research institutes, or individuals or

[[Page 379]]

organizations assisting the land management agencies with cave 
management activities. To request confidential cave information, such 
entities shall make a written request to the authorized officer which 
includes the following:
    (1) Name, address, and telephone number of the individual 
responsible for the security of the information received;
    (2) A legal description of the area for which the information is 
sought;
    (3) A statement of the purpose for which the information is sought; 
and,
    (4) Written assurances that the requesting party will maintain the 
confidentiality of the information and protect the cave and its 
resources.
    (c) Decision final. The decision to permit or deny access to 
confidential cave information is made at the sole discretion of the 
authorized officer and is not subject to further administrative review 
or appeal under 5 U.S.C. 552 or parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 290.5  Collection of information.

    The collection of information contained in this rule represents new 
information requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320, Controlling 
Paperwork Burdens on the Public. In accordance with those rules and the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 as amended (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest 
Service has received approval by the Office of Management and Budget to 
collect cave nomination information under clearance number 0596-0123 and 
confidential information under 0596-0122. The information provided for 
the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be 
listed as ``significant'' and the information in the requests to obtain 
confidential cave information will be used to decide whether to grant 
access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is 
voluntary. No action may be taken against a person for refusing to 
supply the information requested. Response to the information 
requirements for obtaining confidential cave information is required to 
obtain a benefit in accordance with section 5 of the Federal Cave 
Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4304).

<R05>
Sec. 292.11  Introduction.

    (a) Administration of the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units will 
be coordinated with the other purposes of

[[Page 381]]

the Central Valley Project of the Bureau of Reclamation and of the 
recreation area as a whole so as to provide for: (1) Public outdoor 
recreation benefits; (2) conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, 
and other values contributing to public enjoyment; and (3) the 
management, utilization, and disposal of renewable natural resources 
which in the judgment of the Secretary of Agriculture will promote or is 
compatible with, and does not significantly impair, public recreation 
and conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, or other values 
contributing to public enjoyment.
    (b) The Secretary may not acquire without consent of the owner any 
privately owned ``improved property'' or interests therein within the 
boundaries of these units, so long as the appropriate local zoning 
agency shall have in force and applicable to such property a duly 
adopted, valid, zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary. This 
suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire ``improved property'' 
without the owner's consent would automatically cease: (1) If the 
property is made the subject of a variance or exception to any 
applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable 
standards contained in Secs. 292.11 to 292.13; or (2) if such property 
is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable zoning 
ordinance approved by the Secretary.
    (c) Improved property as used in Secs. 292.11 to 292.13, means any 
building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which 
was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than three 
acres of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of 
buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such 
``improved property'' any shore or waters, together with so much of the 
land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public 
access thereto.
    (d) Sections 292.11 to 292.13 specify the standards with which local 
zoning ordinances for the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units must 
conform if the ``improved property'' or unimproved property proposed for 
development as authorized by the Act within the boundaries of the units 
is to be exempt from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of 
Secs. 292.11 to 292.13 are to:
    (1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other than those 
which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the purposes of the 
act establishing the national recreation area; (2) promote the 
protection and development of properties in keeping with the purposes of 
that Act by means of use, acreage, setback, density, height or other 
requirements; and (3) provide that the Secretary receive notice of any 
variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of the 
zoning ordinance approved by him.
    (e) Following promulgation of Secs. 292.11 to 292.13 of final form, 
the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any 
amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which 
conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in effect at the 
time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment.
    (f) Any owner of unimproved property who proposes to develop his 
property for service to the public may submit to the Secretary a 
development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which 
the property is to be developed and the use to which it is proposed to 
be put. If the Secretary determines that the development and the use of 
the property conforms to approved zoning ordinances, and serves the 
purposes of the National Recreation Area and that the property is not 
needed for easements and rights-of-way for access, utilities, or 
facilities, or for administration sites, campgrounds, or other areas 
needed for use by the United States for visitors, he may in his 
discretion issue to such owner a certification that so long as the 
property is developed, maintained, and used in conformity with approved 
zoning ordinances the Secretary's authority to acquire the property 
without the owner's consent is suspended.


<R05>
Sec. 292.12  General provisions; procedures.

    (a) Approval of zoning ordinance and development plans. (1) All 
validly adopted zoning ordinances and amendments thereto pertaining to 
the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be

[[Page 382]]

submitted by the county of origin to the Secretary for written approval 
relative to their conformance with the applicable standards of 
Secs. 292.11 to 292.13. Within 60 days following submission, the county 
will be notified of the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the 
zoning ordinances or amendments thereto. If more than 60 days are 
required, the county will be notified of the expected delay and of the 
additional time deemed necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's 
approval shall remain effective so long as the zoning ordinances or 
amendments thereto remain in effect as approved.
    (2) Development plans pertaining to unimproved property within the 
Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the owner to 
the Secretary for determination as to whether they conform with approved 
zoning ordinances and whether the planned use and development would 
serve the Act. Within 30 days following submission of such plans the 
Secretary will approve or disapprove the plans or, if more than 30 days 
are required, will notify the applicant of the expected delay and of the 
additional time deemed necessary.
    (b) Amendment of ordinances. Amendments of approved ordinances may 
be furnished in advance of their adoption to the Secretary for written 
decision as to their conformance with applicable standards of 
Secs. 292.11 to 292.13.
    (c) Variances or exceptions to application of ordinances. (1) The 
Secretary shall be given written notice of any variance granted under, 
or any exception made to, the application of a zoning ordinance or 
amendment thereto approved by him.
    (2) The County, or private owners of improved property, may submit 
to the Secretary proposed variances or exceptions to the application of 
an approved zoning ordinance or amendment thereto for written advice as 
to whether the intended use will make the property subject to 
acquisition without the owner's consent. Within 30 days following his 
receipt of such a request, the Secretary will advise the interested 
party or parties as to his determination. If more than 30 days are 
required by the Secretary for such determination, he shall so notify the 
interested party or parties stating the additional time required and the 
reasons therefore.
    (d) Certification of property. Where improvements and land use of 
improved property conform with approved ordinances, or with approved 
variances from such ordinances, certification that the Secretary's 
authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is 
suspended may be obtained by any party in interest upon request to the 
Secretary. Where the development and use of unimproved property for 
service to the public is approved by the Secretary, certification that 
the authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is 
suspended may be issued to the owner.
    (e) Effect of noncompliance. Suspension of the Secretary's authority 
to acquire any improved property without the owner's consent will 
automatically cease if: (1) Such property is made the subject of 
variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not 
conform to the applicable standard in the Secretary's regulation, (2) 
such property is put to a use which does not conform to any applicable 
zoning ordinance, or, as to property approved by the Secretary for 
development, a use which does not conform to the approved development 
plan or (3) the local zoning agency does not have in force a duly 
adopted, valid zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary in 
accordance with the standards of Secs. 292.11 to 292.13.
    (f) Nonconforming commercial or industrial uses. Any existing 
commercial or industrial uses not in conformance with approved zoning 
ordinances shall be discontinued within 10 years from the date such 
ordinances are approved: Provided, however, That with the approval of 
the Secretary such 10-year period may be extended by the county for a 
prescribed period sufficient to allow the owner reasonable additional 
time to amortize investments made in the property before November 8, 
1965.


<R05>
Sec. 292.13  Standards.

    (a) The standards set forth in Secs. 292.11-292.13 shall apply to 
the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units, which are defined by the 
boundary descriptions in the notice of the Secretary of Agriculture of 
July 12, 1966 (31 FR 9469),

[[Page 383]]

and to a strip of land outside the National Recreation Area on either 
side of Federal Aid Secondary Highway Numbered 1089, as more fully 
described in 2(a) of the act establishing the recreation area (79 Stat. 
1296).
    (b) New industrial or commercial uses. New industrial or commercial 
uses will be prohibited in any location except under the following 
conditions:
    (1) The industrial use is such that its operation, physical 
structures, or waste byproducts would not have significant adverse 
impacts on surrounding or nearby outdoor recreation, scenic and esthetic 
values. Industrial uses having an adverse impact include, but are not 
limited to, cement production, gravel extraction operations involving 
more than one-fourth acre of surface, smelters, sand, gravel and 
aggregate processing plants, fabricating plants, pulpmills, and 
commercial livestock feeder yards.
    (2)(i) The commercial use is for purposes of providing food, 
lodging, automotive or marine maintenance facilities and services to 
accommodate recreationists and the intended land occupancy and physical 
structures are such that they can be harmonized with adjacent land 
development and surrounding appearances in accordance with approved 
plans and schedules.
    (ii) This standard provides for privately owned and operated 
businesses whose purposes and physical structures are in keeping with 
objectives for use and maintenance of the area's outdoor recreation 
resources. It precludes establishment of drive-in theaters, zoos, and 
similar nonconforming types of commercial entertainment.
    (c) Protection of roadsides. Provisions to protect natural scenic 
qualities and maintain screening along public travel routes will 
include:
    (1) Prohibition of new structural improvements or visible utility 
lines within a strip of land extending back not less than 150 feet from 
both sides of the centerline of any public road or roadway except roads 
within subdivisions or commercial areas. In addition to buildings, this 
prohibition pertains to above-ground power and telephone lines, borrow 
pits, gravel, or earth extraction areas, and quarries.
    (2) Retention of trees and shrubs in the above-prescribed roadside 
strips to the full extent that is compatible with needs for public 
safety and road maintenance. Wholesale clearing by chemical or other 
means for fire control and other purposes will not be practiced under 
this standard.
    (d) Protection of shorelines. Provisions to protect scenic qualities 
and reduce potentials for pollution of public reservoirs will include: 
Prohibition of structures within 300 feet horizontal distance from 
highwater lines of reservoirs other than structures the purpose of which 
is to service and accommodate boating or to facilitate picnicking and 
swimming: Provided, That exceptions to this standard may be made upon 
showing satisfactory to the Secretary that proposed structures will not 
conflict with scenic and antipollution considerations.
    (e) Property development. Location and development of structures 
will conform with the following minimum standards:
    (1) Commercial development. (i) Stores, restaurants, garages, 
service stations, and comparable business enterprises will be situated 
in centers zoned for this purpose unless they are operated as part of a 
resort or hotel. Commercial centers will be of sufficient size that 
expansion of facilities or service areas is not dependent upon use of 
public land.
    (ii) Sites outside designated commercial centers will be used for 
resort development contingent upon case by case concurrence of the 
responsible county officials and the Secretary that such use is, in all 
aspects, compatible with the purposes for establishing the recreation 
area.

<R05>
Sec. 292.15  General provisions--procedures.

    (a) Classification of private property. For the purpose of 
establishing specific standards applicable to the several parcels of 
private land within the boundaries, such properties are classified and 
assigned to land use categories as shown on the Land Use Category Map, 
dated December 15, 1973, as amended July 16, 1976, on file and available 
for public inspection in the office of the Area Ranger, Sawtooth 
National Recreation Area, Ketchum, Idaho. The classification of private 
properties is based on evaluation of scenic, natural, historic, 
pastoral, wildlife, and other values.
    (b) Land use categories. Land use categories shown on the map 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:
    (1) Designated community. All properties inside a designated 
community.
    (2) Residential. Areas for residential development outside 
designated communities.
    (3) Commercial. Areas for commercial development outside designated 
communities.
    (4) Agriculture. All properties outside designated communities not 
placed in a residential or commercial land use category.
    (5) Mineral. Any areas in the land use in paragraphs (b) (1) through 
(4) of this section, used for mineral operations.
    (c) Changes in classification. The Secretary may make changes in the 
classification of private lands set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section by incorporating such changes in an amendment of these 
regulations.
    (d) Certification of compliance with standards--(1) Present use. Any 
owner of property may request in writing the Area Ranger to examine the 
present use of the property and issue a certification that such present 
use conforms to the applicable standards established in Sec. 292.16 for 
the land use category in which the property is placed. If after 
examination the Area Ranger determines that the present use of the 
property does so conform, he will issue a certification to this effect.
    (2) Planned development or change in use. Any owner of property who 
proposes to change the use or develop his property for other than 
agricultural use may submit to the Area Ranger a use or development plan 
setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is 
to be developed and the use to which the property is to be put. If the 
Area Ranger determines that the development and use plan conforms to the 
applicable standards established in Sec. 292.16 for the land use 
category in which the property is placed, he will issue a certification 
to this effect.

[[Page 386]]

    (3) Notification of action. Within 45 days after receipt of request 
for certification, the Area Ranger shall:
    (i) Issue the certification.
    (ii) Notify applicant that additional information is needed before 
action can be taken on the application.
    (iii) Notify applicant that certification is denied, and reasons for 
denial.
    (iv) Notify applicant that action on the request is deferred for a 
specified period of time for stated reasons.
    (e) Qualified certifications. (1) Any owner of a property classified 
residential or commercial under paragraph (a) of this section which had 
been improved and was being used for residential or commercial purposes 
on the effective date of these regulations, but which does not conform 
to the standards established for properties in the land use category in 
which the property is placed may nevertheless be issued a certification 
for period not to exceed 10 years so that the improvements may be made 
to conform to the standards. Such certification shall specify that it is 
only effective so long as the property is not subdivided, and is not 
further improved and the improvements existing on the effective date of 
these regulations, are not reconstructed, altered or relocated, except 
to meet standards. The certification shall specify the date on which it 
shall terminate.
    (2) If the Area Ranger determines, prior to certification, that a 
part or all of a property, for which a request for certification is 
made, is needed for access to and utilization of public property or for 
recreation and other facilities, he may except from the certification 
that part of the property needed for these purposes.
    (f) Revocation of certification. The Area Ranger will revoke a 
certification when he finds that the property is being used or developed 
not in conformance with the terms of the certification or the applicable 
standards established in Sec. 292.16 or is in imminent danger of being 
so used or developed. Notice of such revocation will be in writing and 
delivered to the owner in person or by certified mail. A partial 
revocation may be made when a portion of a property covered by a 
certification is determined to be needed for access to and utilization 
of public property or for recreation and other facilities.
    (g) Effect of certification. Property for which a certification is 
held by the owner shall not be acquired by the Secretary by 
condemnation.
    (h) Effect of noncompliance with standards. Property for which a 
determination has been made that it is being used or developed not in 
conformance with the applicable standards established in Sec. 292.16 for 
the land use category in which the property is placed may be acquired by 
the Secretary by condemnation.
    (i) Acquisition by negotiated purchase. (1) Any privately owned land 
or interest in land determined by the Secretary to be needed in 
furtherance of the objectives and purposes for which the Sawtooth 
National Recreation Area was established may be acquired by negotiated 
purchase subject only to the limitation in paragraph (j) of this 
section.
    (2) Property which has been developed for use prior to the effective 
date of these regulations, but which is not in conformance with 
applicable standards may be acquired by the Secretary through negotiated 
purchase and the Secretary may permit the owners, their successors or 
assigns to retain a right of use and occupancy of the improved property 
for a definite term not beyond December 31, 1988.
    (j) Limitation on acquisitions. Acquisitions of lands or interests 
therein for access to and utilization of public property and for 
recreation and other facilities shall not exceed 5 percent of the total 
acreage of all private property within the Sawtooth National Recreation 
Area on August 22, 1972. A land acquisition plan shall be prepared by 
the Area Ranger and approved by the Regional Forester showing those 
properties needed for access to and utilization of public property or 
for recreation and other facilities. Said plan may be revised from time 
to time upon approval by the Regional Forester. Said plan shall be 
available for inspection by the public in the office of the Area Ranger.
    (k) Land exchanges. Some parcels of Federal lands within the 
Sawtooth National Recreation Area are classified or

[[Page 387]]

may be subsequently classified in the overall general plan for the 
Recreation Area as suitable for selection through land exchange. Using 
existing land exchange authorities, these Federal lands may be made 
available for selection by parties owning land within the boundaries of 
the National Recreation Area to resolve some existing or potential land 
use conflicts. The values of the properties so exchanged shall be 
approximately equal, or, if they are not approximately equal, they shall 
be equalized by the payment of cash. Federal lands which may be located 
within the boundaries of designated communities will be considered for 
exchange only after acceptable community development plans and 
ordinances have been implemented.
    (l) Appeals. Any landowner who is adversely affected by a decision 
of the Area Ranger under these regulations may file an appeal under the 
provisions of 36 CFR part 251, subpart C.
    (m) Judicial review. The United States District Court for the 
District of Idaho shall have jurisdiction to review these regulations 
upon a compliant filed within 6 months after the effective date of these 
regulations, by any affected landowner in an action for a declaratory 
judgment as provided in the Act of August 22, 1972 (86 Stat. 612), 
section 4(a).

operating plan with the Act and the General Management Plan. The Area 
Ranger may not approve an operating plan for an identical claimed area 
to more than one operator.
    (2) Within 30 working days of receipt of a proposed operating plan, 
the Area Ranger shall take one of the following actions:
    (i) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved as 
submitted; or,
    (ii) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved 
as subject to the operator accepting the changes or conditions deemed 
necessary by the Area Ranger; or,
    (iii) Notify the operator that more time is necessary to review the 
plan because of the need to prepare an environmental impact statement, 
or conduct a cultural resource survey, or other stated reasons; in such 
cases, the operator will be notified of the approximate time needed to 
complete the review; or,
    (iv) Notify the operator of an apparent conflict of ownership and 
that additional proof of ownership is required; or,
    (v) Notify the operator that the operating plan as submitted is 
inadequate to support any conclusion as to substantial impairment, and 
that additional information will be required; or,
    (vi) Notify the operator that the operating plan is not approved 
since such operations as specified in the plan would create substantial 
impairment.
    (f) Operating plans--suspension or modification. The Area Ranger may 
suspend or terminate authorization to operate in whole or in part where 
such operations are causing substantial impairment which cannot be 
mitigated. At any time during operations under an approved operation 
plan, the operator may be required to modify the operating plan in order 
to minimize or avoid substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA.

[[Page 392]]

    (g) Bond requirements. (1) An operator shall furnish a bond, in the 
amount determined by the Area Ranger to be appropriate for reclamation 
of the disturbed surface area, prior to the commencement of operations. 
In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, 
as directed by the Forest Service, cash in an amount equal to the 
required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the 
United States having market value at the time of deposit or not less 
than the required dollar amount of the bond.
    (2) When the reclamation of the project, or portions thereof, has 
been completed, the operator will notify the Area Ranger who will 
examine the area to determine whether the reclamation is acceptable. 
When the Area Ranger has accepted as completed any portion of the 
reclamation, he shall reduce proportionately the amount of bond 
thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation. 
However, the operator will not be released from liability under the bond 
for the amount which may be necessary to revegetate each planting area 
for a minimum period of at least 5 years after the first efforts at 
revegetation if those initial efforts are unsuccessful.
    (3) If the Area Ranger determines that revegetation is likely to 
occur before the expiration of such minimum period, he may release the 
operator from the extended liability under the bond for revegetation of 
planting area.
    (h) Access. The operator shall permit free and unrestricted public 
access to and through lands included within an unpatented mining claim 
for all lawful and proper purposes. In areas where such access would 
unduly interfere with authorized operations or would constitute a hazard 
to public health and safety, public use may be restricted with prior 
approval of the Area Ranger.

     Subpart E--Hells Canyon National Recreation Area--Private Lands

    Authority: 89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-13.

    Source: 59 FR 30497, June 13, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 292.20  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National 
Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-
13) encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private 
land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing, farming, timber 
harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, 
as they existed at the time the HCNRA was established on December 31, 
1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to 
promulgate regulations establishing standards for the use and 
development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary 
limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards 
are not met. The purpose of this subpart is to establish standards that 
would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited 
condemnation authority granted by the Act.
    (b) Scope. The regulations in this subpart establish standards 
applicable to all private property within the boundaries of the HCNRA, 
including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha 
Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells Canyon Wilderness. The regulations 
in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of 
private property; rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those 
uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was 
established. Uses not compatible with these standards could result in 
the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without a landowner's 
consent.
    The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect 
a taking of private property, including valid, existing water rights, 
nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a 
private landowner's property use that is compatible with the purposes of 
the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this 
subpart solely to determine whether private land uses or developments 
are compatible with the purposes and direction of the Act and, if not, 
to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating 
condemnation proceedings to acquire land or scenic easements.

where structures typify the architectural style and materials of a 
significant historic era such as pre-World War II. Screening is not 
required, however, for new or replacement structures that are associated 
with an existing unscreened structure or structures that were not 
screened at the time this rule became effective.

[[Page 395]]

    (3) No public or commercial solid waste disposal sites or hazardous 
substance disposal sites are located on private lands within the HCNRA.
    (4) All new or replacement utility lines are placed underground 
where ground conditions and topography permit. This standard does not 
prevent or impair routine maintenance of utility lines or related 
structures in existence prior to June 13, 1994.
    (5) No new or replacement structures are developed within the 
boundaries of the Hells Canyon Wilderness, provided that existing 
structures may be repaired and/or maintained.
    (6) Significant historic, archaeologic, or paleontologic sites are 
protected.
    (7) Sites used for the extraction of common mineral materials, such 
as gravel, for construction and maintenance purposes on all except 
designated mining lands, are screened where possible, and are not in 
excess of 2 acres in size.
    (8) New recreational facilities enhance and are compatible with the

standards are applicable to farm/forest/grazing lands:
    (1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the minimum lot 
size for residential development is 160 acres. Only residences 
associated with farm/forest/grazing uses may be developed. Partitions of 
less than 160 acres may be made to provide for the continuation of 
existing commercial agriculture, but such partitions may not be 
developed for residential use. Lots of less than 160 acres existing on 
June 13, 1994, with residences permanently affixed to a foundation or 
basement, are considered to be in compliance.
    (2) Structures are limited to those necessary to conduct farm/
forest/grazing use.
    (3) Dude ranching is permitted provided it is compatible with the 
purpose and direction of the Act and is part of a recognized ranching 
operation.
    (4) New or replacement structures for farm/forest/grazing use are 
not closer than 25 feet from a property line or 55 feet from the center 
line of a travel route.
    (c) Mining Lands. (1) The following standards are applicable to

    (b) Noncompliance. (1) In the event that the Forest Service 
determines that an existing or proposed use of development is not in 
compliance with the standards of Sec. 292.23 of this subpart, the Ranger 
shall give the landowner written notice of the manner and nature of 
noncompliance. To the extent practicable, the notice will include 
suggestions for achieving compliance. The notice also must include a 
statement that the violation of a standard or standards and the failure 
to cure such violation may result in the initiation of condemnation 
proceedings by the Secretary.
    (2) The Forest Service may initiate a noncompliance determination on 
its own without having first received a landowner request.
    (c) Written petition. The landowner may file a written petition with 
the Forest Supervisor for a review of a decision of compliance or 
noncompliance. The Forest Supervisor shall render a decision within 30

authorized officer shall review the information related to valid 
existing rights and notify the operator in writing within 60 days of one 
of the following situations:
    (1) That sufficient information on valid existing rights has been 
provided and the anticipated date by which the valid existing rights 
determination will be completed, which shall not be more than 2 years 
after the date of notification; unless the authorized officer, upon 
finding of good cause with written notice and explanation to the 
operator, extends the time period for completion of the valid existing 
rights determination.
    (2) That the operator has failed to provide sufficient information 
to review a claim of valid existing rights and, therefore, the 
authorized officer has no obligation to evaluate whether the operator 
has valid existing rights or to process the operator's proposed plan of 
operations.
    (b)(1) If the authorized officer concludes that there is not 
sufficient evidence of valid existing rights, the officer shall so 
notify the operator in writing of the reasons for the determination, 
inform the operator that the proposed mineral operation cannot be 
conducted, advise the operator that the Forest Service will promptly 
notify the Bureau of Land Management of the determination and request 
the initiation of a mineral contest action against the pertinent mining 
claim, and advise the operator that further consideration of the 
proposed plan of operations is suspended pending final action by the 
Department of the Interior on the operator's claim of valid existing 
rights and any final judicial review thereof.
    (2) If the authorized officer concludes that there is not sufficient 
evidence of valid existing rights, the authorized officer also shall 
notify promptly the Bureau of Land Management of the determination and 
request the initiation of a mineral contest action against the pertinent 
mining claims.
    (c) An authorized officer's decision pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section that there is not sufficient evidence of valid existing 
rights is not subject to further agency or Department of Agriculture 
review or administrative appeal.
    (d) The authorized officer shall notify the operator in writing that 
the review of the remainder of the proposed plan will proceed if:
    (1) The authorized officer concludes that there is sufficient 
evidence of valid existing rights;
    (2) Final agency action by the Department of the Interior determines 
that the applicable mining claim constitutes a valid existing right; or
    (3) Final judicial review of final agency action by the Department 
of the Interior finds that the applicable mining claim constitutes a 
valid existing right.
    (e) Upon completion of the review of the plan of operations, the 
authorized officer shall ensure that the minimum information required by 
Sec. 292.63(c) of this subpart has been addressed and, pursuant to 
Sec. 228.5(a) of this chapter, notify the operator in writing whether or 
not the plan of operations is approved.

[[Page 404]]

    (f) If the plan of operations is not approved, the authorized 
officer shall explain in writing why the plan of operations cannot be 
approved.
    (g) If the plan of operations is approved, the authorized officer 
shall establish a time period for the proposed operations which shall be 
for the minimum amount of time reasonably necessary for a prudent 
operator to complete the mineral development activities covered by the 
approved plan of operations.
    (h) An approved plan of operations is subject to review and 
modification as follows:
    (1) To bring the plan into conformance with changes in applicable 
federal law or regulation; or
    (2) To respond to new information not available at the time the 
authorized officer approved the plan, for example, new listings of 
threatened or endangered species; or
    (3) To correct errors or omissions made at the time the plan was 
approved, for example, to ensure compliance with applicable federal law 
or regulation; or
    (4) To permit operations requested by the operator that differ in 
type, scope, or duration from those in an approved plan of operations 
but that are not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
    (i) If an operator desires to conduct operations that differ in 
type, scope, or duration from those in an approved plan of operations, 
and if those changes will result in resource impacts not anticipated 
when the original plan was approved, the operator must submit a 
supplemental plan or a modification of the plan for review and approval.


<R05>
Sec. 292.65  Plan of operations--suspension.

    (a) The authorized officer may suspend mineral operations due to an 
operator's noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or terms 
and conditions of the approved plan of operations.
    (1) In those cases that present a threat of imminent harm to public 
health, safety, or the environment, or where such harm is already 
occurring, the authorized officer may take immediate action to stop the 
threat or damage without prior notice. In such case, written notice and 
explanation of the action taken shall be given the operator as soon as 
reasonably practicable following the suspension.
    (2) In those cases that do not present a threat of imminent harm to 
public health, safety, or the environment, the authorized officer must 
first notify the operator in writing of the basis for the suspension and 
provide the operator with reasonably sufficient time to respond to the 
notice of the authorized officer or to bring the mineral operations into 
conformance with applicable laws, regulations, or the terms and 
conditions of the approved plan of operations.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the authorized 
officer shall notify the operator not less than 30 days prior to the

<R05>
Sec. 295.1  Applicability.

    The regulations in the following parts pertain to administrative 
designation and location of specific areas and trails of National Forest 
System lands on which the use of vehicles traveling off National Forest 
development roads is allowed, restricted or prohibited. Prohibitions 
regarding use of vehicles off roads is provided in 36 CFR part 261.


<R05>
Sec. 295.2  Planning and designation for use of vehicles off forest development roads.

    (a) On National Forest System lands, the continuing land management 
planning process will be used to allow, restrict, or prohibit use by 
specific vehicle types off roads. This process will include coordination 
with appropriate Federal, State and local agencies. The planning process 
will analyze and evaluate current and potential impacts arising from 
operation of specific vehicle types on soil, water, vegetation, fish and 
wildlife, forest visitors and cultural and historic resources. If the 
analysis indicates that the use of one or more vehicle types off roads 
will cause considerable adverse effects on the resources or other forest 
visitors, use of the affected areas and trails by the vehicle type or 
types likely to cause such adverse effects will be restricted or 
prohibited until such time as the adverse effects can be eliminated as 
provided in 36 CFR part 261.
    (b) Off-road vehicle management plans shall provide vehicle 
management direction aimed at resource protection, public safety of all 
users, minimizing conflicts among users, and provide for diverse use and 
benefits of the National Forests. Designation of areas and trails shall 
be in accordance with the following:
    (1) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize damage to soil, 
watershed, vegetation, or other resources of the public lands.
    (2) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize harassment of 
wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife habitats.
    (3) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize conflicts between 
off-road vehicle use and other existing or proposed recreational uses of 
the same or neighboring public lands, and to ensure the compatibility of 
such uses with existing conditions in populated areas, taking into 
account noise and other factors.
    (4) Areas and trails shall not be located in officially designated 
Wilderness Areas or Primitive Areas.

However, this does not preclude the use of any fire, military, 
emergency, or law enforcement vehicle for emergency purposes, or the use 
of any combat or combat support vehicle for national defense purposes, 
or registered motorboats, or vehicle use expressly authorized by the 
Chief, Forest Service, under a permit, lease, license, or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 295.3  Public participation.

    The public shall be provided an opportunity to participate in the 
process of allowing, restricting, or prohibiting use of areas and trails 
to one or more specific vehicle types off forest development roads. 
Sixty days advance notice will be given to allow for public review of 
proposed or revised designations. In emergency situations, temporary 
designations up to one year in length may be made or revised without 
public participation if needed to protect the resources and/or to 
provide for public safety.


<R05>
Sec. 295.4  Public information.

    In addition to the requirements of 36 CFR 261.51, information and

    (b) Time periods when use is allowed, restricted or prohibited.
    (c) The type of vehicle regulated.


<R05>
Sec. 295.5  Monitoring effects of vehicle use off forest development roads.

    The effects of use by specific types of vehicles off roads on 
National Forest System lands will be monitored. If the

[[Page 414]]

results of monitoring, including public input, indicate that the use of 
one or more vehicle types off roads is causing or will cause 
considerable adverse effects on the factors and resource values referred 
to in Sec. 295.2, the area or trail suffering adverse effects will be 
immediately closed to the responsible vehicle type or types until the 
adverse effects have been eliminated and measures have been implemented 
to prevent future recurrence as provided in 36 CFR part 261. Forest 
Supervisors may delegate immediate closure authority to District Rangers 
or other forest officers in order to facilitate timely actions to meet 
these objectives. Designations, use restrictions, and operating 
conditions will be revised as needed to meet changing conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 295.6  Revision of off-road vehicle management plans.

    Forest Supervisors will annually review off-road vehicle management 
plans and temporary designations implemented since the last annual 
review. If the plan needs revision, the public will be given the 
opportunity to participate in the review as stated in Sec. 295.3.

Sec. 296.1  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the 
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and 
procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing 
protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and 
Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land 
managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration 
provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 
42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal 
of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized 
excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of 
archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for 
ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources 
when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources.
    (b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions 
on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations 
relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple 
uses of the public lands.

<R05>
Sec. 296.5  Permit requirements and exceptions.

    (a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological 
resources from public lands or Indian lands, and to carry out activities 
associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the 
Federal land manager for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not 
begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Federal land 
manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to 
appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for 
a permit meets conditions in Sec. 296.8(a) of this part.
    (b) Exceptions: (1) No permit shall be required under this part for 
any person conducting activities on the public lands under other 
permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those 
activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or 
removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might 
incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. 
General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other 
authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal 
as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the 
Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities 
which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, 
leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal 
of archaeological resources required for compliance with those 
authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit 
requirements of this part.
    (2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person 
collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which 
is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that 
such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaelogical 
resource.
    (3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 
of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or 
removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological 
resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in 
the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or 
archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member 
shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;
    (4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to 
carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued 
under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the 
enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such 
permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions 
until expiration.
    (5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit 
is issued under this part.
    (c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal 
land manager's direction, associated with

[[Page 418]]

the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit 
application procedures of Sec. 296.6. However, the Federal land manager 
shall insure that provisions of Sec. 296.8 and Sec. 296.9 have been met 
by other documented means, and that any official duties which might 
result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or 
cultural site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the 
subject of consideration under Sec. 296.7.
    (d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf 
of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager 
shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of Sec. 296.5(b)(5), 
Sec. 296.7, Sec. 296.8(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), Sec. 296.9, 
Sec. 296.10, Sec. 296.12, and Sec. 296.13(a) to such Governor or to such 
designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the 
Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/
or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving 
any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other 
scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land 
manager.
    (e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities 
governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may 
be required for activities which do not require a permit under this 
part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any 
activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this 
part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of 
determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning 
such activities.


<R05>
Sec. 296.6  Application for permits and information collection.

    (a) Any person may apply to the appropriate Federal land manager for 
a permit to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public

    (4) Evidence of the applicant's ability to initiate, conduct, and 
complete the proposed work, including evidence of logistical support and 
laboratory facilities.
    (5) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of 
archaeological resources on public lands, the names of the university, 
museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the 
applicant proposes to store all collections, and copies of records, 
data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work. 
Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized 
official of the institution, of willingness to assume curatorial 
responsibility for the collections, records, data, photographs and other 
documelts and to safeguard and preserve these materials as property of 
the United States.
    (6) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of 
archaeological resources on Indian lands, the name of the university, 
museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the 
applicant proposes to store copies of records, data, photographs, and

    (c) The Federal land manager may require additional information, 
pertinent to land management responsibilities, to be included in the 
application for permit and shall so inform the applicant.
    (d) Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection requirement 
contained in Sec. 296.6 of these regulations has been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and 
assigned clearance number 1024-0037. The purpose of the information 
collection is to meet statutory and administrative requirements in the 
public interest. The information will be used to assist Federal land 
managers in determining that applicants for permits are qualified, that 
the work proposed would further archaeological knowledge, that 
archaeological resources and associated records and data will be 
properly preserved, and that the permitted activity would not conflict 
with the management of the public lands involved. Response to the 
information requirement is necessary in order for an applicant to obtain 
a benefit.


<R05>
Sec. 296.7  Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.

    (a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm 
to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on 
public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 
days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify 
any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or 
cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the 
public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.
    (1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be 
sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the 
tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be 
the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe 
and the Federal land manager.
    (2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native 
American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider 
sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.
    (3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager 
may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to 
discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential 
harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any 
mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the 
terms and conditions of the permit under Sec. 296.9.
    (4) When the Federal land manager detemines that a permit applied 
for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent 
threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal 
land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.
    (b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural 
importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian 
tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal 
land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief 
executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the 
location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural 
importance so that such information may be on file for land management 
purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National 
Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure 
pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 
U.S.C. 470w-3).
    (2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American 
group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has 
aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land 
manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate 
with official representatives of that group to obtain information on 
sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.
    (3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any 
Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations 
for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this 
section.
    (4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in 
consultation with official representatives of Indian

[[Page 420]]

tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the 
subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has 
been issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the 
discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification 
have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land 
manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of 
permits, under Sec. 296.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land 
manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following 
the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and 
consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving 
Native American human remains and other ``cultural items'', as defined 
by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its 
implementing regulations.

Sec. 296.14  Determination of archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair.

    (a) Archaeological value. For purposes of this part, the 
archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a 
violation of the prohibitions in Sec. 296.4 of this part or conditions 
of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the value of the 
information associated with the archaeological resource. This value 
shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the 
scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the 
violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost 
of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out 
laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to 
realize the information potential.
    (b) Commercial value. For purposes of this part, the commercial 
value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the 
prohibitions in Sec. 296.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued 
pursuant to this part shall be its fair market value. Where the 
violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the 
fair market value should be determined using the condition of the 
archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its 
prior condition can be ascertained.

[[Page 423]]

    (c) Cost of restoration and repair. For purposes of this part, the 
cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damaged as a 
result of a violation of prohibitions or conditions pursuant to this 
part, shall be the sum of the costs already incurred for emergency 
restoration or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary 
to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be 
limited to, the costs of the following:
    (1) Reconstruction of the archaeological resource;
    (2) Stabilization of the archaeological resource;
    (3) Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization;
    (4) Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization;
    (5) Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by 
the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from 
further disturbance;
    (6) Examination and analysis of the archaeological resource 
including recording remaining archaeological information, where 
necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which 
cannot be otherwise conserved;
    (7) Reinterment of human remains in accordance with religious custom 
and State, local, or tribal law, where appropriate, as determined by the 
Federal land manager.
    (8) Preparation of reports relating to any of the above activities.


<R05>

occurred, the Federal land manager shall so notify the person served 
with a notice of violation, and no penalty shall be assessed.
    (4) Where the facts warrant a conclusion that a violation has 
occurred, the Federal land manager shall determine a penalty amount in 
accordance with Sec. 296.16.
    (f) Notice of assessment. The Federal land manager shall notify the 
person served with a notice of violation of the penalty amount assessed

the notice. The person shall enclose with the request for hearing a copy 
of the notice of assessment, and shall deliver the request as specified 
in the notice of assessment, personally or by registered or certified 
mail (return receipt requested).
    (2) Failure to deliver a written request for a hearing within 45 
days of the date of service of the notice of assessment shall be deemed 
a waiver of the right to a hearing.
    (3) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be held in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. section 554. In any such hearing, the amount of 
civil penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with this part, 
and shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Federal land 
manager under paragraph (f) of this section or any offer of mitigation 
or remission made by the Federal land manager.
    (h) Final administrative decision. (1) Where the person served with 
a notice of violation has accepted the penalty pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, the notice of violation shall constitute the 
final administrative decision;
    (2) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has not 
filed a timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section, the notice of assessment shall constitute the final 
administrative decision;
    (3) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has filed a 
timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the decision resulting from the hearing or any applicable 
administrative appeal therefrom shall constitute the final 
administrative decision.
    (i) Payment of penalty. (1) The person assessed a civil penalty 
shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final 
administrative decision in which to make full payment of the penalty 
assessed, unless a timely request for appeal has been filed with a 
United States District Court as provided in section 7(b)(1) of the Act.
    (2) Upon failure to pay the penalty, the Federal land manager may 
request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to collect the 
penalty in a United States District Court for any district in which the 
person assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts 
business. Where the Federal land manager is not represented by the 
Attorney General, a civil action may be

[[Page 425]]

initiated directly by the Federal land manager.
    (j) Other remedies not waived. Assessment of a penalty under this 
section shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to pursue other 
available legal or administrative remedies.

recognizing violations, documenting relevant evidence, and reporting 
assembled information to the appropriate authorities. Methods employed 
to document and report such violations should be compatible with 
existing agency reporting systems for documenting violations of other 
appropriate Federal statutes and regulations. Summary information to be 
included in the Secretary's comprehensive report will be based upon the 
system developed by each Federal land manager for documenting suspected 
violations.

boundaries of a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System 
pursuant to section 3(a) or 2(a)(ii) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 297.4  Requirements for Federal agencies.

    (a) No license, permit, or other authorization can be issued for a 
Federally assisted water resources project on any portion of a Wild and 
Scenic River or Study River nor can appropriations be requested to begin 
construction of such projects, without prior notice to the Secretary of 
Agriculture, and a determination in accordance with section 7 of the 
Act.
    (b) As soon as practicable, but no less than 60 days prior to the 
date of proposed action, the Federal agency shall provide a notice of 
intent to issue such license, permit, or other authorization to the 
Chief, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2417, 
Washington, DC 20013. The Secretary will, to the extent possible, give 
expedited consideration to a notice of intent for a project needed to 
address an emergency situation.
    (c) The notice shall include the following information:
    (1) Name and location of affected river;
    (2) Location of the project;
    (3) Nature of the permit or other authorization proposed for 
issuance;
    (4) A description of the proposed activity; and
    (5) Any relevant information, such as plans, maps, and environmental 
studies, assessments, or environmental impact statements.


<R05>
Sec. 297.5  Determination.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture will consent to the issuance of any 
Federal license, permit, or other authorization if, as a finding of 
fact, it is determined that:
    (1) The water resources project will not have a direct and adverse 
effect on the values for which a Wild and Scenic River or Study River 
was designated, when any portion of the project is within the boundaries 
of said river, or;
    (2) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade 
nor unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish wildlife 
values of a Wild and Scenic River, when any portion of the project is 
located above, below, or outside the Wild and Scenic River, or;

[[Page 429]]

    (3) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade 
nor diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish and wildlife values of a 
Study River when the project is located above, below, or outside the 
Study River during the study period.
    (b) If consent is denied, the Secretary may recommend measures to 
eliminate adverse effects, and the authorizing agencies may submit 
revised plans for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 297.6  Environmental analysis requirements.

    (a) The determination of the effects of a proposed water resources 
project shall be made in compliance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA). To the extent possible, authorizing agencies should 
ensure that any environmental studies, assessments, or environmental 
impact statements prepared for a water resources project adequately 
address the environmental effects on resources protected by the Wild and 
Scenic Rivers Act, and that the Department of Agriculture is apprised of 
ongoing analyses so as to facilitate coordination and identification of 
Wild and Scenic River related issues.
    (b) To the extent practicable, impacts on Wild and Scenic River 
values will be considered in the context of other review procedures 
provided by law. Authorizing agencies are encouraged to consult with the 
Forest Service in order to identify measures which could eliminate any 
direct and adverse effects, thereby increasing the likelihood of 
securing consent.
