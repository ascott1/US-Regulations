              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 200.1  General statement and statutory authority.

    The Securities and Exchange Commission was created in 1934 under the 
Securities Exchange Act. That Act transferred to the Commission the 
administration of the Securities Act of 1933, formerly administered by 
the Federal Trade Commission. Subsequent laws assigned to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission for administration are: Public Utility Holding 
Company Act of 1935, Trust Indenture Act of 1939, Investment Company Act 
of 1940, and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, under the 
Bankruptcy Code, the Commission is a statutory party in cases arising 
under chapters 9 and 11. Considered together, the laws administered by 
the Commission provided for the following.
    (a) Public disclosure of pertinent facts concerning public offerings 
of securities and securities listed on national securities exchanges and 
certain securities traded in the over-the-counter markets.

[[Page 8]]

    (b) Enforcement of disclosure requirements in the soliciting of 
proxies for meetings of security holders by companies whose securities 
are registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, public utility holding companies, and their subsidiaries and 
investment companies.
    (c) Regulation of the trading in securities on national securities 
exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.
    (d) Investigation of securities frauds, manipulations, and other 
violations, and the imposition and enforcement of legal sanctions 
therefor.
    (e) Registration, and the regulation of certain activities, of 
brokers, dealers and investment advisers.
    (f) Supervision of the activities of mutual funds and other 
investment companies.
    (g) Administration of statutory standards governing protective and 
other provisions of trust indentures under which debt securities are 
sold to the public.
    (h) Regulation of the purchase and sale of securities, utility 
properties, and other assets by registered public utility holding 
companies and their electric and gas utility subsidiaries; enforcement 
of statutory standards for public utility holding company system 
simplification and integration; and approval of their reorganization, 
mergers and consolidations.
    (i) Protection of the interests of public investors involved in 
bankruptcy reorganization cases and in bankruptcy cases involving the 
adjustment of debts of a municipality.
    (j) Administrative sanctions, injunctive remedies, civil money 
penalties and criminal prosecution. There are also private rights of 
action for investors injured by violations of the Acts.

<R05>
Sec. 200.2  Statutory functions.

    Following are brief descriptions of the Commission's functions under 
each of the statutes it administers:
    (a) Securities Act of 1933. (1) Issuers of securities making public 
offerings for sale in interstate commerce or through the mails, directly 
or by others on their behalf, are required to file with the Commission 
registration statements containing financial and other pertinent data 
about the issuer and the offering. A similar requirement is provided 
with respect to such public offerings on behalf of a controlling person 
of the issuer. Unless a registration statement is in effect with respect 
to such securities, it is unlawful to sell the securities in interstate 
commerce or through the mails. (There are certain limited exemptions, 
such as government securities, non-public offerings, and intrastate 
offerings.) The effectiveness of a registration statement may be refused 
or suspended after a hearing if the statement contains material 
misstatements or omissions, thus barring sale of the securities until it 
is appropriately amended. Registration is not a finding by the 
Commission as to the accuracy of the facts disclosed; and it is unlawful 
so to represent. Moreover, registration of securities does not imply 
approval of the issue by the Commission or insure investors against loss 
in their purchase, but serves rather to provide information upon which 
investors may make an informed and realistic evaluation of the worth of 
the securities.
    (2) Persons responsible for filing false information with the 
Commission subject themselves to the risk of fine or imprisonment or 
both; and the issuing company, its directors, officers, and the 
underwriters and dealers and others may be liable in damages to 
purchasers of registered securities if the disclosures in the 
registration statements and prospectus are materially defective. Also 
the statute contains antifraud provisions which apply generally to the 
sale of securities, whether or not registered.
    (b) Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This Act requires the filing of 
registration applications and annual and other reports with national 
securities exchanges and the Commission, by companies whose securities 
are listed on the exchanges. Annual and other reports must be filed also 
by certain companies whose securities are traded on the over-the-counter 
markets. These must contain financial and other

[[Page 9]]

data prescribed by the Commission for the information of investors. 
Material misstatements or omissions are grounds for suspension or 
withdrawal of the security from exchange trading. This Act makes 
unlawful any solicitation of proxies, authorizations, or consents in 
contravention of Commission rules. These rules require disclosure of 
information about the subject of the solicitation to security holders. 
The Act requires disclosure of the holdings and the transactions by an 
officer, director, or beneficial owner of over 10 percent of any class 
of equity security of certain companies. It also requires disclosure of 
the beneficial owners of more than five percent of any class of equity 
securities of a registered company. It provides substantive and 
procedural protection to security holders in third-party and issuer 
tender offers. The Act also provides for the registration with, and 
regulation by, the Commission of national securities exchanges, brokers 
or dealers engaged in an over-the-counter securities business, and 
national associations of such brokers or dealers. It gives the 
Commission rulemaking power with respect to short sales, stabilizing, 
floor trading activities of specialists and odd-lot dealers, and such 
matters as excessive trading by exchange members. The Act authorizes the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe minimum 
margin requirements for listed securities.
    (c) Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This Act authorizes 
the Commission to regulate gas and electric public-utility holding 
companies under standards prescribed for the protection of the public 
interest and the interest of investors and consumers. The Act generally 
limits a public-utility holding company to a single integrated public-
utility system, and requires simple corporate and capital structures. If 
not exempt, a public-utility holding company must register with the 
Commission. Generally, a registered holding company must obtain 
Commission approval before it can issue and sell securities, acquire 
utility securities or assets or any other interest in any business, or 
enter into transactions with its affiliates. It must also comply with 
extensive reporting and record-keeping requirements. Although largely 
free of these requirements, an exempt holding company remains subject to 
the geographic limitations of the Act. The Act permits the acquisition 
of interests in ``exempt wholesale generators'' and ``foreign utility 
companies'' unrelated to a system's utility operations.
    (d) Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This Act safeguards the interests 
of purchasers of publicly-offered debt securities issued under trust 
indentures by requiring the inclusion of certain protective provisions 
in, and the exclusion of certain types of exculpatory clauses from, 
trust indentures. The Act also requires that an independent indenture 
trustee represent the debtors by proscribing certain relationships that 
could conflict with proper exercise of duties.
    (e) Investment Company Act of 1940. This Act establishes a 
comprehensive regulatory framework for investment companies and subjects 
their activities to regulation under standards prescribed for the 
protection of investors. Among other things, the Act provides for the 
registration of investment companies with the Commission; requires them 
to disclose their financial condition and investment policies to their 
shareholders; prohibits them from substantially changing investment 
policies without shareholder approval; bars persons guilty of securities 
fraud from serving as officers or directors; prevents underwriters, 
investment bankers, or brokers from constituting more than a minority of 
the directors of an investment company; requires that management 
contracts be submitted to shareholders for their approval; prohibits 
transactions between investment companies and their directors, officers, 
or affiliated companies or persons, except when approved by the 
Commission; and prohibits investment companies from issuing senior 
securities except under specified terms and conditions. The Act also 
regulates advisory fees, sales and repurchases of securities, exchange 
offers, and other activities of investment companies. The Act authorizes 
the Commission to exempt any person or class of persons or securities 
from any provisions of, or rules

[[Page 10]]

under, the Act and to conduct any investigation it deems necessary to 
determine existing or potential violations of the Act. It also 
authorizes the Commission to prepare reports to security holders on the 
fairness of plans of reorganization, merger, or consolidation. The 
Commission may institute a court action to enjoin acts or practices of 
management involving, among other things, a breach of fiduciary duty and 
the consummation of plans of reorganization, merger, or consolidation 
that are grossly unfair to security holders.
    (f) Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Persons who, for compensation, 
engage in the business of advising others with respect to their security 
transactions must register with the Commission. Their activities in the 
conduct of such business are subject to standards of the act which make 
unlawful those practices which constitute fraud or deceit and which 
require, among other things, disclosure of any interests they may have 
in transactions executed for clients. The Act grants to the Commission 
rule-making power with respect to fraudulent and other activities of 
investment advisers.
    (g) Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy 
Code (11 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) provides for Commission participation as a 
statutory party in reorganization cases. Under section 1109(a) of the 
Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 1109(a)), which also applies to Chapter 9 
cases regarding municipalities, the Commission ``may raise and may 
appear and be heard on any issue in the case.''

Sec. 200.16  Executive Assistant to the Chairman.

    The Executive Assistant to the Chairman assists the Chairman in 
consideration of legal, financial, and economic problems encountered in 
the administration of the Commission's statutes. He or she arranges for 
and conducts conferences with officials of the Commission, members of 
the staff, and/or representatives of the public on matters arising with 
regard to general programs or specific matters. Acting for the Chairman, 
he or she furnishes the initiative, executive direction, and authority 
for staff studies and reports bearing on the Commission's administration 
of the laws and its relations with the public, industry, and the 
Congress. The Executive Assistant is also responsible for assisting 
members of the Commission in the preparation of the opinions of the 
Commission, and to the Commission for the preparation of opinions and 
decisions on motions and certifications of questions and rulings by 
administrative law judges in the course of administrative proceedings 
under Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice (Sec. 
201.102(e) of this chapter), and in other cases in which the Chairman or 
the General Counsel has determined that separation of functions 
requirements or other circumstances would make inappropriate the 
exercise of such functions by the General Counsel. In cases where, 
pursuant to a waiver by the parties of separation of function 
requirements, another Division or Office of the Commission's staff 
undertakes to prepare an opinion or decision, such Division or Office 
rather than the Executive Assistant will prepare such opinion or 
decision, although the Executive Assistant may assist in such 
preparation. The Executive Assistant is further responsible for the 
exercise of such review functions with respect to adjudicatory matters 
as are delegated to him or her by the Commission pursuant to 101 Stat. 
1254 (15 U.S.C. 78d-1, 78d-2) or as may be otherwise delegated or 
assigned to him or her.

Chairman informed about problems and deficiencies in the Commission's 
programs and operations.
    (c) The Inspector General reports to the Chairman, but is 
independent of all other Commission management. In addition, the 
Inspector General independently prepares semi-annual reports to the 
Congress.
    (d) With respect to misconduct of Commission employees and 
contractors, the Inspector General, after consultation with the Ethics 
Counsel, where appropriate, serves as the Commission's liaison with

may be designated from time to time by the Chairman of the Commission:

    (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to issue notices, 
under Sec. 270.0-5 of this chapter, with respect to applications for 
orders under the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and, with 
respect to section 8(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(f)), in cases where 
no application has been filed, where, upon examination, the matter does 
not appear to the Director to present significant issues that have not 
been previously settled by the Commission or to raise questions of fact 
or policy indicating that the public interest or the interest of 
investors warrants that the Commission consider the matter.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to authorize the 
issuance of orders where a notice, under Sec. 270.0-5 of this chapter, 
has been issued and no request for a hearing has been received from any 
interested person within the period specified in the notice and the 
Director believes that the matter presents no significant issues that 
have not been previously settled by the Commission and it does not 
appear to the Director to be necessary in the public interest or the 
interest of investors that the Commission consider the matter.
    (3) To permit the withdrawal of applications pursuant to the Act (15

    (4) In connection with the mailing of reports to stockholders and

    (i) To grant reasonable extensions of time, upon a showing of good 
cause and that it would not be contrary to the public interest or 
inconsistent with the protection of investors; and
    (ii) To deny requests for extensions of time, provided the applicant 
is advised that he can request Commission review of any such denial.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) To authorize the issuance of orders granting confidential 
treatment pursuant to section 45(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-44(a)) 
where applications for confidential treatment are made regarding matters 
of disclosure in registration statements filed pursuant to section 8 of 
the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8), or in reports filed pursuant to section 30 of 
the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-29), but only when the Commission has previously

applicant's conduct has been such as not to make it against the public 
interest or the protection of investors to grant the temporary 
exemption; and

the investment companies being served by the applicant by allowing time 
for the orderly consideration of the application for permanent relief or

94-29, 89 Stat. 163, the Commission hereby delegates to an individual 
Commissioner, to be designated as the Commission's ``duty officer'' by 
the Chairman of the Commission (or by the Chairman's designee) from time 
to time, all of the functions of the Commission; Provided, however, That 
no such delegation shall authorize the duty officer (i) to exercise the 
function of rulemaking, as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act 
of 1946, as codified, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., with reference to general 
rules as distinguished from rules of particular applicability; (ii) to 
make any rule, pursuant to section 19(c) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934; or (iii) to preside at the taking of evidence as described in 
section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556(b), 
except that the duty officer may preside at the taking of evidence with 
respect to

[[Page 52]]

the issuance of a temporary cease-and-desist order as provided by Rule 
511(c) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, Sec. 201.511(c) of this 
chapter.
    (2) To the extent feasible, the designation of a duty officer shall 
rotate, under the administration of the Secretary, on a regular weekly 
basis among the members of the Commission other than the Chairman.
    (b) Exercise of duty officer authority. (1) The authority delegated 
by this rule shall be exercised when, in the opinion of the duty 
officer, action is required to be taken which, by reason of its urgency, 
cannot practicably be scheduled for consideration at a Commission 
meeting. After consideration of a staff recommendation involving such a 
matter, the duty officer shall forthwith report his or her action 
thereon to the Secretary.
    (2) The duty officer may, when in his or her opinion it would be 
proper and timely, exercise the authority delegated in this section to 
initiate by order a nonpublic formal investigative proceeding pursuant 
to section 19(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77s(b)), 
section 21(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u(b)),

(15 U.S.C. 80b-9(b)), and part 203 (Rules Relating to Investigations) of 
this title (17 CFR part 203). After consideration of a staff 
recommendation for initiation by order of a nonpublic formal 
investigative proceeding, the duty officer shall forthwith report his or 
her action thereon to the Secretary.
    (3) In any consideration of Commission business by a duty officer, 
the provisions of subpart I herein, Sec. 200.400 et seq., shall not 
apply, whether or not the duty officer, in exercising his or her 
authority, consults with, or seeks the advice of, other members of the 
Commission individually.
    (c) Commission affirmation of duty officer action. (1) Any action 
authorized by a duty officer pursuant to Sec. 200.43(a) shall be either 
(i) circulated to the members of the Commission for affirmation pursuant 
to Sec. 200.42; or (ii) scheduled for affirmation at a Commission 
meeting at the earliest practicable date consistent with the procedures 
in subpart I.
    (2)(i) The Commission may, in its discretion, at any time review any 
unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer, either upon its own 
initiative or upon the petition of any person affected thereby. The vote 
of any one member of the Commission, including the duty officer, shall 
be sufficient to bring any such unaffirmed action taken by a duty 
officer before the Commission for review.
    (ii) A person or party adversely affected by any unaffirmed action 
taken by a duty officer shall be entitled to seek review by the 
Commission of the duty officer's unaffirmed actions, but only in the 
event that the unaffirmed action by the duty officer (A) denies any 
request for action pursuant to sections 8(a) or 8(c) of the Securities 
Act of 1933, or the first sentence of section 12(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934; (B) suspends trading in a security pursuant to 
section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (C) is pursuant 
to any provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in a case of 
adjudication, as defined in section 551 of Title 5, U.S. Code, not 
required by that Act to be determined on the record after notice and 
opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter 
described in section 554(a) (1) through (6) of Title 5, United States 
Code).
    (3) Affirmed or unaffirmed action taken by the duty officer shall be 
deemed to be, for all purposes, the action of the Commission unless and 
until the Commission directs otherwise. Rules 430 and 431 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice, Sec. Sec. 201.430 and 201.431 of this 
chapter, shall not apply to duty officer action.

<R05>
Sec. 200.50  Authority.

    The Canons of Ethics for Members of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission were approved by the Commission on July 22, 1958.


<R05>
Sec. 200.51  Policy.

    It is characteristic of the administrative process that the Members 
of the Commission and their place in public opinion are affected by the 
advice and conduct of the staff, particularly the professional and 
executive employees. It shall be the policy of the Commission to require 
that employees bear in mind the principles specified in the Canons.


<R05>
Sec. 200.52  Copies of the Canons.

    The Canons have been distributed to employees of the Commission. In 
addition, executive and professional employees are issued copies of the 
Canons upon entrance on duty.


<R05>
Sec. 200.53  Preamble.

    (a) Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission are entrusted 
by various enactments of the Congress with powers and duties of great 
social and economic significance to the American people. It is their 
task to regulate varied aspects of the American economy, within the 
limits prescribed by Congress, to insure that our private enterprise 
system serves the welfare of all citizens. Their success in this 
endeavor is a bulwark against possible abuses and injustice which, if 
left unchecked, might jeopardize the strength of our economic 
institutions.
    (b) It is imperative that the members of this Commission continue to 
conduct themselves in their official and personal relationships in a 
manner which commands the respect and confidence of their fellow 
citizens. Members of this Commission shall continue to be mindful of, 
and strictly abide by, the standards of personal conduct set forth in 
its regulation regarding Conduct of Members and Employees and Former 
Members and Employees of the Commission, which is set forth in subpart M 
of this part 200, most of which has been in effect for many years, and 
which was originally codified in 1953.
    (c) However, in addition to the continued observance of those 
principles of personal conduct, it is fitting and proper for the members 
of the Commission to restate and resubscribe to the standards of conduct 
applicable to its executive, legislative and judicial responsibilities.

[25 FR 6725, July 15, 1960, as amended at 31 FR 13533, Oct. 20, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 200.54  Constitutional obligations.

    The members of this Commission have undertaken in their oaths of 
office to support the Federal Constitution. Insofar as the enactments of 
the Congress impose executive duties upon the members, they must 
faithfully execute the laws which they are charged with administering. 
Members shall also carefully guard against any infringement of the 
constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities of those who are 
subject to regulation by this Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.55  Statutory obligations.

    In administering the law, members of this Commission should 
vigorously enforce compliance with the law by all persons affected 
thereby. In the exercise of the rulemaking powers delegated this 
Commission by the Congress, members should always be concerned that the 
rulemaking power be confined to the proper limits of the law and be 
consistent with the statutory purposes expressed by the Congress. In the 
exercise of their judicial functions, members shall honestly, fairly and 
impartially determine the rights of all persons under the law.


<R05>
Sec. 200.56  Personal conduct.

    Appointment to the office of member of this Commission is a high 
honor and requires that the conduct of a member, not only in the 
performance of the duties of his office but also in his everyday life, 
should be beyond reproach.

[[Page 54]]


<R05>
Sec. 200.57  Relationships with other members.

    Each member should recognize that his conscience and those of other 
members are distinct entities and that differing shades of opinion 
should be anticipated. The free expression of opinion is a safeguard 
against the domination of this Commission by less than a majority, and 
is a keystone of the commission type of administration. However, a 
member should never permit his personal opinion so to conflict with the 
opinion of another member as to develop animosity or unfriendliness in 
the Commission, and every effort should be made to promote solidarity of 
conclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 200.58  Maintenance of independence.

    This Commission has been established to administer laws enacted by 
the Congress. Its members are appointed by the President by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate to serve terms as provided by law. 
However, under the law, this is an independent Agency, and in performing 
their duties, members should exhibit a spirit of firm independence and 
reject any effort by representatives of the executive or legislative 
branches of the government to affect their independent determination of 
any matter being considered by this Commission. A member should not be 
swayed by partisan demands, public clamor or considerations of personal 
popularity or notoriety; so also he should be above fear of unjust 
criticism by anyone.


<R05>
Sec. 200.59  Relationship with persons subject to regulation.

    In all matters before him, a member should administer the law 
without regard to any personality involved, and with regard only to the 
issues. Members should not become indebted in any way to persons who are 
or may become subject to their jurisdiction. No member should accept 
loans, presents or favors of undue value from persons who are regulated 
or who represent those who are regulated. In performing their judicial 
functions, members should avoid discussion of a matter with any person 
outside this Commission and its staff while that matter is pending. In 
the performance of his rule-making and administrative functions, a 
member has a duty to solicit the views of interested persons. Care must 
be taken by a member in his relationship with persons within or outside 
of the Commission to separate the judicial and the rule-making functions 
and to observe the liberties of discussion respectively appropriate. 
Insofar as it is consistent with the dignity of his official position, 
he should maintain contact with the persons outside the agency who may 
be affected by his rule-making functions, but he should not accept 
unreasonable or lavish hospitality in so doing.


<R05>
Sec. 200.60  Qualification to participate in particular matters.

    The question in a particular matter rests with that individual 
member. Each member should weigh carefully the question of his 
qualification with respect to any matter wherein he or any relatives or 
former business associates or clients are involved. He should disqualify 
himself in the event he obtained knowledge prior to becoming a member of 
the facts at issue before him in a quasi-judicial proceeding, or in 
other types of proceeding in any matter involving parties in whom he has 
any interest or relationship directly or indirectly. If an interested 
person suggests that a member should disqualify himself in a particular 
matter because of bias or prejudice, the member shall be the judge of 
his own qualification.


<R05>
Sec. 200.61  Impressions of influence.

    A member should not, by his conduct, permit the impression to 
prevail that any person can improperly influence him, that any person 
unduly enjoys his favor or that he is affected in any way by the rank, 
position, prestige, or affluence of any person.


<R05>
Sec. 200.62  Ex parte communications.

    All proceedings required to be determined by the Commission on the 
record shall be determined by the members solely upon the record and the 
arguments of the parties or their counsel properly made in the regular 
course of such proceeding. A member shall at all times comply with the

[[Page 55]]

Commission's Code of Behavior governing ex parte communications between 
persons outside the Commission and decisional employees, Sec. 200.110 
et seq.

[28 FR 4446, May 3, 1963]


<R05>
Sec. 200.63  Commission opinions.

    The opinions of the Commission should state the reasons for the 
action taken and contain a clear showing that no serious argument of 
counsel has been disregarded or overlooked. In such manner, a member 
shows a full understanding of the matter before him, avoids the 
suspicion of arbitrary conclusion, promotes confidence in his 
intellectual integrity and may contribute some useful precedent to the 
growth of the law. A member should be guided in his decisions by a deep 
regard for the integrity of the system of law which he administers. He 
should recall that he is not a repository of arbitrary power, but is 
acting on behalf of the public under the sanction of the law.


<R05>
Sec. 200.64  Judicial review.

    The Congress has provided for review by the courts of the decisions 
and orders by this Commission. Members should recognize that their 
obligation to preserve the sanctity of the laws administered by them 
requires that they pursue and prosecute, vigorously and diligently but 
at the same time fairly and impartially and with dignity, all matters 
which they or others take to the courts for judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 200.65  Legislative proposals.

    Members must recognize that the changing conditions in a volatile 
economy may require that they bring to the attention of the Congress 
proposals to amend, modify or repeal the laws administered by them. They 
should urge the Congress, whenever necessary, to effect such amendment, 
modification or repeal of particular parts of the statutes which they 
administer. In any action a member's motivation should be the common 
weal and not the particular interests of any particular group.


<R05>
Sec. 200.66  Investigations.

    The power to investigate carries with it the power to defame and 
destroy. In determining to exercise their investigatory power, members 
should concern themselves only with the facts known to them and the 
reasonable inferences from those facts. A member should never suggest, 
vote for, or participate in an investigation aimed at a particular 
individual for reasons of animus, prejudice or vindictiveness. The 
requirements of the particular case alone should induce the exercise of 
the investigatory power, and no public pronouncement of the pendency of 
such an investigation should be made in the absence of reasonable 
evidence that the law has been violated and that the public welfare 
demand it.


<R05>
Sec. 200.67  Power to adopt rules.

    In exercising its rule-making power, this Commission performs a 
legislative function. The delegation of this power by the Congress 
imposes the obligation upon the members to adopt rules necessary to 
effectuate the stated policies of the statute in the interest of all of 
the people. Care should be taken to avoid the adoption of rules which 
seek to extend the power of the Commission beyond proper statutory 
limits. Its rules should never tend to stifle or discourage legitimate 
business enterprises or activities, nor should they be interpreted so as 
unduly and unnecessarily to burden those regulated with onerous 
obligations. On the other hand, the very statutory enactments evidence 
the need for regulation, and the necessary rules should be adopted or 
modifications made or rules should be repealed as changing requirements 
demand without fear or favor.


<R05>
Sec. 200.68  Promptness.

    Each member should promptly perform the duties with which he is 
charged by the statutes. The Commission should evaluate continuously its 
practices and procedures to assure that it promptly disposes of all 
matters affecting the rights of those regulated. This is particularly 
desirable in quasi-judicial proceedings. While avoiding arbitrary action 
in unreasonably or unjustly forcing matters to trial, members should 
endeavor to hold counsel to

[[Page 56]]

a proper appreciation of their duties to the public, their clients and 
others who are interested. Requests for continuances of matters should 
be determined in a manner consistent with this policy.


<R05>
Sec. 200.69  Conduct toward parties and their counsel.

    Members should be temperate, attentive, patient and impartial when 
hearing the arguments of parties or their counsel. Members should not 
condone unprofessional conduct by attorneys in their representation of 
parties. The Commission should continuously assure that its staff 
follows the same principles in their relationships with parties and 
counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 200.70  Business promotions.

    A member must not engage in any other business, employment or 
vocation while in office, nor may he ever use the power of his office or 
the influence of his name to promote the business interests of others.


<R05>
Sec. 200.71  Fiduciary relationships.

    A member should avoid service as a fiduciary if it would interfere 
or seem to interfere with the proper performance of his duties, or if 
the interests of those represented require investments in enterprises 
which are involved in questions to be determined by him. Such 
relationships would include trustees, executors, corporate directors, 
and the like.


<R05>
Sec. 200.72  Supervision of internal organization.

    Members and particularly the Chairman of the Commission should 
scrutinize continuously its internal organization in order to assure 
that such organization handles all matters before it efficiently and 
expeditiously, while recognizing that changing times bring changing 
emphasis in the administration of the laws.

    (vi) Copies and a general index of all records which have been

    (3) Records created on or after November 1, 1996, which are required 
to be available for public inspection and copying under paragraph (a)(2)

privacy, identifying details may be deleted from materials made public 
as set forth in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3), of this section, e.g., 
apparently defamatory statements made about any person, information 
received by or given to the Commission in confidence, or any contents of 
personnel and medical and similar files. In addition, certain materials 
which are considered to be nonpublic, as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section may, as authorized by the Commission from time to time, be 
made available for public inspection and copying in an abridged or

reasonably segregable portions of records, the Commission will generally 
not publish or make available to any person matters that are:
    (1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an

the Commission or any other agency, including, but not limited to:

reward of any Commission employee or member, the existence, 
investigation, or disposition of a complaint against any Commission 
employee or member, the physical or mental condition of any Commission 
employee or member, the handling of strictly internal matters, matters 
which would tend to infringe on the privacy of the staff or members of 
the Commission, or similar subjects.
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552): Provided, That such statute (i) requires that the matters 
be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion 
on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or 
refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.
    (4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, including, but 
not limited to:

Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.17a-5(b)(3)), statements filed pursuant to Rule 
17a-5(k)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.17a-5(k)(1)),

the Securities Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.17a-10 and 240.17a-12); and
    (iii) Information contained in reports, summaries, analyses, 
letters, or memoranda arising out of, in anticipation of or in 
connection with an examination or inspection of the books and records of 
any person or any other investigation.
    (5) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters, including 
generally records which reflect discussions between or consideration by 
members of the Commission or members of its staff, or both, of any 
action taken or proposed to be taken by the Commission or by any member 
of its staff, and specifically, reports, summaries, analyses, 
conclusions, or any other work product of members of the Commission or 
of attorneys, accountants, analysts, or other members of the 
Commission's staff, prepared in the course of an inspection of the books 
or records of any person whose affairs are regulated by the Commission, 
or prepared otherwise in the course of an examination or investigation 
or related litigation conducted by or on behalf of the Commission, 
except those which by law would routinely be made available to a party 
other than an agency in litigation with the Commission.
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, including those concerning all employees of the

Commission and those concerning persons subject to regulation by the 
Commission.
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to 
the extent that the production of such records or information:

activities undertaken or likely to be undertaken by the Commission or 
the Department of Justice, or any United States Attorney, or any 
Federal, state, local, foreign governmental authority or foreign 
securities authority, any professional association, or any securities 
industry self-regulatory organization;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source including a state, local or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques or procedures or would disclose 
guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such 
disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the 
law; or
    (vi) Could be reasonably expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (8) Contained in, or related to, any examination, operating, or 
condition report prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, the

    (c)(1) Public reference facility. In order to disseminate records, 
including those listed in appendix A to this section, the Commission has 
a specially staffed and equipped public reference room located at 100 F 
Street, NE., Washington, DC. Copying machines, which are available to 
requestors on a self-service or contractor-operated basis, can be used 
to make immediate copies up to 8\1/2\ by 11 inches in size of materials 
that are available for inspection in the Washington, DC Headquarters. 
Fees and levels of service are set out in the Commission's schedule of 
fees in appendix E to this section and in information available from the 
public reference room. The Commission accepts only written requests for 
copies of documents.
    (i) The public reference room in Washington, DC has available for 
public inspection all of the publicly available records of the 
Commission as described in paragraph (a) of this section. Upon request, 
and only when suitable arrangements can be made with respect to the 
transportation, storage, and inspection of records, records may be sent 
to any other Commission office for inspection at that office, if the 
records are not needed by the Commission or the staff in connection with 
the performance of official duties. When the records are sent to another 
office at the request of a member of the public, the requestor shall be 
charged all costs incurred by the Commission in transporting the 
records.
    (ii) All regional offices of the Commission have available for 
public examination the materials set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this

to records available through the Commission's public reference facility 
may be made in person from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., E.T., at this facility or 
by mail directed to the Public Reference Branch, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Washington, DC 20549. In addition, access to agency records 
not available in the public reference facility may be requested pursuant 
to the Freedom of Information Act. Such requests must be in writing, 
should be clearly and prominently identified by a legend on the first 
page, such as ``Freedom of Information Act Request'', and should be 
addressed to the Freedom of Information Act Officer, SEC, 100 F Street, 
NE., Washington, DC 20549. The request may also be made by facsimile 
(202-772-9337) or by Internet (foia/pa@sec.gov).
    (2) Requests for copies of records. Requests for copies of 
Commission records available through the Commission's public reference 
facility, including those listed in appendix A to this section, may be 
made directly to the facility either in person or by mail addressed to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Reference Branch, 
Washington, DC 20549. Levels of service and charges for copies are set 
out in the Commission's schedule of fees in appendix E to this section. 
Requests for copies of materials to which access has been granted 
pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request will be processed 
pursuant to regulations found in this section in paragraphs (e)(9) and 
(e)(10) and at charges set out in appendix E to this section.
    (3) Description of requested records. Each request for Commission 
records or copies thereof shall reasonably describe the records sought 
with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates and subject 
matter to permit the records to be located among the records maintained 
by or for the Commission. A person who has requested Commission records 
or copies thereof will be promptly advised if the records cannot be 
located on the basis of the description given and that further 
identifying information must be provided before his request can be 
satisfied.
    (4) Normal availability. Records maintained in the Commission's 
public reference facility or copies thereof will normally be made 
available in keeping with levels of service and fees set out in appendix 
E to this section. Records requested pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act will be made available as described in paragraphs (e)(9) 
and (e)(10) of this section.
    (5) Initial determination; multi-track processing, and denials--(i) 
Time within

[[Page 61]]

which to respond. When a request complies with the procedures in this 
section for requesting records under the Freedom of Information Act, a 
response shall be sent within 20 business days from the date the Office 
of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations receives the 
request, except as described in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii) and (d)(5)(iii) of 
this section. If that Office has identified the requested records, the 
response shall state that the records are being withheld, in whole or in 
part, under a specific exemption or are being released.
    (ii) Voluminous records. The amount of separate and distinct records 
which are demanded in a single request or the amount of time or work (or 
both) involved may be such that the review of the records cannot be 
completed within 20 business days, as prescribed in paragraph (d)(5)(i) 
of this section. In such a case, the Office of Freedom of Information 
and Privacy Act Operations shall inform the requester of the approximate 
volume of the records and give him or her the option of limiting the 
scope of the request to qualify for 20-day processing or placing the 
request in the Commission's first-in, first-out (FIFO) system for 
reviewing voluminous records. In the latter case, the Office will inform 
the requester of the approximate time when the review will start. The 
FIFO system allows the Commission to serve all those requesting 
voluminous records on a first-come, first-served basis, such that all 
releasable records sought will be released at one time, unless the 
requester specifically requests that releasable records be released 
piecemeal as they are processed.
    (iii) Expedited processing. The Office of Freedom of Information and 
Privacy Act Operations shall grant a request for expedited processing if 
the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the records. 
``Compelling need'' means that a failure to obtain the requested records 
on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent 
threat to an individual's life or physical safety or, if the requester 
is primarily engaged in disseminating information, an urgency to inform 
the public of actual or alleged Federal government activity. A 
compelling need shall be demonstrated by a statement, certified to be 
true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. 
The Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations shall 
notify the requester of the decision to grant or deny the request for 
expedited treatment within ten business days of the date of the request. 
A request for records that has been granted expedited processing shall 
be processed as soon as practicable.
    (iv) Notice of denial. Any notification of denial of any request for 
records shall state the name and title or position of the person 
responsible for the denial of the request, the reason for the decision, 
and the right of the requester to appeal to the General Counsel. The 
decision shall estimate the volume of records that are being withheld in 
their entirety, unless giving such an estimate would harm an interest 
protected by the applicable exemption. The amount of information 
redacted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record and, 
if technically feasible, at the place where the redaction is made.
    (v) Form of releasable records. Releasable records shall be made 
available in any form or format requested if they are readily 
reproducible in that form or format.
    (6) Administrative review. Any person who has received no response 
to a request within the period prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section or within an extended period permitted under paragraph (d)(7) of 
this section, or whose request has been denied under paragraph (d)(5) of 
this section, may appeal the adverse decision or failure to respond to 
the General Counsel.
    (i) The appeal shall be in writing, shall be clearly and prominently 
identified on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first 
page by a legend such as ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal,'' and 
shall identify the record in the form in which it was originally 
requested.
    (ii) The appeal must be mailed to the Office of Freedom of 
Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., 
Washington, DC 20549, and a copy of it must be mailed to the General 
Counsel, Securities and Exchange

[[Page 62]]

Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549.
    (iii) The appeal may include such facts and cite such legal or other 
authorities as the person submitting the appeal may consider 
appropriate.
    (iv) The General Counsel shall have the authority to grant or deny 
all appeals, in whole or in part, and to release as an exercise of 
discretion records exempt from mandatory disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552(b). In appropriate cases he or she may, in his or her sole and 
unfettered discretion, refer appeals to the Commission for 
determination.
    (v) A determination with respect to any appeal shall be made within 
twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) 
after the receipt of such appeal or within such extended period as may 
be permitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (vi) A denial of an appeal in whole or in part shall set forth the 
basis for the denial, and shall advise the requester that judicial 
review of the decision is available in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4).
    (7) Extension of time to consider requests and to consider 
administrative appeals. In unusual circumstances, as specified in this 
paragraph, the time limits prescribed in either paragraphs (d) (5) or 
(6) of this section may be extended by written notice to the person 
making a request for a record or a copy, setting forth the unusual 
circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination 
is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that 
would result in an extension for more than ten business days, except as 
provided in paragraph (d)(8) of this section. As used in this paragraph, 
``unusual circumstances'' means, but only to the extent reasonably 
necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:
    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request. (Many records of the Commission are 
stored in Federal Records Centers in accordance with law--including many 
of the documents which have been on file with the Commission for more 
than 2 years--and cannot be made available for several days after a 
request has been made. Other records may temporarily be located at a 
regional office of the Commission. Any person who has requested for 
personal examination a record stored at the Federal Records Center or 
temporarily located in a regional office of the Commission will be 
notified when and where the record will be made available to him. Any 
person who has ordered a copy of such record will be provided with a 
copy as soon as practicable). Some records have been disposed of in 
accordance with the Commission's Records Control Schedule (17 CFR 
200.80(f)).
    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request. (While every reasonable effort will be made fully to 
comply with each request as promptly as possible on a first-come, first-
served basis, work done to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
records in response to a request for a large number of records will be 
contingent upon the availability of processing personnel in accordance 
with an equitable allocation of time to all members of the public who 
have requested or wish to request records.)
    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components within 
the Commission having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
    (8) Inability to meet time limits. If a request for records cannot 
be processed within the time prescribed under paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section, the Commission shall so notify and give the requester an 
opportunity to modify the request so that it may be processed within 
that time or to arrange an alternative time for processing the request 
or a modified request.
    (i) Records in use for another member of the public. Any record 
being inspected by or copied for another member of the public will be 
made available as soon as practicable.

[[Page 63]]

    (ii) Records in use by a member of the Commission or its staff. 
Although every effort will be made to make a record in use by a member 
of the Commission or its staff available when requested, it may 
occasionally be necessary to delay making such a record available when 
doing so at the time the request is made would seriously interfere with 
the work of the Commission or its staff.
    (iii) Missing or lost records. Any person who has requested a record 
or copy will be notified if the record sought cannot be found. If he so 
requests, he will be notified if it should subsequently be located.
    (9) Misdirected written requests. The Commission cannot assure that 
a timely or satisfactory response will be given to written requests for 
inspection or copies of records that are directed to the Commission 
other than in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of 
this section. Any staff member who receives a written request for 
records should promptly forward the request to the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer. Misdirected requests for records will be 
considered to have been received for purposes of paragraph (d) of this 
section only when they have been actually received by the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer. The Commission will not entertain any appeal 
from an alleged denial or failure to comply with a misdirected request, 
unless it is clearly shown that the request was in fact received by the 
Freedom of Information Act Officer.
    (e) Fees for records services. A current schedule of fees for record 
services, including locating, reviewing, and making records available, 
attestations and copying, appears in appendix E to this subpart D, 17 
CFR 200.80e. Copies of the current schedule of fees may also be obtained 
upon request made in person, by telephone or by mail from the public 
reference room or at any regional office of the Commission.
    (1) Services provided without charge. Generally, up to one-half hour 
of staff time devoted to searching for and reviewing Commission records 
will be provided without charge. Where a request for records pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act is determined not to serve a commercial 
purpose as defined in paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section, a total of 
two staff hours of search and review and one hundred pages of 
duplication as defined in paragraphs (e)(9)(i), (e)(9)(ii) and 
(e)(9)(iii) of this section, respectively, shall be made available 
without charge in the form most economical for the government.
    (2) Services for which fees are charged. For records available 
through the Commission's public reference facility, requestors may make 
arrangements for duplication in accordance with provisions of the 
Commission's dissemination contract. Copies of that contract, which 
contain tables of charges, may be inspected in the public reference 
room, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC. A complete schedule of services 
offered by the contractor and fees charged for those services is 
available through the Commission's public reference facility. Fees for 
services provided in connection with requests made pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act shall be assessed as set out in appendix E to 
this section and in keeping with guidelines and procedures described in 
paragraphs (e)(9) and (e)(10) of this section.
    (3) Requests requiring large expenditures. A request for Commission 
records may state that the requesting person is willing to pay fees up 
to a stated limit for services to be provided in locating, reviewing and 
making available requested records. In such circumstances, no work will 
be done that will result in fees beyond the stated limit without further 
written authorization. If no limit is initially stated by the person 
requesting records or copies, services in locating and making available 
the requested records will not be done so as to exceed fees of $28 
(exclusive of applicable copying charges) without the express written 
authorization by the requesting person, and he will be so informed.
    (4) Waiver or reduction of fees. (i) The Office of Freedom of 
Information and Privacy Act Operations may waive or reduce search, 
review, and duplication fees if:
    (A) Disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest 
because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding 
of the

[[Page 64]]

operations or activities of the government; and
    (B) Disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester.
    (ii) The Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations 
will determine whether disclosure is likely to contribute significantly 
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the 
government based upon four factors:
    (A) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the 
operations and activities of the Federal government;
    (B) Whether the requested records are meaningfully informative on 
those operations or activities so that their disclosure would likely 
contribute to increased public understanding of specific operations or 
activities of the government;
    (C) Whether disclosure will contribute to the understanding of the 
public at large, rather than the understanding of the requester or a 
narrow segment of interested persons; and
    (D) Whether disclosure would contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the governmental operations or activities.
    (iii) The Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act 
Operations will determine whether disclosure of the requested records is 
not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester based upon two 
factors:
    (A) Whether disclosure would further any commercial interests of the 
requester; and
    (B) Whether the public interest in disclosure is greater than the 
requester's commercial interest.
    (iv) If only a portion of the requested records satisfies both the 
requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction of 
fees will be granted for only that portion.
    (v) A request for a waiver or reduction of fees may be a part of a 
request for records. Such requests should address all the factors 
identified in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (e)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (vi) Denials of requests for a waiver or reduction of fees may be 
appealed to the General Counsel in accordance with the procedure set 
forth in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
    (5) Records obtained from Federal Records Centers. When, to fill a 
request for inspection or copying, records are required to be obtained 
from a Federal Records Center, fees, in addition to those provided on 
the Commission's current schedule of fees, will be charged to the extent 
authorized or required by rules or regulations promulgated by the 
National Archives and Records Administration.
    (6) Attestations. In addition to any other fees or charges which may 
apply, a fee will be charged for records attestations as provided in the 
Commission's current schedule of fees. The seal of the Commission will 
be affixed to all attestations without additional charge.
    (7) Copying services. Copies of records filed with or retained by 
the Commission, or portions thereof, will be provided subject to fees 
established by agreement between the Commission and a private contractor 
as set forth in the Commission's current schedule of fees and, where 
applicable, procedures and guidelines for Freedom of Information Act 
requests as set out in paragraphs (e)(9) and (e)(10) of this section.
    (i) Facsimile copies. Requests for facsimile copies may be made 
either in person at the Commission's Washington, DC public reference 
room, or by mail addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Public Reference Room, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549. The 
contractor will send copies directly to the purchaser unless attestation 
is requested. Persons who request copies of documents through the public 
reference room will be billed by the contractor at regulated prices, and 
will be billed separately by the Commission for search, review and 
attestation charges, if any. Copies of documents requested directly from 
the contractor or from any other information service or vendor are not 
subject to regulated prices. Special classes of copying services, such 
as telecopies, not listed herein or in the current schedule of fees 
posted in the public reference room, are not provided or regulated by 
the Commission, but may be obtained from private vendors at market 
prices.
    (ii) Microfiche copies. A contractor also makes available to the 
public

[[Page 65]]

microfiche copies of certain public documents on file with the 
Commission, at prices and on terms governed by its contract with the 
Commission. Microfiche services include subscription microfiche service 
on an annual basis. Microfiche subscription prices are regulated by the 
Commission whether requested through the public reference room or 
directly from the contractor. Certain other microfiche services are 
provided at prices that are regulated by the Commission only if ordered 
through the Commission's public reference room. The Commission will 
accept only subscription requests made in writing, although the 
contractor may elect to accept subscription requests by telephone. All 
microfiche subscription charges are payable directly to the contractor, 
whether placed through the Commission or not. Information concerning the 
types and cost of regulated microfiche services may be obtained by 
writing to the Commission at its public reference room located at 100 F 
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549.
    (iii) Transcripts of public hearings. Copies of the transcripts of 
recent public hearings may be obtained from the reporter subject to the 
fees established annually by contract between the Commission and the 
reporter. Copies of that contract, which contains tables of charges, may 
be inspected in the public reference room, 100 F Street, NE., 
Washington, DC and in each regional office. Copies of other public 
transcripts may be obtained, in the manner of other Commission records, 
subject to the charges referred to in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this 
section.
    (8) Releases and publications. (i) The Commission's decisions, 
reports, orders, rules and regulations are published initially in the 
form of releases and distributed.
    (ii) The Commission publishes daily the SEC News Digest, which 
summarizes the releases published by the Commission each day, contains 
Commission announcements, and lists certain filings with the Commission. 
The Commission publishes weekly the SEC Docket, which prints the full 
text of every Commission release.
    (iii) The Commission publishes an annual report to the Congress 
which sets forth the results of the Commission's operations during the 
past fiscal year under the various statutes committed to its charge. 
Copies may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (iv) The Commission also makes other information in the fields of 
securities and finance, including economic studies, available to the 
public through the issuance of releases on specific subject matters.
    (v) A classification of the releases available from the Commission 
appears below as appendix B to this section. Other publications 
available from the Commission are set forth in appendix C to this 
section. Copies of rules, regulations, and miscellaneous publications 
set forth in appendix D to this section may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20402.
    (9) Fees for services required for processing Freedom of Information 
Act Requests. In cases where records are requested pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act and according to procedures set forth in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, fees shall be charged as set out in 
the Commission's current schedule of fees, appendix E to this section, 
for services as described in the following:
    (i) Search. The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for 
material manually or by using electronic data processing equipment that 
is responsive to a request, as distinguished from ``review'' as defined 
at paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section. Searching for requested and 
specifically identified information, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, includes the cost of staff time devoted to the search as 
indicated in appendix E to this section and direct costs for use of 
Commission electronic data processing equipment.
    (ii) Review. The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining 
documents located in response to a request to determine whether any 
portion of any document is permitted to be withheld pursuant to 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. It also includes 
processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is 
necessary to

[[Page 66]]

excise material from and otherwise prepare them for release.
    (iii) Duplication. The term ``duplication'' refers to producing 
paper or microform copies of records. The Commission shall charge for 
duplication as established by agreement between the Commission and a 
private contractor. These charges are currently set out in appendix E to 
this section. Such charges shall be set so as not to exceed the direct 
cost that would be incurred by the Commission if it were to perform such 
services itself, as calculated to include the salary of operators, the 
cost of reproduction machinery, the cost of material and any other 
direct costs incurred by the Commission in copying materials responsive 
to a Freedom of Information Act request.
    (iv) Partial exemption from fee provisions. No fees shall be charged 
for the first two hours of search time and the first one hundred pages 
of materials for requesters described in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) and 
(e)(10)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Minimum fee. Fees will not be charged if the normal cost of 
collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.
    (10) Classification of Freedom of Information Act requesters for 
purposes of assessing fees. Parties requesting records pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act will be classified and charged fees described 
in appendix E to this section as follows:
    (i) The following types of requesters shall be charged for 
duplication of records as described in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this 
section as qualified in paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section: 
Educational institutions requesting information for purposes of 
scholarly research; non-commercial scientific institutions requesting 
information for purposes of scientific research; and representatives of 
the news media requesting information concerning current events or 
matters of current interest to the general public.
    (ii) Commercial requesters, defined as parties other than those 
mentioned in paragraph (e)(10)(i) of this section who are requesting 
information to be used in any way which could reasonably be expected to 
result in corporate or personal financial gain or profit, shall be 
charged for search, review and duplication of records as described in 
paragraphs (e)(9)(i), (e)(9)(ii) and (e)(9)(iii), respectively, of this 
section.
    (iii) All parties other than those described in paragraphs 
(e)(10)(i) and (e)(10)(ii) of this section requesting access to such 
records shall be charged for search and duplication of records as 
described in paragraphs (e)(9)(i) and (e)(9)(iii) of this section, 
respectively, as qualified in paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section.
    (11) Appeal of classification. Classification under the provisions 
of paragraph (e)(10) of this section may be appealed to the General 
Counsel in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section.
    (12) Aggregation of requests. If the Freedom of Information Act 
Officer reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters 
acting in concert is attempting to divide one request into a series of 
requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, those 
requests may be aggregated and charges assessed accordingly.
    (13) Advance payment. The Freedom of Information Act Officer may 
require advance payment of fees expected to be incurred in connection 
with a request, but only when the subject requester has failed to make 
timely payment in the past, or when the estimated processing costs 
exceed $250.00 and the requester has no previous payment records or has 
failed to make timely payment in the past. Processing in such cases 
shall be delayed until advance payment is received and statutory time 
limits will be appropriately extended.
    (14) Interest on unpaid bills. On the 31st day following the date of 
a bill to a requester, the Commission may begin assessing interest on 
the unpaid amount at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of 
the U.S. Code. Interest will accrue from the date of the bill.

<R05>
Sec. 200.81  Publication of interpretative, no-action and certain exemption letters and other written communications.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
every letter or other written communication requesting the staff of the 
Commission to provide interpretative legal advice with respect to any 
statute administered by the Commission or any rule or regulation adopted 
thereunder; or requesting a statement that, on the basis of the facts 
stated in such letter or other communication, the staff would not 
recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action; or requesting 
an exemption, on the basis of the facts stated in such letter, from the 
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et 
seq.) or any rule or regulation thereunder, where the issuance of an 
order granting such exemption does not require public notice and an 
opportunity for hearing; together with any written response thereto, 
shall be made available for inspection and copying by any person as soon 
as practicable after the response has been sent or given to the person 
requesting it.
    (b) Any person submitting such letter or other written communication 
may also submit therewith a request that it be accorded confidential 
treatment for a specified period of time, not exceeding 120 days from 
the date the response, together with a statement setting forth the 
considerations upon which the request for such treatment is based. If 
the staff determines that the request is reasonable and appropriate it 
will be granted and the letter or other communication will not be made 
available for public inspection or copying until the expiration of the 
specified period. If it appears to the staff that the request for 
confidential treatment should be denied, the staff shall so advise the 
person making the request and such person may withdraw the letter or 
other communication within 30 days thereafter. In such case, no response 
will be sent or given and the letter or other communication shall remain 
in the Commission's files but will not be made public. If such letter or 
other communication is not so withdrawn, it shall be deemed to be 
available for public inspection and copying together with any written 
response thereto.

    Note: All letters or other written communications requesting 
interpretative advice, a no-action position, or an exemption shall 
indicate prominently, in a separate caption at the beginning of the 
request, each section of the Act and each rule to which the request 
relates. If more than one section or rule is involved, a separate copy 
of the request shall be submitted for each section or rule involved and 
an additional copy for the use of the staff of the Commission.

    (c) This section shall not apply, however, to letters of comment or 
other communications relating to the accuracy or adequacy of any 
registration statement, report, proxy, or information statement or other 
document filed with the Commission, or relating to the extent to which 
such statement, report, or document complies with any applicable 
requirement. Further, this section shall not apply to applications or 
other written communications filed pursuant to Sec. 240.24b-2 that 
relate to objections to public disclosure of information filed with the 
Commission or any exchange.

[35 FR 17779, Nov. 19, 1970, as amended at 53 FR 12413, Apr. 14, 1988;

Sec. 200.82  Public availability of materials filed pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-8(d) and related materials.

    Materials filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 14a-8(d) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-8(d)), written 
communications related thereto received from any person, and each 
related no-action letter or other written communication issued by the 
staff of the Commission, shall be made available to any person upon 
request for inspection or copying.

[37 FR 20558, Sept. 30, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 200.83  Confidential treatment procedures under the Freedom of Information Act.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides a procedure by which persons 
submitting information in any form to the Commission can request that 
the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom 
of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the 
Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in 
any other context. This section is procedural only and does not provide 
rights to any person or alter the rights of any person under the Freedom 
of Information Act or any other applicable statute or regulation.
    (b) Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply only where no 
other statute or Commission rule provides procedures for requesting 
confidential treatment respecting particular categories of information 
(see, e.g., 17 CFR 240.24b-2) or where the Commission has not specified 
that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a 
particular study, report, investigation, or other matter. The provisions 
of this section shall not apply to any record which is contained in or 
is part of a personnel, medical or similar file relating to a Commission 
member or employee which would normally be exempt from disclosure 
pursuant to section 552(b)(6) of title 5, U.S. Code.
    (c) Written request for confidential treatment to be submitted with 
information. (1) Any person who, either voluntarily or pursuant to any 
requirement of law, submits any information or causes or permits any 
information to be submitted to the Commission, which information is 
entitled to confidential treatment and for which no other specific 
procedure exists for according confidential treatment, may request that 
the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of 
Information Act to such information for reasons of personal privacy or 
business confidentiality, or for any other reason permitted by Federal 
law, and should take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure, as nearly 
as practicable, that at the time the information is first received by 
the Commission (i) it is supplied segregated from information for which 
confidential treatment is not being requested, (ii) it is appropriately 
marked as confidential, and (iii) it is accompanied by a written request 
for confidential treatment which specifies the information as to which 
confidential treatment is requested.
    (2) A person who submits a record to the Commission for which he or 
she seeks confidential treatment must clearly mark each page or 
segregable portion of each page with the words ``Confidential Treatment 
Requested by [name]'' and an identifying number and code, such as a 
Bates-stamped number. In his or her written confidential treatment 
request, the person must refer to the record by identifying number and 
code.
    (3) In addition to giving a copy of any written request for 
confidential treatment to the Commission employee receiving the record 
in question, the person requesting confidential treatment must send a 
copy of the request (but not the record) by mail to the Office of 
Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, 
NE., Washington, DC 20549. The legend ``FOIA Confidential Treatment 
Request'' must clearly and prominently appear on the top of the first 
page of the written request, and the written request must contain the 
name, address, and telephone number of the person requesting 
confidential treatment. The person requesting confidential treatment is 
responsible for informing the Office of Freedom of Information and 
Privacy Act Operations promptly of any changes in address, telephone 
number, or representation.
    (4) In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in 
the

[[Page 78]]

course of a Commission investigation or providing a record requested in 
the course of a Commission examination or inspection, it may be 
impracticable to submit a written request for confidential treatment at 
the time the record is first given to the Commission. In no 
circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this 
section justify or excuse any delay in submitting any record to the 
Commission. The person testifying or otherwise submitting the record 
must inform the Commission employee receiving it, at the time the record 
is submitted or as soon thereafter as possible, that he or she is 
requesting confidential treatment. The person must then submit a written 
confidential treatment request within 30 days from the date of the 
testimony or the submission of the record. Any confidential treatment 
request submitted under this paragraph must also comply with paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (5) Where confidential treatment is requested by the submitter on 
behalf of another person, the request must identify that person and 
provide the telephone number and address of that person or the person's 
responsible representative if the submitter would be unable to provide 
prompt substantiation of the request at the appropriate time.
    (6) No determination on a request for confidential treatment will be 
made until the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act 
Operations receives a request for disclosure of the record.
    (7) A confidential treatment request will expire ten years from the 
date the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations 
receives it, unless that Office receives a renewal request before the 
confidential treatment request expires. The renewal request must be sent 
by mail to the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act 
Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, and must 
clearly identify the record for which confidential treatment is sought. 
A renewal request will likewise expire ten years from the date that 
Office receives it, unless that Office receives another timely renewal 
request which complies with the requirements of this paragraph.
    (8) A confidential treatment request shall be nonpublic. If an 
action is filed in a Federal court, however, by either the Freedom of 
Information requester (under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) and Sec. 200.80(d)(6)) 
or by the confidential treatment requester (under paragraph (e)(5) of 
this section), the confidential treatment request may become part of the 
court record.
    (d) Substantiation of request for confidential treatment. (1) If it 
is determined that records which are the subject of a request for access 
under the Freedom of Information Act are also the subject of a request 
for confidential treatment under this rule and no other grounds appear 
to exist which would justify the withholding of the records [e.g., 
Freedom of Information Act Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A)], the 
Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer promptly shall so inform 
the person requesting confidential treatment or, in the case of a 
request made on behalf of a person other than the submitter, the person 
identified as able to provide substantiation, by telephone, facsimile or 
certified mail and require that substantiation of the request for 
confidential treatment be submitted in ten calendar days. Failure to 
submit a written substantiation within ten calendar days from the time 
of notification, or any extension thereof, may be deemed a waiver of the 
confidential treatment request and the confidential treatment 
requester's right to appeal an initial decision denying confidential 
treatment to the Commission's General Counsel as permitted by paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (2) Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall 
consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or 
necessary for the determination of the request for confidential 
treatment, the following information regarding the request:
    (i) The reasons, concisely stated and referring to specific 
exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the 
information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of 
Information Act;
    (ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory 
provisions

[[Page 79]]

which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;
    (iii) The existence and applicability of any prior determinations by 
the Commission, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning 
confidential treatment of the information;
    (iv) The adverse consequences to a business enterprise, financial or 
otherwise, that would result from disclosure of confidential commercial 
or financial information, including any adverse effect on the business' 
competitive position;
    (v) The measures taken by the business to protect the 
confidentiality of the commercial or financial information in question 
and of similar information, prior to, and after, its submission to the 
Commission;
    (vi) The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling 
the commercial or financial information;
    (vii) Whether the commercial or financial information was 
voluntarily submitted to the Commission and, if so, whether and how 
disclosure of the information would tend to impede the availability of 
similar information to the Commission;
    (viii) The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation 
of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded 
confidential treatment; and
    (ix) Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as 
the requesting person may consider appropriate.
    (e) Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is 
not warranted. (1) In a preliminary decision, which shall be sent by 
mail or facsimile, or both, the Office of Freedom of Information and 
Privacy Act Operations will inform the confidential treatment requester 
whether it intends to grant confidentiality in whole or in part and give 
the requester ten calendar days from the date of the preliminary 
decision to submit supplemental arguments if the requester disagrees 
with the preliminary decision. A final decision, which shall also be 
sent by mail or facsimile, or both, no sooner than ten calendar days 
from the date of the preliminary decision, shall inform the Freedom of 
Information Act requester and the confidential treatment requester of 
his or her right to appeal an adverse decision to the Commission's 
General Counsel within ten calendar days from the date of the final 
decision. Records, which the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act 
Officer determines to be releasable, may be released to the Freedom of 
Information Act requester ten calendar days after the date of the final 
decision. However, if within those ten calendar days, the Freedom of 
Information and Privacy Act Officer receives an appeal from the 
confidential treatment requester, he or she shall inform the Freedom of 
Information Act requester that an appeal is pending and that the records 
will not be released until the appeal is resolved.
    (2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment 
shall be in writing, and shall be clearly and prominently identified on 
the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page by the 
legend ``FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.'' The appeal must be sent 
by mail to the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act 
Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, or by 
facsimile (202-772-9337). A copy of the appeal must be mailed to the 
General Counsel, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., 
Washington, DC 20549. The person requesting confidential treatment may 
supply additional substantiation of the request for confidential 
treatment in connection with the appeal to the General Counsel.
    (3) The General Counsel shall have the authority to consider all 
appeals from decisions of the Freedom of Information Act Officer with 
respect to confidential treatment. All appeals taken under this section 
will be considered by the General Counsel as expeditiously as 
circumstances permit. Although other procedures may be employed, to the 
extent possible, the General Counsel will decide the matter on the basis 
of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the 
interested persons and such other information as is brought to the 
attention of the General Counsel. The General Counsel shall also have 
the authority to enter and vacate stays under the circumstances set 
forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. In appropriate cases the 
General

[[Page 80]]

Counsel may, in his or her sole and unfettered discretion, refer appeals 
and questions concerning stays under paragraph (e)(5) of this section to 
the Commission for decision.
    (4) If it is determined that confidential treatment is not warranted 
with respect to all or any part of the information in question, the 
person requesting confidential treatment will be so informed by 
telephone, if possible, with a facsimile or certified mail letter 
directed to the person's last known address. Disclosure of the 
information under the Freedom of Information Act will occur ten calendar 
days after notice to the person requesting confidential treatment, 
subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (e) (5) of this 
section.
    (5) If within that ten calendar day period the General Counsel has 
been notified that the person requesting confidential treatment has 
commenced an action in a Federal court concerning the determination to 
make such information publicly available, the General Counsel will stay 
making the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial 
resolution of the matter. The General Counsel may vacate a stay under 
this section either on his or her own motion or at the request of a 
person seeking access to the information under the Freedom of 
Information Act. If the stay is vacated, the information will be 
released under the Freedom of Information Act ten calendar days after 
the person requesting confidential treatment is notified of this action 
by telephone, if possible, with a facsimile or certified mail letter 
sent to the person's last known address, unless the court orders 
otherwise.
    (f) Initial determination that confidential treatment is warranted. 
If it is determined by the Commission's Freedom of Information Act 
Officer that confidential treatment is warranted, the person submitting 
the information and the person requesting access to the information 
under the Freedom of Information Act will be so informed by mail. The 
person requesting access, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 
will also be informed of the right to appeal the determination to the 
General Counsel. Any such appeal must be taken in accordance with the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and Commission rules 
thereunder. See 17 CFR 200.80(d)(6).
    (g) Confidential treatment request and substantiation as nonpublic. 
Any confidential treatment request and substantiation of it shall be 
nonpublic. If an action is filed in a Federal court, however, by either 
the Freedom of Information Act requester (under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) and 
Sec. 200.80(d)(6)) or by the confidential treatment requester (under 
paragraph(e)(5) of this section), both request and substantiation may 
become part of the public court record.
    (h) Effect of no prior request for confidentiality. (1) If access is 
requested under the Freedom of Information Act to information which is 
submitted to the Commission on or after October 20, 1980 with respect to 
which no request for confidential treatment has been made pursuant to 
either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(5) of this section, it will be presumed 
that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in 
asserting an exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information 
Act for reasons of personal privacy or business confidentiality, or for 
other reasons.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this section, in appropriate 
circumstances, any person who would be affected by the public disclosure 
of information under the Freedom of Information Act may be contacted by 
Commission personnel to determine whether the person desires to make a 
request for confidential treatment. Any request for confidential 
treatment that is asserted in response to such inquiry shall be made in 
accordance with provisions of this section.
    (i) Extensions of time limits. Any time limit under this section may 
be extended in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's 
General Counsel, or the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer 
for good cause shown.
    (j) Electronic filings. Confidential treatment requests shall be 
submitted in paper format only, whether or not the person making the 
request is an electronic filer.
    (k) In their discretion, the Commission, the Commission's General 
Counsel, and the Freedom of Information

[[Page 81]]

Act Officer may use alternative procedures for considering requests for 
confidential treatment.

[[Page 82]]

date subsequent to the time specified herein.
    (d) Definitions. As used in this subpart:
    (1) Ex parte communication means an oral or written communication 
not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice 
to all participants to the proceeding is not given, but it shall not 
include requests for status reports on any matter or proceeding. In 
addition, an ex parte communication shall not include:
    (i) Any written communication of which copies are served by the 
communicator contemporaneously with the transmittal of the communication

<R05>
Sec. 200.112  Duties of recipient; notice to participants.

    (a) Duties of recipient. A member of the Commission or decisional 
employee who receives, or who make or knowingly causes to be made, a 
communication prohibited by this section, or who receives or makes a 
communication which he or she concludes should, in fairness, be brought 
to the attention of all participants to the proceeding, shall transmit 
to the Commission's Secretary, who shall place on the public record of 
the proceeding:
    (1) All such written communications; and
    (2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; 
and
    (3) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (a) (1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (b) Notice to participants. The Secretary shall send copies of the 
communication to all participants to the proceeding with respect to 
which it was made, and shall notify the communicator of the provisions 
of this code prohibiting ex parte communications. If the communications 
are from persons other than participants to the proceedings or their 
agents, and the Secretary determines that it would be too burdensome to 
send copies of the communications to all participants because: (1) The 
communications are so voluminous, or (2) the communications are of such 
borderline relevance to the issues of the proceedings, or (3) the 
participants to the proceeding are so numerous, the Secretary may, 
instead, notify the participants that the communications have been 
received, placed in the file, and are available for examination.
    (c) Post decisional communications. Any Commission member or 
decisional employee who receives a communication which would be 
prohibited by this Code, but for the fact that it was received 
subsequent to the date when the prohibitions imposed hereby have ceased 
to apply, shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 200.112(a) with 
respect to such communication in the event that he or she is to act in a 
decisional capacity in the same proceeding pursuant to remand where he 
or she concludes,

[[Page 83]]

in fairness, that such communication should be brought to the attention 
of all participants to the proceeding.

[42 FR 14691 Mar. 16, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 200.113  Opportunity to respond; interception.

    (a) Opportunity to respond. All participants to a proceeding may 
respond to any allegations or contentions contained in a prohibited ex 
parte communication placed in the public record in accordance with Sec. 
200.112. Such responses shall be included in the public record.
    (b) Interception of communications. All written communications 
addressed to the Commission respecting a proceeding will be deemed to be 
communications to the staff of the interested division and will be 
directed to that division by the Commission's mail room. A Commission 
member or decisional employee may instruct any of his assistants who are 
nondecisional employees to intercept any communication directed to him 
which might appear to violate this Code and authorize them either to 
transmit any such written communication to the staff of the interested 
division of the Commission, if it appears from the contents of the 
communication that the intent of the sender is consistent with such 
action, or to return the communication to the sender.

Sec. 200.114  Sanctions.

    (a) Discipline of persons practicing before the Commission. The 
Commission may, to the extent not prohibited by law, censure, suspend, 
or revoke the privilege to practice before it of any person who makes, 
or solicits the making of, an unauthorized ex parte communication.
    (b) Adverse action on claim. Upon receipt of a communication 
knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party in violation of 
this subpart, the Commission, administrative law judge, or other 
employee presiding at the hearing may, to the extent consistent with the 
interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes, require 
the party to show cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding 
should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely 
affected on account of such violation.
    (c) Discipline of Commission employees. The Commission may censure, 
suspend, or dismiss any Commission employee who violates the 
prohibitions or requirements of this Code.

    Source: 40 FR 44068, Sept. 24, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 200.301  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896, is 
based, in part, on the finding by Congress that ``in order to protect 
the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained 
by Federal agencies, it is necessary and proper for the Congress to 
regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of 
information by such agencies.'' To achieve this objective the Act, among 
other things, provides, with some exceptions, that Federal agencies 
shall advise an individual upon request whether records maintained by 
the agency in a system of records pertain to the individual and shall 
grant the individual access to such records. The Act further provides 
that individuals may request amendments or corrections to records 
pertaining to them that are maintained by the agency, and that the 
agency shall either grant the requested amendments or set forth fully 
its reasons for refusing to do so.
    (b) The Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to subsection 
(f) of the Privacy Act, adopts the following rules and procedures to 
implement the provisions of the Act summarized above, and other 
provisions of the Act. These rules and procedures are applicable to all 
requests for information, access or amendment to records pertaining to 
an individual that are contained in any system of records that is 
maintained by the Commission.

[[Page 86]]


<R05>
Sec. 200.302  Definitions.

    The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this subpart:
    (a) The terms individual, maintain, record, system of records, and 
routine use are defined for purposes of these rules as they are defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6).
    (b) Commission means the Securities and Exchange Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.303  Times, places and requirements for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system and for the identification of individuals making 
          requests for access to the records pertaining to them.

    (a) Place to make request. Any request by an individual to be 
advised whether any system of records maintained by the Commission and 
named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him or her, or 
any request by an individual for access to a record pertaining to him or 
her that is contained in a system of records maintained by the 
Commission, shall be submitted by mail to the Office of Freedom of 
Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., 
Washington, DC 20549, or by facsimile (202-772-9337). All requests will 
be required to be put in writing and signed by the individual making the 
request. In the case of requests for access that are made by mail, the 
envelope should be clearly marked ``Privacy Act Request.''
    (1) Information to be included in requests. Each request by an 
individual concerning whether the Commission maintains in a system of 
records a record that pertains to him, or for access to any record 
pertaining to the individual that is maintained by the Commission in a 
system of records, shall include such information as will assist the 
Commission in identifying those records as to which the individual is 
seeking information or access. Where practicable, the individual should 
identify the system of records that is the subject of his request by 
reference to the Commission's notices of systems of records, which are 
published in the Federal Register, as required by section (e)(4) of the 
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). Where a system of records is compiled 
on the basis of a specific identification scheme, the individual should 
include in his request the identification number or other identifier 
assigned to him. In the event the individual does not know the specific 
identifier assigned to him, he shall provide other information, 
including his full name, address, date of birth and subject matter of 
the record, to aid in processing his request. If additional information 
is required before a request can be processed, the individual shall be 
so advised.
    (2) Verification of identity. When the fact of the existence of a 
record is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or when a record as to which access has 
been requested is not required to be disclosed under that Act, the 
individual seeking the information or requesting access to the record 
shall be required to verify his or her identity before access will be 
granted or information given. For this purpose, individuals shall appear 
at the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 
100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, during normal business hours of 
9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. E.S.T., Monday through Friday, or at one of the

    (3) Methods for verifying identity--appearance in person. An 
individual seeking information as to records pertaining to him or access 
to those records shall furnish documentation that may reasonably be 
relied on to establish the individual's identity. Such documentation 
might include a valid birth certificate, driver's license, employee or 
military identification card, or medicare card.
    (4) Method for verifying identity by mail. Where an individual 
cannot appear at one of the Commission's Offices to verify his or her 
identity, he or she must submit, along with the request for information 
or access, a statement attesting to his or her identity. Where access is 
being sought, the statement shall include a representation that the 
requested records pertain to the individual and a statement that the 
individual is aware that knowingly and willfully requesting or obtaining 
records pertaining to an individual from the Commission under false 
pretenses is a criminal offense. This statement shall be a sworn 
statement, or in lieu of a sworn statement, an individual may submit an 
unsworn statement to the same effect if it is signed by him or her as 
true under penalty of perjury, dated, and in substantially the following 
form:
    (i) If executed outside the United States: ``I declare (or certify, 
verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United 
States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.''
    Executed on (date)--------

(Signature)
    (ii) If executed within the United States, its territories, 
possessions, or commonwealths: ``I declare (or certify, verify, or 
state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and 
correct.''
    Executed on (date)--------

(Signature)
    (5) Additional procedures for verifying identity. When it appears 
appropriate, there may be made such other arrangements for the 
verification of identity as are reasonable under the circumstances and 
appear to be effective to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access 
to, individual records.
    (b) Acknowledgement of requests for information pertaining to 
individual records in a record system or for access to individual 
records. (1) Except where an immediate acknowledgement is given for 
requests made in person, the receipt of a request for information 
pertaining to individual records in a record system will be acknowledged 
within 10 days after the receipt of such request. Requests will be 
processed as promptly as possible and a response to such requests will 
be given within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) unless, within the 30 day period and for cause shown, the 
individual making the request is notified in writing that a longer 
period is necessary.
    (2) When an individual appears in person at the Office of Freedom of 
Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., 
Washington, DC 20549, or at one of its Regional Offices to request 
access to records pertaining to him, and such individual provides the 
required information and verification of identity, the Commission's 
staff, if practicable, will indicate at that time whether it is likely 
that the individual will be given access to the records and, if so, when 
and under what circumstances such access will be given. In the case of 
requests received by mail, whenever practicable, acknowledgement of the 
receipt of the request will be given within 10 days after receipt 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays). The acknowledgement 
will indicate, if practicable, whether or not access likely will be

[[Page 88]]

granted and, if so, when and under what circumstances.

Sec. 200.304  Disclosure of requested records.

    (a) Initial review. Requests by individuals for access to records 
pertaining to them will be referred to the Commission's Privacy Act 
Officer who initially will determine whether access will be granted, 
Provided, however, That a Director of a staff Division of the Commission 
or Office head, other than the General Counsel, whose zone of 
responsibility relates to the record requested (see 17 CFR 200.13 et 
seq.), may make a determination that access is not lawfully required to 
be granted and should not be granted, in which case he, and not the 
Privacy Act Officer, shall make the required notification to the 
individual making the request.
    (b) Grant of request for access. (1) If it is determined that a 
request for access to records pertaining to an individual will be 
granted, the individual will be advised by mail that access will be 
given at the designated Office of the Commission or a copy of the 
requested record will be provided by mail if the individual shall so 
indicate. Where the individual requests that copies of the record be 
mailed to him or requests copies of a record upon reviewing it at a 
Commission Office, the individual shall pay the cost of making the 
requested copies, as set forth in Sec. 200.310 of this subpart.
    (2) In granting access to an individual to a record pertaining to 
him, such steps shall be taken by the Commission's staff as are 
necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure at the same time of 
information pertaining to individuals other than the person making the 
request or of other information that does not pertain to the individual.
    (c) Denial of request for access. If it is determined that access 
will not be granted, the individual making the request will be notified 
of that fact and given the reasons why access is being denied. The 
individual also will be advised (1) of his right to seek review by the 
General Counsel of the intital decision to deny access, in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in Sec. 200.308 of this subpart; and (2) 
of his right ultimately to obtain judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1)(A) of a final denial of access by the General Counsel.
    (d) Time for acting on requests for access. Access to a record 
pertaining to an individual normally will be granted or denied within 30 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the receipt 
of the request for access unless the individual making the request is 
notified in writing within the 30 day period that, for good cause shown, 
a longer time is required. In such cases, the individual making the 
request shall be informed in writing of the difficulties encountered and 
an indication shall be given as to when it is anticipated that access 
may be granted or denied.
    (e) Authorization to allow designated person to review and discuss 
records pertaining to another individual. An individual who is granted 
access to records pertaining to him, and who appears at a Commission 
Office to review the records, may be accompanied by another person of 
his choosing. Where the records as to which access has been granted are 
not required to be disclosed under provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, the individual requesting the 
records, before being granted access, shall execute a written statement, 
signed by him and the person accompanying him, which specifically 
authorizes the latter individual to review and discuss the records. If 
such authorization has not been given as described, the person who has 
accompanied the individual making the request will be excluded from any 
review or discussion of the records.
    (f) Exclusion for certain records. Nothing contained in these rules 
shall allow

[[Page 89]]

an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable 
anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

Sec. 200.305  Special procedure: Medical records.

    (a) Statement of physician or mental health professional. When an 
individual requests access to records pertaining to him that include 
medical and/or psychological information, the Commission, if it deems it 
necessary under the particular circumstances, may require the individual 
to submit with the request a signed statement by his physician or a 
mental health professional indicating that, in their opinion, disclosure 
of the requested records or information directly to the individual will 
not have an adverse effect on the individual.
    (b) Designation of physician or mental health professional to 
receive records. If the Commission believes, in good faith, that 
disclosure of medical and/or psychological information directly to an 
individual could have an adverse effect on that individual, the 
individual may be asked to designate in writing a physician or mental 
health professional to whom he would like the records to be disclosed, 
and disclosure that otherwise would be made to the individual will 
instead be made to the designated physician or mental health 
professional.


<R05>
Sec. 200.306  Requests for amendment or correction of records.

    (a) Place to make requests. A written request by an individual to 
amend or correct records pertaining to him or her may be hand delivered 
during normal business hours to the SEC, Operations Center, Room 1418, 
6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312-2414, or be sent by mail to 
the Office of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, Operations 
Center, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312-2413, or by 
facsimile (703-914-1149).
    (1) Information to be included in requests. Each request to amend or 
correct a Commission record shall reasonably describe the record sought 
to be amended or corrected. Such description should include, for 
example, relevant names, dates and subject matter to permit the record 
to be located among the records maintained by the Commission. An 
individual who has requested that a record pertaining to him be amended 
or corrected will be advised promptly if the record cannot be located on 
the basis of the description given and that further identifying 
information is necessary before his request can be processed. An initial 
evaluation of a request presented in person will be made immediately to 
ensure that the request is complete and to indicate what, if any, 
additional information will be required. Verification of the 
individual's identity as set forth in Sec. 200.303(a) (2), (3), (4) and 
(5) may also be required.
    (2) Basis for amendment or correction. An individual requesting an 
amendment or correction to a record pertaining to him shall specify the 
substance of the amendment or correction and set forth facts and provide 
such materials that would support his contention that the record 
pertaining to him as maintained by the Commission is not accurate, 
timely or complete, or that the record is not necessary and relevant to 
accomplish a statutory purpose of the Commission as authorized by law or 
by Executive Order of the President.
    (b) Acknowledgement of requests for amendment or correction. Receipt 
of a request to amend or correct a record pertaining to an individual 
normally will be acknowledged in writing within 10 days after such 
request has been received. When a request to amend or correct is made in 
person, the individual making the request will be given a written 
acknowledgement when the request is presented. The acknowledgement will 
describe the request received and indicate when it is anticipated that 
action will be taken on the request. No acknowledgement will be sent 
when the request for amendment

[[Page 90]]

or correction will be reviewed, and an initial decision made, within 10 
days from the date the request is received.

65 FR 55186, Sept. 13, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 200.307  Review of requests for amendment or correction.

    (a) Initial review. As in the case of requests for access, requests 
by individuals for amendment or correction to records pertaining to them 
will be referred to the Commission's Privacy Act Officer for an initial 
determination, except that such requests may be considered by a Division 
Director or Office Head (other than the General Counsel) as set forth in 
Sec. 200.304(a) of this subpart.
    (b) Standards to be applied in reviewing requests. In reviewing 
requests to amend or correct records, the Privacy Act Officer, or 
Division or Office head, will be guided by the criteria set forth in 5 
U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), i.e., that records maintained by the Commission shall 
contain only such information as is necessary and relevant to accomplish 
a statutory purpose of the Commission as required by statute or 
Executive Order of the President and that such information also be 
accurate, timely, and complete. These criteria will be applied whether 
the request is to add material to a record or to delete information from 
a record.
    (c) Time for acting on requests. Initial review of a request by an 
individual to amend or correct a record pertaining to him shall be 
completed as promptly as is reasonably possible and normally within 30 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) from the date the 
request was received, unless unusual circumstances preclude completion 
of review within that time. If the anticipated completion date indicated 
in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the individual requesting the 
amendment will be advised in writing of the delay and the reasons 
therefor, and also advised when action is expected to be completed.
    (d) Grant of requests to amend or correct records. If a request to 
amend or correct a record is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy 
Act Officer will: (1) Advise the individual making the request in 
writing of the extent to which it has been granted; (2) amend or correct 
the record accordingly; and (3) where an accounting of disclosures of 
the record has been kept pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c), advise all 
previous recipients of the record of the fact that the record has been 
amended or corrected and the substance of the amendment or correction.
    (e) Denial of requests to amend or correct records. If an 
individual's request to amend or correct a record pertaining to him is 
denied in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer will:
    (1) Promptly advise the individual making the request in writing of 
the extent to which the request has been denied;
    (2) State the reasons for the denial of the request;
    (3) Describe the procedures established by the Commission to obtain 
further review within the Commission of the request to amend or correct, 
including the name and address of the person to whom the appeal is to be 
addressed; and
    (4) Inform the individual that the Privacy Act Officer will provide 
information and assistance to the individual in perfecting an appeal of 
the initial decision.

his request for amendment or correction has been denied in whole or in 
part, or who has received no response to a request for access or to 
amend within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal

[[Page 91]]

holidays) after his request was received by the Office of Information 
and Privacy Act Operations (or within such extended period as may be

    (3) The applicant, if he wishes, may state such facts and cite such 
legal or other authorities as he may consider appropriate in support of 
his application.
    (4) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to 
any appeal within 30 days after the receipt of such appeal (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays), unless for good cause shown, the 
General Counsel shall extend that period. If such an extension is made, 
the individual who is appealing shall be advised in writing of the 
extension, the reasons therefor, and the anticipated date when the 
appeal will be decided.
    (5) In considering an appeal from a denial of a request to amend or 
correct a record, the General Counsel shall apply the same standards as 
set forth in Sec. 200.307(b).
    (6) If the General Counsel shall conclude that access should be 
granted, he or she shall issue an order granting access and instructing 
the Privacy Act Officer to comply with Sec. 200.304(b).
    (7) If the General Counsel shall conclude that the request to amend 
or correct the record should be granted in whole or in part, he or she 
shall issue an order granting the requested amendment or correction in 
whole or in part and instructing the Privacy Act Officer to comply with 
the requirements of Sec. 200.307(d) of this subpart, to the extent 
applicable.
    (8) If the General Counsel affirms the initial decision denying 
access, he or she shall issue an order denying access and advising the 
individual seeking access of (i) The order; (ii) the reasons for denying 
access; and (iii) the individual's right to obtain judicial review of 
the decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(B).
    (9) If the General Counsel determines that the decision of the 
Privacy Act Officer denying a request to amend or correct a record 
should be upheld, he or she shall issue an order denying the request and 
the individual shall be advised of
    (i) The order refusing to amend or correct the record and the 
reasons therefor;
    (ii) His or her right to file a concise statement setting forth his 
or her disagreement with the General Counsel's decision not to amend or 
correct the record;
    (iii) The procedures for filing such a statement of disagreement 
with the General Counsel;
    (iv) The fact that any such statement of disagreement will be made 
available to anyone to whom the record is disclosed, together with, if 
the General Counsel deems it appropriate, a brief statement setting 
forth the General Counsel's reasons for refusing to amend or correct;
    (v) The fact that prior recipients of the record in issue will be 
provided with the statement of disagreement and the General Counsel's 
statement, if any, to the extent that an accounting of such disclosures 
has been maintained pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c); and
    (vi) The individual's right to seek judicial review of the General 
Counsel's refusal to amend or correct, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1)(A).
    (10) In appropriate cases the General Counsel may, in his or her 
sole and unfettered discretion, refer matters requiring administrative 
review of initial decisions to the Commission for determination and the 
issuance, where indicated, of orders.
    (b) Statement of disagreement. As noted in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of 
this section, an individual may file with the General Counsel a

[[Page 92]]

and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, Operations Center, 6432 General Green 
Way, Alexandria, VA 22312-2413, or by facsimile (703-914-1149), within 
30 days after receipt by the individual of the General Counsel's order 
denying the amendment or correction. For good cause shown this period 
can be extended for a reasonable time.
    (2) Such statement of disagreement shall concisely state the basis 
for the individual's agreement. Generally a statement should be no more 
than two pages in length, except an individual may submit a slightly 
longer statement if it is necessary to set forth his disagreement 
effectively. Unduly lengthy or irrelevant materials will be returned to 
the individual by the General Counsel for appropriate revisions before 
they become a permanent part of the individual's record.
    (3) The record about which a statement of disagreement has been 
filed will clearly note which part of the record is disputed and the 
General Counsel will provide copies of the statement of disagreement 
and, if the General Counsel deems it appropriate, provide a concise 
statement of his or her reasons for refusing to amend or correct the 
record, to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been or will 
be disclosed.
    (4) In appropriate cases, the General Counsel may, in his or her 
sole and unfettered discretion, refer matters concerning statements of 
disagreement to the Commission for disposition.

<R05>
Sec. 200.309  General provisions.

    (a) Extensions of time. Pursuant to Sec. Sec. 200.303(b), 
200.304(d), 200.307(c) and 200.308(a)(4) of this subpart, the time 
within which a request for information, access or amendment by an 
individual with respect to records maintained by the Commission that 
pertain to him normally would be processed may be extended for good 
cause shown or because of unusual circumstances. As used in these rules, 
good cause and unusual circumstances shall include, but only to the 
extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of a particular 
request:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
Office processing the request. Many records of the Commission are stored 
in Federal Records Centers in accordance with law--including many of the 
documents which have been on file with the Commission for more than 2 
years--and cannot be made available promptly. Other records may 
temporarily be located at a Regional Office of the Commission. Any 
person who has requested for personal examination a record stored at the 
Federal Records Center or temporarily located in a Regional Office of 
the Commission will be notified when the record will be made available 
to him.
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which may be demanded 
in a single request. While every reasonable effort will be made fully to 
comply with each request as promptly as possible on a first-come, first-
served basis, work done to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
records in response to a request for a large number of records will be 
contingent upon the availability of processing personnel in accordance 
with an equitable allocation of time to all members of the public who 
have requested or wish to request records.
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request, or among two or more components within 
the Commission having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
    (b) Effective date of action. Whenever it is provided in this 
Subpart that an acknowledgement or response to a request will be given 
by specific times,

[[Page 93]]

deposit in the mails of such acknowledgement or response by that time, 
addressed to the person making the request, will be deemed full 
compliance.
    (c) Records in use by a member of the Commission or its staff. 
Although every effort will be made to make a record in use by a member 
of the Commission or its staff available when requested, it may 
occasionally be necessary to delay making such a record available when 
doing so at the time the request is made would seriously interfere with 
the work of the Commission or its staff.
    (d) Missing or lost records. Any person who has requested a record 
or a copy of a record pertaining to him will be notified if the record 
sought cannot be found. If he so requests, he will be notified if the 
record subsequently is found.
    (e) Oral requests; misdirected written requests--(1) Telephone and 
other oral requests. Before responding to any request by an individual 
for information concerning whether records maintained by the Commission 
in a system of records pertain to him or to any request for access to 
records by an individual, such request must be in writing and signed by 
the individual making the request. The General Counsel will not 
entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with an 
oral request. Any person who has orally requested information or access 
to records pertaining to him that he believes to have been improperly 
denied to him should resubmit his request in appropriate written form in 
order to obtain proper consideration and, if need be, administrative 
review.
    (2) Misdirected written requests. The Commission cannot assure that 
a timely or satisfactory response will be given to written requests for 
information, access or amendment by an individual with respect to 
records pertaining to him that are directed to the Commission other than 
in a manner prescribed in Sec. Sec. 200.303(a), 200.306(a), 
200.308(a)(2), and 200.310 of this subpart. Any staff member who 
receives a written request for information, access or amendment should 
promptly forward the request to the Privacy Act Officer. Misdirected 
requests for records will be considered to have been received by the 
Commission only when they have been actually received by the Privacy Act 
Officer in cases under Sec. 200.308(a)(2). The General Counsel will not 
entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with a 
misdirected request, unless it is clearly shown that the request was in 
fact received by the Privacy Act Officer.

Sec. 200.310  Fees.

    (a) A request by an individual for copies of a record pertaining to 
him or her that is maintained by the Commission may be sent by mail to 
the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 
Operations Center, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312-2413, or 
by facsimile (703-914-1149). There will be no charge assessed to the 
individual for the Commission's expense involved in searching for or 
reviewing the record. Copies of the Commission's records will be 
provided by a commercial copier or by the Commission at rates 
established by a contract between the copier and the Commission.
    (b) Waiver or reduction of fees. Whenever the Privacy Act Officer 
determines that good cause exists to grant a request for reduction or 
waiver of fees for copying documents, he or she may reduce or waive any 
such fees.

    Title 18 U.S.C. 1001 makes it a criminal offense, subject to a 
maximum fine of $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 5 years or 
both, to knowingly and willingly make or cause to be made any false or 
fradulent statements or representations in any matter within the 
jurisdiction of any agency of the United States. 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) makes 
it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 for any 
person knowingly and willfully to request or obtain any record 
concerning an individual from the Commission under

[[Page 94]]

false pretenses. 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) (1) and (2) provide criminal penalties 
for certain violations of the Privacy Act by officers and employees of 
the Commission.

Sec. 200.312  Specific exemptions.

    Pursuant to section (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Chairman of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the concurrence of the 
Commission, has deemed it necessary to promulgate the following

security, or the possible investigation of, or institution of activity

[[Page 98]]

    (ii) Significantly frustrate the implementation, or the proposed

authority, or any securities industry self-regulatory organization: 
Provided, however, That this paragraph (a)(9)(ii) shall not apply in any 
instance where the Commission has already disclosed to the public the 
precise content or nature of its proposed action, or where the 
Commission is expressly required by law to make such disclosure on its 
own initiative prior to taking final agency action on such proposal.
    (10) Specifically concern the Commission's consideration of, or its 
actual: Issuance of a subpoena (whether by the Commission directly or by 
any Commission employee or member); participation in a civil action or 
proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or 
an arbitration; or initiation, conduct, or disposition of a particular 
case of formal adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554, 
or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity

otherwise; or
    (vi) The disposition of any application for a Commission order of 
any nature where the issuance of such an order would involve a 
determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Interpretation of exemptions. The examples set forth Sec. 
200.402(a)(1) through (10) of particular matters which may be the 
subject of closed Commission deliberations are to be construed as 
illustrative, but not as exhaustive, of the scope of those exemptions.
    (c) Public interest determination. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 200.402(a) (concerning the closing of Commission meetings), but 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 200.409(a) (respecting the right of 
certain persons to petition for the closing of a Commission meeting), 
the Commission may conduct any meeting or portion of a meeting in public 
where the Commission determines, in its discretion, that the public 
interest renders it appropriate to open such a meeting.
    (d) Nonpublic matter in announcements. The Commission may delete 
from the notice of Commission meetings described in Sec. 200.403, from 
the announcements concerning closed meetings described in Sec. Sec. 
200.404(b) and 200.405(c), and from the General Counsel's certification 
described in Sec. 200.406, any information or description the 
publication of which would be likely to disclose matters of the nature 
described in Sec. 200.402(a) (concerning the closing of Commission 
meetings).

    (b) Time of notice. The announcement of Commission meetings referred

immediately thereafter to the Federal Register for publication) at least 
one week prior to the consideration of any item listed therein, except

shall be made publicly available (and submitted to the Federal Register) 
at the earliest practicable time.
    (c) Amendments to notice. (1)(i) The time or place of a meeting may

subsection shall be made publicly available at the earliest practicable 
time, and may be combined, in whole or in part, with the announcement

    Note: The Commission intends, to the extent convenient, to adhere to 
the following schedule in organizing its weekly agenda: Closed meetings 
to consider matters concerning the enforcement of the federal securities 
laws and the conduct of related investigations will generally be held on 
Tuesdays and on Thursday afternoons. An open meeting will generally be 
held each Thursday morning to consider matters of any appropriate 
nature. On Wednesdays, either open or closed meetings, or both, will 
generally be held according to the requirements of the Commission's 
agenda for the week in question. Normally, no meetings will be scheduled 
on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    The foregoing tentative general schedule is set forth for the 
guidance of the public, but is not, in any event, binding upon the 
Commission. In every case, the scheduling of Commission meetings shall 
be determined by the demands of Commission business, consistent with the 
requirements of this subpart I. When feasible, the Commission will 
endeavor to announce the subject matter of all then-contemplated open 
meetings during a particular month at least one week prior to the 
commencement of that month.
    When and if convenient after the conclusion of a closed Commission 
meeting, the Commission will endeavor to make publicly available a 
notice describing (subject to the provision in Sec. 200.402(d) 
regarding nonpublic matter in announcements) the items considered at 
that meeting and any action taken thereon.

Sec. 200.404  General procedure for determination to close meeting.

    (a) Action to close meeting. Action to close a meeting pursuant to 
Sec. 200.402(a) or (c) shall be taken only upon a vote of a majority of 
the entire membership of the Commission. A separate vote of the 
Commission members shall be taken with respect to each Commission 
meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the 
public pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a), or with respect to any information 
which is proposed to be withheld under Sec. 200.402(d); Provided, 
however, That a single vote may be taken with respect to a series of 
meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed, or 
with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so 
long as each meeting in such series relates to the same matters and is 
scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting 
in such series. The vote of each Commission member participating in such 
vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.
    (b) Announcement of action to close meeting. Within one day of any 
vote pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 200.409(a) 
(relating to review of Commission determinations to open a meeting), the 
Commission shall make publicly available:
    (1) A written record reflecting the vote of each participating 
member of the Commission on the question; and
    (2) In the case of a meeting or portion thereof to be closed to the 
public, a written explanation of the Commission's action closing the 
meeting or a portion thereof, together with a list describing 
generically or specifically the persons expected to attend the meeting 
and their affiliation; and

Sec. 200.405  Special procedure for determination to close meeting.

    (a) Finding. Based, in part, on a review of several months of its 
meetings, as well as the legislative history of the Sunshine Act, the 
Commission finds that a majority of its meetings may properly be closed 
to the public pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (4), (8), (9)(i), or (10), or 
any combination thereof.
    (b) Action to close meeting. The Commission may, by recorded vote of 
a majority of its members at the commencement of any meeting or portion 
thereof, determine to close any meeting or a portion thereof properly 
subject to being closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (4), (8), (9)(i), 
or (10), or any combination thereof. The procedure described in this 
rule may be utilized notwithstanding the fact that a meeting or portion 
thereof properly subject to being closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) 
(4), (8), (9)(i), or (10), or any combination thereof, could also be 
closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), or 
(9)(ii), or any combination thereof.
    (c) Announcement of action to close meeting. In the case of a 
meeting or a portion of a meeting closed pursuant to this rule, as soon 
as practicable the Commission shall make publicly available:
    (1) A written record reflecting the vote of each participating 
member of the Commission to close the meeting; and
    (2) The certification described in Sec. 200.406, executed by the 
Commission's General Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 200.406  Certification by the General Counsel.

    For every Commission meeting closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (1) 
through (10), the General Counsel of the Commission (or, in his or her 
absence, the attorney designated by General Counsel pursuant to Sec. 
200.21) shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting 
may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive 
provision.

Sec. 200.410  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Unauthorized activities; maintenance of decorum. Nothing in this 
subpart shall authorize any member of the public to be heard at, or 
otherwise participate in, any Commission meeting, or to photograph or 
record by videotape or similar device any Commission meeting or portion 
thereof. The Commission may exclude any person from attendance at any 
meeting whenever necessary to preserve decorum, or where appropriate or 
necessary for health or safety reasons, or where necessary to terminate 
behavior unauthorized by this paragraph (a). Any person desiring to 
sound-record an open Commission meeting shall notify the Commission's 
Secretary of his intention to do so at least 48 hours in advance of the 
meeting in question. Any person desiring to photograph or videotape the 
Commission's proceedings may apply to the Secretary for permission to do 
so at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting in question. The 
Commission's determination to permit photography or videotaping at any 
meeting is confined to its exclusive discretion, and will be granted 
only if such activities will not result in undue disruption of 
Commission proceedings.
    (b) Suspension of open meeting. Subject to the satisfaction of any 
procedural requirements which may be required by this subpart, nothing 
in this subpart shall preclude the Commission from directing that the 
room be cleared of spectators, temporarily or permanently, whenever it 
appears that the discussion during an open Commission meeting is likely 
to involve any matter described in Sec. 200.402(a) (respecting closed 
meetings).
    (c) Access to Commission documents. Except as expressly provided, 
nothing in this subpart shall authorize any person to obtain access to 
any document not otherwise available to the public or not required to be 
disclosed pursuant to subpart D. Access to documents considered or 
mentioned at Commission meetings may only be obtained subject to the 
procedures set forth in, and the provisions of, subpart D.
    (d) Access to public meetings. Any member of the public who plans to 
attend a public meeting of the Commission, and who requires an auxiliary 
aid such as a sign language interpreter, should contact the Commission's 
Selective Placement Coordinator, Office of Personnel at (202) 272-7065 
or TDD number (202) 272-2552, prior to the meeting to make the necessary 
arrangements. The Selective Placement Coordinator will take all

major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward 
such impairment; or
    (iii) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (1) of this

or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may

on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;

reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to

    (v) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;

separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.
    (3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose 
or effect of which would--

    (6) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification 
program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with handicaps 
to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by this regulation.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals 
with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with 
handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order 
to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by 
this regulation.

29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 200.641-200.648  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 200.649  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 200.650, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 200.650  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 200.650(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 200.650(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a

[[Page 111]]

physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of 
Sec. 200.650(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program 
accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 200.651  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 200.660  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.

[[Page 112]]

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 200.660 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;

<R05>
Sec. 200.735-1  Purpose.

    This subpart sets forth the standards of ethical conduct required of 
members, employees and special Government employees, and former members 
and employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is a further 
revision of a comprehensive conduct regulation first adopted by the 
Commission in 1953 ``to restate the ethical principles which it believes 
should govern and have governed the conduct of members and employees and 
former members and employees of the Commission.'' \1\ This revision is 
necessary to provide members, employees, special Government employees 
and former Commission members and employees with a comprehensive 
statement of standards of conduct which are dictated by applicable 
Federal law, Executive orders, and the Commission's own requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The last major revision of the Conduct Regulation was done in 
1966 to implement Executive Order 11222, May 8, 1965, and part 735 of 
the Civil Service Commission regulations (5 CFR part 735) adopted 
pursuant thereto. It also contains references to the several applicable 
statutes governing employee conduct, particularly Pub. L. 87-849 (76 
Stat. 1119, 18 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and the ``Code of Ethics for 
Government Service,'' House Concurrent Resolution 175, 85th Congress, 2d 
session (72 Stat. B 12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-2  Policy.

    (a) The Securities and Exchange Commission has been entrusted by 
Congress with the protection of the public interest in a highly 
significant area of our national economy. In view of the effect which 
Commission action frequently has on the general public, it is important 
that members, employees and special Government employees maintain 
unusually high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality and 
conduct. They must be constantly aware of the need to avoid situations 
which might result either in actual or apparent misconduct or conflicts 
of interest and to conduct themselves in their official relationships in 
a manner which commands the respect and confidence of their fellow 
citizens.
    (b) For these reasons, members, employees and special Government 
employees should at all times abide by the standards of conduct set 
forth in this subpart, the canons of ethics for members of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (subpart C of this part 200) and, in 
the case of a professional person, the ethical standards applicable to 
the profession of such person.


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-3  General provisions.

    (a)(1) In considering the prohibitions of this section, members and 
employees must constantly be aware that the provisions here enumerated 
set forth standards of conduct which are broader than the specific 
applications stated in the rules which follow. Therefore, members and 
employees should look to these general prohibitions when assessing the 
advisability of a particular course of conduct. The broadly stated 
provisions of this rule are aimed at eliminating the appearance of 
impropriety as well as any actual wrongdoing.
    (2) Accordingly, a member or employee should avoid any action, 
whether or not specifically prohibited by law or regulation (including 
the provisions of this subpart), which would result in or might create 
appearance of, among other things:
    (i) Using public office for private gain;
    (ii) Giving preferential treatment to any organization or person;

[[Page 114]]

    (iii) Losing complete independence or impartiality;
    (iv) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (v) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.
    (3) While provisions applicable to all employees of the Commission 
are outlined in this regulation, certain Offices or Divisions for 
management reasons may require more stringent regulations in certain 
areas. These may be imposed by Division Directors, Office Heads or 
Regional Directors with the consent of the Chairman and the approval of 
the Office of Government Ethics. Should such additional regulations be 
imposed, all employees affected must be notified ten days before the 
effective date of the restriction or at the time of their employment.
    (b) A member or employee of the Commission shall not:
    (1) Engage, directly or indirectly, in any personal business 
transaction or private arrangement for personal profit the opportunity 
for which arises because of his or her official position or authority, 
or that is based upon confidential or nonpublic information which he or 
she gains by reason of such position or authority. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Detailed provisions regarding outside or private employment and 
transactions in securities and commodities are set forth in Sec. Sec. 
200.735-4 and 200.735-5, respectively. Further provisions regarding use 
and disclosure of confidential information are set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section and in the note appended thereto.
    Members of the Commission are subject also to the following 
prohibition in section 4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78d(a)): ``* * * No Commissioner shall engage in any other 
business, vocation, or employment than that of serving as Commissioner, 
nor shall any Commissioner participate, directly or indirectly, in any 
stock market operations or transactions of a character subject to 
regulation by the Commission pursuant to this title * * *.'' This does 
not preclude Commissioners from engaging in securities transactions. See 
Opinion letter dated February 11, 1975, sent by the Office of the 
General Counsel to David Reich, Ethics Counselor at the Civil Service 
Commission. In addition, members of the Commission are subject to the 
requirements of Executive Order 11222 of May 8, 1965.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan, service, or any other thing of monetary 
value from any person with whom he or she transacts business on behalf 
of the United States:
    (i) Who has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business 
or financial relations with the Commission;
    (ii) Who conducts operations or activities regulated by the 
Commission; or
    (iii) Who has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or non-performance of his or her official duty.
    (3) The restrictions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section do not 
prohibit members and employees from the following:
    (i) The acceptance of food and refreshments, not lavish in kind, 
offered free in the course of a meeting or other group function, not 
connected with an inspection or investigation, at which attendance is 
desirable because it will assist the member or employee in performing 
his or her official duties. Members shall determine for themselves and 
their staffs the propriety of accepting such invitations. Division 
Directors, Office Heads, and Regional Directors are authorized to make 
such determinations for themselves and their subordinates. Staff members 
are required to advise their Division Director, Office Head, or Regional 
Director of invitations received from entities described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (ii) The acceptance of items of value when the circumstances make it 
clear that it is family or personal relationships rather than the 
business of the persons concerned which govern and are the motivating 
factors.
    (iii) The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional 
material, such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars and other items of 
modest value.
    (iv) The acceptance of meals and refreshments as provided to all 
panelists, when participating as a panelist in an educational program.
    (v) The acceptance of gifts given for participation in an 
educational program when they are (A) of modest

[[Page 115]]

value; or (B) provided to all participants in the program; or (C) in the 
nature of a remembrance traditional to the particular sponsor 
institution.
    (vi) For purposes of this subpart, person means an individual, a 
corporation, a company, an association, a firm, a partnership, a 
society, a joint stock company; or any other organization or institution 
or anyone who acts for such a person in a representative capacity. \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Members and employees of the Commission are subject also to 
provisions of the Federal criminal code which prohibit, (1) any officer 
or employee of the United States from asking, accepting or receiving any 
money or other thing of value in connection with any matter before him 
or her in his or her official capacity, (18 U.S.C. 203); and (2) the 
compensation of government employees for services to the government by 
entities other than the United States (18 U.S.C. 209). In addition, 
members are prohibited by 5 CFR 735.203(c) from receiving compensation 
or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, 
writing, or appearance, the subject matter of which is devoted 
substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of the 
Commission or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which 
have not become part of the body of public information. See also 17 CFR 
200.735-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Solicit contributions from another employee for a gift to an 
employee in a superior official position. An employee in a superior 
official position shall not accept a gift presented as a contribution 
from employees receiving less salary than himself or herself. An 
employee shall not make a donation as a gift to an employee in a 
superior official position (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does 
not prohibit the occasional giving of gifts of modest value to an 
employee in a superior position or the receipt of such gifts by a 
superior or the use of completely voluntary contributions of nominal 
amounts by employees within the Commission to establish funds for the 
limited purpose of providing token remembrances or gifts of modest value 
to an employee in a superior position on special occasions.
    (5) Accept from a foreign government a gift, decoration or other 
thing of more than minimal value except in accordance with the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7342.
    (6) Discuss or entertain a proposal for future employment by any 
person outside the Government with whom he or she is personally and 
substantially involved in transacting business on behalf of the United 
States. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Detailed provisions regarding negotiations for future employment 
are set forth in Sec. 200.735-7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) If an employee wishes to discuss future employment with another 
Government agency, this fact should be disclosed to the employee's 
Division Director, Office Head or Regional Director prior to any 
discussion regarding employment, if at that time the employee is 
representing the Commission in a particular matter in which the other 
agency is taking a position adverse to the Commission.
    (7)(i) Divulge to any unauthorized person or release in advance of 
authorization for its release \5\ any nonpublic Commission document, or 
any information contained in any such document or any confidential 
information: (A) In contravention of the rules and regulations of the 
Commission promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552, 552a and 552b; or (B) in 
circumstances where the Commission has determined to accord such 
information confidential treatment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ In Section 171 of the Commission's Manual of Administrative 
Regulations the Commission's policy on making available nonpublic 
information to Federal, State and foreign government authorities, 
national securities exchanges and national securities associations is 
outlined.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Except where the Commission or the General Counsel, pursuant to 
delegated authority, has previously granted approval or in relation to a 
Commission administrative proceeding or a judicial proceeding in which 
the Commission, or a present or former Commissioner, or present or 
former member of the staff, represented by Commission counsel, is a 
party, any officer, employee or former officer or employee who is served 
with a subpoena requiring the disclosure of confidential or non-public 
information or documents shall, unless the Commission or the General 
Counsel, pursuant to delegated authority, authorizes the disclosure of 
such information or documents, respectfully decline to disclose the 
information or produce the documents

[[Page 116]]

called for, basing his or her refusal on this paragraph.
    (iii) Any member, employee or former member or employee who is 
served with such a subpoena not covered by the exceptions in paragraph 
(b)(7)(ii) of this section shall promptly advise the General Counsel of 
the service of such subpoena, the nature of the information or documents 
sought, and any circumstances which may bear upon the desirability in 
the public interest of making available such information or documents. 
\6\ The Commission or the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated 
authority, shall authorize the disclosure of non-expert, non-privileged, 
factual staff testimony and the production of non-privileged documents 
when validly subpoenaed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Detailed prohibitions regarding disclosure or use of 
confidential or nonpublic information are set forth in Rule 122 (17 CFR 
230.122) under the Securities Act of 1933; section 24(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78x) and Rule 0-4 (17 CFR 
240.0-4); and Rule 24(b)(2) (17 CFR 240.24b-2), thereunder; section 
22(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79y) 
and Rule 104 thereunder (17 CFR 250.104); section 45(a)(1) of the 
Investment Company Act, and section 210(b) of the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-10). But see, section 171 of the 
Administrative Manual which authorizes the staff to divulge certain 
nonpublic information without Commission approval (n. 5, supra).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (8) Act in any official matter with respect to which there exists a 
personal interest incompatible with an unbiased exercise of official 
judgment. \7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Section 200.735-6 of this subpart provides a procedure for 
relieving employees from assignments in certain cases, including those 
covered by paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (9) Have direct or indirect personal, business or financial affairs 
which conflict or appear to conflict with his or her official duties and 
responsibilities.
    (10)(i) Use, or allow the use of, directly or indirectly, Government 
property of any kind, including property leased to the Government, for 
other than officially approved activities. Officially approved 
activities for the purpose of this section are those activities which 
are part of an employee's official duties or are approved by the 
employee's Division Director, Office Head or Regional Director as being 
sufficiently related to the employee's official duties, or important to 
the interests of the Commission to warrant the use of Commission 
facilities for their accomplishment. Division Directors, Office Heads 
and Regional Directors may, for their own activities meeting the same 
criteria, obtain the concurrence of the Executive Director.
    (ii) An employee has a positive duty to protect and conserve 
Government property, including equipment, supplies, and other property 
entrusted or issued to him or her.
    (11) Participate, while on Government-owned or leased property or 
while on duty for the Government, in any gambling activity, including 
the operation of a gambling device, in conducting a lottery or pool, in 
a game for money or property, or in selling or purchasing a numbers slip 
or ticket.
    (12) Engage in unlawful or unethical conduct, or other conduct 
prejudicial to the Government.

Sec. 200.735-4  Outside employment and activities.

    (a) No member or employee shall permit his or her name to be 
associated in any way with any legal, accounting or other professional 
firm or office. \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ With respect to members, this paragraph supplements the 
statutory prohibition against outside employment contained in section 
4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, quoted in footnote 2. 
Except as otherwise indicated, the remaining provisions of this section 
are not made applicable to members in view of the provisions of section 
4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b)(1) No employee shall have any outside or private employment, 
activity, or affiliation incompatible with concurrent employment by the 
Commission. Incompatible activities include but are not limited to
    (i) Employment or association with any securities exchange, 
association of securities dealers, or other self-regulatory organization 
either registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise 
involved with the securities industry, any registered

[[Page 117]]

broker, dealer, registered municipal securities dealer, public utility 
holding company, investment company, investment adviser, securities 
information processor, transfer agent, clearing agency or other persons 
who are subject to regulation by the Commission, or where the facts 
relating to a particular employment would create an appearance of 
impropriety, because the employment is directly or indirectly related to 
the issuance, sale, purchase or investment of securities;
    (ii) Legal, accounting, or engineering work for compensation 
involving matters in which the Federal government may be significantly 
interested;
    (iii) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, 
or any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which 
acceptance may result in or create the appearance of conflicts of 
interest;
    (iv) Outside employment or activity which impairs the employee's 
mental or physical capacity to perform his or her Commission duties and 
responsibilities in an acceptable manner;
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph (b), the private employment 
of an employee's spouse, or other member of his or her immediate 
household with any securities exchange, association of securities 
dealers, or other self-regulatory organization either registered under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise involved in the 
securities industry, any registered broker, dealer, registered municipal 
securities dealer, public utility holding company, investment company, 
investment adviser, securities information processor, transfer agent, 
clearing agency or other persons who are subject to regulation by the 
Commission, or where the particular employment is directly related to 
the issuance, sale, purchase or investment of securities is deemed to be 
incompatible with the employee's concurrent employment by the Commission 
if the duties and activities incident to such employment relate directly 
to the official activities of the Commission employee, except as 
determined otherwise by the Commission in a specific case.
    (i) Member of his or her immediate household is defined for the 
purposes of this paragraph as a resident of the employee's household who 
is related to the employee by blood or marriage.
    (3) No employee shall accept or perform outside employment 
prohibited by law, regulations of the Office of Personnel Management or 
the rules in this subpart.
    (4) No employee shall receive any salary or anything of monetary 
value from a private source as compensation for his or her services to 
the Government (18 U.S.C. 209), except as otherwise provided by law.
    (5) The Commission encourages employees to engage in teaching, 
lecturing, and writing activities with or without compensation. \9\ In 
participating in such activities, employees should be guided by the 
following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ As to employees, while the receipt of honoraria is discouraged 
(See 17 CFR 200.735-4(b)(7)), that rule is not applicable to the receipt 
of compensation for teaching.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) No teaching, lecturing, or writing should be engaged in if 
prohibited by law, Executive order, Office of Personnel Management 
regulations, or the rules in this subpart.
    (ii) No teaching, lecturing, or writing should be engaged in 
(including for the purpose of the special preparation of a person or 
class of persons for an examination of the Office of Personnel 
Management or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service) that depends 
on information filed with the Commission, or obtained by the Commission 
in an investigation or otherwise, or generated within the Commission 
which is nonpublic, unless the Commission gives formal approval for the 
use of such nonpublic information on the basis that the use thereof is 
in the public interest. \10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Since members of the Commission are covered by section 401(a) 
of Executive Order 11222, they are prohibited by Civil Service 
Regulations (5 CFR 735.203(c)) from receiving compensation or anything 
of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or 
appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the 
responsibilities, programs, or operations of their agencies, or which 
draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part 
of the body of public information.
    \11\ [Reserved]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6)(i) Subject to the specific prohibition and requirements set 
forth below, the Commission may accept payment

[[Page 118]]

or reimbursement in cash or in kind, for travel and subsistence expenses 
actually incurred by Commission members and employees, while on official 
duty status, in connection with the participation of such members and 
employees in conferences, proceedings, meetings, seminars, and 
educational programs concerning the functions and responsibilities of 
the Commission and related topics.
    (ii)(A) The Commission shall accept no payment or reimbursement for 
expenses described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section from or in 
connection with a conference sponsored by:
    (1) A person directly required to file reports or registration 
statements with the Commission, or
    (2) A person directly or indirectly regulated by the Commission, or
    (3) Any association or other group composed predominantly of persons 
regulated by the Commission, Provided, however, That the Chairman may 
authorize the Commission to accept payment or reimbursement from such a 
group. In determining whether to authorize such payment or 
reimbursement, the Chairman shall consider the benefits to the 
Commission and the public of participation in the particular program and 
the possibility of any appearance of impropriety.
    (B) For purposes of this section, the phrase person regulated by the 
Commission means all persons whose activities are directly regulated by, 
or who are required to register with, the Commission, including but not 
limited to, such persons as brokers or dealers in securities, national 
securities exchanges, national securities associations, investment 
companies, investment advisers, public utility holding companies, and 
any self-regulatory organization, as that term is defined in section 3 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78(c).
    (iii)(A) Subordinate members of the staff who are invited to 
participate in programs which offer payment or reimbursement meeting the 
criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section must, prior to 
participation, obtain the written approval of their Division Director, 
Office Head, or Regional Director to participate in the program and the 
written approval of the Chairman, if paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this 
section applies. If paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section does not 
apply, the Executive Director shall determine in writing whether the 
Commission will accept the payment or reimbursement.
    (1) In acting on requests to participate, Division Directors, Office 
Heads, and Regional Directors shall consider: (i) The benefit to the 
Commission and the public of participation; (ii) the expertise of the 
proposed participant; and (iii) the appropriate allocation of resources.
    (2) In determining whether the Commission shall accept payment or 
reimbursement, the Executive Director shall consider the possibility of 
any appearance of impropriety.
    (B) Division Directors, Office Heads, and Regional Directors must, 
prior to participation, obtain the written approval of the Chairman, if 
paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section applies. If paragraph 
(b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section does not apply, the Executive Director 
shall determine, in writing, considering the possibility of any 
appearance of impropriety, whether the Commission will accept the 
payment or reimbursement. Division Directors, Office Heads, and Regional 
Directors shall make the determinations specified in paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(A)(1) of this section as to their own participation.
    (C) Except if paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section applies, 
each Commissioner shall determine for himself or herself whether payment 
or reimbursement for his or her expenses incident to participation in 
programs meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section 
should be accepted by the Commission. Notice of each decision shall be 
sent to the Executive Director.
    (D) Whenever it is determined, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) 
(A), (B), or (C) of this section that the Commission will accept a 
particular payment or reimbursement, the Executive Director shall 
forward notice of that decision to the Public Reference Room, 
Washington, DC, for insertion in a public file.
    (iv) Payment or reimbursement shall not be accepted for expenses 
which are unreasonable or lavish.
    (v) On a quarterly basis, the Commission shall publish in the SEC 
Docket a

[[Page 119]]

compilation of payments and reimbursements accepted.
    (vi) The Commission's acceptance from any person of payment or 
reimbursement for the expenses of a spouse or traveling companion 
accompanying a member or employee is prohibited. If a staff member 
wishes to participate in a program which offers payment or reimbursement 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section and 
acceptance would not be prohibited by paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this 
section, but is denied approval in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(6)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, or wishes to accept reimbursement 
for the travel expenses of his or her spouse or traveling companion, the 
staff member may participate in the program and accept such 
reimbursement personally, Provided, That:
    (A) No reimbursement for travel expenses may be accepted from a 
person who does, or is seeking to do, business with the Commission, is 
regulated directly or indirectly by the Commission, is registered with 
the Commission, or has interests which may be substantially affected by 
the official's performance or non-performance of his or her official 
duties.
    (B) No reimbursement may be accepted for the travel expenses of an 
employee's spouse or traveling companion unless the prior written 
approval of the General Counsel is obtained. Under appropriate 
circumstances, such as programs where participants are expected to 
engage in social activities, the General Counsel may approve acceptance 
upon written application.
    (C) A copy of the General Counsel's approval and notice of the 
amount of payment or reimbursement accepted from the sponsor must be 
sent to the Executive Director for inclusion in the public file in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(D) of this section.
    (D) Such staff member's participation and travel occur only while on 
annual leave, approved in accord with regular leave procedures. Note 7 
CFR 200.735-4(e)(2)(ii).
    (vii) Members or employees who are participating in a program 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, which is 
sponsored by a person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be 
a tax-exempt organization pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), and for which 
reimbursement for the member's or employee's participation will be 
accepted by the Commission, may, while on official duty, accept from the 
sponsoring entity bona fide reimbursement for actual expenses for travel 
and necessary subsistence for a spouse or traveling companion Provided 
that the procedures detailed in paragraphs (d)(6)(vi) (A)-(C) of this 
section are followed.
    (7) The provisions of this paragraph (b) and Sec. 200.735-3(b)(2) 
do not preclude a member or employee from:
    (i) Participation in the activities of national or State political 
parties not proscribed by law;
    (ii) Participation in the affairs of, or acceptance of an award for 
a meritorious public contribution or achievement given by, a charitable, 
religious, professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational, 
recreational, public service, or civic organization.
    (8)(i) As a matter of general policy, the Commission discourages the 
acceptance of honoraria or similar fees and payments which are given for 
publications, speeches or lectures based on the official duties of the 
employee. In accord with this policy, no member or employee may accept 
such an honorarium unless written approval is obtained in advance from 
the Commission's General Counsel, subject to the general review of the 
Commission. Requests for such approval should be submitted to the 
General Counsel in writing and should include a statement in support of 
the request.
    (ii) Honoraria which are most likely to be deemed acceptable are 
those which appear to be remuneration for teaching. An employee may not, 
under any circumstances, accept an honorarium from any person from whom 
reimbursement for travel expenses is prohibited by paragraph (b)(6)(ii) 
of this section. In any event an employee may not accept an excessive 
honorarium as described in 2 U.S.C. 441(i). This section does not 
preclude the acceptance of a modest gift for participation as a speaker, 
as provided in Rule 3.
    (c) No employee shall appear in court or on a brief in a 
representative capacity (with or without compensation) or

[[Page 120]]

otherwise accept or perform legal, accounting, engineering, or similar 
professional work, unless specifically authorized to do so by the 
Commission. Acceptance of a forwarding fee shall be deemed to be within 
the foregoing prohibition. As a matter of general policy, outside or 
private professional work or practice by the staff is discouraged and 
only in unusual cases or circumstances will it be authorized. However, 
the Commission encourages its employees, in off-duty hours and 
consistent with official responsibilities, to participate, without 
compensation, in programs to provide legal or other appropriate 
assistance and representation to indigents. \12\ Such participation may 
include limited appearances in court and on briefs when required in 
connection with such programs. However, such participation may not 
involve any activities which are prohibited by law, Executive orders, 
Office of Personnel Management regulations, or this subpart M. \13\ For 
example, 18 U.S.C. 205 prohibits a Federal employee from appearing in 
court in a matter in which the United States has an interest (other than 
on behalf of the United States), without regard to compensation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ As a matter of policy, the Commission encourages members of its 
staff to participate in matters involving improvement to their 
communities and service to indigent persons, provided that the necessary 
approval is obtained in advance. However, in no case will approval be 
given to participate in matters involving securities.
    \13\ Attention is called to Title 18, United States Code, sections 
201 through 209 which provide, among other things, that Federal 
employees are prohibited from acting as agent or attorney in prosecuting 
any claim against the United States or from aiding and assisting in any 
way, except as otherwise permitted in the discharge of official duties, 
in the prosecution or support of any such claim, or from receiving any 
gratuity, or any share of an interest in any claim from any claimant 
against the United States; and from directly or indirectly receiving or 
agreeing to receive any compensation whatever for services rendered or 
to be rendered to any persons in relation to any matter in which the 
United States is a party or directly or indirectly interested. 18 U.S.C. 
205 contains an exception from the foregoing restrictions for acting as 
agent or attorney, without compensation, for government employees who 
are the subject of disciplinary, loyalty or other personnel-type 
proceedings, in connection with these proceedings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The provisions of this paragraph (c) and Sec. 200.735-3(b)(2) 
do not preclude an employee from:
    (i) Acting without compensation as agent or attorney (A) for a 
Commission employee who is sued or is under investigation in connection 
with his or her official duties; (B) for any Commission employee who is 
the subject of disciplinary, loyalty or other personnel administrative 
proceedings in connection with those proceedings; or (C) for any 
Commission employee who raises claims or against whom allegations of 
wrongdoing are made pursuant to the Commission's Equal Opportunity 
regulations, if such representation is not inconsistent with the 
faithful performance of the employee's duties. \14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ This is adapted from the provision in 18 U.S.C. 205 and 
expresses the Commission's general policy which favors the 
representation of fellow employees without compensation. However, it may 
be necessary to look to other regulations for specific provisions 
regarding such representation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) No member or employee shall hold office in or be a director of 
any company which has public security holders, except not for profit 
corporations, savings and loan associations, and similar institutions, 
whose securities are exempted under section 3(a)(4) or 3(a)(5) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(4), 77c(a)(5)).
    (e)(1) As paragraph (b)(5) of this section indicates, the Commission 
encourages employees to engage in teaching, lecturing and writing 
activities. \15\ It is understood, however, that Commission employees in 
their teaching, writing and lecturing shall not
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ This paragraph (e), requiring review of prepared speeches or 
writings relating to the Commission, does not apply to teaching 
activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Use confidential or nonpublic information;
    (ii) Make comments on pending litigation in which the Commission is 
participating as a party or amicus curiae; or
    (iii) Make comments on rulemaking proceedings pending before the 
Commission which would adversely affect the operations of the 
Commission.

[[Page 121]]

    (2) To assist employees in conforming to these requirements the 
following procedure for reviewing writings prior to publication, or 
prepared speeches prior to delivery, has been established:
    (i) Employees must submit proposed publications or prepared speeches 
relating to the Commission, or the statutes or rules it administers, to 
the General Counsel for review. Employees will be notified as promptly 
as possible, with due regard to publication deadlines, but in any event 
within 30 days of receipt of the written document, whether such document 
conforms to the requirements of this Rule.
    (ii) A determination by the General Counsel that a proposed 
publication conforms to the requirements of the rule will not involve 
adoption of, or concurrence in, the views expressed. Therefore, such 
publication or speech shall include at an appropriate place or by way of 
footnote, or otherwise, the following disclaimer of responsibility:

    The Securities and Exchange Commission, as a matter of policy, 
disclaims responsibility for any private publication or statement by any 
of its employees. The views expressed herein are those of the author and 
do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or of the 
author's colleagues upon the staff of the Commission.


In appropriate cases, the above disclaimer may be modified by the 
General Counsel or the Commission to reflect the circumstances of an 
individual case. In addition, any publication or speech which reflects 
positions taken by the Commission shall set forth those positions 
accurately and, if it contains differences with Commission positions, it 
shall clearly state that such positions are those of the employee.
    (f) An employee who intends to accept or perform any outside or 
private employment or professional work shall obtain necessary 
authorization in advance of such acceptance or performance. A request 
for such authorization shall be submitted to the Division Director, 
Office Head or Regional Director concerned, together with all pertinent 
facts regarding the proposed employment, such as the name of the 
employer, the nature of the work to be performed, its estimated 
duration, and the fee or compensation to be received. Division 
Directors, Office Heads and Regional Directors have been delegated the 
authority to approve routine requests for outside employment. The 
approving official shall forward to the Director of Personnel a copy of 
each request showing the date of approval. Requests of a non-routine 
nature should be forwarded to the Director of Personnel.
    (g) The Director of Personnel, or his designee, is authorized to 
approve or disapprove requests for outside or private employment under 
this rule, except as to those cases which, in his judgment, should be 
considered and decided by the Commission. An employee may appeal a 
disapproved request to the Commission. The written appeal, submitted 
through the Director of Personnel, shall give reasons why the proposed 
outside or private employment is consistent with this rule. The Director 
of Personnel may not approve proposed outside or private employment 
which is absolutely prohibited by these rules. The Commission may, in a 
particular case, approve such employment. \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ The Commission does not favor the granting of waivers from the 
provision of this subsection.

Sec. 200.735-5  Securities transactions.

    (a)(1) This section applies to all transactions effected by or on 
behalf of a member or employee. This includes transactions for the 
accounts of other persons effected by the member or employee, directly 
or indirectly, under a power of attorney or otherwise. In addition, a 
member or employee is considered to have sufficient interest in the 
securities transactions of his or her spouse or unemancipated minor 
child or other member of his or her immediate household so that 
transactions effected by or on behalf of such persons must be reported 
and are subject to all the terms of this section.
    (i) Except, this section shall not apply to securities transactions 
of a legally separated spouse living apart from the member or employee, 
including transactions for the benefit of a

[[Page 122]]

minor child, if the member or employee has no power to control and does 
not, in fact, advise or control with regard to such transactions. If the 
member or employee has knowledge of securities held by a separated 
spouse or for the benefit of a minor child, the disqualification 
provisions of Rule 6, 17 CFR 200.735-6, and 18 U.S.C. 208 are 
applicable.
    (ii) For purposes of this section member of his or her immediate 
household means a resident of the member's or employee's household who 
is related to the employee by blood or marriage or who is in the legal 
care and/or custody of the employee by reason of adoption, prospective 
adoption or guardianship.
    (2) Members and employees are prohibited from recommending or 
suggesting the purchase or sale of securities:
    (i) Based on non-public information gained in the course of 
employment; or
    (ii) Which a member or employee could not purchase because of the 
restrictions of this rule, in any circumstance in which the member or 
employee could reasonably expect to benefit from the recommendation, or 
to anyone over whom the member or employee has or may have control or 
substantial influence.
    (b)(1) No member or employee shall effect or cause to be effected 
any transaction in a security except for bona fide investment purposes. 
Therefore, all securities purchased by a member or employee must be held 
for a minimum of six months. Except, this holding period is not 
applicable to
    (i) Securities sold for less than the purchase price pursuant to a 
stop-loss order entered at the time of purchase and submitted to the 
Office of Personnel with the report of purchase;
    (ii) Money market fund shares; \17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ For purposes of this section a money market fund is defined as 
a registered open-end fund that complies with Sec. 270.2a-7 of this 
chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Securities purchased by a member or employee prior to entrance 
on duty with the Commission;
    (iv) Debt securities with an initial term of less than six months 
which are held to term; or
    (v) The transferring of funds that have been held as shares in a 
registered investment company for a minimum of 30 days to another 
registered investment company within the same family of registered 
investment companies. This 30-day holding period does not apply to money 
market fund shares, which are exempted from the six-month holding period 
by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this provision a family means any two or more 
registered investment companies which share the same investment adviser 
or principal underwriter and hold themselves out to investors as related 
companies for purposes of investment and investor services.
    (c) No member or employee shall effect any purchase or sale of an 
option, future contract, or option on a future contract involving a 
security or group of securities.
    (d) No member or employee shall
    (1) Carry securities on margin;
    (2) Borrow funds or securities, with or without collateral, for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying securities with the proceeds, unless 
the prior approval of the Commission has been secured; or
    (3) Sell a security which he or she does not own, or consummate a 
sale by the delivery of a security borrowed by or for such member's or 
employee's account.
    (e)(1) Except as provided in this paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) 
below, members and employees are prohibited from purchasing or selling 
any security which is the subject of a registration statement filed 
under the Security Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.), the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), or a letter of 
notification filed under Regulation A, or any security of the same 
issuer while such a registration statement or letter of notification is 
pending or during the first 60 days after its effective date. This 
prohibition shall not apply to:
    (i) A security which is the subject of a pending registration 
statement filed on Forms S-2, S-3, S-8, F-2, F-3, 8-A, or 8-B; or
    (ii) Offerings, except initial public offerings, of shares by an 
investment company, other than a closed-end investment company, or to 
offerings by a registered separate account (as defined

[[Page 123]]

in section 1(a)(37) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80a-2(a)(37)) which become effective pursuant to 17 CFR 230.485(b).
    (2) Securities of a unit investment trust whose registration 
statements become effective pursuant to 17 CFR 230.487 may be purchased 
immediately upon effectiveness of the registration statement.
    (3) Securities which are registered for delayed distribution 
pursuant to 17 CFR 230.415 may be purchased 60 days after the 
registration becomes effective. The subsequent filing of a pricing 
amendment or sticker does not revive the prohibition on purchase.
    (f) A member or employee may sell a security which is referred to in 
paragraph (e) of this section only if:
    (1) The member or employee certifies that he or she has no 
information which is not publicly available concerning or relating to 
the issuer; and
    (2) The employee's Division Director, Office Head or Regional 
Director certifies that the employee has not participated in the 
registration processing. Members, Division Directors, Office Heads, and 
Regional Directors are required to submit such certification on their 
own behalf to the Director of the Office of Personnel.
    (g) No member or employee shall purchase any security which to his 
or her knowledge is involved in any pending investigation by the 
Commission, or in any proceeding before the Commission, or to which the 
Commission is a party.
    (h) No member or employee shall purchase any security of any company 
which is in a receivership or bankruptcy proceeding in which the 
Commission has filed a notice of appearance.
    (i) No member or employee shall purchase securities of:
    (1) Any holding company registered under section 5 of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79e), or any subsidiary 
thereof, or
    (2) Any company, if its status under such Act, or the applicability 
of any provision of the Act to it, is known by the employee to be under 
consideration.
    (j) The restrictions imposed in paragraphs (e), (g), (h), and (i) of 
this section do not apply;
    (1) To the exercise of a privilege to convert or exchange 
securities;
    (2) To the exercise of rights accruing unconditionally by virtue of 
ownership of other securities (as distinguished from a contingent right 
to acquire securities not subscribed for by others);
    (3) To the acquisition and exercise of rights in order to round out 
fractional shares;
    (4) To the acceptance of stock dividends on securities already 
owned; to the reinvestment, under a reinvestment program, of cash 
dividends on a security already owned; or the participation in a 
periodic investment plan for the purchase of a security when the 
original purchase was consistent with the provisions of this rule; or
    (5) Investments in funds established pursuant to the Federal 
Employees Retirement System.
    (k) Members and employees holding a Senior Executive Service 
position in the Division of Investment Management or the Office of 
Compliance Inspections and Examinations may make discretionary 
investments in any investment company registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a et seq., provided that the registered 
investment company is diversified pursuant to section 5(b)(1) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1). The Directors of 
the Division of Investment Management and the Office of Compliance 
Inspections and Examinations, in consultation with the Office of the 
General Counsel, shall determine in writing whether Senior Executive 
Service positions in their respective Division or Office whose duties do 
not include fund matters also may invest in nondiversified registered 
investment companies.
    (l) No member or employee shall have a beneficial interest in any 
broker, dealer or investment adviser through ownership of securities or 
otherwise. However, if a corporation acquires or establishes a 
subsidiary or affiliate subject to regulation by the Commission 
(regulated entity),
    (1) A member or employee may retain his or her existing holdings in 
the corporation, provided the security was originally acquired in 
compliance with

[[Page 124]]

the provisions of this rule or prior to entry on duty with the 
Commission.
    (2) Purchases of the corporation's shares will be permitted so long 
as the regulated entity subsidiary or affiliate provides less than 10% 
of the corporation's gross revenue. Except for reinvestment of cash 
dividends, additional purchases are prohibited when the regulated entity 
provides 10% or more of the corporation's gross revenues.
    (3) A member or employee who owns shares in a corporation with a 
regulated entity subsidiary or affiliate is disqualified from 
participating in any matter including rulemaking which affects the 
regulated entity unless the disqualification is waived in accordance 
with the provisions of Rule 6, of this section, 17 CFR 200.735-6, and 18 
U.S.C. 208(b).
    (m)(1) Annually, in accordance with the procedures adopted by the 
Director of Personnel, every member and employee shall furnish the 
Director of Personnel with a complete list of all securities in which he 
or she has an interest. Employees having no interests in securities and 
required to so state.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this 
section, members and employees shall report every acquisition or sale of 
any security within five business days of the transaction date or date 
confirmation is received. (Reports submitted by employees in field 
offices must be placed in the mails within five business days of the 
transaction date or date the confirmation is received for each 
transaction.)
    (3) Members and employees shall report only the initial purchase and 
final sale of shares in a money market fund.
    (4) Changes in holdings, other than by purchase, which do not affect 
disqualification, such as those resulting from the automatic 
reinvestment of dividends, stock splits, stock dividends or 
reclassifications, may be reported on the annual statement rather than 
when notification of the transaction is received. But, the acquisition 
of holdings by, for example, gifts, inheritance or spin-offs, which may 
result in additional disqualifications pursuant to Rule 6 of this 
section, 17 CFR 200.735-6, and 18 U.S.C. 208 shall be reported within 
five days of the receipt of the notice of the change in holdings.
    (n) At the time of taking the oath of office, or prior thereto if 
requested by the Director of Personnel, a new member or employee shall 
provide to the Office of Personnel, as requested, information relating 
to--
    (1) Securities owned by or held for the benefit of him or her, or 
his or her spouse or unemancipated minor child, or a member of his or 
her immediate household, or by any trust or estate of which he or she is 
a trustee or other fiduciary or beneficiary, or by any person for whom 
he or she effects transactions under a power of attorney or otherwise;
    (2) Accounts with securities firms;
    (3) Close relatives (i.e., children, parents, grandparents, 
siblings, aunts, uncles, or like relations of a spouse), who are 
partners or officers of securities firms, investment advisers, or 
registered public utility holding companies or their affiliates;
    (4) The holding of office in or being a director of any company 
which has public security holders; and
    (5) Such other information as may be required by the Director of 
Personnel.

Employees are required to advise the Office of Personnel of changes in 
the foregoing information within ten business days of the time the new 
information is learned.
    (o) Paragraphs (b), (m), and (n) of this section do not apply to 
personal notes, individual real estate mortgages, securities issued by 
the U.S. Government or its agencies, and securities issued by building 
and loan associations or cooperatives.
    (p) Any member or employee who is a trustee or other fiduciary or a 
beneficiary of a trust or estate holding securities not exempted by 
paragraph (o) of this section, shall report the existence and nature of 
such trust or estate to the Director of Personnel. The transactions of 
such trust or estate, which is not a qualified blind trust, shall be 
subject to all the provisions of this section except if the member or 
employee did not create the trust, is solely a beneficiary, has no power 
to control, and does not in fact control or advise with respect to the 
investments

[[Page 125]]

of the trust or estate, unless the Commission shall otherwise direct in 
view of the circumstances of the particular case.
    (q) The Director of Personnel, or his designee, is authorized to 
require the disposition of securities acquired as a result of a 
violation of the provisions of this section, whether unintentional or 
not. Repeated violations shall be reported to the Commission for 
appropriate action.
    (r) Any member or employee who believes that the application of any 
of the provisions of this rule will result in undue hardship in a 
particular case may make a written application to the Commission 
(through the Director of Personnel) setting out, in detail, the reasons 
for that belief and requesting a waiver. However, as a matter of policy 
the Commission favors a strict interpretation of the provisions of this 
rule.

<R05>
Sec. 200.735-6  Action in case of personal interest.

    Any employee assigned to work on any application, filing or matter 
of a company (a) in which he or she or his or her spouse or his or her 
minor unemancipated child then owns any securities or has a personal 
interest, including a continuing financial interest in a pension or 
retirement plan, shared income, or other arrangement, as a result of any 
current or prior employment or business or professional association; or 
(b) with which he or she has been employed or associated in the past 5 
years; or (c) which was a client of a firm with which he or she had been 
associated, shall immediately advise his or her Division Director or 
other Office Head or Regional Director of the fact. Division Directors, 
Office Heads and Regional Directors are authorized to direct the 
reporting employee to continue with the assignment in question where 
this appears in the interest of the Government, taking into account (1) 
the prohibitions stated in Sec. 200.735-3(b) (7) and (8); (2) the 
general desirability of avoiding situations that require a question of 
conflict of interest to be resolved; (3) the extent to which the 
employee's activities will be supervised; and (4) the difficulty of 
assigning the matter to some other employee. Where the employee in 
question is not relieved of the assignment, his or her written report 
concerning the nature of his or her interest shall be forwarded to the 
Director of Personnel with a notation that he or she has been directed 
to continue the assignment, together with such explanation, if any, as 
may seem appropriate. In the event that a Division Director, Office Head 
or Regional Director deems that he or she has, himself or herself, such 
a personal interest in an application, filing or matter of a company as 
may raise a question as to his or her disinterestedness, he or she may 
delegate his or her responsibility with regard thereto to a subordinate, 
but in that event shall submit a brief memorandum of the circumstances 
to the Director of Personnel. \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ 18 U.S.C. 208, provides among other things, that a member or 
employee is prohibited from participating personally and substantially 
in any matter in which to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, 
partner, organization in which he is serving as an officer, director, 
trustee, partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he 
is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, 
has a financial interest. This section (of the Criminal Code) does not 
apply if the employee has received a written determination made by an 
authorized official that the interest is not so substantial as to be 
deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee's service. Note: 
Members of the Commission may follow the procedural provision contained 
in Part V, Section 503 of the Executive Order 11222.

<R05>
Sec. 200.735-7  Negotiation for employment.

    (a) An employee may not negotiate employment with anyone outside the 
Commission with whom he or she is personally transacting business in any 
matter on behalf of the Commission or the United States, or while he or 
she is immediately or personally engaged in representing the Commission 
in any matter in which the prospective employer is a participant or 
witness or counsel for such a person, whether or

[[Page 126]]

not such a person takes a substantive position in an adversary 
proceeding in opposition to the Commission's position.
    (b) An employee who wishes to negotiate employment with another 
Government agency at a time when he or she is representing the 
Commission in a particular matter in which the other Government agency 
is taking a position adverse to the Commission should disclose this 
intention to his or her Division Director, Office Head or Regional 
Administrator prior to taking any action.
    (c) No employee shall undertake to act personally on behalf of the 
Commission in any capacity in a matter \19\ that, to his or her 
knowledge, affects even indirectly any person or organization outside 
the Commission with whom he or she is discussing or entertaining any 
proposal for future employment, except pursuant to the direction of the 
Commission, his or her Division Director, Office Head, or Regional 
Administrator, as provided in Sec. 200.735-6. See footnote 18.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Employees should bear in mind that in this connection the word 
matter is construed very broadly. See 200.735-8 and footnote 20, 
thereto, infra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-8  Practice by former members and employees of the Commission.

    (a)(1) No person shall appear in a representative capacity before 
the Commission in a particular matter if such person, or one 
participating with him or her in the particular matter, participated 
personally and substantially in that matter while he or she was a member 
or employee of the Commission. \20\ As used in this rule, a matter means 
a discrete and isolatable transaction or set of transactions between 
identifiable parties. \21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ As used in this paragraph, a single investigation or formal 
proceeding, or both if they are related, shall be presumed to constitute 
a particular matter for at least 2 years irrespective of changes in the 
issues. However, in cases of proceedings in which the issues change from 
time to time, such as proceedings involving compliance with section 11 
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (15 U.S.C. 79k), this 
paragraph shall not be construed as prohibiting appearance in such a 
proceeding, more than two years after ceasing to be a member or employee 
of the Commission, unless it appears to the Commission that there is 
such an identity of particular issues or pertinent facts as to make it 
likely that confidential information, derived while a member or employee 
of the Commission, would have continuing relevance to the proceeding, so 
as to make participation therein by the former member or employee of the 
Commission unethical or prejudicial to the interests of the Commission.
    \21\ This definition is taken from Formal Opinion 342 of the ABA 
Ethics Committee. The opinion states that ``work as a government 
employee in drafting, enforcing or interpreting government or agency 
procedures, regulations or laws, or in briefing abstract principles of 
law, does not disqualify the lawyer under DR9-101B (which states `a 
lawyer shall not accept private employment in a matter in which he had 
substantial responsibility while he was a public employee') from 
subsequent private employment involving the same regulation procedures, 
or points of law * * *.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) No person who has been a member or employee shall, within 2 
years after his or her employment has ceased, assist, by personal 
presence, a person appearing in a representative capacity before the 
Commission in any matter in which he or she participated personally and 
substantially while a member or employee of the Commission at any time 
within a period of 1 year prior to the termination of such 
responsibility.
    (3) No person who has been a member or an employee shall, within 2 
years after his or her employment has ceased, appear in a representative 
capacity before the Commission in any matter which was under his or her 
official responsibility as a member or employee of the Commission at any 
time within a period of 1 year prior to the termination of such 
responsibility. The term official responsibility as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
202 means the ``direct administrative or operating authority, whether 
intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone or with others, and 
either personally or through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or 
otherwise direct Government action.''
    (4) No employee in a position which is designated by the Director of 
the Office of Government Ethics shall, within one year after his or her 
employment has ceased, appear in a representative capacity before the 
Commission or

[[Page 127]]

communicate with the Commission or its employees with the intent to 
influence. \22\ This restriction does not apply to members who ceased 
employment before July 1, 1979, or to employees who ceased employment 
prior to February 28, 1980.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ This prohibition appears in the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978. Pub. L. 95-521.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b)(1) Any former member or employee of the Commission who, within 2 
years after ceasing to be such, is employed or retained as the 
representative of any person outside the Government in any matter in 
which it is contemplated that he or she will appear before the 
Commission, or communicate with the Commission or its employees, shall, 
within ten days of such retainer or employment, or of the time when 
appearance before, or communication with the Commission or its employees 
is first contemplated, file with the Secretary of the Commission a 
statement which includes:
    (i) A description of the contemplated representation;
    (ii) An affirmative representation that the former employee while on 
the Commission's staff had neither personal and substantial 
responsibility nor official responsibility for the matter which is the 
subject of the representation; and
    (iii) The name of the Commission Division or Office in which the 
person had been employed.
    (2) Employment of a recurrent character may be covered by a single 
comprehensive statement. Each such statement should include an 
appropriate caption indicating that it is filed pursuant to this 
section. The reporting requirements of this paragraph do not apply to
    (i) Communications incidental to court appearances in litigation 
involving the Commission; and
    (ii) Oral communications concerning ministerial or informational 
matters or requests for oral advice not otherwise prohibited by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) As used in this section, the term appear before the commission 
means physical presence before the Commission or its employees in either 
a formal or informal setting or the conveyance of material in connection 
with a formal appearance or application to the Commission. As used in 
this section the term communication with intent to influence does not 
encompass communications which are not for the purpose of influencing 
the Commission or any of its employees or which, at the time of the 
filings, are reasonably believed not to involve any potential 
controversy. As used in this section, the term representative or 
representative capacity shall include not only the usual type of 
representation by an attorney, etc., but also representation of a 
corporation in the capacity of an officer, director or controlling 
stockholder thereof.
    (d)(1) Partners or associates of any person disqualified from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission in a particular matter by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section are also disqualified. Such partners or 
associates (the firm) may request a waiver of this prohibition from the 
Commission by writing a letter to the General Counsel of the commission 
setting forth the facts of the proposed representation and the 
individual's disqualification. In appropriate situations, a firm may 
request a generic waiver with respect to a number of different matters. 
Upon the advice of the Office of the General Counsel, the Commission, or 
the General Counsel exercising delegated authority, will advise the 
requestor of the Commission's response.
    (2) Waivers ordinarily will be granted where the firm makes a 
satisfactory representation that it has adopted screening measures which 
will effectively isolate the individual lawyer disqualified under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section from participating in the particular 
matter or matters and from sharing in any fees attributable to it. It 
will be considered significant for purposes of this determination that:
    (i) The firm had a pre-existing securities law practice prior to the 
arrival of the disqualified attorney;
    (ii) The matter was previously the subject of consideration by the 
firm or the client was already advised by the firm;
    (iii) In cases where the matter or client became the subject of 
consideration by the firm subsequent to the

[[Page 128]]

firm's employment of the lawyer individually disqualified, that the 
matter was not brought to the firm because of the disqualified attorney.
    (3) Notwithstanding the existence or non-existence of any of these 
factors, no waiver will be issued if the proposed representation would 
create a significant appearance of impropriety or would otherwise 
adversely affect the interests of the government. \23\ All proceedings 
with respect to waivers shall be a matter of public record except to the 
extent that such public disclosure might violate attorney-client 
privilege or breach the attorney's obligation to preserve the 
confidences and secrets of this or her clients, reveal the existence of 
ongoing private investigations, interfere with law enforcement 
proceedings, or otherwise be inconsistent with the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ For example, no waiver will be granted if, during the course of 
representing a client who has an interest with respect to a matter 
before the Commission, a firm employs, or accepts as a partner, a member 
of the staff or of the Commission who at any time during the course of 
that representation had direct and substantial responsibility for the 
same matter, and whose departure would result in a significant adverse 
impact upon that matter at the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Persons in doubt as to the applicability of any portion of this 
section may apply for an advisory ruling of the Commission. \24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ Attention of former members and employees is directed to Formal 
Opinion 342 of the Committee on Ethics of the American Bar Association, 
62 A.B.A.J. 517 (1975) and to 18 U.S.C. 207.

Sec. 200.735-9  Indebtedness.

    (a) The Securities and Exchange Commission considers the 
indebtedness of its members and employees to be essentially a matter of 
their own concern and will not be placed in the position of acting as a 
collection agency or of determining the validity or amount of contested 
debts. Nevertheless, failure on the part of an employee without good 
reason and in a proper and timely manner to honor debts acknowledged by 
him or her to be valid, or reduced to judgment by a court, or to make or 
to adhere to satisfactory arrangements for the settlement thereof, may 
be a cause for disciplinary action. In this connection each member and 
employee is expected to meet his or her responsibilities for payment of 
Federal, State and local taxes. For purposes of this section, in a 
proper and timely manner means in a manner which the agency determines 
does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government 
as his or her employer.
    (b) Compensation due members and employees is subject to garnishment 
for child support and alimony obligations. (42 U.S.C. 659).


<R05>

employment and financial interests required by the following provisions.
    (b) Prior to the time of entry on duty, or upon designation to a

    (2) A list of the names of the employee's creditors and the 
creditors of his or her spouse, unemancipated minor child or other 
member of his or her immediate household, other than those creditors to 
whom any such person may be indebted by reason of a mortgage on property 
which he or she occupies as a personal residence, or to whom such person 
may be indebted for current and ordinary household and living expenses 
such as those incurred for household furnishings, vacations, an 
automobile, education, or the like.
    (3) A list of the employee's interests and those of his or her

household means a resident of the employee's household who is related to 
the employee by blood or marriage.
    (5) In the instance where a spouse is not a member of the employee's 
immediate household, and the employee certifies he or she neither 
derives nor expects to derive any economic benefit from the holdings of 
the spouse, the Director of Personnel may waive the requirement of 
reporting the interests of such spouse.

    (d) Changes in, or additions to, the information contained in an 
employee's statement of employment and financial interests shall be 
reported in a supplementary statement as of May 15 of each year. If no 
changes or additions occur, a negative report is required. 
Notwithstanding the filing of the annual report required by this 
paragraph, each employee shall at all times avoid acquiring a financial 
interest that could result, or taking an action that would result, in a 
violation of the conflict-of-interest provisions of section 208 of title 
18 U.S.C., or of this Conduct Regulation.
    (e) If any information required to be included on a statement of 
employment and financial interest or supplementary statement, including 
holdings placed in trust, is not known to the employee but is known to 
another person, the employee shall request that other person to submit 
information in his or her behalf.
    (f) Paragraph (c) of this section does not require an employee to 
submit any information relating to his or her connection with, or 
interest in, a non-profit educational, charitable, religious, 
professional, social, fraternal, recreational, public service, civic, or 
political organization, or a similar organization not conducted as a 
business enterprise. For the purpose of this section, educational and 
other institutions doing research and development or related work 
involving grants of money from or contracts with the Government are 
deemed business enterprises and are required to be included in an 
employee's statement of employment and financial interests.
    (g) Statements of employment and financial interests filed pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section shall be sent to the Director of 
Personnel in a sealed envelope marked ``Confidential Employment and 
Financial Interests.'' They shall be maintained in a confidential file. 
Only those officials of the Commission whose participation is necessary 
for the carrying out of the purpose of this Conduct Regulation may have 
access to such statements and no information may be disclosed from them 
except as the Commission or the Office of Personnel Management may 
determine for good cause shown.
    (h) In accordance with the requirements of the Ethics in Government 
Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-521, the Director of Personnel or the Assistant 
Director of Personnel shall review the financial disclosure reports 
filed pursuant to that Act.
    (i) The Director of Personnel or the Assistant Director of Personnel 
shall examine the statements of employment and financial interests filed 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to determine whether conflicts 
of interest or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of employees 
exist. An employee shall be afforded the opportunity to explain any 
conflict or appearance of conflict. When the Director or Assistant 
Director of Personnel, in consultation with appropriate superiors of the 
employee involved, is unable to resolve a conflict or appearance of 
conflict, he or she shall report the matter to the Commission through 
the Counselor for the Commission designated under Sec. 200.735-15(a).
    (j) The Counselor for the Commission shall examine statements filed 
by the Director of Personnel and the Assistant Director of Personnel.

[[Page 131]]

    (k) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section 
the statement of employment and financial interests and supplementary 
statements required of employees are in addition to, and not in 
substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement imposed 
by law, order or regulation. The submission of a statement by an 
employee does not permit him or her or any other person to participate 
in a matter in which his or her or the other person's participation is 
prohibited by law, order or regulation.
    (l) An employee has the right to ask for a review through the 
Commission's grievance procedure outlined in section 771, Part II, 
Manual of Administrative Regulations, of a complaint that his or her 
position has been improperly included under the provisions of this 
section as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment and 
financial interests.

<R05>
Sec. 200.735-12  Special Government employees.

    (a) Special Government employee means a person defined in section 18 
U.S.C. 202 as a special Government employee. All of the provisions of 
this Conduct Regulation are applicable to special Government employees, 
except that in specific appropriate cases the Commission may exempt such 
employees from, or modify the applicability of, any portion of any 
provision of the Conduct Regulation.
    (b) In no event will the Commission waive a provision of the Conduct 
Regulation which would permit a special Government employee to:
    (1) Use his or her Government employment for a purpose that is, or 
gives the appearance of being, motivated by the desire for private gain 
for himself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has 
family, business, or financial ties.
    (2) Use inside information obtained as a result of his or her 
Government employment for private gain for himself or herself or another 
person either by direct action on his or her part or by counsel, 
recommendation, or suggestion to another person, particularly one with 
whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties. For purposes of 
this paragraph, inside information means information obtained under 
Government authority which has not become part of the body of public 
information.
    (3) Use his or her Government employment to coerce, or give the 
appearance of coercing, a person to provide financial benefit to himself 
or herself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has 
family, business, or financial ties.
    (4) Receive or solicit from a person having business with the 
Commission anything of value as a gift, gratuity, loan, entertainment, 
or favor for himself or herself or another person, particularly one with 
whom he or she has family, business or financial ties.
    (c) Prior to entrance on duty, each special Government employee 
shall submit to the Director of Personnel a statement of employment and 
financial interests which contains such information as the Director of 
Personnel determines is relevant in the light of the duties the special 
Government employee is to perform and, if appropriate, the financial 
disclosure report as provided by title II of the Ethics in Government 
Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-521. It shall be kept current throughout the 
period of employment by the filing of supplementary statements in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 200.735-11(d). Statements 
shall be on the official form made available for this purpose through 
the Office of Personnel.
    (d) The Commission may waive the requirement of paragraph (c) of 
this section in the case of a special Government employee who is not a 
consultant or an expert, as those terms are defined in chapter 304 of 
the Federal Personnel Manual (5 CFR 735.304), if the duties of the 
position are determined to be at a level of responsibility which does 
not require the submission of such statement to protect the integrity of 
the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-13  Disciplinary and other remedial action.

    (a) Knowing participation in a violation of this subpart by persons 
not within the scope of the foregoing rules in this subpart shall 
likewise be

[[Page 132]]

deemed improper conduct and in contravention of Commission rules. 
Departure from any of the rules in this subpart by employees or special 
Government employees without specific approval may be cause for 
appropriate remedial and/or disciplinary action or, in the case of 
former members, employees, and special Government employees, for 
disqualification from appearing and practicing before the Commission, 
which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.
    (b) When there has been a departure from any of the rules of this 
subpart without specific approval or when a conflict of interest or an 
apparent conflict of interest on the part of an employee or special 
Government employee arises, the Director of Personnel may order 
immediate action to end such conflict or appearance of conflict of 
interest. Remedial action may include, but is not limited to (1) changes 
in assigned duties; (2) divestment by the employee or special Government 
employee of his conflicting interest; (3) disciplinary action; or (4) 
disqualification for a particular assignment. Remedial action, whether 
disciplinary or otherwise, shall be effected in accordance with any 
applicable laws, Executive Orders, and regulations. The Director of 
Personnel may refer any recommended action to the Commission. The 
employee may obtain review by the Commission of any action ordered to be 
taken by the Director of Personnel. During the period of review, unless 
otherwise directed by the Commission, the action ordered by the Director 
of Personnel is stayed.
    (c) Former members or employees who violate the post-employment 
restriction provisions of 18 U.S.C. 207(a), (b) or (c), which parallel 
the provisions of Rule 8(a), supra, will be subject to an administrative 
enforcement proceeding as set forth in Rule 102(e) of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice, Sec. 201.102(e) of this chapter, except that, when 
proceedings are brought to determine if violations of post-employment 
restrictions have occurred, denial of the privilege of appearing and 
practicing before the Commission will be based on a finding of violation 
of the provisions of Rule 8(a) and 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) and (c). 
Procedures applicable to such administrative proceedings are to be found 
in the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.100 et seq.

[[Page 133]]

violation of any provision of this Conduct Regulation or of the law will 
be brought to the attention of appropriate persons.
    (e) The Director of Personnel shall furnish a copy of this Conduct 
Regulation (subpart M) to each member, employee and special Government 
employee immediately upon his or her entrance on duty and shall

Subpart A [Reserved]


<R04>
   Subpart B_Regulations Pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act


<R05>
Sec. 201.31  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the Act in 
this subpart B), provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the 
Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over 
the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially 
justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in 
this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the 
proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, 
and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use in ruling 
on those applications.

[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.32  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to adversary adjudications described in Sec. 201.33 
pending or commenced before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985. 
It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after 
October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided 
that an application for fees and expenses, as described in these rules, 
has been filed with the Commission within 30 days after August 5, 1985. 
Proceedings which have been substantially concluded are not deemed 
pending under these rules although officially pending for purposes such 
as concluding remedial actions found in Commission orders or private 
undertakings.

[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.33  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Commission. These are on the record adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in 
which the position of an Office or Division of the Commission as a 
party, not including amicus participation, is presented by an attorney 
or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceeding. See appendix, 17 CFR 201.60.
    (b) The fact that the Commission has not identified a type of 
proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of 
an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the 
Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for 
resolution in proceedings on the application.

[[Page 142]]

    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.34  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks it seeks an award. The term party is 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all 
conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or public or private organization with a new worth of not 
more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an individual rather than a sole owner of an 
unincorporated business if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
subpart, unless the administrative law judge determines that such 
treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in 
light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In 
addition, the administrative law judge may determine that financial 
relationships of the applicant other than those described in this 
paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award 
unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.35  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or in a significant 
and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position 
of the Office or Division over which the applicant has prevailed was 
substantially justified. The position of the Office or Division 
includes, in addition to the position taken by the Office or Division in 
the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Office 
or Division upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden 
of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing 
applicant is on counsel for an Office or Division of the Commission, 
which must show that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding

[[Page 143]]

or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.36  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Subject to the limitation of paragraph (b), awards will be based 
on rates customarily charged, in the locale of the hearing, by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award of the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the reasonable rate at which the Commission pays witnesses with 
similar expertise. However, an award may also include the reasonable 
expenses of the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the 
attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for 
such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 201.41  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant, the proceeding for which an award is 
sought and contain the information required in this subpart. The 
application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and specify the 
position(s) of the opposing Office or Division in the proceeding that 
the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the 
applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number 
of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose 
of its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant

[[Page 144]]

wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what 
amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

<R05>
Sec. 201.42  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 201.34(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The 
administrative law judge or the Commission may require an applicant to 
file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that exhibit in accordance with 17 CFR 201.190.

Sec. 201.43  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The applicant may be required to provide 
vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses 
claimed.


<R05>
Sec. 201.44  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the 
Commission's final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on 
which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or 
any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or 
voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the 
Commission and to the courts.
    (c) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.

<R05>
Sec. 201.51  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other document related to an 
application shall be filed and served in the same manner as other papers 
in proceedings under the Commission's Rules of Practice. In addition, a 
copy of each application for fees and expenses shall be served on the 
General Counsel of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.52  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the Office or Division of the Commission may file an answer 
to the application. Unless the Office or Division of the

[[Page 145]]

Commission counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a 
statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, 
failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a 
consent to the award requested.
    (b) If counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission and the 
applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, 
they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a 
settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for 
filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may 
be granted upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain any objections to the award requested 
and identify the facts relied on in support of that position. If the 
answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the 
proceeding, it shall include supporting affidavits or a request for 
further proceedings under Sec. 201.55.


<R05>
Sec. 201.53  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 201.55.


<R05>
Sec. 201.54  Settlement.

    The applicant and counsel for the Office or Division of the 
Commission may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final 
action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the 
underlying proceeding or after the underlying proceeding has been 
concluded, in accordance with the Commission's standard settlement 
procedure. See 17 CFR 201.240. If a prevailing party and counsel for the 
Office or Division of the Commission agree on a proposed settlement of 
an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be 
filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement provides 
that each side shall bear its own expenses, and the settlement is 
accepted, no application may be filed.

<R05>
Sec. 201.55  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission, or on his or 
her own initiative, the administrative law judge may order further 
proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional 
written submissions or, as to issues other than substantial 
justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of 
fees and expenses) an evidentiary hearing. The administrative law judge 
may order all proceedings that are otherwise available under Sec. 
201.221 and Sec. 201.222(a). Such further proceedings shall be held 
only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising 
from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. 
Whether or not the Commission's position was substantially justified 
shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a 
whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and 
other expenses are sought.
    (b) A request for further proceedings under this section shall 
specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and 
shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve 
the issues.

<R05>
Sec. 201.56  Decision.

    The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the 
application promptly after completion of proceedings on the application. 
The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the 
applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at 
issue, findings on whether the Commission's position was substantially 
justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or 
whether special circumstances make an award unjust.

<R05>
Sec. 201.57  Commission review.

    In accordance with the procedures set forth in 17 CFR 201.410 and 
201.411, either the applicant or counsel for the Office or Division of 
the Commission may seek review of the initial decision on the fee 
application, or the Commission may decide to review the decision on its 
own initiative. If neither the applicant nor counsel for the Division or 
Office of the Commission seeks review and the Commission does not take 
review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application 
shall become a final decision of the Commission 30 days after it is 
issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion 
of the Commission. If review is taken, the Commission will issue a final 
decision on the application or remand the application to the 
administrative law judge for further proceedings.

    Judicial review of final Commission decisions on awards may be 
sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).

    An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the 
Comptroller of the Commission a copy of the Commission's final decision 
granting the award, accompanied by a sworn statement that the applicant 
will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. The

law, unless judicial review of the award has been sought by the 
applicant.

    (B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action 
brought by the Commission to which he or she is a party or found by the 
Commission in any administrative proceeding to which he or she is a 
party to have violated (unless the violation was found not to have been 
willful) or aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the 
Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing 
before the Commission in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this 
section may, within 30 days after service upon him or her of the order 
of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary 
suspension. If no petition has been received by the Commission within 30 
days after service of the order, the suspension shall become permanent.
    (iii) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the Commission shall either 
lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing at a 
time and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after 
opportunity for hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the 
petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a 
period of time or permanently. In every case in which the temporary 
suspension has not been lifted, every hearing held and other action 
taken pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) shall be expedited in accordance 
with Sec. 201.500. If the hearing is held before a hearing officer, the 
time limits set forth in Sec. 201.540 will govern review of the hearing 
officer's initial decision.
    (iv) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the staff of the Commission shall 
show either that the petitioner has been enjoined as described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section or that the petitioner has been 
found to have committed or aided and abetted violations as described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section and that showing, without more, 
may be the basis for censure or disqualification. Once that showing has 
been made, the burden shall be upon the petitioner to show cause why he 
or she should not be censured or temporarily or permanently disqualified 
from appearing and practicing before the Commission. In any such 
hearing, the petitioner may not contest any finding made against him or 
her or fact admitted by him or her in the judicial or administrative 
proceeding upon which the proceeding

[[Page 151]]

under this paragraph (e)(3) is predicated. A person who has consented to 
the entry of a permanent injunction as described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i)(A) of this section without admitting the facts set forth in 
the complaint shall be presumed for all purposes under this paragraph 
(e)(3) to have been enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the 
complaint.
    (4) Filing of prior orders. Any person appearing or practicing 
before the Commission who has been the subject of an order, judgment, 
decree, or finding as set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section 
shall promptly file with the Secretary a copy thereof (together with any 
related opinion or statement of the agency or tribunal involved). 
Failure to file any such paper, order, judgment, decree or finding shall 
not impair the operation of any other provision of this section.
    (5) Reinstatement. (i) An application for reinstatement of a person 
permanently suspended or disqualified under paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(3) 
of this section may be made at any time, and the applicant may, in the 
Commission's discretion, be afforded a hearing; however, the suspension 
or disqualification shall continue unless and until the applicant has 
been reinstated by the Commission for good cause shown.
    (ii) Any person suspended under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall be reinstated by the Commission, upon appropriate application, if 
all the grounds for application of the provisions of that paragraph are 
subsequently removed by a reversal of the conviction or termination of 
the suspension, disbarment, or revocation. An application for 
reinstatement on any other grounds by any person suspended under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section may be filed at any time and the 
applicant shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing in the matter; 
however, such suspension shall continue unless and until the applicant 
has been reinstated by order of the Commission for good cause shown.
    (6) Other proceedings not precluded. A proceeding brought under 
paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section shall not preclude 
another proceeding brought under these same paragraphs.
    (7) Public hearings. All hearings held under this paragraph (e) 
shall be public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission on its own 
motion or after considering the motion of a party.
    (f) Practice defined. For the purposes of these Rules of Practice, 
practicing before the Commission shall include, but shall not be limited 
to:
    (1) Transacting any business with the Commission; and
    (2) The preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by any 
attorney, accountant, engineer or other professional or expert, filed 
with the Commission in any registration statement, notification, 
application, report or other document with the consent of such attorney, 
accountant, engineer or other professional or expert.

Sec. 201.151  Filing of papers with the Commission: Procedure.

    (a) When to file. All papers required to be served by a party upon 
any person shall be filed contemporaneously with the Commission. Papers 
required to be filed with the Commission must be received within the 
time limit, if any, for such filing. Filing with the Commission may be 
made by facsimile transmission if the party also contemporaneously 
transmits to the Commission a non-facsimile original with a manual 
signature. However, any person filing with the Commission by facsimile 
transmission will be responsible for assuring that the Commission 
receives a complete and legible filing within the time limit set for 
such filing.
    (b) Where to file. Filing of papers with the Commission shall be 
made by filing them with the Secretary. When a proceeding is assigned to 
a hearing officer, a person making a filing with the Secretary shall 
promptly provide to the hearing officer a copy of any such filing, 
provided, however, that the hearing officer may direct or permit filings 
to be made with him or her, in which event the hearing officer shall 
note thereon the filing date and promptly provide the Secretary with 
either the original or a copy of any such filings.
    (c) To whom to direct the filing. Unless otherwise provided, where 
the Commission has assigned a case to a hearing officer, all motions, 
objections, applications or other filings made during a proceeding prior 
to the filing of an initial decision therein, or, if no initial decision 
is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the filing of briefs with 
the Commission, shall be directed to and decided by the hearing officer.
    (d) Certificate of service. Papers filed with the Commission or a 
hearing officer shall be accompanied by a certificate stating the name 
of the person or persons served, the date of service, the method of 
service and the mailing address or facsimile telephone number to which 
service was made, if not made in person. If the method of service to any 
party is different from the method of service to any other party or the 
method for filing with the Commission, the

[[Page 156]]

certificate shall state why a different means of service was used.

    (2) Be typewritten or printed in 12-point or larger typeface or 
otherwise reproduced by a process that produces permanent and plainly

70 FR 72569, Dec. 5, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 201.153  Filing of papers: Signature requirement and effect.

    (a) General requirements. Following the issuance of an order 
instituting proceedings, every filing of a party represented by counsel 
shall be signed by at least one counsel of record in his or her name and 
shall state that counsel's business address and telephone number. A 
party who acts as his or her own counsel shall sign his or her 
individual name and state his or her address and telephone number on 
every filing.
    (b) Effect of signature. (1) The signature of a counsel or party 
shall constitute a certification that:
    (i) the person signing the filing has read the filing;
    (ii) to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief, 
formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing is well grounded in fact and 
is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, 
modification, or reversal of existing law; and
    (iii) the filing is not made for any improper purpose, such as to 
harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of 
adjudication.
    (2) If a filing is not signed, the hearing officer or the Commission 
shall strike the filing, unless it is signed promptly after the omission 
is called to the attention of the person making the filing.


<R05>
Sec. 201.154  Motions.

    (a) Generally. Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion 
shall be in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds 
therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be 
accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied

[[Page 157]]

upon. All written motions shall be served in accordance with Sec. 
201.150, be filed in accordance with Sec. 201.151, meet the 
requirements of Sec. 201.152, and be signed in accordance with Sec. 
201.153. The Commission or the hearing officer may order that an oral 
motion be submitted in writing. Unless otherwise ordered by the 
Commission or the hearing officer, if a motion is properly made to the 
Commission concerning a proceeding to which a hearing officer is 
assigned, the proceeding before the hearing officer shall continue 
pending the determination of the motion by the Commission. No oral 
argument shall be heard on any motion unless the Commission or the 
hearing officer otherwise directs.
    (b) Opposing and reply briefs. Except as provided in Sec. 201.401, 
briefs in opposition to a motion shall be filed within five days after 
service of the motion. Reply briefs shall be filed within three days 
after service of the opposition.
    (c) Length limitation. No motion (together with the brief in support 
of the motion), brief in opposition to the motion, or reply brief shall 
exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of any table of contents or table of 
authorities. The word limit shall not apply to any addendum that 
consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative 
provisions or rules, or relevant exhibits. Requests for leave to file 
motions and briefs in excess of 7,000 words are disfavored. A motion or 
brief, together with any accompanying brief, that does not exceed 15 
pages in length, exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, 
table of authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of copies of 
applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions, or rules and

presumptively considered to contain no more than 7,000 words. Any motion 
or brief that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by 
the attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the document 
complies with the length limitation set forth in this paragraph and 
stating the number of words in the document. The person preparing the 
certificate may rely on the word count of a word-processing program to 
prepare the document.

<R05>
Sec. 201.155  Default; motion to set aside default.

    (a) A party to a proceeding may be deemed to be in default and the 
Commission or the hearing officer may determine the proceeding against 
that party upon consideration of the record, including the order 
instituting proceedings, the allegations of which may be deemed to be 
true, if that party fails:
    (1) To appear, in person or through a representative, at a hearing 
or conference of which that party has been notified;
    (2) To answer, to respond to a dispositive motion within the time 
provided, or otherwise to defend the proceeding; or
    (3) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
commission or the hearing officer pursuant to Sec. 201.180(b).
    (b) A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a 
reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, 
and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In 
order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, 
the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of the initial 
decision, or the Commission, at any time, may for good cause shown set 
aside a default.


<R05>
Sec. 201.160  Time computation.

    (a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed in or 
allowed by these Rules of Practice or by order of the Commission, the 
day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of 
time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so 
computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal 
legal holiday (as defined in Sec. 201.104), in which event the period 
runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or 
Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal 
legal holidays

[[Page 158]]

shall be excluded from the computation when the period of time 
prescribed or allowed is seven days or less, not including any 
additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this 
section. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather or other 
conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing 
location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of 
the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal 
holiday.
    (b) Additional time for service by mail. If service is made by mail, 
three days shall be added to the prescribed period for response unless 
an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a date 
certain for filing. In the event that an order of the Commission or the 
hearing officer specifies a date certain for filing, no time shall be 
added for service by mail.

<R05>
Sec. 201.161  Extensions of time, postponements and adjournments.

    (a) Availability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
Commission, at any time, or the hearing officer, at any time prior to 
the filing of his or her initial decision or, if no initial decision is 
to be filed, at any time prior to the closing of the record, may, for 
good cause shown, extend or shorten any time limits prescribed by these 
Rules of Practice for the filing of any papers and may, consistent with 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, postpone or adjourn any hearing.
    (b) Considerations in determining whether to extend time limits or 
grant postponements, adjournments and extensions. (1) In considering all 
motions or requests pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, 
the Commission or the hearing officer should adhere to a policy of 
strongly disfavoring such requests, except in circumstances where the 
requesting party makes a strong showing that the denial of the request 
or motion would substantially prejudice their case. In determining 
whether to grant any requests, the Commission or hearing officer shall 
consider, in addition to any other relevant factors:
    (i) The length of the proceeding to date;
    (ii) The number of postponements, adjournments or extensions already 
granted;
    (iii) The stage of the proceedings at the time of the request;
    (iv) The impact of the request on the hearing officer's ability to 
complete the proceeding in the time specified by the Commission; and
    (v) Any other such matters as justice may require.
    (2) To the extent that the Commission has chosen a timeline under 
which the hearing would occur beyond the statutory 60-day deadline, this 
policy of strongly disfavoring requests for postponement will not apply 
to a request by a respondent to postpone commencement of a cease and 
desist proceeding hearing beyond the statutory 60-day period.
    (c)(1) Time limit. Postponements, adjournments or extensions of time 
for filing papers shall not exceed 21 days unless the Commission or the 
hearing officer states on the record or sets forth in a written order 
the reasons why a longer period of time is necessary.
    (2) Stay pending Commission consideration of offers of settlement. 
(i) If the Commission staff and one or more respondents in the 
proceeding file a joint motion notifying the hearing officer that they 
have agreed in principle to a settlement on all major terms, then the 
hearing officer shall stay the proceeding as to the settling 
respondent(s), or in the discretion of the hearing officer as to all 
respondents, pending completion of Commission consideration of the 
settlement offer. Any such stay will be contingent upon:
    (A) The settling respondent(s) submitting to the Commission staff, 
within fifteen business days of the stay, a signed offer of settlement 
in conformance with Sec. 201.240; and
    (B) Within twenty business days of receipt of the signed offer, the 
staff submitting the settlement offer and accompanying recommendation to 
the Commission for consideration.
    (ii) If the parties fail to meet either of these deadlines or if the 
Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the hearing officer must be 
promptly notified and, upon notification of the hearing officer, the 
stay shall lapse and the

[[Page 159]]

proceeding will continue. In the circumstance where:
    (A) A hearing officer has granted a stay because the parties have 
``agreed in principle to a settlement;''
    (B) The agreement in principle does not materialize into a signed 
settlement offer within 15 business days of the stay; and
    (C) The stay lapses, the hearing officer will not be required to 
grant another stay related to the settlement process until both parties 
have notified the hearing officer in writing that a signed settlement 
offer has been prepared, received by the Commission's staff, and will be 
submitted to the Commission.
    (iii) The granting of any stay pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall 
not affect any deadline set pursuant to Sec. 201.360.

<R05>
Sec. 201.180  Sanctions.

    (a) Contemptuous conduct--(1) Subject to exclusion or suspension. 
Contemptuous conduct by any person before the Commission or a hearing 
officer during any proceeding, including any conference, shall be 
grounds for the Commission or the hearing officer to:
    (i) Exclude that person from such hearing or conference, or any 
portion thereof; and/or
    (ii) Summarily suspend that person from representing others in the 
proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the duration, or any 
portion, of the proceeding.
    (2) Review procedure. A person excluded from a hearing or 
conference, or a counsel summarily suspended from practice for the 
duration or any portion of a proceeding, may seek review of the 
exclusion or suspension by filing with the Commission, within three days 
of the exclusion or suspension order, a motion to vacate the order. The 
Commission shall consider such motion on an expedited basis as provided 
in Sec. 201.500.
    (3) Adjournment. Upon motion by a party represented by counsel 
subject to an order of exclusion or suspension, an adjournment shall be 
granted to allow the retention of new counsel. In determining the length 
of an adjournment, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider, in 
addition to the factors set forth in Sec. 201.161, the availability of 
co-counsel for the party or of other members of a suspended counsel's 
firm.
    (b) Deficient filings; leave to cure deficiencies. The Commission or 
the hearing officer may reject, in whole or in part, any filing that 
fails to comply with any requirements of these Rules of Practice or of 
any order issued in the proceeding in which the filing was made. Any 
such filings shall not be part of the record. The Commission or the 
hearing officer may direct a party to cure any deficiencies and to 
resubmit the filing within a fixed time period.
    (c) Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing. The 
Commission or the hearing officer may enter a default pursuant to Sec. 
201.155, dismiss the case, decide the particular matter at issue against 
that person, or prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude 
testimony concerning that matter if a person fails:
    (1) To make a filing required under these Rules of Practice; or
    (2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
Commission or the hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 201.190  Confidential treatment of information in certain filings.

    (a) Application. An application for confidential treatment pursuant 
to the provisions of Clause 30 of Schedule A of the Securities Act of

Rule 104 thereunder, 17 CFR 250.104; Section 45(a) of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-44(a), and Rule 45a-1 thereunder, 17

15 U.S.C. 80b-10(a), shall be filed with the Secretary. The application 
shall be accompanied by a sealed copy of the materials as to which 
confidential treatment is sought.

[[Page 160]]

    (b) Procedure for supplying additional information. The applicant 
may be required to furnish in writing additional information with 
respect to the grounds for objection to public disclosure. Failure to 
supply the information so requested within 14 days from the date of 
receipt by the applicant of a notice of the information required shall 
be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion 
of the information to which the additional information relates, unless 
the Commission or the hearing officer shall otherwise order for good 
cause shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.
    (c) Confidentiality of materials pending final decision. Pending the 
determination of the application for confidential treatment, 
transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and 
other materials in connection with the application shall be placed under 
seal; shall be for the confidential use only of the hearing officer, the 
Commission, the applicant, and any other parties and counsel; and shall 
be made available to the public only in accordance with orders of the 
Commission.
    (d) Public availability of orders. Any final order of the Commission 
denying or sustaining an application for confidential treatment shall be 
made public. Any prior findings or opinions relating to an application 
for confidential treatment under this section shall be made public at 
such time as the material as to which confidentiality was requested is 
made public.


<R05>
Sec. 201.191  Adjudications not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.

    (a) Scope of the rule. This rule applies to every case of 
adjudication, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, pursuant to any statute which 
the Commission administers, where adjudication is not required to be 
determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing and 
which the Commission has not chosen to determine on the record after 
notice and opportunity for hearing.
    (b) Procedure. In every case of adjudication under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Commission shall give prompt notice of any adverse 
action or final disposition to any person who has requested the 
Commission to make (or not to make) any such adjudication, and furnish 
to any such person a written statement of reasons therefor. Additional 
procedures may be specified in rules relating to specific types of such 
adjudications. Where any such rule provides for the publication of a 
Commission order, notice of the action or disposition shall be deemed to 
be given by such publication.
    (c) Contents of the record. If the Commission provides notice and 
opportunity for the submission of written comments by parties to the 
adjudication or, as the case may be, by other interested persons, 
written comments received on or before the closing date for comments, 
unless accorded confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of 
the Commission, become a part of the record of the adjudication. The 
Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the record 
written comments filed with the Commission after the closing date.


<R05>
Sec. 201.192  Rulemaking: Issuance, amendment and repeal of rules of general application.

    (a) By petition. Any person desiring the issuance, amendment or 
repeal of a rule of general application may file a petition therefor 
with the Secretary. Such petition shall include a statement setting 
forth the text or the substance of any proposed rule or amendment 
desired or specifying the rule the repeal of which is desired, and 
stating the nature of his or her interest and his or her reasons for 
seeking the issuance, amendment or repeal of the rule. The Secretary 
shall acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the petition and refer it to 
the appropriate division or office for consideration and recommendation. 
Such recommendations shall be transmitted with the petition to the 
Commission for such action as the Commission deems appropriate. The 
Secretary shall notify the petitioner of the action taken by the 
Commission.
    (b) Notice of proposed issuance, amendment or repeal of rules. 
Except where the Commission finds that notice and public procedure are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, whenever 
the Commission proposes

[[Page 161]]

to issue, amend, or repeal any rule or regulation of general application 
other than an interpretive rule; general statement of policy; or rule of 
agency organization, procedure, or practice; or any matter relating to 
agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, 
benefits, or contracts, there shall first be published in the Federal 
Register a notice of the proposed action. Such notice shall include:
    (1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the rulemaking 
proceeding, with particular reference to the manner in which interested 
persons shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in such 
proceeding;
    (2) Reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and
    (3) The terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of 
the subjects and issues involved.


<R05>
Sec. 201.193  Applications by barred individuals for consent to associate.

                            Preliminary note

    This rule governs applications to the Commission by certain persons, 
barred by Commission order from association with brokers, dealers, 
municipal securities dealers, government securities brokers, government 
securities dealers, investment advisers, investment companies or 
transfer agents, for consent to become so associated. Applications made 
pursuant to this section must show that the proposed association would 
be consistent with the public interest. In addition to the information 
specifically required by the rule, applications should be supplemented, 
where appropriate, by written statements of individuals (other than the 
applicant) who are competent to attest to the applicant's character, 
employment performance, and other relevant information. Intentional 
misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 
18 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. and other provisions of law.
    The nature of the supervision that an applicant will receive or 
exercise as an associated person with a registered entity is an 
important matter bearing upon the public interest. In meeting the burden 
of showing that the proposed association is consistent with the public 
interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate 
that the proposed supervision, procedures, or terms and conditions of 
employment are reasonably designed to prevent a recurrence of the 
conduct that led to imposition of the bar. As an associated person, the 
applicant will be limited to association in a specified capacity with a 
particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms 
and conditions.
    Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that the proposed 
association is consistent with the public interest will be difficult to 
meet where the applicant is to be supervised by, or is to supervise, 
another barred individual. In addition, where an applicant wishes to 
become the sole proprietor of a registered entity and thus is seeking 
Commission consent notwithstanding an absence of supervision, the 
applicant's burden will be difficult to meet.
    In addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the Commission will consider the nature of the findings that 
resulted in the bar when making its determination as to whether the 
proposed association is consistent with the public interest. In this 
regard, attention is directed to Rule 5(e) of the Commission's Rules on 
Informal and Other Procedures, 17 CFR 202.5(e). Among other things, Rule 
5(e) sets forth the Commission's policy ``not to permit a * * * 
respondent [in an administrative proceeding] to consent to * * * [an] 
order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the * * * 
order for proceedings.'' Consistent with the rationale underlying that 
policy, and in order to avoid the appearance that an application made 
pursuant to this section was granted on the basis of such denial, the 
Commission will not consider any application that attempts to reargue or 
collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the Commission's bar 
order.

    (a) Scope of rule. Applications for Commission consent to associate, 
or to change the terms and conditions of association, with a registered 
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities 
broker, government securities dealer, investment adviser, investment 
company or transfer agent may be made pursuant to this section where a 
Commission order bars the individual from association with a registered 
entity and:
    (1) Such barred individual seeks to become associated with an entity 
that is not a member of a self-regulatory organization; or
    (2) The order contains a proviso that application may be made to the 
Commission after a specified period of time.
    (b) Form of application. Each application shall be supported by an 
affidavit, manually signed by the applicant, that addresses the factors 
set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. One original and three 
copies of the application shall be filed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 201.151,

[[Page 162]]

201.152 and 201.153. Each application shall include as exhibits:
    (1) A copy of the Commission order imposing the bar;
    (2) An undertaking by the applicant to notify immediately the 
Commission in writing if any information submitted in support of the 
application becomes materially false or misleading while the application 
is pending;
    (3) The following forms, as appropriate:
    (i) A copy of a completed Form U-4, where the applicant's proposed 
association is with a broker-dealer or municipal securities dealer;
    (ii) A copy of a completed Form MSD-4, where the applicant's 
proposed association is with a bank municipal securities dealer;
    (iii) The information required by Form ADV, 17 CFR 279.1, with 
respect to the applicant, where the applicant's proposed association is 
with an investment adviser;
    (iv) The information required by Form TA-1, 17 CFR 249b.100, with 
respect to the applicant, where the applicant's proposed association is 
with a transfer agent; and
    (4) A written statement by the proposed employer that describes:
    (i) The terms and conditions of employment and supervision to be 
exercised over such applicant and, where applicable, by such applicant;
    (ii) The qualifications, experience, and disciplinary records of the 
proposed supervisor(s) of the applicant;
    (iii) The compliance and disciplinary history, during the two years 
preceding the filing of the application, of the office in which the 
applicant will be employed; and
    (iv) The names of any other associated persons in the same office 
who have previously been barred by the Commission, and whether they are 
to be supervised by the applicant.
    (c) Required showing. The applicant shall make a showing 
satisfactory to the Commission that the proposed association would be 
consistent with the public interest.
    (d) Factors to be addressed. The affidavit required by paragraph (b) 
of this section shall address each of the following:
    (1) The time period since the imposition of the bar;
    (2) Any restitution or similar action taken by the applicant to 
recompense any person injured by the misconduct that resulted in the 
bar;
    (3) The applicant's compliance with the order imposing the bar;
    (4) The applicant's employment during the period subsequent to 
imposition of the bar;
    (5) The capacity or position in which the applicant proposes to be 
associated;
    (6) The manner and extent of supervision to be exercised over such 
applicant and, where applicable, by such applicant;
    (7) Any relevant courses, seminars, examinations or other actions 
completed by the applicant subsequent to imposition of the bar to 
prepare for his or her return to the securities business; and
    (8) Any other information material to the application.
    (e) Notification to applicant and written statement. In the event an 
adverse recommendation is proposed by the staff with respect to an 
application made pursuant to this section, the applicant shall be so 
advised and provided with a written statement of the reasons for such 
recommendation. The applicant shall then have 30 days to submit a 
written statement in response.
    (f) Concurrent applications. The Commission will not consider any 
application submitted pursuant to this section if any other application 
for consent to associate concerning the same applicant is pending before 
any self-regulatory organization.

<R05>
Sec. 201.200  Initiation of proceedings.

    (a) Order instituting proceedings: Notice and opportunity for 
hearing--(1) Generally. Whenever an order instituting proceedings is 
issued by the Commission, appropriate notice thereof shall be given to 
each party to the proceeding by the Secretary or another duly designated 
officer of the Commission. Each party shall be given notice of any 
hearing within a time reasonable in light of the circumstances, in

[[Page 163]]

advance of the hearing; provided, however, no prior notice need be given 
to a respondent if the Commission has authorized the Division of 
Enforcement to seek a temporary sanction ex parte.
    (2) Stop order proceedings: Additional persons entitled to notice. 
Any notice of a proceeding relating to the issuance of a stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement pursuant to 
Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(d), shall be 
sent to or served on the issuer; or, in the case of a foreign government 
or political subdivision thereof, sent to or served on the underwriter; 
or, in the case of a foreign or territorial person, sent to or served on 
its duly authorized representative in the United States named in the 
registration statement, properly directed in the case of telegraphic 
notice to the address given in such statement. In addition, if such 
proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the registration statement 
has become effective, notice of the proceeding shall be given to the 
agent for service named on the facing sheet of the registration 
statement and to each other person designated on the facing sheet of the 
registration statement as a person to whom copies of communications to 
such agent are to be sent.
    (b) Content of order. The order instituting proceedings shall:
    (1) State the nature of any hearing;
    (2) State the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the 
hearing is to be held;
    (3) Contain a short and plain statement of the matters of fact and 
law to be considered and determined, unless the order directs an answer 
pursuant to Sec. 201.220 in which case the order shall set forth the 
factual and legal basis alleged therefor in such detail as will permit a 
specific response thereto; and
    (4) State the nature of any relief or action sought or taken.
    (c) Time and place of hearing. The time and place for any hearing 
shall be fixed with due regard for the public interest and the 
convenience and necessity of the parties, other participants, or their 
representatives.
    (d) Amendment to order instituting proceedings--(1) By the 
Commission. Upon motion by a party, the Commission may, at any time, 
amend an order instituting proceedings to include new matters of fact or 
law.
    (2) By the hearing officer. Upon motion by a party, the hearing 
officer may, at any time prior to the filing of an initial decision or, 
if no initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the 
filing of final briefs with the Commission, amend an order instituting 
proceedings to include new matters of fact or law that are within the 
scope of the original order instituting proceedings.
    (e) Publication of notice of public hearings. Unless otherwise 
ordered by the Commission, notice of any public hearing shall be given 
general circulation by release to the public, by publication in the SEC 
News Digest and, where directed, by publication in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 201.201  Consolidation and severance of proceedings.

    (a) Consolidation. By order of the Commission or a hearing officer, 
proceedings involving a common question of law or fact may be 
consolidated for hearing of any or all the matters at issue in such 
proceedings. The Commission or the hearing officer may make such orders 
concerning the conduct of such proceedings as it deems appropriate to 
avoid unnecessary cost or delay. Consolidation shall not prejudice any 
rights under these Rules of Practice and shall not affect the right of 
any party to raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation 
had not occurred. For purposes of this section, no distinction is made 
between joinder and consolidation of proceedings.
    (b) Severance. By order of the Commission, any proceeding may be 
severed with respect to one or more parties. Any motion to sever must be 
made solely to the Commission and must include a representation that a 
settlement offer is pending before the Commission or otherwise show good 
cause.

<R05>
Sec. 201.202  Specification of procedures by parties in certain proceedings.

    (a) Motion to specify procedures. In any proceeding other than an 
enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a 
determination by a self-regulatory organization pursuant to Sec. Sec. 
201.420 and 201.421, or a proceeding to review a determination of the 
Board pursuant to Sec. Sec. 201.440 and 201.441, a party may, at any 
time up to 20 days prior to the start of a hearing, make a motion to 
specify the procedures necessary or appropriate for the proceeding with 
particular reference to:
    (1) Whether there should be an initial decision by a hearing 
officer;
    (2) Whether any interested division of the Commission may assist in 
the preparation of the Commission's decision; and
    (3) Whether there should be a 30-day waiting period between the 
issuance of the Commission's order and the date it is to become 
effective.
    (b) Objections; effect of failure to object. Any other party may 
object to the procedures so specified, and such party may specify such 
additional procedures as it considers necessary or appropriate. In the 
absence of such objection or such specification of additional 
procedures, such other party may be deemed to have waived objection to 
the specified procedures.
    (c) Approval required. Any proposal pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, even if not objected to by any party, shall be subject to 
the written approval of the hearing officer.
    (d) Procedure upon agreement to waive an initial decision. If an 
initial decision is waived pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
the hearing officer shall notify the Secretary and, unless the 
Commission directs otherwise within 14 days, no initial decision shall 
be issued.

<R05>
Sec. 201.210  Parties, limited participants and amici curiae.

    (a) Parties in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a 
proceeding to review a self-regulatory organization determination, or a 
proceeding to review a Board determination--(1) Generally. No person 
shall be granted leave to become a party or a non-party participant on a 
limited basis in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding 
to review a determination by a self-regulatory organization pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 201.420 and 201.421, or a proceeding to review a 
determination by the Board pursuant to Sec. Sec. 201.440 and 201.441, 
except as authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Disgorgement proceedings. In an enforcement proceeding, a person 
may state his or her views with respect to a proposed plan of 
disgorgement or file a proof of claim pursuant to Sec. 201.1103.
    (b) Intervention as a party--(1) Generally. In any proceeding, other 
than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding 
to review a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to review a 
Board determination, any person may seek leave to intervene as a party 
by filing a motion setting forth the person's interest in the 
proceeding. No person, however, shall be admitted as a party to a 
proceeding by intervention unless it is determined that leave to 
participate pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section would be 
inadequate for the protection of the person's interests.
    (i) In a proceeding under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 
1935, any representative of interested consumers or security holders, or 
any other person whose participation in the proceeding may be in the 
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, may be 
admitted as a party upon the filing of a written motion setting forth 
the person's interest in the proceeding.
    (ii) In a proceeding under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any 
representative of interested security holders, or any other person whose 
participation in the proceeding may be in the public interest or for the 
protection of investors, may be admitted as a party upon the filing of a 
written motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding.
    (2) Intervention as of right. (i) In proceedings under the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, any interested representative, 
agency, authority or instrumentality of the United States or any 
interested State, State commission, municipality or other political 
subdivision of a state shall be

[[Page 165]]

admitted as a party to any proceeding upon the filing of a written 
motion requesting leave to be admitted.
    (ii) In proceedings under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any 
interested State or State agency shall be admitted as a party to any 
proceeding upon the filing of a written motion requesting leave to be 
admitted.
    (c) Leave to participate on a limited basis. In any proceeding, 
other than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a 
proceeding to review a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to 
review a Board determination, any person may seek leave to participate 
on a limited basis as a non-party participant as to any matter affecting 
the person's interests:
    (1) Procedure. Motions for leave to participate shall be in writing, 
shall set forth the nature and extent of the movant's interest in the 
proceeding, and, except where good cause for late filing is shown, shall 
be filed not later than 20 days prior to the date fixed for the 
commencement of the hearing. Leave to participate pursuant to this 
paragraph (c) may include such rights of a party as the hearing officer 
may deem appropriate. Persons granted leave to participate shall be 
served in accordance with Sec. 201.150; provided, however, that a party 
to the proceeding may move that the extent of notice of filings or other 
papers to be provided to persons granted leave to participate be 
limited, or may move that the persons granted leave to participate bear 
the cost of being provided copies of any or all filings or other papers. 
Persons granted leave to participate shall be bound, except as may be 
otherwise determined by the hearing officer, by any stipulation between 
the parties to the proceeding with respect to procedure, including 
submission of evidence, substitution of exhibits, corrections of the 
record, the time within which briefs or exceptions may be filed or 
proposed findings and conclusions may be submitted, the filing of 
initial decisions, the procedure to be followed in the preparation of 
decisions and the effective date of the Commission's order in the case. 
Where the filing of briefs or exceptions or the submission of proposed 
findings and conclusions are waived by the parties to the proceedings, a 
person granted leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall 
not be permitted to file a brief or exceptions or submit proposed 
findings and conclusions except by leave of the Commission or of the 
hearing officer.
    (2) Certain persons entitled to leave to participate. The hearing 
officer is directed to grant leave to participate under this paragraph 
(c) to any person to whom it is proposed to issue any security in 
exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or 
property interests, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash, 
where the Commission is authorized to approve the terms and conditions 
of such issuance and exchange after a hearing upon the fairness of such 
terms and conditions.
    (3) Leave to participate in certain Commission proceedings by a 
representative of the United States Department of Justice, a United 
States Attorney's Office, or a criminal prosecutorial authority of any 
State or any other political subdivision of a State. The Commission or 
the hearing officer may grant leave to participate on a limited basis to 
an authorized representative of the United States Department of Justice, 
an authorized representative of a United States Attorney, or an 
authorized representative of any criminal prosecutorial authority of any 
State or any other political subdivision of a State for the purpose of 
requesting a stay during the pendency of a criminal investigation or 
prosecution arising out of the same or similar facts that are at issue 
in the pending Commission enforcement or disciplinary proceeding. Upon a 
showing that such a stay is in the public interest or for the protection 
of investors, the motion for stay shall be favored. A stay granted under 
this paragraph (c)(3) may be granted for such a period and upon such 
conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deems appropriate.
    (d) Amicus participation--(1) Availability. An amicus brief may be 
filed only if:
    (i) A motion for leave to file the brief has been granted;
    (ii) The brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties;

[[Page 166]]

    (iii) The brief is filed at the request of the Commission or the 
hearing officer; or
    (iv) The brief is presented by the United States or an officer or 
agency thereof, or by a State, Territory or Commonwealth.
    (2) Procedure. An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the 
motion for leave. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of 
the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae 
is desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae 
shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position 
the amicus will support, unless the Commission or hearing officer, for 
cause shown, grants leave for a later filing. In the event that a later 
filing is allowed, the order granting leave to file shall specify when 
an opposing party may reply to the brief. A motion of an amicus curiae 
to participate in oral argument will be granted only for extraordinary 
reasons.
    (e) Permission to state views. Any person may make a motion seeking 
leave to file a memorandum or make an oral statement of his or her 
views. Any such communication may be included in the record; provided, 
however, that unless offered and admitted as evidence of the truth of 
the statements therein made, any assertions of fact submitted pursuant 
to the provisions of this paragraph (e) will be considered only to the 
extent that the statements therein made are otherwise supported by the 
record.
    (f) Modification of participation provisions. The Commission or the 
hearing officer may, by order, modify the provisions of this section 
which would otherwise be applicable, and may impose such terms and 
conditions on the participation of any person in any proceeding as it 
may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest.

<R05>
Sec. 201.220  Answer to allegations.

    (a) When required. In its order instituting proceedings, the 
Commission may require any party to file an answer to each of the 
allegations contained therein. Even if not so ordered, any party in any 
proceeding may elect to file an answer. Any other person granted leave 
by the Commission or the hearing officer to participate on a limited 
basis in such proceedings pursuant to Sec. 201.210(c) may be required 
to file an answer.
    (b) When to file. Except where a different period is provided by 
rule or by order, a party required to file an answer as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall do so within 20 days after service 
upon the party of the order instituting proceedings. Persons granted 
leave to participate on a limited basis in the proceeding pursuant to 
Sec. 201.210(c) may file an answer within a reasonable time, as 
determined by the Commission or the hearing officer. If the order 
instituting proceedings is amended, the Commission or the hearing 
officer may require that an amended answer be filed and, if such an 
answer is required, shall specify a date for the filing thereof.
    (c) Contents; effect of failure to deny. Unless otherwise directed 
by the hearing officer or the Commission, an answer shall specifically 
admit, deny, or state that the party does not have, and is unable to 
obtain, sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the 
order instituting proceedings. When a party intends in good faith to 
deny only a part of an allegation, the party shall specify so much of it 
as is true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of a lack of 
information shall have the effect of a denial. A defense of res 
judicata, statute of limitations or any other matter constituting an 
affirmative defense shall be asserted in the answer. Any allegation not 
denied shall be deemed admitted.
    (d) Motion for more definite statement. A party may file with an 
answer a motion for a more definite statement of specified matters of 
fact or law to be considered or determined. Such motion shall state the 
respects in which, and the reasons why, each such matter of fact or law 
should be required to be made more definite. If the motion is granted, 
the order granting such motion shall set the periods for filing such a 
statement and any answer thereto.
    (e) Amendments. A party may amend its answer at any time by written 
consent of each adverse party or with leave of the Commission or the 
hearing

[[Page 167]]

officer. Leave shall be freely granted when justice so requires.
    (f) Failure to file answer: default. If a party respondent fails to 
file an answer required by this section within the time provided, such 
person may be deemed in default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(a). A party 
may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(b).


<R05>
Sec. 201.221  Prehearing conference.

    (a) Purposes of conference. The purposes of a prehearing conference 
include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Expediting the disposition of the proceeding;
    (2) Establishing early and continuing control of the proceeding by 
the hearing officer; and
    (3) Improving the quality of the hearing through more thorough 
preparation.
    (b) Procedure. On his or her own motion or at the request of a 
party, the hearing officer may, in his or her discretion, direct counsel 
or any party to meet for an initial, final or other prehearing 
conference. Such conferences may be held with or without the hearing 
officer present as the hearing officer deems appropriate. Where such a 
conference is held outside the presence of the hearing officer, the 
hearing officer shall be advised promptly by the parties of any 
agreements reached. Such conferences also may be held with one or more 
persons participating by telephone or other remote means.
    (c) Subjects to be discussed. At a prehearing conference 
consideration may be given and action taken with respect to any and all 
of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Exchange of witness and exhibit lists and copies of exhibits;
    (3) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and stipulations concerning 
the contents, authenticity, or admissibility into evidence of documents;
    (4) Matters of which official notice may be taken;
    (5) The schedule for exchanging prehearing motions or briefs, if 
any;
    (6) The method of service for papers other than Commission orders;
    (7) Summary disposition of any or all issues;
    (8) Settlement of any or all issues;
    (9) Determination of hearing dates;
    (10) Amendments to the order instituting proceedings or answers 
thereto;
    (11) Production of documents as set forth in Sec. 201.230, and 
prehearing production of documents in response to subpoenas duces tecum 
as set forth in Sec. 201.232;
    (12) Specification of procedures as set forth in Sec. 201.202; and
    (13) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly and expeditious 
disposition of the proceeding.
    (d) Required prehearing conference. Except where the emergency 
nature of a proceeding would make a prehearing conference clearly 
inappropriate, at least one prehearing conference should be held.
    (e) Prehearing orders. At or following the conclusion of any 
conference held pursuant to this section, the hearing officer shall 
enter a ruling or order which recites the agreements reached and any 
procedural determinations made by the hearing officer.
    (f) Failure to appear: default. Any person who is named in an order 
instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may be made or 
sanctions imposed and who fails to appear, in person or through a 
representative, at a prehearing conference of which he or she has been 
duly notified may be deemed in default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(a). A 
party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to Sec. 
201.155(b).

<R05>
Sec. 201.222  Prehearing submissions.

    (a) Submissions generally. The hearing officer, on his or her own 
motion, or at the request of a party or other participant, may order any

deemed appropriate, including any or all of the following:
    (1) An outline or narrative summary of its case or defense;
    (2) The legal theories upon which it will rely;
    (3) Copies and a list of documents that it intends to introduce at

    (4) A list of witnesses who will testify on its behalf, including 
the witnesses'

[[Page 168]]

names, occupations, addresses and a brief summary of their expected 
testimony.
    (b) Expert witnesses. Each party who intends to call an expert 
witness shall submit, in addition to the information required by 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a statement of the expert's 
qualifications, a listing of other proceedings in which the expert has 
given expert testimony, and a list of publications authored or co-
authored by the expert.


<R05>
Sec. 201.230  Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Availability of documents for inspection and copying.

    For purposes of this section, the term documents shall include 
writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings and other 
data compilations, including data stored by computer, from which 
information can be obtained.
    (a) Documents to be available for inspection and copying. (1) Unless 
otherwise provided by this section, or by order of the Commission or the 
hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall make available for 
inspection and copying by any party documents obtained by the Division 
prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the 
investigation leading to the Division's recommendation to institute 
proceedings. Such documents shall include:
    (i) Each subpoena issued;
    (ii) Every other written request to persons not employed by the 
Commission to provide documents or to be interviewed;
    (iii) The documents turned over in response to any such subpoenas or 
other written requests;
    (iv) All transcripts and transcript exhibits;
    (v) Any other documents obtained from persons not employed by the 
Commission; and
    (vi) Any final examination or inspection reports prepared by the 
Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, the Division of 
Market Regulation, or the Division of Investment Management, if the 
Division of Enforcement intends either to introduce any such report into 
evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of any 
witness.
    (2) Nothing in this paragraph (a) shall limit the right of the 
Division to make available any other document, or shall limit the right 
of a respondent to seek access to or production pursuant to subpoena of 
any other document, or shall limit the authority of the hearing officer 
to order the production of any document pursuant to subpoena.
    (b) Documents that may be withheld. (1) The Division of Enforcement 
may withhold a document if:
    (i) The document is privileged;
    (ii) The document is an internal memorandum, note or writing 
prepared by a Commission employee, other than an examination or 
inspection report as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, 
or is otherwise attorney work product and will not be offered in 
evidence;
    (iii) The document would disclose the identity of a confidential 
source; or
    (iv) The hearing officer grants leave to withhold a document or 
category of documents as not relevant to the subject matter of the 
proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
    (2) Nothing in this paragraph (b) authorizes the Division of 
Enforcement in connection with an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding 
to withhold, contrary to the doctrine of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 
87 (1963), documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
    (c) Withheld document list. The hearing officer may require the 
Division of Enforcement to submit for review a list of documents or 
categories of documents withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iv) of this section or to submit any document withheld, 
and may determine whether any such document should be made available for 
inspection and copying. When similar documents are withheld pursuant to 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section, those documents 
may be identified by category instead of by individual document. The 
hearing officer retains discretion to determine when an identification 
by category is insufficient.

[[Page 169]]

    (d) Timing of inspection and copying. Unless otherwise ordered by 
the Commission or the hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall 
commence making documents available to a respondent for inspection and 
copying pursuant to this section no later than 7 days after service of 
the order instituting proceedings. In a proceeding in which a temporary 
cease-and-desist order is sought pursuant to Sec. 201.510 or a 
temporary suspension of registration is sought pursuant to Sec. 
201.520, documents shall be made available no later than the day after 
service of the decision as to whether to issue a temporary cease-and-
desist order or temporary suspension order.
    (e) Place of inspection and copying. Documents subject to inspection 
and copying pursuant to this section shall be made available to the 
respondent for inspection and copying at the Commission office where 
they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties, 
in writing, may agree. A respondent shall not be given custody of the 
documents or leave to remove the documents from the Commission's offices 
pursuant to the requirements of this section other than by written 
agreement of the Division of Enforcement. Such agreement shall specify 
the documents subject to the agreement, the date they shall be returned 
and such other terms or conditions as are appropriate to provide for the 
safekeeping of the documents.
    (f) Copying costs and procedures. The respondent may obtain a 
photocopy of any documents made available for inspection. The respondent 
shall be responsible for the cost of photocopying. Unless otherwise 
ordered, charges for copies made by the Division of Enforcement at the 
request of the respondent will be at the rate charged pursuant to the 
fee schedule at 17 CFR 200.80e for copies. The respondent shall be given 
access to the documents at the Commission's offices or such other place 
as the parties may agree during normal business hours for copying of 
documents at the respondent's expense.
    (g) Issuance of investigatory subpoenas after institution of 
proceedings. The Division of Enforcement shall promptly inform the 
hearing officer and each party if investigatory subpoenas are issued 
under the same investigation file number or pursuant to the same order 
directing private investigation (``formal order'') under which the 
investigation leading to the institution of proceedings was conducted. 
The hearing officer shall order such steps as necessary and appropriate 
to assure that the issuance of investigatory subpoenas after the 
institution of proceedings is not for the purpose of obtaining evidence 
relevant to the proceedings and that any relevant documents that may be 
obtained through the use of investigatory subpoenas in a continuing 
investigation are made available to each respondent for inspection and 
copying on a timely basis.
    (h) Failure to make documents available--harmless error. In the 
event that a document required to be made available to a respondent 
pursuant to this section is not made available by the Division of 
Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or 
decided shall be required, unless the respondent shall establish that 
the failure to make the document available was not harmless error.

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995; 60 FR 46499, Sept. 7, 1995, as amended at 
68 FR 35789, June 17, 2003; 69 FR 13177, Mar. 19, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 201.231  Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Production of witness statements.

    (a) Availability. Any respondent in an enforcement or disciplinary 
proceeding may move that the Division of Enforcement produce for 
inspection and copying any statement of any person called or to be 
called as a witness by the Division of Enforcement that pertains, or is 
expected to pertain, to his or her direct testimony and that would be 
required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. For 
purposes of this section, statement shall have the meaning set forth in 
18 U.S.C. 3500(e). Such production shall be made at a time and place 
fixed by the hearing officer and shall be made available to any party, 
provided, however, that the production shall be made under conditions 
intended to preserve the items to be inspected or copied.
    (b) Failure to produce--harmless error. In the event that a 
statement required to be made available for inspection and

[[Page 170]]

copying by a respondent is not turned over by the Division of 
Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or 
decided shall be required unless the respondent establishes that the 
failure to turn over the statement was not harmless error.

<R05>
Sec. 201.232  Subpoenas.

    (a) Availability; procedure. In connection with any hearing ordered 
by the Commission, a party may request the issuance of subpoenas 
requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses at the designated 
time and place of hearing, and subpoenas requiring the production of 
documentary or other tangible evidence returnable at any designated time 
or place. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for issuance 
of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant 
to Sec. 201.150. A person whose request for a subpoena has been denied 
or modified may not request that any other person issue the subpoena.
    (1) Unavailability of hearing officer. In the event that the hearing 
officer assigned to a proceeding is unavailable, the party seeking 
issuance of the subpoena may seek its issuance from the first available 
of the following persons: The Chief Administrative Law Judge, the law 
judge most senior in service as a law judge, the duty officer, any other 
member of the Commission, or any other person designated by the 
Commission to issue subpoenas. Requests for issuance of a subpoena made 
to the Commission, or any member thereof, must be submitted to the 
Secretary, not to an individual Commissioner.
    (2) Signing may be delegated. A hearing officer may authorize 
issuance of a subpoena, and may delegate the manual signing of the 
subpoena to any other person authorized to issue subpoenas.
    (b) Standards for issuance. Where it appears to the person asked to 
issue the subpoena that the subpoena sought may be unreasonable, 
oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in 
his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the 
subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general 
relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence 
sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the person 
requested to issue the subpoena determines that the subpoena or any of 
its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly 
burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue it only 
upon such conditions as fairness requires. In making the foregoing 
determination, the person issuing the subpoena may inquire of the other 
participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be 
proved.
    (c) Service. Service shall be made pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 201.150 (b) through (d). The provisions of this paragraph (c) 
shall apply to the issuance of subpoenas for purposes of investigations, 
as required by 17 CFR 203.8, as well as hearings.
    (d) Tender of fees required. When a subpoena compelling the 
attendance of a person at a hearing or deposition is issued at the 
instance of anyone other than an officer or agency of the United States, 
service is valid only if the subpoena is accompanied by a tender to the 
subpoenaed person of the fees for one day's attendance and mileage 
specified by paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) Application to quash or modify. (1) Any person to whom a 
subpoena is directed, or who is an owner, creator or the subject of the 
documents that are to be produced pursuant to a subpoena, or any party 
may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event 
more than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena, request 
that the subpoena be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by 
application filed with the Secretary and served on all parties pursuant 
to Sec. 201.150. The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued may, 
within five days of service of the application, file an opposition to 
the application. If a hearing officer has been assigned to the 
proceeding, the application to quash shall be directed to that hearing 
officer for consideration, even if the subpoena was issued by another 
person.
    (2) Standards governing application to quash or modify. If 
compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly 
burdensome, the hearing officer or the Commission shall

[[Page 171]]

quash or modify the subpoena, or may order return of the subpoena only 
upon specified conditions. These conditions may include but are not 
limited to a requirement that the party on whose behalf the subpoena was 
issued shall make reasonable compensation to the person to whom the 
subpoena was addressed for the cost of copying or transporting evidence 
to the place for return of the subpoena.
    (f) Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses summoned before the 
Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to 
witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose 
depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be 
entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of 
the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party 
at whose instance the witnesses appear.

<R05>
Sec. 201.233  Depositions upon oral examination.

    (a) Procedure. Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness 
by deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why 
such deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the 
party believes the witness will be unable to attend or testify at the 
hearing; the name and address of the prospective witness; the matters 
concerning which the prospective witness is expected to be questioned; 
and the proposed time and place for the taking of the deposition.
    (b) Required finding when ordering a deposition. In the discretion 
of the Commission or the hearing officer, an order for a deposition may 
be issued upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give 
testimony material to the proceeding; that it is likely the prospective 
witness, who is then within the United States, will be unable to attend 
or testify at the hearing because of age, sickness, infirmity, 
imprisonment, other disability, or absence from the United States, 
unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the 
party requesting the deposition; and that the taking of a deposition 
will serve the interests of justice.
    (c) Contents of order. An order for deposition shall designate by 
name a deposition officer. The designated officer may be the hearing 
officer or any other person authorized to administer oaths by the laws 
of the United States or of the place where the deposition is to be held. 
An order for deposition also shall state:
    (1) The name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;
    (2) The scope of the testimony to be taken;
    (3) The time and place of the deposition;
    (4) The manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition; 
and
    (5) The number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to 
be filed upon completion of the deposition.
    (d) Procedure at depositions. A witness whose testimony is taken by 
deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put 
to him or her. Examination and cross-examination of deponents may 
proceed as permitted at a hearing. The witness being deposed may have 
counsel present during the deposition.
    (e) Objections to questions or evidence. Objections to questions or 
evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied 
upon. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the 
deposition officer upon the deposition, but a deposition officer other 
than the hearing officer shall not have the power to decide on the 
competency, materiality or relevance of evidence. Failure to object to 
questions or evidence before the deposition officer shall not be deemed 
a waiver unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been 
obviated or removed if presented at that time.
    (f) Filing of depositions. The questions propounded and all answers 
or objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a 
transcript prepared by the deposition officer, or under his or her 
direction. The transcript shall be subscribed by the witness and 
certified by the deposition officer. The original deposition and 
exhibits shall be filed with the Secretary. A copy of the deposition 
shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase at 
prescribed rates.

[[Page 172]]

    (g) Payment. The cost of the transcript shall be paid by the party 
requesting the deposition.

<R05>
Sec. 201.234  Depositions upon written questions.

    (a) Availability. Depositions may be taken and submitted on written 
questions upon motion of any party. The motion shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 201.233(a). A decision on the motion 
shall be governed by the provisions of Sec. 201.233(b).
    (b) Procedure. Written questions shall be filed with the motion. 
Within 10 days after service of the motion and written questions, any 
party may file objections to such written questions and any party may 
file cross-questions. When a deposition is taken pursuant to this 
section no persons other than the witness, counsel to the witness, the 
deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does not act as 
reporter, a reporter, shall be present at the examination of the 
witness. No party shall be present or represented unless otherwise 
permitted by order. The deposition officer shall propound the questions 
and cross-questions to the witness in the order submitted.
    (c) Additional requirements. The order for deposition, filing of the 
deposition, form of the deposition and use of the deposition in the 
record shall be governed by paragraphs (c) through (g) of Sec. 201.233, 
except that no cross-examination shall be made.


<R05>
Sec. 201.235  Introducing prior sworn statements of witnesses into the record.

    (a) At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn 
statement of a witness, not a party, otherwise admissible in the 
proceeding, may make a motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If 
only part of a statement is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may 
require that all relevant portions of the statement be introduced. If 
all of a statement is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may 
require that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A 
motion to introduce a prior sworn statement may be granted if:
    (1) The witness is dead;
    (2) The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that 
the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior 
sworn statement;
    (3) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, 
sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;
    (4) The party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,
    (5) In the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, it 
would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior 
sworn statement to be used. In making this determination, due regard 
shall be given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in 
an open hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn 
statement in lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given 
to the convenience of the parties in avoiding unnecessary expense.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 201.240  Settlement.

    (a) Availability. Any person who is notified that a proceeding may 
or will be instituted against him or her, or any party to a proceeding 
already instituted, may, at any time, propose in writing an offer of 
settlement.
    (b) Procedure. An offer of settlement shall state that it is made 
pursuant to this section; shall recite or incorporate as a part of the 
offer the provisions of paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this section; 
shall be signed by the person making the offer, not by counsel; and 
shall be submitted to the interested division.
    (c) Consideration of offers of settlement. (1) Offers of settlement 
shall be considered by the interested division when time, the nature of 
the proceedings, and the public interest permit.
    (2) Where a hearing officer is assigned to a proceeding, the 
interested division and the party submitting the offer may request that 
the hearing officer express his or her views regarding the 
appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for the hearing 
officer to express his or her views on an offer of settlement or 
otherwise to participate in a settlement conference

[[Page 173]]

constitutes a waiver by the persons making the request of any right to 
claim bias or prejudgment by the hearing officer based on the views 
expressed.
    (3) The interested division shall present the offer of settlement to 
the Commission with its recommendation, except that, if the division's 
recommendation is unfavorable, the offer shall not be presented to the 
Commission unless the person making the offer so requests.
    (4) By submitting an offer of settlement, the person making the 
offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:
    (i) All hearings pursuant to the statutory provisions under which 
the proceeding is to be or has been instituted;
    (ii) The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (iii) Proceedings before, and an initial decision by, a hearing 
officer;
    (iv) All post-hearing procedures; and
    (v) Judicial review by any court.
    (5) By submitting an offer of settlement the person further waives:
    (i) Such provisions of the Rules of Practice or other requirements 
of law as may be construed to prevent any member of the Commission's 
staff from participating in the preparation of, or advising the 
Commission as to, any order, opinion, finding of fact, or conclusion of 
law to be entered pursuant to the offer; and
    (ii) Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Commission based 
on the consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or 
any part of the proceeding.
    (6) If the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the person 
making the offer shall be notified of the Commission's action and the 
offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall 
not constitute a part of the record in any proceeding against the person 
making the offer, provided, however, that rejection of an offer of 
settlement does not affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to any discussions 
concerning the rejected offer of settlement.
    (7) Final acceptance of any offer of settlement will occur only upon 
the issuance of findings and an order by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.250  Motion for summary disposition.

    (a) After a respondent's answer has been filed and, in an 
enforcement or a disciplinary proceeding, documents have been made 
available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to 
Sec. 201.230, the respondent, or the interested division may make a 
motion for summary disposition of any or all allegations of the order 
instituting proceedings with respect to that respondent. If the 
interested division has not completed presentation of its case in chief, 
a motion for summary disposition shall be made only with leave of the 
hearing officer. The facts of the pleadings of the party against whom 
the motion is made shall be taken as true, except as modified by 
stipulations or admissions made by that party, by uncontested 
affidavits, or by facts officially noted pursuant to Sec. 201.323.
    (b) The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion for 
summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. The hearing 
officer may grant the motion for summary disposition if there is no 
genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the 
motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law. If it 
appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present by affidavit 
prior to hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, 
the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion. A hearing officer's 
decision to deny leave to file a motion for summary disposition is not 
subject to interlocutory appeal.
    (c) The motion for summary disposition, together with any supporting 
memorandum of points and authorities (exclusive of any declarations, 
affidavits, or attachments), shall not exceed 9,800 words. Requests for 
leave to file motions and accompanying documents in excess of 9,800 
words are disfavored. A motion that does not, together with any 
accompanying memorandum of points and authorities, exceed 35 pages in 
length, inclusive of pleadings incorporated by reference (but excluding

[[Page 174]]

any declarations, affidavits, or attachments) is presumptively 
considered to contain no more than 9,800 words. Any motion that exceeds 
these page limits must include a certificate by the attorney, or an 
unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the length 
limitation set forth in this paragraph and stating the number of words 
in the motion. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word 
count of a word-processing program to prepare the document.

                        Rules Regarding Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 201.300  Hearings.

    Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be held only upon 
order of the Commission. All hearings shall be conducted in a fair, 
impartial, expeditious and orderly manner.


<R05>
Sec. 201.301  Hearings to be public.

    All hearings, except hearings on applications for confidential 
treatment filed pursuant to Sec. 201.190, hearings held to consider a 
motion for a protective order pursuant to Sec. 201.322, and hearings on 
ex parte application for a temporary cease-and-desist order, shall be 
public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission on its own motion or 
the motion of a party. No hearing shall be nonpublic where all 
respondents request that the hearing be made public.


<R05>
Sec. 201.302  Record of hearings.

    (a) Recordation. Unless ordered otherwise by the hearing officer or 
the Commission, all hearings shall be recorded and a written transcript 
thereof shall be prepared.
    (b) Availability of a transcript. Transcripts of public hearings 
shall be available for purchase at prescribed rates. Transcripts of 
nonpublic proceedings, and transcripts subject to a protective order 
pursuant to Sec. 201.322, shall be available for purchase only by 
parties; provided, however, that any person compelled to submit data or 
evidence in a hearing may purchase a copy of his or her own testimony.
    (c) Transcript correction. Prior to the filing of post-hearing 
briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, or within such earlier time 
as directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, a party or witness 
may make a motion to correct the transcript. Proposed corrections of the 
transcript may be submitted to the hearing officer by stipulation 
pursuant to Sec. 201.324, or by motion. Upon notice to all parties to 
the proceeding, the hearing officer may, by order, specify corrections 
to the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 201.310  Failure to appear at hearings: Default.

    Any person named in an order instituting proceedings as a person 
against whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed who fails to 
appear at a hearing of which he or she has been duly notified may be 
deemed to be in default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(a). A party may make a 
motion to set aside a default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(b).


<R05>
Sec. 201.320  Evidence: Admissibility.

    The Commission or the hearing officer may receive relevant evidence 
and shall exclude all evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial or unduly 
repetitious.


<R05>
Sec. 201.321  Evidence: Objections and offers of proof.

    (a) Objections. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence 
must be made on the record and shall be in short form, stating the 
grounds relied upon. Exceptions to any ruling thereon by the hearing 
officer need not be noted at the time of the ruling. Such exceptions 
will be deemed waived on appeal to the Commission, however, unless 
raised:
    (1) Pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with Sec. 
201.400;
    (2) In a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to Sec. 
201.340; or
    (3) In a petition for Commission review of an initial decision filed 
in accordance with Sec. 201.410.
    (b) Offers of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the record. Excluded material shall be retained pursuant 
to Sec. 201.350(b).

[[Page 175]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.322  Evidence: Confidential information, protective orders.

    (a) Procedure. In any proceeding as defined in Sec. 201.101(a), a 
party, any person who is the owner, subject or creator of a document 
subject to subpoena or which may be introduced as evidence, or any 
witness who testifies at a hearing may file a motion requesting a 
protective order to limit from disclosure to other parties or to the 
public documents or testimony that contain confidential information. The 
motion should include a general summary or extract of the documents 
without revealing confidential details. If the movant seeks a protective 
order against disclosure to other parties as well as the public, copies 
of the documents shall not be served on other parties. Unless the 
documents are unavailable, the movant shall file for in camera 
inspection a sealed copy of the documents as to which the order is 
sought.
    (b) Basis for issuance. Documents and testimony introduced in a 
public hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective 
order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from 
disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
    (c) Requests for additional information supporting confidentiality. 
A movant under paragraph (a) of this section may be required to furnish 
in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for 
confidentiality. Failure to supply the information so requested within 
five days from the date of receipt by the movant of a notice of the 
information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public 
disclosure of that portion of the documents to which the additional 
information relates, unless the Commission or the hearing officer shall 
otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such 
five-day period.
    (d) Confidentiality of documents pending decision. Pending a 
determination of a motion under this section, the documents as to which 
confidential treatment is sought and any other documents that would 
reveal the confidential information in those documents shall be 
maintained under seal and shall be disclosed only in accordance with 
orders of the Commission or the hearing officer. Any order issued in 
connection with a motion under this section shall be public unless the 
order would disclose information as to which a protective order has been 
granted, in which case that portion of the order that would reveal the 
protected information shall be nonpublic.


<R05>
Sec. 201.323  Evidence: Official notice.

    Official notice may be taken of any material fact which might be 
judicially noticed by a district court of the United States, any matter 
in the public official records of the Commission, or any matter which is 
peculiarly within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. If 
official notice is requested or taken of a material fact not appearing 
in the evidence in the record, the parties, upon timely request, shall 
be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 201.324  Evidence: Stipulations.

    The parties may, by stipulation, at any stage of the proceeding 
agree upon any pertinent facts in the proceeding. A stipulation may be 
received in evidence and, when received, shall be binding on the parties 
to the stipulation.


<R05>
Sec. 201.325  Evidence: Presentation under oath or affirmation.

    A witness at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall 
testify under oath or affirmation.


<R05>
Sec. 201.326  Evidence: Presentation, rebuttal and cross-examination.

    In any proceeding in which a hearing is required to be conducted on 
the record after opportunity for hearing in accord with 5 U.S.C. 556(a), 
a party is entitled to present its case or defense by oral or 
documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such 
cross-examination as, in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing 
officer, may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. 
The scope and form of evidence, rebuttal evidence, if any, and cross-
examination, if any, in any other proceeding shall be determined by the 
Commission or the hearing officer in each proceeding.

[[Page 176]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.340  Proposed findings, conclusions and supporting briefs.

    (a) Opportunity to file. Before an initial decision is issued, each 
party shall have an opportunity, reasonable in light of all the 
circumstances, to file in writing proposed findings and conclusions 
together with, or as a part of, its brief.
    (b) Procedure. Proposed findings of fact must be supported by 
citations to specific portions of the record. If successive filings are 
directed, the proposed findings and conclusions of the party assigned to 
file first shall be set forth in serially numbered paragraphs, and any 
counter statement of proposed findings and conclusions must, in addition 
to any other matter, indicate those paragraphs of the proposals already 
filed as to which there is no dispute. A reply brief may be filed by the 
party assigned to file first, or, where simultaneous filings are 
directed, reply briefs may be filed by each party, within the period 
prescribed therefor by the hearing officer. No further briefs may be 
filed except with leave of the hearing officer.
    (c) Time for filing. In any proceeding in which an initial decision 
is to be issued:
    (1) At the end of each hearing, the hearing officer shall, by order, 
after consultation with the parties, prescribe the period within which 
proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs are to be filed. 
The party or parties directed to file first shall make its or their 
initial filing within 30 days of the end of the hearing unless the 
hearing officer, for good cause shown, permits a different period and 
sets forth in the order the reasons why the different period is 
necessary.
    (2) The total period within which all such proposed findings and 
conclusions and supporting briefs and any counter statements of proposed 
findings and conclusions and reply briefs are to be filed shall be no 
longer than 90 days after the close of the hearing unless the hearing 
officer, for good cause shown, permits a different period and sets forth 
in an order the reasons why the different period is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 201.350  Record in proceedings before hearing officer; retention of documents; copies.

    (a) Contents of the record. The record shall consist of:

any amendments;

Secretary shall retain any such document until the later of the date 
upon which a Commission order ending the proceeding becomes final, or 
the conclusion of any judicial review of the Commission's order.
    (c) Substitution of copies. A true copy of a document may be 
substituted for any document in the record or any document retained 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 201.351  Transmittal of documents to Secretary; record index; certification.

    (a) Transmittal from hearing officer to Secretary of partial record 
index. The hearing officer may, at any time, transmit to the Secretary 
motions, exhibits or any other original documents

[[Page 177]]

filed with or accepted into evidence by the hearing officer, together 
with a list of such documents.
    (b) Preparation, certification of record index. Promptly after the 
close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit to the 
Secretary an index of the originals of any motions, exhibits or any 
other documents filed with or accepted into evidence by the hearing 
officer that have not been previously transmitted to the Secretary, and 
the Secretary shall prepare a record index. Prior to issuance of an 
initial decision, or if no initial decision is to be prepared, within 30 
days of the close of the hearing, the Secretary shall transmit the 
record index to the hearing officer and serve a copy of the record index 
on each party. Any person may file proposed corrections to the record 
index with the hearing officer within 15 days of service of the record 
index. The hearing officer shall, by order, direct whether any 
corrections to the record index shall be made. The Secretary shall make 
such corrections, if any, and issue a revised record index. If an 
initial decision is to be issued, the initial decision shall include a 
certification that the record consists of the items set forth in the 
record index or revised record index issued by the Secretary.
    (c) Final transmittal of record items to the Secretary. After the 
close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit to the 
Secretary originals of any motions, exhibits or any other documents 
filed with, or accepted into evidence by, the hearing officer, or any 
other portions of the record that have not already been transmitted to 
the Secretary. Prior to service of the initial decision by the 
Secretary, or if no initial decision is to be issued, within 60 days of 
the close of the hearing, the Secretary shall inform the hearing officer 
if any portions of the record are not in the Secretary's custody.

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 13178, Mar. 19, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 201.360  Initial decision of hearing officer.

    (a)(1) When required. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, the 
hearing officer shall prepare an initial decision in any proceeding in 
which the Commission directs a hearing officer to preside at a hearing, 
provided, however, that an initial decision may be waived by the parties 
with the consent of the hearing officer pursuant to Sec. 201.202.
    (2) Time period for filing initial decision. In the order 
instituting proceedings, the Commission will specify a time period in 
which the hearing officer's initial decision must be filed with the 
Secretary. In the Commission's discretion, after consideration of the 
nature, complexity, and urgency of the subject matter, and with due 
regard for the public interest and the protection of investors, this 
time period will be either 120, 210 or 300 days from the date of service 
of the order. Under the 300-day timeline, the hearing officer shall 
issue an order providing that there shall be approximately 4 months from 
the order instituting the proceeding to the hearing, approximately 2 
months for the parties to obtain the transcript and submit briefs, and 
approximately 4 months after briefing for the hearing officer to issue 
an initial decision. Under the 210-day timeline, the hearing officer 
shall issue an order providing that there shall be approximately 2\1/2\ 
months from the order instituting the proceeding to the hearing, 
approximately 2 months for the parties to review the transcript and 
submit briefs, and approximately 2\1/2\ months after briefing for the 
hearing officer to issue an initial decision. Under the 120-day 
timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order providing that there 
shall be approximately 1 month from the order instituting the proceeding 
to the hearing, approximately 2 months for the parties to review the 
transcript and submit briefs, and approximately 1 month after briefing 
for the hearing officer to issue an initial decision. These deadlines 
confer no substantive rights on respondents. If a stay is granted 
pursuant to Sec. 201.210(c)(3), the time period specified in the order 
instituting proceedings in which the hearing officer's initial decision 
must be filed with the Secretary, as well as any other time limits 
established in orders issued by the hearing officer in the proceeding, 
shall be automatically tolled during the period while the stay is in 
effect.

[[Page 178]]

    (3) Motion for extension. In the event that the hearing officer 
presiding over the proceeding determines that it will not be possible to 
issue the initial decision within the specified period of time, the 
hearing officer should consult with the Chief Administrative Law Judge. 
Following such consultation, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may 
determine, in his or her discretion, to submit a motion to the 
Commission requesting an extension of the time period for filing the 
initial decision. This motion must be filed no later than 30 days prior 
to the expiration of the time specified in the order for issuance of an 
initial decision. The motion will be served upon all parties in the 
proceeding, who may file with the Commission statements in support of or 
in opposition to the motion. If the Commission determines that 
additional time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the 
Commission shall issue an order extending the time period for filing the 
initial decision.
    (b) Content. An initial decision shall include: Findings and 
conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, as to all the material 
issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record and the 
appropriate order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof. The initial 
decision shall also state the time period, not to exceed 21 days after 
service of the decision, except for good cause shown, within which a 
petition for review of the initial decision may be filed. The reasons 
for any extension of time shall be stated in the initial decision. The 
initial decision shall also include a statement that, as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section:
    (1) The Commission will enter an order of finality as to each party 
unless a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a 
petition for review of the initial decision or a motion to correct a 
manifest error of fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, 
or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial 
decision; and
    (2) If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely 
files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of 
fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, or if the 
Commission takes action to review as to a party or an aggrieved person 
entitled to review, the initial decision shall not become final as to 
that party or person.
    (c) Filing, service and publication. The hearing officer shall file 
the initial decision with the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly 
serve the initial decision upon the parties and shall promptly publish 
notice of the filing thereof in the SEC News Digest. Thereafter, the 
Secretary shall publish the initial decision in the SEC Docket; 
provided, however, that in nonpublic proceedings no notice shall be 
published unless the Commission otherwise directs.
    (d) Finality. (1) If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to 
review timely files a petition for review or a motion to correct a 
manifest error of fact in the initial decision, or if the Commission on 
its own initiative orders review of a decision with respect to a party 
or a person aggrieved who would be entitled to review, the initial 
decision shall not become final as to that party or person.
    (2) If a party or aggrieved person entitled to review fails to file 
timely a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of 
fact in the initial decision, and if the Commission does not order 
review of a decision on its own initiative, the Commission will issue an 
order that the decision has become final as to that party. The decision 
becomes final upon issuance of the order. The order of finality shall 
state the date on which sanctions, if any, take effect. Notice of the 
order shall be published in the SEC Docket and on the SEC Web site.

             Appeal to the Commission and Commission Review


<R05>
Sec. 201.400  Interlocutory review.

    (a) Availability. The Commission may, at any time, on its own 
motion, direct that any matter be submitted to it for review. Petitions 
by parties for interlocutory review are disfavored, and the Commission 
ordinarily will grant a petition to review a hearing officer ruling 
prior to its consideration of an initial

[[Page 179]]

decision only in extraordinary circumstances. The Commission may decline 
to consider a ruling certified by a hearing officer pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section or the petition of a party who has been 
denied certification if it determines that interlocutory review is not 
warranted or appropriate under the circumstances. This section is the 
exclusive remedy for review of a hearing officer's ruling prior to 
Commission consideration of the entire proceeding and is the sole 
mechanism for appeal of actions delegated pursuant to Sec. Sec. 200.30-
9 and 200.30-10 of this chapter.
    (b) Expedited consideration. Interlocutory review of a hearing 
officer's ruling shall be expedited in every way, consistent with the 
Commission's other responsibilities.
    (c) Certification process. A ruling submitted to the Commission for 
interlocutory review must be certified in writing by the hearing officer 
and shall specify the material relevant to the ruling involved. The 
hearing officer shall not certify a ruling unless:
    (1) His or her ruling would compel testimony of Commission members, 
officers or employees or the production of documentary evidence in their 
custody; or
    (2) Upon application by a party, within five days of the hearing 
officer's ruling, the hearing officer is of the opinion that:
    (i) The ruling involves a controlling question of law as to which 
there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and
    (ii) An immediate review of the order may materially advance the 
completion of the proceeding.
    (d) Proceedings not stayed. The filing of an application for review 
or the grant of review shall not stay proceedings before the hearing 
officer unless he or she, or the Commission, shall so order. The 
Commission will not consider the motion for a stay unless the motion 
shall have first been made to the hearing officer.

Sec. 201.401  Consideration of stays.

    (a) Procedure. A request for a stay shall be made by written motion, 
filed pursuant to Sec. 201.154, and served on all parties pursuant to 
Sec. 201.150. The motion shall state the reasons for the relief 
requested and the facts relied upon, and, if the facts are subject to 
dispute, the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn 
statements or copies thereof. Portions of the record relevant to the 
relief sought, if available to the movant, shall be filed with the 
motion. The Commission may issue a stay based on such motion or on its 
own motion.
    (b) Scope of relief. The Commission may grant a stay in whole or in 
part, and may condition relief under this section upon such terms, or 
upon the implementation of such procedures, as it deems appropriate.
    (c) Stay of a Commission order. A motion for a stay of a Commission 
order may be made by any person aggrieved thereby who would be entitled 
to review in a federal court of appeals. A motion seeking to stay the 
effectiveness of a Commission order pending judicial review may be made 
to the Commission at any time during which the Commission retains 
jurisdiction over the proceeding.
    (d) Stay of an action by a self-regulatory organization--(1) 
Availability. A motion for a stay of an action by a self-regulatory 
organization for which the Commission is the appropriate regulatory 
agency, for which action review may be sought pursuant to Sec. 201.420, 
may be made by any person aggrieved thereby at the time an application 
for review is filed in accordance with Sec. 201.420 or thereafter.
    (2) Summary entry. A stay may be entered summarily, without notice 
and opportunity for hearing.
    (3) Expedited consideration. Where the action complained of has 
already taken effect and the motion for stay is filed within 10 days of 
the effectiveness of the action, or where the action complained of, 
will, by its terms, take effect within five days of the filing of the 
motion for stay, the consideration of and decision on the motion for a 
stay shall be expedited in every way, consistent with the Commission's 
other responsibilities. Where consideration will be expedited, persons 
opposing the motion for a stay may file a statement in opposition within 
two days of service of the motion unless the Commission,

[[Page 180]]

by written order, shall specify a different period.
    (e) Lifting of stay of action by the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board--(1) Availability. Any person aggrieved by a stay of 
action by the Board entered in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 7215(e) for 
which review has been sought pursuant to Sec. 201.440 or which the 
Commission has taken up on its motion pursuant to Sec. 201.441 may make 
a motion to lift the stay. The Commission may, at any time, on its own 
motion determine whether to lift the automatic stay.
    (2) Summary action. The Commission may lift a stay summarily, 
without notice and opportunity for hearing.
    (3) Expedited consideration. The Commission may expedite 
consideration of a motion to lift a stay of Board action, consistent 
with the Commission's other responsibilities. Where consideration is 
expedited, persons opposing the lifting of the stay may file a statement 
in opposition within two days of service of the motion requesting 
lifting of the stay unless the Commission, by written order, shall 
specify a different period.

<R05>
Sec. 201.410  Appeal of initial decisions by hearing officers.

    (a) Petition for review; when available. In any proceeding in which 
an initial decision is made by a hearing officer, any party, and any 
other person who would have been entitled to judicial review of the 
decision entered therein if the Commission itself had made the decision, 
may file a petition for review of the decision with the Commission.
    (b) Procedure. The petition for review of an initial decision shall 
be filed with the Commission within such time after service of the 
initial decision as prescribed by the hearing officer pursuant to Sec. 
201.360(b) unless a party has filed a motion to correct an initial 
decision with the hearing officer. If such correction has been sought, a 
party shall have 21 days from the date of the hearing officer's order 
resolving the motion to correct to file a petition for review. The 
petition shall set forth the specific findings and conclusions of the 
initial decision as to which exception is taken, together with 
supporting reasons for each exception. Supporting reasons may be stated 
in summary form. Any exception to an initial decision not stated in the 
petition for review, or in a previously filed proposed finding made 
pursuant to Sec. 201.340 may, at the discretion of the Commission, be 
deemed to have been waived by the petitioner. In the event a petition 
for review is filed, any other party to the proceeding may file a cross-
petition for review within the original time allowed for seeking review 
or within ten days from the date that the petition for review was filed, 
whichever is later.
    (c) Financial disclosure statement requirement. Any person who files 
a petition for review of an initial decision that asserts that person's 
inability to pay either disgorgement, interest or a penalty shall file 
with the opening brief a sworn financial disclosure statement containing 
the information specified in Sec. 201.630(b).
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission 
for review of an initial decision is a prerequisite to the seeking of 
judicial review of a final order entered pursuant to such decision.

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 13179, Mar. 19, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 201.411  Commission consideration of initial decisions by hearing officers.

    (a) Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set 
aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, an initial 
decision by a hearing officer and may make any findings or conclusions 
that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the record.
    (b) Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for 
review--(1) Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been 
filed, the Commission shall review any initial decision that:
    (i) Denies any request for action pursuant to Section 8(a) or 
Section 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(a), (c), or 
the first sentence of Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 
78l(d);

[[Page 181]]

    (ii) Suspends trading in a security pursuant to Section 12(k) of the 
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(k); or
    (iii) Is in a case of adjudication (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) not 
required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for 
hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in 5 
U.S.C. 554(a) (1) through (6)).
    (2) Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any 
other decision. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission 
shall consider whether the petition for review makes a reasonable 
showing that:
    (i) A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the 
proceeding; or
    (ii) The decision embodies:
    (A) A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly 
erroneous; or
    (B) A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or
    (C) An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is 
important and that the Commission should review.
    (c) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. 
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any initial 
decision, or any portion of any initial decision, within 21 days after 
the end of the period established for filing a petition for review 
pursuant to Sec. 210.410(b). A party who does not intend to file a 
petition for review, and who desires the Commission's determination 
whether to order review on its own initiative to be made in a shorter 
time, may make a motion for an expedited decision, accompanied by a 
written statement that the party waives its right to file a petition for 
review. The vote of one member of the Commission, conveyed to the 
Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission 
for review.
    (d) Limitations on matters reviewed. Review by the Commission of an 
initial decision shall be limited to the issues specified in the 
petition for review or the issues, if any, specified in the briefing 
schedule order issued pursuant to Sec. 201.450(a). On notice to all 
parties, however, the Commission may, at any time prior to issuance of 
its decision, raise and determine any other matters that it deems 
material, with opportunity for oral or written argument thereon by the 
parties.
    (e) Summary affirmance. (1) At any time within 21 days after the 
filing of a petition for review pursuant to Sec. 201.410(b), any party 
may file a motion in accordance with Sec. 201.154 asking that the 
Commission summarily affirm an initial decision. Any party may file an 
opposition and reply to such motion in accordance with Sec. 201.154. 
Pending determination of the motion for summary affirmance, the 
Commission, in its discretion, may delay issuance of a briefing schedule 
order pursuant to Sec. 201.450.
    (2) Upon consideration of the motion and any opposition or upon its 
own initiative, the Commission may summarily affirm an initial decision. 
The Commission may grant summary affirmance if it finds that no issue 
raised in the initial decision warrants consideration by the Commission 
of further oral or written argument. The Commission will decline to 
grant summary affirmance upon a reasonable showing that a prejudicial 
error was committed in the conduct of the proceeding or that the 
decision embodies an exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy 
that is important and that the Commission should review.
    (f) Failure to obtain a majority. In the event a majority of 
participating Commissioners do not agree to a disposition on the merits, 
the initial decision shall be of no effect, and an order will be issued 
in accordance with this result.

<R05>
Sec. 201.420  Appeal of determinations by self-regulatory organizations.

    (a) Application for review; when available. An application for 
review by the Commission may be filed by any person who is aggrieved by 
a self-regulatory organization determination as to which a notice is 
required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of 
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1). Such determinations include any:
    (1) Final disciplinary sanction;
    (2) Denial or conditioning of membership or participation;

[[Page 182]]

    (3) Prohibition or limitation in respect to access to services 
offered by that self-regulatory organization or a member thereof; or
    (4) Bar from association.
    (b) Procedure. As required by section 19(d)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1), an applicant must file an 
application for review with the Commission within 30 days after the 
notice of the determination is filed with the Commission and received by 
the aggrieved person applying for review. The Commission will not extend 
this 30-day period, absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances. 
This section is the exclusive remedy for seeking an extension of the 30-
day period.
    (c) Application. The application shall be filed with the Commission 
pursuant to Sec. 201.151. The applicant shall serve the application on 
the self-regulatory organization. The application shall identify the 
determination complained of and set forth in summary form a brief 
statement of the alleged errors in the determination and supporting 
reasons therefor. The application shall state an address where the 
applicant can be served. The application should not exceed two pages in 
length. If the applicant will be represented by a representative, the 
application shall be accompanied by the notice of appearance required by 
Sec. 201.102(d).
    (d) Determination not stayed. Filing an application for review with 
the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall not 
operate as a stay of the complained of determination made by the self-
regulatory organization unless the Commission otherwise orders either 
pursuant to a motion filed in accordance with Sec. 201.401 or on its 
own motion.
    (e) Certification of the record; service of the index. Fourteen days 
after receipt of an application for review or a Commission order for 
review, the self-regulatory organization shall certify and file with the 
Commission one copy of the record upon which the action complained of 
was taken, and shall file with the Commission three copies of an index 
to such record, and shall serve upon each party one copy of the index.

<R05>
Sec. 201.421  Commission consideration of determinations by self-regulatory organizations.

    (a) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. 
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any 
determination by a self-regulatory organization that could be subject to 
an application for review pursuant to Sec. 201.420(a) within 40 days 
after notice thereof was filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 
19(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1).
    (b) Supplemental briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to 
issuance of its decision raise or consider any matter that it deems 
material, whether or not raised by the parties. Notice to the parties 
and an opportunity for supplemental briefing with respect to issues not 
briefed by the parties shall be given where the Commission believes that 
such briefing would significantly aid the decisional process.


<R05>
Sec. 201.430  Appeal of actions made pursuant to delegated authority.

    (a) Scope of rule. Any person aggrieved by an action made by 
authority delegated in Sec. Sec. 200.30-1 through 200.30-8 or 
Sec. Sec. 200.30-11 through 200.30-18 of this chapter may seek review 
of the action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Procedure--(1) Notice of intention to petition for review. A 
party to an action made pursuant to delegated authority, or a person 
aggrieved by such action, may seek Commission review of the action by 
filing a written notice of intention to petition for review within five 
days after actual notice of the action to that party or aggrieved 
person, or 15 days after publication of the notice of action in the 
Federal Register, or five days after service of notice of the action on 
that party or aggrieved person pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b), whichever 
is the earliest.
    (2) Petition for review. Within five days after the filing of a 
notice of intention to petition for review pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the person seeking review shall file a petition for 
review containing a clear and concise statement of the issues to be 
reviewed and the reasons why review is

[[Page 183]]

appropriate. The petition shall include exceptions to any findings of 
fact or conclusions of law made, together with supporting reasons for 
such exceptions based on appropriate citations to such record as may 
exist. These reasons may be stated in summary form.
    (c) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission 
for review of an action made by authority delegated in Sec. Sec. 
200.30-1 through 200.30-18 of this chapter is a prerequisite to the 
seeking of judicial review of a final order entered pursuant to such an 
action.

<R05>
Sec. 201.431  Commission consideration of actions made pursuant to delegated authority.

    (a) Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set 
aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, any action 
made pursuant to authority delegated in Sec. Sec. 200.30-1 through 
200.30-18 of this chapter.
    (b) Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for 
review--(1) Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been 
filed, the Commission shall review any action that it would be required 
to review pursuant to Sec. 201.411(b)(1) if the action was made as the 
initial decision of a hearing officer.
    (2) Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any 
other action. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission 
shall consider the factors set forth in Sec. 201.411(b)(2).
    (c) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. 
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any action 
made pursuant to delegated authority at any time, provided, however, 
that where there are one or more parties to the matter, such review 
shall not be ordered more than ten days after the action. The vote of 
one member of the Commission, conveyed to the Secretary, shall be 
sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission for review.
    (d) Required items in an order for review. In an order granting a 
petition for review or directing review on the Commission's own 
initiative, the Commission shall set forth the time within which any 
party or other person may file a statement in support of or in 
opposition to the action made by delegated authority and shall state 
whether a stay shall be granted, if none is in effect, or shall be 
continued, if in effect pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Automatic stay of delegated action. An action made pursuant to 
delegated authority shall have immediate effect and be deemed the action 
of the Commission. Upon filing with the Commission of a notice of 
intention to petition for review, or upon notice to the Secretary of the 
vote of a Commissioner that a matter be reviewed, an action made 
pursuant to delegated authority shall be stayed until the Commission 
orders otherwise, provided, however, there shall be no automatic stay of 
an action:
    (1) To grant a stay of action by the Commission or a self-regulatory 
organization as authorized by 17 CFR 200.30-14(g) (5)-(6); or
    (2) To commence a subpoena enforcement proceeding as authorized by 
17 CFR 200.30-4(a)(10).
    (f) Effectiveness of stay or of Commission decision to modify or 
reverse a delegated action. As against any person who shall have acted 
in reliance upon any action at a delegated level, any stay or any 
modification or reversal by the Commission of such action shall be 
effective only from the time such person receives actual notice of such 
stay, modification or reversal.

Sec. 201.440  Appeal of determinations by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

    (a) Application for review; when available. Any person who is 
aggrieved by a determination of the Board with respect to any final 
disciplinary sanction, including disapproval of a completed application 
for registration of a public accounting firm, may file an application 
for review.
    (b) Procedure. An aggrieved person may file an application for 
review with the Commission pursuant to Sec. 201.151

[[Page 184]]

within 30 days after the notice filed by the Board of its determination 
with the Commission pursuant to Sec. 240.19d-4 of this chapter is 
received by the aggrieved person applying for review. The applicant 
shall serve the application on the Board at the same time. The 
application shall identify the determination complained of, set forth in 
summary form a brief statement of alleged errors in the determination 
and supporting reasons therefor, and state an address where the 
applicant can be served. The notice of appearance required by Sec. 
201.102(d) shall accompany the application.
    (c) Stay of determination. Filing an application for review with the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section operates as a stay 
of the Board's determination unless the Commission otherwise orders 
either pursuant to a motion filed in accordance with Sec. 201.401(e) or 
upon its own motion.
    (d) Certification of the record; service of the index. Within 
fourteen days after receipt of an application for review, the Board 
shall certify and file with the Commission one copy of the record upon 
which it took the complained-of action. The Board shall file with the 
Commission three copies of an index of such record, and shall serve one 
copy of the index on each party.

Sec. 201.441  Commission consideration of Board determinations.

    (a) Commission review other than pursuant to an application for 
review. The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any 
final disciplinary sanction, including disapproval of a completed 
application for registration of a public accounting firm, imposed by the 
Board that could be subject to an application for review pursuant to 
Sec. 201.440(a) within 40 days after the Board filed notice thereof 
pursuant to Sec. 240.19d-4 of this chapter.
    (b) Supplemental briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to 
the issuance of its decision raise or consider any matter that it deems 
material, whether or not raised by the parties. The Commission will give 
notice to the parties and an opportunity for supplemental briefing with 
respect to issues not briefed by the parties where the Commission 
believes that such briefing could significantly aid the decisional 
process.

Sec. 201.450  Briefs filed with the Commission.

    (a) Briefing schedule order. Other than review ordered pursuant to 
Sec. 201.431, if review of a determination is mandated by statute, 
rule, or judicial order or the Commission determines to grant review as 
a matter of discretion, the Commission shall issue a briefing schedule 
order directing the party or parties to file opening briefs and 
specifying particular issues, if any, as to which briefing should be 
limited or directed. Unless otherwise provided, opening briefs shall be 
filed within 30 days of the date of the briefing schedule order. 
Opposition briefs shall be filed within 30 days after the date opening 
briefs are due. Reply briefs shall be filed within 14 days after the 
date opposition briefs are due. No briefs in addition to those specified 
in the briefing schedule order may be filed except with leave of the 
Commission. The briefing schedule order shall be issued:
    (1) At the time the Commission orders review on its own initiative 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 201.411 or 201.421, or orders interlocutory 
review on its own motion pursuant to Sec. 201.400(a); or
    (2) Within 21 days, or such longer time as provided by the 
Commission, after:
    (i) The last day permitted for filing a petition for review pursuant 
to Sec. 201.410(b) or a brief in opposition to a petition for review 
pursuant to Sec. 201.410(d);
    (ii) Receipt by the Commission of an index to the record of a 
determination of a self-regulatory organization filed pursuant to Sec.

    (iv) Receipt by the Commission of the mandate of a court of appeals 
with respect to a judicial remand; or
    (v) Certification of a ruling for interlocutory review pursuant to 
Sec. 201.400(c).
    (b) Contents of briefs. Briefs shall be confined to the particular 
matters at issue. Each exception to the findings or

[[Page 185]]

conclusions being reviewed shall be stated succinctly. Exceptions shall 
be supported by citation to the relevant portions of the record, 
including references to the specific pages relied upon, and by concise 
argument including citation of such statutes, decisions and other 
authorities as may be relevant. If the exception relates to the 
admission or exclusion of evidence, the substance of the evidence 
admitted or excluded shall be set forth in the brief, in an appendix 
thereto, or by citation to the record. Reply briefs shall be confined to 
matters in opposition briefs of other parties.
    (c) Length limitation. Except with leave of the Commission, opening 
and opposition briefs shall not exceed 14,000 words and reply briefs 
shall not exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of pages containing the table of 
contents, table of authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of 
copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions or rules, 
and exhibits. The number of words shall include pleadings incorporated 
by reference. Motions to file briefs in excess of these limitations are 
disfavored.
    (d) Certificate of compliance. An opening or opposition brief that 
does not exceed 30 pages in length, exclusive of pages containing the 
table of contents, table of authorities, and any addendum that consists 
solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative provisions, 
or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of pleadings incorporated by 
reference, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 14,000 
words. A reply brief that does not exceed 15 pages in length, exclusive 
of pages containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any 
addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent 
legislative provisions, or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of 
pleadings incorporated by reference, is presumptively considered to 
contain no more than 7,000 words. Any brief that exceeds these page 
limits must include a certificate by the party's representative, or an 
unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the length 
limitation set forth in Sec. 201.450(c) and stating the number of words 
in the brief. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word 
count of the word-processing system used to prepare the brief.

<R05>
Sec. 201.451  Oral argument before the Commission.

    (a) Availability. The Commission, on its own motion or the motion of 
a party or any other aggrieved person entitled to Commission review, may 
order oral argument with respect to any matter. Motions for oral 
argument with respect to whether to affirm all or part of an initial 
decision by a hearing officer shall be granted unless exceptional 
circumstances make oral argument impractical or inadvisable. The 
Commission will consider appeals, motions and other matters properly 
before it on the basis of the papers filed by the parties without oral 
argument unless the Commission determines that the presentation of facts 
and legal arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process 
would be significantly aided by oral argument.
    (b) Procedure. Requests for oral argument shall be made by separate 
motion accompanying the initial brief on the merits. The Commission 
shall issue an order as to whether oral argument is to be heard, and if 
so, the time and place therefor. If oral argument is granted, the time 
fixed for oral argument shall be changed only by written order of the 
Commission, for good cause shown. The order shall state at whose request 
the change is made and the reasons for any such changes. No visual aids 
may be used at oral argument unless copies have been provided to the 
Commission and all parties at least five business days before the 
argument is to be held.
    (c) Time allowed. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, not more 
than one half-hour per side will be allowed for oral argument. The 
Commission may, in its discretion, determine that several persons have a 
common interest, and that the interests represented will be considered a 
single side for purposes of allotting time for oral argument. Time will 
be divided equally among persons on a single side, provided, however, 
that by mutual agreement they may reallocate their time

[[Page 186]]

among themselves. A request for additional time must be made by motion 
filed reasonably in advance of the date fixed for argument.
    (d) Participation of Commissioners. A member of the Commission who 
was not present at the oral argument may participate in the decision of 
the proceeding, provided that the member has reviewed the transcript of 
such argument prior to such participation. The decision shall state 
whether the required review was made.

Sec. 201.510  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Application process.

    (a) Procedure. A request for entry of a temporary cease-and-desist 
order shall be made by application filed by the Division of Enforcement. 
The application shall set forth the statutory provision or rule that 
each respondent is alleged to have violated; the temporary relief sought 
against each respondent, including whether the respondent would be 
required to take action to prevent the dissipation or conversion of 
assets; and whether the relief is sought ex parte.
    (b) Accompanying documents. The application shall be accompanied by 
a declaration of facts signed by a person with knowledge of the facts 
contained therein, a memorandum of points and authorities, a proposed 
order imposing the temporary relief sought, and, unless relief is sought 
ex parte, a proposed notice of hearing and order to show cause whether 
the temporary relief should be imposed. If a proceeding for a permanent 
cease-and-desist order has not already been commenced, a proposed order 
instituting proceedings to determine whether a permanent cease-and-
desist order should be imposed shall also be filed with the application.
    (c) With whom filed. The application shall be filed with the 
Secretary or, if the Secretary is unavailable, with the duty officer. In

<R05>
Sec. 201.511  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Notice; procedures for hearing.

    (a) Notice: how given. Notice of an application for a temporary 
cease-and-desist order shall be made by serving a notice of hearing and 
order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b) or, where timely 
service of a notice of hearing pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b) is not 
practicable, by any other means reasonably calculated to give actual 
notice that a

[[Page 188]]

hearing will be held, including telephonic notification of the general 
subject matter, time, and place of the hearing. If an application is 
made ex parte, pursuant to Sec. 201.513, no notice to a respondent need 
be given prior to the Commission's consideration of the application.
    (b) Hearing before the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, hearings on an application for a temporary cease-
and-desist order shall be held before the Commission.
    (c) Presiding officer: designation. The Chairman shall preside or 
designate a Commissioner to preside at the hearing. If the Chairman is 
absent or unavailable at the time of hearing and no other Commissioner 
has been designated to preside, the duty officer on the day the hearing 
begins shall preside or designate another Commissioner to preside.
    (d) Procedure at hearing. (1) The presiding officer shall have all 
those powers of a hearing officer set forth in Sec. 201.111 and shall 
rule on the admissibility of evidence and other procedural matters, 
including, but not limited to whether oral testimony will be heard; the 
time allowed each party for the submission of evidence or argument; and 
whether post-hearing submission of briefs, proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law will be permitted and if so, the procedures for 
submission; provided, however, that the person presiding may consult 
with other Commissioners participating in the hearing on these or any 
other question of procedure.
    (2) Each Commissioner present at the hearing shall be afforded a 
reasonable opportunity to ask questions of witnesses, if any, or of 
counsel.
    (3) A party or witness may participate by telephone. Alternative 
means of remote access, including a video link, shall be permitted in 
the Commission's discretion. Factors the Commission may consider in 
determining whether to permit alternative means of remote access 
include, but are not limited to, whether allowing an alternative means 
of access will delay the hearing, whether the alternative means is 
reliable, and whether the party proposing its use has made arrangements 
to pay for its cost.
    (4) After a hearing has begun, the Commission may, on its own 
motion, or the motion of a party, assign a hearing officer to preside at 
the taking of oral testimony or other evidence and to certify the record 
of such testimony or other evidence to the Commission within a fixed 
period of time. No recommended or initial decision shall be made by such 
a hearing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 201.512  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Issuance after notice and opportunity for hearing.

    (a) Basis for issuance. A temporary cease-and-desist order shall be 
issued only if the Commission determines that the alleged violation or 
threatened violation specified in an order instituting proceedings 
whether to enter a permanent cease-and-desist order pursuant to 
Securities Act Section 8A(a), 15 U.S.C. 77h-1(a), Exchange Act Section 
21C(a), 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(a), Investment Company Act Section 9(f)(1), 15 
U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(1), or Investment Advisers Act Section 203(k)(1), 15 
U.S.C. 80b-3(k)(1), or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in 
significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to 
investors, or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but 
not limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection 
Corporation, prior to the completion of proceedings on the permanent 
cease-and-desist order.
    (b) Content, scope and form of order. Every temporary cease-and-
desist order granted shall:
    (1) Describe the basis for its issuance, including the alleged or 
threatened violations and the harm that is likely to result without the 
issuance of an order;
    (2) Describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the order 
instituting proceedings or any other document, the act or acts the 
respondent is to take or refrain from taking; and
    (3) Be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance.
    (c) Effective upon service. A temporary cease-and-desist order is 
effective upon service upon the respondent.
    (d) Service: how made. Service of a temporary cease-and-desist order 
shall be made pursuant to Sec. 201.141(a). The person who serves the 
order shall

[[Page 189]]

promptly file a declaration of service identifying the person served, 
the method of service, the date of service, the address to which service 
was made and the person who made service; provided, however, failure to 
file such a declaration shall have no effect on the validity of the 
service.
    (e) Commission review. At any time after the respondent has been 
served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the respondent may apply 
to the Commission to have the order set aside, limited or suspended. The 
application shall set forth with specificity the facts that support the 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 201.513  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Issuance without prior notice and opportunity for hearing.

    In addition to the requirements for issuance of a temporary cease-
and-desist order set forth in Sec. 201.512, the following requirements 
shall apply if a temporary cease-and-desist order is to be entered 
without prior notice and opportunity for hearing:
    (a) Basis for issuance without prior notice and opportunity for 
hearing. A temporary cease-and-desist order may be issued without notice 
and opportunity for hearing only if the Commission determines, from 
specific facts in the record of the proceeding, that notice and hearing 
prior to entry of an order would be impracticable or contrary to the 
public interest.
    (b) Content of the order. An ex parte temporary cease-and-desist 
order shall state specifically why notice and hearing would have been 
impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
    (c) Hearing before the Commission. If a respondent has been served 
with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior 
Commission hearing, the respondent may apply to the Commission to have 
the order set aside, limited, or suspended, and if the application is 
made within 10 days after the date on which the order was served, may 
request a hearing on such application. The Commission shall hold a 
hearing and render a decision on the respondent's application at the 
earliest possible time. The hearing shall begin within two days of the 
filing of the application unless the applicant consents to a longer 
period or the Commission, by order, for good cause shown, sets a later 
date. The Commission shall render a decision on the application within 
five calendar days of its filing, provided, however, that the 
Commission, by order, for good cause shown, may extend the time within 
which a decision may be rendered for a single period of five calendar 
days, or such longer time as consented to by the applicant. If the 
Commission does not render its decision within 10 days of the 
respondent's application or such longer time as consented to by the 
applicant, the temporary order shall be suspended until a decision is 
rendered.
    (d) Presiding officer, procedure at hearing. Procedures with respect 
to the selection of a presiding officer and the conduct of the hearing 
shall be in accordance with Sec. 201.511.


<R05>
Sec. 201.514  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Judicial review; duration.

    (a) Availability of judicial review. Judicial review of a temporary 
cease-and-desist order shall be available as provided in Section 
8A(d)(2) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77h-1(d)(2), Section 21C(d)(2) 
of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(d)(2), Section 9(f)(4)(B) of the 
Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(4)(B), or Section 
203(k)(4)(B) of the Investment Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-3(k)(4)(B).
    (b) Duration. Unless set aside, limited, or suspended, either by 
order of the Commission, a court of competent jurisdiction, or a hearing 
officer acting pursuant to Sec. 201.531, or by operation of Sec. 
201.513, a temporary cease-and-desist order shall remain effective and 
enforceable until the earlier of:
    (1) The completion of the proceedings whether a permanent order 
shall be entered; or
    (2) 180 days, or such longer time as consented to by the respondent, 
after issuance of a briefing schedule order pursuant to Sec. 
201.540(b), if an initial decision whether a permanent order should be 
entered is appealed.

investors.
    (b) Content, scope and form of order. Each order suspending a

the disgorgement ordered; the date which, for purposes of calculating 
disgorgement, each such violation was deemed to have occurred; the

to any funds which the respondent has placed in an escrow or otherwise 
guaranteed for payment of disgorgement upon a final determination of the 
respondent's liability. Escrow and other guarantee arrangements must be 
approved by the Commission or the hearing officer prior to entry of the 
disgorgement order.

<R05>
Sec. 201.630  Inability to pay disgorge ment, interest or penalties.

    (a) Generally. In any proceeding in which an order requiring payment 
of disgorgement, interest or penalties may be entered, a respondent may 
present evidence of an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or a 
penalty. The Commission may, in its discretion, or the hearing officer 
may, in his or her discretion, consider evidence concerning ability to 
pay in determining whether disgorgement, interest or a penalty is in the 
public interest.
    (b) Financial disclosure statement. Any respondent who asserts an 
inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties may be required to 
file a sworn financial disclosure statement and to keep the statement 
current. The financial statement shall show the respondent's assets, 
liabilities, income or other funds received and expenses or other 
payments, from the date of the first violation alleged against that 
respondent in the order instituting proceedings, or such later date as 
specified by the Commission or a hearing officer, to the date of the 
order requiring the disclosure statement to be filed. By order, the 
Commission or the hearing officer may prescribe the use of the 
Disclosure of Assets and Financial Information Form (see Form D-A at 
Sec. 209.1 of this chapter) or any other form, may specify other time 
periods for which disclosure is required, and may require such other 
information as deemed necessary to evaluate a claim of inability to pay.
    (c) Confidentiality. Any respondent submitting financial information 
pursuant to this section or Sec. 201.410(c) may make a motion, pursuant 
to Sec. 201.322, for the issuance of a protective order against 
disclosure of the information submitted to the public or to any parties 
other than the Division of Enforcement. Prior to a ruling on the motion, 
no party receiving information as to which a motion for a protective 
order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any other 
person without the prior permission of the Commission or the hearing 
officer.
    (d) Service required. Notwithstanding any provision of Sec. 
201.322, a copy of the financial disclosure statement shall be served on 
the Division of Enforcement.
    (e) Failure to file required financial information: sanction. Any 
respondent who, after making a claim of inability to pay either 
disgorgement, interest or a penalty, fails to file a financial 
disclosure statement when such a filing has been ordered or is required 
by rule may, in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, 
be deemed

[[Page 194]]

to have waived the claim of inability to pay. No sanction pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 201.155 or 201.180 shall be imposed for a failure to file 
such a statement.

      Informal Procedures and Supplementary Information Concerning 
                        Adjudicatory Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 201.900  Informal Procedures and Supplementary Information Concerning Adjudicatory Proceedings.

    (a) Guidelines for the timely completion of proceedings.(1) Timely 
resolution of adjudicatory proceedings is one factor in assessing the 
effectiveness of the adjudicatory program in protecting investors, 
promoting public confidence in the securities markets and assuring 
respondents a fair hearing. Establishment of guidelines for the timely 
completion of key phases of contested administrative proceedings 
provides a standard for both the Commission and the public to gauge the 
Commission's adjudicatory program on this criterion. The Commission has 
directed that, to the extent possible:
    (i) A decision by the Commission on review of an interlocutory 
matter should be completed within 45 days of the date set for filing the 
final brief on the matter submitted for review.
    (ii) A decision by the Commission on a motion to stay a decision 
that has already taken effect or that will take effect within five days 
of the filing of the motion, should be issued within five days of the 
date set for filing of the opposition to the motion for a stay. If the 
decision complained of has not taken effect, the Commission's decision 
should be issued within 45 days of the date set for filing of the 
opposition to the motion for a stay.
    (iii) Ordinarily, a decision by the Commission with respect to an 
appeal from the initial decision of a hearing officer, a review of a 
determination by a self-regulatory organization, or a remand of a prior 
Commission decision by a court of appeals should be issued within seven 
months from the date the petition for review, application for review, or 
mandate of the court is filed, unless the Commission determines that the 
matter presents unusual complicating circumstances, in which case a 
decision by the Commission on the matter may be issued within 11 months 
from the date the petition for review, application for review, or 
mandate of the court is filed. The Commission retains discretion to take 
additional time to dispose of an appeal from the initial decision of a 
hearing officer, a review of a determination by a self-regulatory 
organization, or a remand of a prior Commission decision by a court of 
appeals when the Commission determines that extraordinary facts and 
circumstances of the matter so require. The deadlines in Sec. 201.900 
confer no substantive rights on the parties.
    (2) The guidelines in this paragraph (a) do not create a requirement 
that each portion of a proceeding or the entire proceeding be completed 
within the periods described. Among other reasons, a proceeding at 
either the hearing stage or on review by the Commission may require 
additional time because it is unusually complex or because the record is 
exceptionally long. In addition, fairness is enhanced if the 
Commission's deliberative process is not constrained by an inflexible 
schedule. In some proceedings, deliberation may be delayed by the need 
to consider more urgent matters, to permit the preparation of dissenting 
opinions, or for other good cause. The guidelines will be used by the 
Commission as one of several criteria in monitoring and evaluating its 
adjudicatory program. The guidelines will be examined periodically, and, 
if necessary, readjusted in light of changes in the pending caseload and 
the available level of staff resources.
    (b) Reports to the Commission on pending cases. The administrative 
law judges, the Secretary and the General Counsel have each been 
delegated authority to issue certain orders or adjudicate certain 
proceedings. See 17 CFR 200.30-1 et seq. Proceedings are also assigned 
to the General Counsel for the preparation of a proposed order or 
opinion which will then be recommended to the Commission for 
consideration. In order to improve accountability by and to the 
Commission for management of the docket, the Commission has directed 
that confidential status reports with respect to all filed adjudicatory 
proceedings shall be made periodically to the Commission. These reports 
will be made

[[Page 195]]

through the Secretary, with a minimum frequency established by the 
Commission. In connection with these periodic reports, if a proceeding 
pending before the Commission has not been concluded within 30 days of 
the guidelines established in paragraph (a) of this section, the General 
Counsel shall specifically apprise the Commission of that fact, and 
shall describe the procedural posture of the case, project an estimated 
date for conclusion of the proceeding, and provide such other 
information as is necessary to enable the Commission to determine 
whether additional steps are necessary to reach a fair and timely 
resolution of the matter.
    (c) Publication of information concerning the pending case docket. 
Ongoing disclosure of information about the adjudication program 
caseload increases awareness of the importance of the program, 
facilitates oversight of the program and promotes confidence in the 
efficiency and fairness of the program by investors, securities industry 
participants, self-regulatory organizations and other members of the 
public. The Commission has directed the Secretary to publish in the SEC 
Docket in the first and seventh months of each fiscal year summary 
statistical information about the status of pending adjudicatory 
proceedings and changes in the Commission's caseload over the prior six 
months. The report will include the number of cases pending before the 
administrative law judges and the Commission at the beginning and end of 
the six-month period. The report will also show increases in the 
caseload arising from new cases being instituted, appealed or remanded 
to the Commission and decreases in the caseload arising from the 
disposition of proceedings by issuance of initial decisions, issuance of 
final decisions issued on appeal of initial decisions, other 
dispositions of appeals of initial decisions, final decisions on review 
of self-regulatory organization determinations, other dispositions on 
review of self-regulatory organization determinations, and decisions 
with respect to stays or interlocutory motions. For each category of 
decision, the report shall also show the median age of the cases at the 
time of the decision and the number of cases decided within the 
guidelines for the timely completion of adjudicatory proceedings.

Sec. 201.1100  Creation of Fair Fund.

    In any agency process initiated by an order instituting proceedings 
in which the Commission or the hearing officer issues an order requiring 
the payment of disgorgement by a respondent and also assessing a civil 
money penalty against that respondent, the Commission or the hearing 
officer may order that the amount of disgorgement and of the civil 
penalty, together with any funds received pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), 
be used to create a fund for the benefit of investors who were harmed by 
the violation.

[70 FR 72570, Dec. 5, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 201.1101  Submission of plan of distribution; contents of plan.

    (a) Submission. The Commission or the hearing officer may, at any 
time, order any party to submit a plan for the administration and 
distribution of funds in a Fair Fund or disgorgement fund. Unless 
ordered otherwise, the Division of Enforcement shall submit a proposed 
plan no later than 60 days after the respondent has turned over the 
funds or other assets pursuant to the Commission's order imposing 
disgorgement and, if applicable, a civil money penalty and any appeals 
of the Commission's order have been waived or completed, or appeal is no 
longer available.
    (b) Contents of plan. Unless otherwise ordered, a plan for the 
administration of a Fair Fund or a disgorgement fund shall include the 
following elements:
    (1) Procedures for the receipt of additional funds, including the 
specification of any account where funds will be held, the instruments 
in which the funds may be invested; and, in the case of a Fair Fund, the 
receipt of any funds pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), if applicable;
    (2) Specification of categories of persons potentially eligible to 
receive proceeds from the fund;
    (3) Procedures for providing notice to such persons of the existence 
of the fund and their potential eligibility to receive proceeds of the 
fund;
    (4) Procedures for making and approving claims, procedures for 
handling disputed claims, and a cut-off date for the making of claims;
    (5) A proposed date for the termination of the fund, including 
provision for the disposition of any funds not otherwise distributed;
    (6) Procedures for the administration of the fund, including 
selection, compensation, and, as necessary, indemnification of a fund 
administrator to oversee the fund, process claims, prepare accountings, 
file tax returns, and, subject to the approval of the Commission, make 
distributions from the fund to investors who were harmed by the 
violation; and
    (7) Such other provisions as the Commission or the hearing officer 
may require.


<R05>
Sec. 201.1102  Provisions for payment.

    (a) Payment to registry of the court or court-appointed receiver. 
Subject to such conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer 
shall deem appropriate, a plan for the administration of a Fair Fund or 
a disgorgement fund may provide for payment of funds into a court 
registry or to a court-appointed receiver in any case pending in federal 
or state court against a respondent or any other person based upon a 
complaint alleging violations arising from the same or substantially 
similar facts as those alleged in the Commission's order instituting 
proceedings.
    (b) Payment to the United States Treasury under certain 
circumstances. When, in the opinion of the Commission or the hearing 
officer, the cost of administering a plan of disgorgement relative to 
the value of the available disgorgement funds and the number of 
potential claimants would not justify distribution of the disgorgement 
funds to injured investors, the plan may provide that the disgorgement 
funds and any civil penalty shall be paid directly to the general fund 
of the United States Treasury.

[[Page 202]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.1103  Notice of proposed plan and opportunity for comment by non-parties.

    Notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or a proposed Fair Fund 
plan shall be published in the SEC Docket, on the SEC website, and in 
such other publications as the Commission or the hearing officer may 
require. The notice shall specify how copies of the proposed plan may be 
obtained and shall state that persons desiring to comment on the 
proposed plan may submit their views, in writing, to the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.1104  Order approving, modifying, or disapproving proposed plan.

    At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a 
proposed plan of disgorgement or of a proposed Fair Fund plan, the 
Commission shall, by order, approve, approve with modifications, or 
disapprove the proposed plan. In the discretion of the Commission, a 
proposed plan that is substantially modified prior to adoption may be 
republished for an additional comment period pursuant to Sec. 201.1103. 
The order approving or disapproving the plan should be entered within 30 
days after the end of the final period allowed for comments on the 
proposed plan unless the Commission or the hearing officer, by written 
order, allows a longer period for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 201.1105  Administration of plan.

    (a) Appointment and removal of administrator. The Commission or the 
hearing officer shall have discretion to appoint any person, including a 
Commission employee, as administrator of a plan of disgorgement or a 
Fair Fund plan and to delegate to that person responsibility for 
administering the plan. An administrator may be removed at any time by 
order of the Commission or hearing officer.
    (b) Assistance by respondent. A respondent may be required or 
permitted to administer or assist in administering a plan of 
disgorgement subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission or 
the hearing officer deems appropriate to ensure the proper distribution 
of the funds.
    (c) Administrator to post bond. If the administrator is not a 
Commission employee, the administrator shall be required to obtain a 
bond in the manner prescribed in 11 U.S.C. 322, in an amount to be 
approved by the Commission. The cost of the bond may be paid for as a 
cost of administration. The Commission may waive posting of a bond for 
good cause shown.
    (d) Administrator's fees. If the administrator is a Commission 
employee, no fee shall be paid to the administrator for his or her 
services. If the administrator is not a Commission employee, the 
administrator may file an application for fees for completed services, 
and upon approval by the Commission or a hearing officer, may be paid a 
reasonable fee for those services. Any objections thereto shall be filed 
within 21 days of service of the application on the parties.
    (e) Source of funds. Unless otherwise ordered, fees and other 
expenses of administering the plan shall be paid first from the interest 
earned on the funds, and if the interest is not sufficient, then from 
the corpus.
    (f) Accountings. During the first 10 days of each calendar quarter, 
or as otherwise directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, the 
administrator shall file an accounting of all monies earned or received 
and all monies spent in connection with the administration of the plan 
of disgorgement. A final accounting shall be submitted for approval of 
the Commission or hearing officer prior to discharge of the 
administrator and cancellation of the administrator's bond, if any.
    (g) Amendment. A plan may be amended upon motion by any party or by 
the plan administrator or upon the Commission's or the hearing officer's 
own motion.


<R05>
Sec. 201.1106  Right to challenge.

    Other than in connection with the opportunity to submit comments as 
provided in Sec. 201.1103, no person shall be granted leave to 
intervene or to participate or otherwise to appear in any agency 
proceeding or otherwise to challenge an order of disgorgement or 
creation of a Fair Fund; or an order approving, approving with 
modifications, or disapproving a plan of disgorgement or a Fair Fund 
plan; or any determination relating to a plan based solely

[[Page 203]]

upon that person's eligibility or potential eligibility to participate 
in a fund or based upon any private right of action such person may have 
against any person who is also a respondent in the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 202.1  General.

    (a) The statutes administered by the Commission provide generally 
(1) for the filing with it of certain statements, such as registration 
statements, periodic and ownership reports, and proxy solicitation 
material, and for the filing of certain plans of reorganization, 
applications and declarations seeking Commission approvals; (2) for 
Commission determination through formal procedures of matters initiated 
by private parties or by the Commission; (3) for the investigation and 
examination of persons and records where necessary to carry out the 
purposes of the statutes and for enforcement of statutory provisions; 
and (4) for the adoption of rules and regulations where necessary to 
effectuate the purposes of the statutes.
    (b) In addition to the Commission's rules of practice set forth in 
part 201 of this chapter, the Commission has promulgated rules and 
regulations pursuant to the several statutes it administers (parts 230, 
240, 250, 260, 270 and 275 of this chapter). These parts contain 
substantive provisions and include as well numerous provisions detailing 
the procedure for meeting specific standards embodied in the statutes. 
The Commission's rules and regulations under each of the statutes are 
available in pamphlet form upon request to the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (c) The statutes and the published rules, regulations and forms 
thereunder prescribe the course and method of formal procedures to be 
followed in Commission proceedings. These are supplemented where 
feasible by certain informal procedures designed to aid the public and 
facilitate the execution of the Commission's functions. There follows a 
brief description of procedures generally followed by the Commission 
which have not been formalized in rules.
    (d) The informal procedures of the Commission are largely concerned 
with the rendering of advice and assistance by the Commission's staff to 
members of the public dealing with the Commission. While opinions 
expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official 
expression of the Commission's views, they represent the views of 
persons who are continuously working with the provisions of the statute 
involved. And any statement by the director, associate director, 
assistant director, chief accountant, chief counsel, or chief financial 
analyst of a division can be relied upon as representing the views of 
that division. In certain instances an informal statement of the views 
of the Commission may be obtained. The staff, upon request or on its own 
motion, will generally present questions to the Commission which involve 
matters of substantial importance and where the issues are novel or 
highly complex, although the granting of a request for an informal 
statement

[[Page 204]]

by the Commission is entirely within its discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 202.2  Pre-filing assistance and interpretative advice.

    The staff of the Commission renders interpretative and advisory 
assistance to members of the general public, prospective registrants, 
applicants and declarants. For example, persons having a question 
regarding the availability of an exemption may secure informal 
administrative interpretations of the applicable statute or rule as they 
relate to the particular facts and circumstances presented. Similarly, 
persons contemplating filings with the Commission may receive advice of 
a general nature as to the preparation thereof, including information as 
to the forms to be used and the scope of the items contained in the 
forms. Inquiries may be directed to an appropriate officer of the 
Commission's staff. In addition, informal discussions with members of 
the staff may be arranged whenever feasible, at the Commission's central 
office or, except in connection with matters under the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935 and certain matters under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, at one of its regional offices.

[25 FR 6736, July 15, 1960, as amended at 59 FR 5945, Feb. 9, 1994; 73 
FR 32227, June 5, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 202.3  Processing of filings.

    (a) Registration statements, proxy statements, letters of 
notification, periodic reports, applications for qualification of 
indentures, and similar documents filed with the Commission under the 
Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and certain 
filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935 are routed to the Division of Corporation 
Finance, which passes initially on the adequacy of disclosure and 
recommends the initial action to be taken. If the filing appears to 
afford inadequate disclosure, as for example through omission of 
material information or through violation of accepted accounting 
principles and practices, the usual practice is to bring the deficiency 
to the attention of the person who filed the document by letter from the 
Assistant Director assigned supervision over the particular filing, and 
to afford a reasonable opportunity to discuss the matter and make the 
necessary corrections. This informal procedure is not generally employed 
when the deficiencies appear to stem from careless disregard of the 
statutes and rules or a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead or 
where the Commission deems formal proceedings necessary in the public 
interest. If an electronic filing is not prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the current EDGAR Filer Manual, the filing may be 
suspended and the filer so notified. Reasonable opportunity will be 
afforded the filer to make the necessary corrections or resubmit the 
filing as needed. Where it appears that the filing affords adequate 
disclosure, acceleration of its effectiveness when appropriate normally 
will be granted. A similar procedure is followed with respect to filings 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and certain filings relating to 
investment companies under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, which are 
routed to the Division of Investment Management, and filings under the 
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which are also routed to the 
Division of Investment Management. A similar procedure is also followed 
in the Commission's Regional Offices with respect to registration 
statements on Forms SB-1 and SB-2 (17 CFR 239.9 and 239.10) and related 
filings under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
    (b)(1) Applications for registration as brokers, dealers, investment 
advisers, municipal securities dealers and transfer agents are submitted 
to the Office of Filings and Information Services where they are 
examined to determine whether all necessary information has been 
supplied and whether all required financial statements and other 
documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective applications may 
be returned with a request for correction or held until corrected before 
being accepted as a filing. The files of the Commission and other 
sources of information are considered to determine whether any person 
connected with the applicant appears to have engaged in

[[Page 205]]

activities which would warrant commencement of proceedings on the 
question of denial of registration. The staff confers with applicants 
and makes suggestions in appropriate cases for amendments and 
supplemental information. Where it appears appropriate in the public 
interest and where a basis therefore exists, denial proceedings may be 
instituted. Within 45 days of the date of the filing of a broker-dealer, 
investment adviser or municipal securities dealer application (or within 
such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission 
shall by order grant registration or institute proceedings to determine 
whether registration should be denied. An application for registration 
as a transfer agent shall become effective within 30 days after receipt 
of the application (or within such shorter period as the Commission may 
determine). The Office of Filings and Information Services is also 
responsible for the processing and substantive examination of statements 
of beneficial ownership of securities and changes in such ownership 
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and 
for the examination of reports filed pursuant to Sec. 230.144 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Applications for registration as national securities exchanges, 
or exemption from registration as exchanges by reason of such exchanges' 
limited volume of transactions filed with the Commission are routed to 
the Division of Market Regulation, which examines these applications to 
determine whether all necessary information has been supplied and 
whether all required financial statements and other documents have been 
furnished in proper form. Defective applications may be returned with a 
request for correction or held until corrected before being accepted as 
a filing. The files of the Commission and other sources of information 
are considered to determine whether any person connected with the 
applicant appears to have engaged in activities which would warrant 
commencement of proceedings on the question of denial of registration. 
The staff confers with applicants and makes suggestions in appropriate 
cases for amendments and supplemental information. Where it appears 
appropriate in the public interest and where a basis therefore exists, 
denial proceedings may be instituted. Within 90 days of the date of 
publication of a notice of the filing of an application for registration 
as a national securities exchange, or exemption from registration by 
reason of such exchanges' limited volume of transactions (or within such 
longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall 
by order grant registration, or institute proceedings to determine 
whether registration should be denied as provided in Sec. 240.19(a)(1) 
of this chapter.
    (3) Notice forms for registration as national securities exchanges 
pursuant to Section 6(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78f(g)(1)) filed with the Commission are routed to the Division 
of Market Regulation, which examines these notices to determine whether 
all necessary information has been supplied and whether all other 
required documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective notices 
may be returned with a request for correction or held until corrected 
before being accepted as a filing.

Sec. 202.3a  Instructions for filing fees.

    (a) General instructions for remittance of filing fees. Payment of 
filing fees specified by the following sections shall be made according 
to the directions listed in this section: Sec. 230.111 of this chapter, 
Sec. 240.0-9 of this chapter, and Sec. 270.0-8 of this chapter. All 
such fees are to be paid through the U.S. Treasury designated lockbox 
depository and may be paid by wire transfer, certified check, bank 
cashier's check, United States postal money order, or bank money order 
pursuant to the specific instructions set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Personal checks will not be accepted for payment of fees. To 
ensure proper posting, all filers must include their Commission-assigned 
Central Index Key (CIK)

[[Page 206]]

number (also known as the Commission-assigned registrant or payor 
account number) on fee payments. If a third party submits a fee payment, 
the fee payment must specify the account number to which the fee is to 
be applied.
    (b) Instructions for payment of filing fees. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, these instructions provide direction for 
remitting fees specified in paragraph (a) of this section. You may 
contact the Fee Account Services Branch in the Office of Financial 
Management at (202) 551-8989 for additional information if you have 
questions.
    (1) Instructions for payment of fees by wire transfer (FEDWIRE). 
U.S. Bank, N.A. in St. Louis, Missouri is the U.S. Treasury designated 
lockbox depository and financial agent for Commission filing fee 
payments. The hours of operation at U.S. Bank are 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Eastern time for wire transfers. Any bank or wire transfer service may 
initiate wire transfers of filing fee payments through the FEDWIRE 
system to U.S. Bank. A filing entity does not need to establish an 
account at U.S. Bank in order to remit filing fee payments.
    (i) To ensure proper credit and prompt filing acceptance, in all 
wire transfers of filing fees to the Commission, you must include:
    (A) The Commission's account number at U.S. Bank (152307768324); and
    (B) The payor's CIK number.
    (ii) You may refer to the examples found on the Commission's Web 
site at http://www.sec.gov for the proper format.
    (2) Instructions for payment of fees by check or money order. To 
remit a filing fee payment by check (certified or bank cashier's check) 
or money order (United States postal or bank money order), you must make 
it payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission, omitting the name 
or title of any official of the Commission. On the front of the check or 
money order, you must include the Commission's account number 
(152307768324) and CIK number of the account to which the fee is to be 
applied. U.S. Bank does not accept walk-in deliveries by individuals. 
You must mail checks or money orders to the following U.S. Bank 
addresses:
    (i) Remittances through the U.S. Postal Service must be sent to the 
following address: Securities and Exchange Commission, P.O. Box 979081, 
St. Louis, MO 63197-9000.
    (ii) The following address can be used for remittances through other 
common carriers: U.S. Bank, Government Lockbox 979081, 1005 Convention 
Plaza, SL-MO-C2-GL, St. Louis, MO 63101.

    Note to paragraph (b). Wire transfers are not instantaneous. The 
time required to process a wire transfer through the FEDWIRE system, 
from origination to receipt by U.S. Bank, varies substantially. 
Specified filings, such as registration statements pursuant to section 
6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 that provide for the registration of 
securities and mandate the receipt of the appropriate fee payment upon 
filing, and transactional filings pursuant to the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, such as many proxy statements involving extraordinary 
business transactions, will not be accepted if sufficient funds have not 
been received by the Commission at the time of filing. You should obtain 
from your bank or wire transfer service the reference number of the wire 
transfer. Having this number can greatly facilitate tracing the funds if 
any problems occur. If a wire transfer of filing fees does not contain 
the required information in the proper format, the Commission may not be 
able to identify the payor and the acceptance of filings may be delayed. 
To ensure proper credit, you must provide all required information to 
the sending bank or wire transfer service. Commission data must be 
inserted in the proper fields. The most critical data are the 
Commission's account number at U.S. Bank and the Commission-assigned 
account number identified as the CIK number.

    (c) Special instructions for Sec. Sec. 230.462(b) and 230.110(d) of 
this chapter. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
for registration statements filed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 230.462(b) and 
Sec. 230.110(d) of this chapter, payment of filing fees for the 
purposes of this section may be made by:
    (1) The registrant or its agent instructing its bank or a wire 
transfer service to transmit to the Commission the applicable filing fee 
by a wire transfer of such amount from the issuer's account or its 
agent's account to the U.S. Treasury designated lockbox depository as 
soon as practicable, but no later than the close of

[[Page 207]]

the next business day following the filing of the registration 
statement; and
    (2) The registrant submitting with the registration statement at the 
time of filing a certification that:
    (i) The registrant or its agent has so instructed its bank or a wire 
transfer service;
    (ii) The registrant or its agent will not revoke such instructions; 
and
    (iii) The registrant or its agent has sufficient funds in such 
account to cover the amount of such filing fee.

    Note to paragraph (c). Such instructions may be sent on the date of 
filing the registration statement after the close of business of such 
bank or wire transfer service, provided that the registrant undertakes 
in the certification sent to the Commission with the registration 
statement that it will confirm receipt of such instructions by the bank 
or wire transfer service during regular business hours on the following 
business day.

    (d) Filing fee accounts. A filing fee account is maintained for each 
filer who submits a filing requiring a fee on the Commission's EDGAR 
system or who submits funds to the U.S. Treasury designated depository 
in anticipation of paying a filing fee. Account statements are regularly 
prepared and provided to account holders. Account holders must maintain 
a current account address with the Commission to ensure timely access to 
these statements.

    Note to paragraph (d). The deposit of money into a filing fee 
account does not constitute payment of a filing fee. Payment of the 
filing fee occurs at the time the filing is made, commensurate with the 
drawing down of the balance of the fee account.

    (e) Return of funds from inactive accounts. Funds held in any filing 
fee account in which there has not been a deposit, withdrawal or other 
adjustment for more than 180 calendar days will be returned to the 
account holder, and account statements will not be sent again until a 
deposit, withdrawal or other adjustment is made with respect to the 
account. Filers must maintain a current account address to assure the 
timely return of funds. It may not be possible to return funds from 
inactive accounts if the Commission is unable to identify a current 
account address of an account holder after making reasonable efforts to 
do so.

    Note to paragraph (e). A company must update its account and other 
addresses using the EDGAR Web site. This method ensures data integrity 
and the timeliest update. Simply changing an address in the text of the 
cover page of a filing made on the EDGAR system will not be sufficient 
to update the Commission's account address records.

[73 FR 6013, Feb. 1, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 202.4  Facilitating administrative hearings.

    (a) Applications, declarations, and other requests involving formal 
Commission action after opportunity for hearing are scrutinized by the 
appropriate division for conformance with applicable statutory standards 
and Commission rules and generally the filing party is advised of 
deficiencies. Prior to passing upon applications and declarations the 
Commission receives the views of all interested persons at public 
hearings whenever appropriate; hence, any applicant or declarant seeking 
Commission approval of proposed transactions by a particular time should 
file his application or declaration in time to allow for the 
presentation and consideration of such views.
    (b) After the staff has had an opportunity to study an application 
or declaration, interested persons may informally discuss the problems 
therein raised to the extent that time and the nature of the case permit 
(e.g., consideration is usually given to whether the proceeding is 
contested and if so to the nature of the contest). In such event, the 
staff will, to the extent feasible, advise as to the nature of the 
issues raised by the filing, the necessity for any amendments to the 
documents filed, the type of evidence it believes should be presented at 
the hearing and, in some instances, the nature, form, and contents of 
documents to be submitted as formal exhibits. The staff will, in 
addition, generally advise as to Commission policy in past cases which 
dealt with the same subject matter as the filing under consideration.
    (c) During the course of the hearings, the staff is generally 
available for informal discussions to reconcile bona fide divergent 
views not only between itself and other persons interested in the 
proceedings, but among all interested persons; and, when circumstances 
permit, an attempt is made to narrow,

[[Page 208]]

if possible, the issues to be considered at the formal hearing.
    (d) In some instances the Commission in the order accompanying its 
findings and opinion reserves jurisdiction over certain matters relating 
to the proceeding, such as payment of fees and expenses, accounting 
entries, terms and conditions relating to securities to be issued, and 
other matters. In such cases, upon receipt of satisfactory information 
and data the Commission considers whether further hearing is required 
before releasing jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 202.5  Enforcement activities.

    (a) Where, from complaints received from members of the public, 
communications from Federal or State agencies, examination of filings 
made with the Commission, or otherwise, it appears that there may be 
violation of the acts administered by the Commission or the rules or 
regulations thereunder, a preliminary investigation is generally made. 
In such preliminary investigation no process is issued or testimony 
compelled. The Commission may, in its discretion, make such formal 
investigations and authorize the use of process as it deems necessary to 
determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to 
violate any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules of a 
self-regulatory organization of which the person is a member or 
participant. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the 
investigation or examination is non-public and the reports thereon are 
for staff and Commission use only.
    (b) After investigation or otherwise the Commission may in its 
discretion take one or more of the following actions: Institution of 
administrative proceedings looking to the imposition of remedial 
sanctions, initiation of injunctive proceedings in the courts, and, in 
the case of a willful violation, reference of the matter to the 
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Commission may also, 
on some occasions, refer the matter to, or grant requests for access to 
its files made by, domestic and foreign governmental authorities or 
foreign securities authorities, self-regulatory organizations such as 
stock exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., 
and other persons or entities.
    (c) Persons who become involved in preliminary or formal 
investigations may, on their own initiative, submit a written statement 
to the Commission setting forth their interests and position in regard 
to the subject matter of the investigation. Upon request, the staff, in 
its discretion, may advise such persons of the general nature of the 
investigation, including the indicated violations as they pertain to 
them, and the amount of time that may be available for preparing and 
submitting a statement prior to the presentation of a staff 
recommendation to the Commission for the commencement of an 
administrative or injunction proceeding. Submissions by interested 
persons should be forwarded to the appropriate Division Director or 
Regional Director with a copy to the staff members conducting the 
investigation and should be clearly referenced to the specific 
investigation to which they relate. In the event a recommendation for 
the commencement of an enforcement proceeding is presented by the staff, 
any submissions by interested persons will be forwarded to the 
Commission in conjunction with the staff memorandum.
    (d) In instances where the staff has concluded its investigation of 
a particular matter and has determined that it will not recommend the 
commencement of an enforcement proceeding against a person, the staff, 
in its discretion, may advise the party that its formal investigation 
has been terminated. Such advice if given must in no way be construed as 
indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may 
ultimately result from the staff's investigation of the particular 
matter.
    (e) The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit 
brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory 
nature pending before it, it is important to avoid creating, or 
permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered 
or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur. 
Accordingly, it hereby announces its policy not to permit a defendant or 
respondent to consent to a judgment or

[[Page 209]]

order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the 
complaint or order for proceedings. In this regard, the Commission 
believes that a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a 
denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits 
nor denies the allegations.
    (f) In the course of the Commission's investigations, civil 
lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, the staff, with appropriate 
authorization, may discuss with persons involved the disposition of such 
matters by consent, by settlement, or in some other manner. It is the 
policy of the Commission, however, that the disposition of any such 
matter may not, expressly or impliedly, extend to any criminal charges 
that have been, or may be, brought against any such person or any 
recommendation with respect thereto. Accordingly, any person involved in 
an enforcement matter before the Commission who consents, or agrees to 
consent, to any judgment or order does so solely for the purpose of 
resolving the claims against him in that investigative, civil, or 
administrative matter and not for the purpose of resolving any criminal 
charges that have been, or might be, brought against him. This policy 
reflects the fact that neither the Commission nor its staff has the 
authority or responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or 
otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and 
responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and representatives of 
the Department of Justice.

Sec. 202.6  Adoption, revision, and rescission of rules and regulations of general application.

    (a) The procedure followed by the Commission in connection with the 
adoption, revision, and rescission of rules of general application 
necessarily varies in accordance with the nature of the rule, the extent 
of public interest therein, and the necessity for speed in its adoption. 
Rules relating to Commission organization, procedure and management, for 
example, are generally adopted by the Commission without affording 
public discussion thereof. On the other hand, in the adoption of 
substantive rules materially affecting an industry or a segment of the 
public, such as accounting rules, every feasible effort is made in 
advance of adoption to receive the views of persons to be affected. In 
such cases, proposals for the adoption, revision, or rescission of rules 
are initiated either by the Commission or by members of the public, and 
to the extent practicable, the practices set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section are observed.
    (b) After preliminary consideration by the Commission a draft of the 
proposed rule is published in the Federal Register and mailed to 
interested persons (e.g., other interested regulatory bodies, principal 
registrants or persons to be affected, stock exchanges, professional 
societies and leading authorities on the subject concerned and other 
persons requesting such draft) for comments. Unless accorded 
confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of the Commission, 
written comments filed with the Commission on or before the closing date 
for comments become a part of the public record upon the proposed rule. 
The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the public 
record written comments received by the Commission after the closing 
date.
    (c) Following analysis of comments received, the rule may be adopted 
in the form published or in a revised form in the light of such 
comments. In some cases, a revised draft is prepared and published and, 
where appropriate, an oral hearing may be held before final action upon 
the proposal. Any interested person may appear at the hearing and/or may 
submit written comment for consideration in accordance with the 
Commission's notice of the rulemaking procedure to be followed. The rule 
in the form in which it is adopted by the Commission is publicly 
released

[[Page 210]]

and is published in the Federal Register.

Sec. 202.9  Small entity enforcement penalty reduction policy.

    The Commission's policy with respect to whether to reduce or assess 
civil money penalties against a small entity is:
    (a) The Commission will consider on a case-by-case basis whether to 
reduce or not assess civil money penalties against a small entity. In 
determining whether to reduce or not assess penalties against a specific 
small entity, the following considerations will apply:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, penalty 
reduction will not be available for any small entity if:
    (i) The small entity was subject previously to an enforcement 
action;
    (ii) Any of the small entity's violations involved willful or 
criminal conduct; or
    (iii) The small entity did not make a good faith effort to comply 
with the law.
    (2) In considering whether the Commission will reduce or refrain 
from assessing a civil money penalty, the Commission may consider:
    (i) The egregiousness of the violations;
    (ii) The isolated or repeated nature of the violations;
    (iii) The violator's state of mind when committing the violations;
    (iv) The violator's history (if any) of legal or regulatory 
violations;
    (v) The extent to which the violator cooperated during the 
investigation;
    (vi) Whether the violator has engaged in subsequent remedial efforts 
to mitigate the effects of the violation and to prevent future 
violations;
    (vii) The degree to which a penalty will deter the violator or 
others from committing future violations; and
    (viii) Any other relevant fact.
    (3) The Commission also may consider whether to reduce or not assess 
a civil money penalty against a small entity, including a small entity 
otherwise excluded from this policy under paragraphs (a)(1) (i)-(iii) of 
this section, if the small entity can demonstrate to

[[Page 211]]

the Commission's satisfaction that it is financially unable to pay the 
penalty, immediately or over a reasonable period of time, in whole or in 
part.
    (4) For purposes of this policy, an entity qualifies as ``small'' if 
it is a small business or small organization as defined by Commission 
rules adopted for the purpose of compliance with the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. \1\ An entity not included in these definitions will be 
considered ``small'' for purposes of this policy if it meets the total 
asset amount that applies to issuers as set forth in Sec. 230.157a of 
this chapter. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Pursuant to the Reg. Flex. Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 601(3), the 
Commission has adopted appropriate definitions of ``small business'' for 
purposes of the Reg. Flex. Act. See 17 CFR 270.0-10, 275.0-7, 240.0-10, 
230.157, 250.110, and 260.0-7. The Commission recently proposed 
amendments to certain of these definitions. Definitions of ``Small 
Business'' or ``Small Organization'' Under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, and the Securities Act of 1933, Securities Act Rel. No. 7383, 
62 FR 4106 (Jan. 28, 1997). The Commission extended the comment period 
for the proposed amendments to April 30, 1997, 62 FR 13356 (Mar. 20, 
1997). Based on an analysis of the language and legislative history of 
the Reg. Flex. Act, Congress does not appear to have intended that Act 
to apply to natural persons (as opposed to individual proprietorships) 
or to foreign entities. The Commission understands that staff at the 
Small Business Administration have taken the same position.
    \2\ At present, this threshold is $5 million. Thus, non-regulated 
entities, such as general partnerships, privately held corporations or 
professional service organizations, with assets of $5 million or less 
may qualify for penalty-reduction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) This policy does not create a right or remedy for any person. 
This policy shall not apply to any remedy that may be sought by the 
Commission other than civil money penalties, whether or not such other 
remedy may be characterized as penal or remedial.

    Freedom of the press is of vital importance to the mission of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Effective journalism complements the 
Commission's efforts to ensure that investors receive the full and fair 
disclosure that the law requires, and that they deserve. Diligent 
reporting is an essential means of bringing securities law violations to 
light and ultimately helps to deter illegal conduct. In this Policy 
Statement the Commission sets forth guidelines for the agency's 
professional staff to ensure that vigorous enforcement of the federal 
securities laws is conducted completely consistently with the principles 
of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press, and 
specifically to avoid the issuance of subpoenas to members of the media 
that might impair the news gathering and reporting functions. These 
guidelines shall be adhered to by all members of the staff in all cases:
    (a) In determining whether to issue a subpoena to a member of the 
news media, the approach in every case must be to strike the proper 
balance between the public's interest in the free dissemination of ideas 
and information and the public's interest in effective enforcement of 
the federal securities laws.
    (b) When the staff investigating a matter determines that a member 
of the news media may have information relevant to the investigation, 
the staff should:
    (1) Determine whether the information might be obtainable from 
alternative non-media sources.
    (2) Make all reasonable efforts to obtain that information from 
those alternative sources. Whether all reasonable efforts have been made 
will depend on the particular circumstances of the investigation, 
including whether there is an immediate need to preserve assets or 
protect investors from an ongoing fraud.
    (3) Determine whether the information is essential to successful 
completion of the investigation.
    (c) If the information cannot reasonably be obtained from 
alternative sources and the information is essential to the 
investigation, then the staff, after seeking approval from the 
responsible Regional Director, District Administrator, or Associate 
Director, should contact legal counsel for the member of the news media. 
Staff

[[Page 212]]

should contact a member of the news media directly only if the member is 
not represented by legal counsel. The purpose of this contact is to 
explore whether the member may have information essential to the 
investigation, and to determine the interests of the media with respect 
to the information. If the nature of the investigation permits, the 
staff should make clear what its needs are as well as its willingness to 
respond to particular problems of the media. The staff should consult 
with the Commission's Office of Public Affairs, as appropriate.
    (d) The staff should negotiate with news media members or their 
counsel, consistently with this Policy Statement, to obtain the 
essential information through informal channels, avoiding the issuance 
of a subpoena, if the responsible Regional Director, District 
Administrator, or Associate Director determines that such negotiations 
would not substantially impair the integrity of the investigation. 
Depending on the circumstances of the investigation, informal channels 
may include voluntary production, informal interviews, or written 
summaries.
    (e) If negotiations are not successful in achieving a resolution 
that accommodates the Commission's interest in the information and the 
media's interests without issuing a subpoena, the staff investigating 
the matter should then consider whether to seek the issuance of a 
subpoena for the information. The following principles should guide the 
determination of whether a subpoena to a member of the news media should 
be issued:
    (1) There should be reasonable grounds to believe that the 
information sought is essential to successful completion of the 
investigation. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral or 
nonessential information.
    (2) The staff should have exhausted all reasonable alternative means 
of obtaining the information from non-media sources. Whether all 
reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the information from 
alternative sources will depend on the particular circumstances of the 
investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to preserve 
assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.
    (f) If there are reasonable grounds to believe the information 
sought is essential to the investigation, all reasonable alternative 
means of obtaining it have been exhausted, and all efforts at 
negotiation have failed, then the staff investigating the matter shall 
seek authorization for the subpoena from the Director of the Division of 
Enforcement. No subpoena shall be issued unless the Director, in 
consultation with the General Counsel, has authorized its issuance.
    (g) In the event the Director of the Division of Enforcement, after 
consultation with the General Counsel, authorizes the issuance of a 
subpoena, notice shall immediately be provided to the Chairman of the 
Commission.
    (h) Counsel (or the member of the news media, if not represented by 
counsel) shall be given reasonable and timely notice of the 
determination of the Director of the Division of Enforcement to 
authorize the subpoena and the Director's intention to issue it.
    (i) Subpoenas should be negotiated with counsel for the member of 
the news media to narrowly tailor the request for only essential 
information. In negotiations with counsel, the staff should attempt to 
accommodate the interests of the Commission in the information with the 
interests of the media.
    (j) Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material 
information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a 
reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production 
of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable 
and timely notice of their demand for documents.
    (k) In the absence of special circumstances, subpoenas to members of 
the news media should be limited to the verification of published 
information and to surrounding circumstances relating to the accuracy of 
published information.
    (l) Because the intent of this policy statement is to protect 
freedom of the press, news gathering functions, and news media sources, 
this policy statement does not apply to demands for purely commercial or 
financial information unrelated to the news gathering function.

[[Page 213]]

    (m) Failure to follow this policy may constitute grounds for 
appropriate disciplinary action. The principles set forth in this 
statement are not intended to create or recognize any legally 
enforceable rights in any person.

PCAOB or explain any changes from the preliminary budget and/or such 
proposed revisions.
    (3) In addition to amounts needed to fund disbursements during the 
budget year, a budget may reflect receipts in amounts needed to fund 
expected disbursements during a period not to exceed the first five 
months of the fiscal year immediately following the budget year (the 
working capital reserve), provided such amounts shall be disbursed only 
as specified in the following year's budget or in a supplemental budget 
approved by the Commission.
    (4) In approving the budget the Commission may not change the 
amounts earmarked for programs, program areas, or activities, or any 
other aspects of the budget; provided, that if the budget is 
conditionally rather than finally approved, then the Commission may 
transmit to the Board such proposed changes as are consistent with the 
preliminary budget and any revisions previously proposed by the 
Commission when it passed the budget back to the PCAOB. No proposed 
reduction or increase may be greater than that included in the 
preliminary budget and any revisions previously proposed by the 
Commission when it passed the budget back to the PCAOB.
    (5) In the event the budget is conditionally approved by the 
Commission, the PCAOB shall have the opportunity to consider the changes 
proposed by the Commission and to vote again for final approval of the 
budget as amended. If this iterative process has not resolved 
differences between the Commission and the PCAOB by December 23, then 
the terms of the most recent conditional approval shall become final, 
and the budget shall be deemed finally approved.
    (e) Limitation on spending. (1) The PCAOB shall not spend in a 
budget year more than the amount specified in the Commission-approved 
PCAOB budget for that year, regardless of the source of the funds, 
unless such expenses have been approved by the Commission through a 
supplemental budget request.
    (2) Funds may be disbursed by the PCAOB only in accordance with the 
Commission approved budget, provided however, during the budget year the 
PCAOB may transfer amounts totaling not more than $1,000,000 into or out 
of each program area without prior Commission approval. Further, the 
PCAOB shall not:
    (i) Apply its resources in a manner not fairly implied in the 
Commission-approved budget and budget justification, such as to create 
programs to perform functions that are not, or to perform functions in a 
way that is not, fairly implied from the Commission-approved budget and 
budget justification, or
    (ii) Eliminate programs described in the Commission-approved budget 
and budget justification.
    (3) In the event that the Commission has not approved a budget for a 
PCAOB fiscal year before the beginning of that fiscal year, the PCAOB 
may spend funds from the reserve and continue to incur obligations as if 
the PCAOB budget or supplemental budget most recently approved by the 
Commission were continuing in effect for that fiscal year.
    (f) Supplemental budget. (1) The PCAOB may submit to the Commission 
a request for approval of a supplemental budget subsequent to Commission 
approval of the budget for the budget year in order to spend any amounts 
in excess of, or contrary to, the limitations described in paragraphs 
(e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) To facilitate Commission review and approval, a supplemental

project or activity;
    (ii) A statement regarding how the supplemental budget facilitates 
the strategic and policy goals of the PCAOB;
    (iii) Information indicating why the amount was not included in the 
budget for the current year, including a description of any subsequent 
and unforeseen events or circumstances necessitating the supplemental 
budget request;
    (iv) Information indicating why the request should not or cannot be 
postponed until the next regular annual budget process; and
    (v) The proposed source for the funds, including any offsets to be 
made elsewhere in the PCAOB's programs and activities.
    (g) Maintenance of records; reports. (1) The PCAOB shall maintain, 
and make available to the Commission or Commission staff upon request, a 
strategic plan and records in reasonable detail that support each 
preliminary budget, budget, budget justification, supplemental budget 
and other report or communication in compliance with this section, 
including past and projected receipts, outlays, obligations, and 
employment levels.
    (2) The PCAOB is required to maintain and, within 30 business days 
after the end of each fiscal quarter, to furnish to the Commission a 
report of its spending and staffing levels for the quarter just ended, 
comparing those levels to the levels in the Commission approved budget.
    (h) Publication of budget. (1) Following submission of the PCAOB-
approved budget to the Commission, such budget and budget justification, 
subject to any applicable exemption under the Freedom of Information 
Act, shall be made available to the public. Neither the Commission nor 
the PCAOB shall publish a preliminary budget, budget, budget 
justification, or any underlying materials in connection therewith, 
until such time as the budget is approved by the PCAOB and submitted to 
the Commission for its approval.
    (2) Supplemental budgets shall be made public, following approval by 
the PCAOB and submission to the Commission, in the same manner as 
described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) The Commission-approved budget shall be made available to the

persons involved in the investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of 
the investigation.
    (b) Any person compelled to appear, or who appears by request or 
permission of the Commission, in person at a formal investigative 
proceeding may be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel, as 
defined in Sec. 201.101(a) of this chapter (Rule 101(a) of the

such person.
    (d) Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, in any public formal 
investigative proceeding, if the record shall contain implications of 
wrongdoing by any person, such person shall have the right to appear on 
the record; and in addition to the rights afforded other witnesses 
hereby, he shall have a reasonable opportunity of cross-examination and 
production of rebuttal testimony or documentary evidence. Reasonable 
shall mean permitting persons as full an opportunity to assert their 
position as may be granted consistent with administrative efficiency and 
with avoidance of undue delay. The determination of reasonableness in 
each instance shall be made in the discretion of the officer conducting 
the investigation.
    (e) The officer conducting the investigation may report to the 
Commission any instances where any witness or counsel has been guilty of 
dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct during the course of an 
investigation or any other instance of violation of these rules. The 
Commission will thereupon take such further action as the circumstances 
may warrant, including suspension or disbarment of counsel from further 
appearance or practice before it, in accordance with Sec. 201.102(e) of 
this chapter (Rule 102(e) of the Commission's rules of practice), or 
exclusion from further participation in the particular investigation.

    Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3716, 31 CFR 901.3.

    Source: 58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 204.1  Applicability and scope.

    (a) The procedures authorized for administrative offset are 
contained in Section 10 of the Debt Collection Act (codified at 31 
U.S.C. 3716). The Act requires that notice procedures be observed by the 
agency. The debtor is also afforded an opportunity to inspect and copy 
government records pertaining to the claim, enter into an agreement for 
repayment, and to a review of the claim (if requested). Like salary 
offset, agencies may cooperate with one another in order to effectuate 
recovery of the claim.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to the collection of debts 
owed to the United States arising from transactions with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (Commission). These regulations are consistent 
with the Debt Collection Act and the Federal Claims Collection Standards 
on administrative offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and 
the Department of the Treasury (31 CFR 901.3).

Sec. 204.2  Definitions.

    (a) Administrative offset as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1) means 
withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable 
by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the 
United States for, a person to satisfy a claim.
    (b) Person includes a natural person or persons, profit or nonprofit 
corporation, partnership, association, trust, estate, consortium, or 
other entity which is capable of owing a debt to the United States 
Government except that agencies of the United States, or of any State or 
local government shall be excluded.

<R05>
Sec. 204.3  General.

    (a) The Chairperson (or designee) may initiate administrative offset 
with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United 
States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another 
agency or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists 
and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
    (b) The Chairperson (or designee) may notify the Department of the 
Treasury of delinquent debts for purposes of administrative offset, and 
may request another agency which holds funds payable to a Commission 
debtor to offset that debt against the funds held; the Commission will 
provide certification that:
    (1) The debt is past due and legally enforceable; and
    (2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
    (c) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt 
that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material 
to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and 
reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials 
responsible for discovering the debt. This limitation does not apply to 
debts reduced to judgment.
    (d) Administrative offset under this subpart may not be initiated 
against:
    (1) A debt in which administrative offset of the type of debt 
involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute;
    (2) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any 
State or local Government; or
    (3) Debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; the 
Social Security Act; or the tariff laws of the United States.
    (e) The procedures for administrative offset in this subpart do not 
apply to the offset of Federal salaries under 5

[[Page 220]]

U.S.C. 5514 or Federal tax refunds under 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 
285.2.

<R05>
Sec. 204.4  Demand for payment--notice.

    (a) Before offset is made, a written notice will be sent to the 
debtor. This notice will include:
    (1) The type and amount of the debt;
    (2) The date when payment is due (not less than thirty days from the 
date of mailing or hand delivery of the notice);
    (3) The agency's intention to collect the debt by administrative 
offset, including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to 
help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment 
by the payment due date or has not made an arrangement for payment by 
the payment due date;
    (4) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the Commission's 
records related to the claim;
    (5) The right of the debtor to request a review of the determination 
of indebtedness and, in the circumstances described in Sec. 204.7, to 
request an oral hearing from the Commission's designee; and
    (6) The right of the debtor to enter into a written agreement with 
the agency to repay the debt in some other way.
    (b) Claims for payment of travel advances and employee training 
expenses require notification prior to administrative offset as 
described in this section. Because no oral hearing is required, notice 
of the right to a hearing need not be included in the notification.

[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54130, Oct. 26, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 204.5  Debtor's failure to respond.

    If the debtor fails to respond to the notice described in Sec. 
204.4(a) by the proposed effective date specified in the notice, the 
Commission may take further action under this section or under the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 901.3). The commission may 
collect by administrative offset if the debtor:
    (a) Has not made payment by the payment due date;
    (b) Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set 
out in Sec. 204.6; or
    (c) Has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date.

[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54130, Oct. 26, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 204.6  Agency review.

    (a) To the extent that a debt owed has not been established by 
judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing 
concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of 
repayment. With respect to debts established by a judicial or 
administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing concerning the 
payment or other discharge of the debt. A request to review a disputed 
debt must be submitted to the Commission official who provided 
notification within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written 
notice described in Sec. 204.4(c).
    (b) The Commission will provide a copy of the record to the debtor 
and advise him/her to furnish available evidence to support his or her 
position. Upon receipt of the evidence, the written record of 
indebtedness will be reviewed and the debtor will be informed of the 
results of that review.
    (c) Pending the resolution of a dispute by the debtor, transactions 
in any of the debtor's accounts maintained by the Commission may be 
temporarily suspended. Depending on the type of transaction, the 
suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as 
prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the 
dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be 
immediately lifted.
    (d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs will continue to accrue.

[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 204.7  Hearing.

    (a) A debtor will be provided a reasonable opportunity for an oral 
hearing by the Commission's designee when:
    (1) (i) By statute, consideration must be given to a request to 
waive the indebtedness;

[[Page 221]]

    (ii) The debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness; and
    (iii) The waiver determination rests on an issue of credibility or 
veracity; or
    (2) The debtor requests reconsideration and the Commission's 
designee determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved 
by reviewing the documentary evidence.
    (b) In cases where an oral hearing is provided to the debtor, the 
Commission's designee will conduct the hearing, and provide the debtor 
with a written decision 30 days after the hearing.

[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 204.8  Written agreement for repayment.

    If the debtor requests a repayment agreement in place of offset, the 
Commission has discretion to determine whether to accept a repayment 
agreement in place of offset. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor 
has not disputed its existence or amount, the Commission will not accept 
a repayment agreement in place of offset unless the debtor is able to 
establish that offset would cause undue financial hardship or be unjust. 
No repayment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a 
financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting the 
debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial 
statement must be submitted within ten business days of the Commission's 
request for the statement. At the Commission's option, a confess-
judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety may be required for 
installment agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 
any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by the Debt 
Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711-3720E, and the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards, 31 CFR 900.1-904.4.

[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 204.9  Administrative offset procedures.

    (a) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review 
within the time specified in Sec. 204.4, or if as a result of the 
review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement 
is executed, then administrative offset shall be ordered in accordance 
with this subpart without further notice.
    (b) Travel advance. The Commission will deduct outstanding advances 
provided to Commission travelers from other amounts owed the traveler by 
the agency whenever possible and practicable. Monies owed by an employee 
for outstanding travel advances that cannot be deducted from other 
travel amounts due that employee will be collected through salary offset 
as described in subpart B of this part.
    (c) Requests for offset to the Department of the Treasury or other 
Federal agencies. The Chairperson (or his or her designee) may notify 
the Department of the Treasury of delinquent debts for purposes of 
administrative offset, and may request that a debt owed to the 
Commission be administratively offset against funds due and payable to a 
debtor by another Federal agency. In requesting administrative offset, 
the Commission, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal 
agency holding funds of the debtor that:
    (1) The debtor owes the past due and legally enforceable debt; and
    (2) The debtor has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
    (d) Requests for offset from other Federal agencies. Any Federal 
agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the 
Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to 
such Federal agency by the debtor. The Commission shall initiate the 
requested offset only upon:
    (1) Receipt of written certification from the crecitor agency that:
    (i) The debtor owes the past due and legally enforceable debt; and
    (ii) The debtor has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
    (2) A determination by the Commission that collection by offset 
against funds payable by the Commission would be in the best interest of 
the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the 
particular case, and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to 
law.

Sec. 204.10  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 204.11  Jeopardy procedure.

    The Commission may effect an administrative offset against a payment 
to be made to the debtor prior to the completion of the procedures 
required by Sec. 204.4(a) if failure to take the offset would 
substantially jeopardize the Commission's ability to collect the debt, 
and the time available before the payment is to be made does not 
reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset 
shall be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. 
Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the 
Commission shall be promptly refunded. This section applies only to 
administrative offset pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3(c), and does not apply 
when debts are referred to the Department of the Treasury for mandatory 
centralized administrative offset under 31 CFR 901.3(b)(1).

[[Page 224]]

prescribed by Sec. 204.35, Petition for pre-offset hearing. Such

<R05>
Sec. 204.34  Employee response.

    (a) Introduction. An employee must respond to a pre-offset notice, 
if at all, within 15 calendar days following receipt, in one or more of 
the ways discussed in Sec. 204.34, Employee response, and Sec. 204.35, 
Petition for pre-offset hearing. Where applicable, the employee bears 
the burdens of proof and persuasion.
    (b) Responses must be submitted in writing to the program official 
who signed the pre-offset notice. A timely response will stay the 
commencement of collection by salary offset, at least until the issuance 
of a written decision. (See Sec. 204.37, Extensions of time). Failure 
to submit a timely response will be treated as an admission of 
indebtedness, and will result in salary offset in accordance with the 
terms specified in the pre-offset notice.
    (c) A response filed after expiration of the 15 day period may be 
accepted if the employee can show that the delay was due to 
circumstances beyond his or her control or failure to receive notice of 
the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it).
    (d) Voluntary repayment agreement. An employee may request to enter 
into a voluntary written agreement for repayment of the debt in lieu of 
offset. It is within the discretion of the program official whether to 
enter into such an agreement, and if so, upon what terms. Voluntary 
deductions may exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay. If an 
agreement is reached, the agreement must be in writing, and must be 
signed by both the employee and the program official. A signed copy must 
be sent to the Comptroller's office. The program official shall notify 
the employee in writing of its decision not to accept the proposed 
voluntary repayment schedule before making any deductions from the 
employee's salary.
    (e) Waiver. Any request for waiver of the debt must be accompanied 
by evidence that the waiver is authorized by law.
    (f) Reconsideration. An employee may request reconsideration of the 
existence or amount of the debt or the offset schedule as reflected in 
the pre-offset notice. The request must be accompanied by a detailed 
narrative and supporting documentation as to why the offset decision is 
erroneous and/or why the offset schedule imposes an undue hardship.

[[Page 225]]


<R05>
Sec. 204.35  Petition for pre-offset hearing.

    (a) The employee may petition for a pre-offset hearing. The petition 
must state with specificity why the employee believes the agency's 
determination is in error. To the extent that a debt has not been 
established by judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a 
pre-offset hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the 
terms of repayment. With respect to debts established by a judicial or 
administrative order, a debtor may request a pre-offset hearing 
concerning the payment or other discharge of the debt.
    (b) The petition must fully identify and explain, with reasonable 
specificity, all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, that the 
employee believes support his or her position. The petition must be 
signed by the employee.

Sec. 204.36  Granting of a pre-offset hearing.

    (a) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the 
timeliness is waived, the program official must:
    (1) arrange for a hearing official. If the hearing official is an 
administrative law judge, he or she shall be designated by the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge as set forth in 17 CFR 200.310(a)(2); and
    (2) provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which 
the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are 
based.
    (b) The hearing official shall notify the employee by personal 
service, by first class, registered or certified mail, or by a reliable 
commercial courier or overnight delivery service whether the employee is 
entitled to an oral or ``paper'' (i.e., a review on the written record) 
hearing. (See 31 CFR 901.3(e).) Within 20 calendar days of receipt of 
this notice the employee shall provide the hearing official with a full 
description of all relevant facts, documentary evidence, and witnesses 
which the employee believes support his or her position. The hearing 
official may extend the time for the employee to respond to the notice 
for good cause shown.
    (c) If an oral hearing is scheduled, the hearing official shall 
notify the program official and the employee in writing of the date, 
time and location of the hearing. The place for the hearing shall be 
fixed by the hearing official with due regard for the public interest 
and the convenience and necessity of the parties, the participants, or 
their representatives.
    (d) If the employee is entitled to an oral hearing, but requests to 
have the hearing based only on the written submissions, the employee 
must notify the hearing official and the program official at least 3 
calendar days before the date of the oral hearing. The hearing official 
may waive the 3-day requirement for good cause.
    (e) Failure of the employee to appear at the oral hearing may result 
in dismissal of the petition and affirmation of the program official's 
decision.

Sec. 204.37  Extensions of time.

    The hearing official may for good cause or in the interests of 
justice postpone the commencement of the hearing, adjourn a convened 
hearing for a reasonable period of time or extend or shorten any other 
time limits prescribed under this section. This extension is not 
intended to abridge the 30 day initial notice or extend the 60 day 
decision requirement other than as provided for in 5 CFR 
550.1104(d)(10).


<R05>
Sec. 204.38  Pre-offset hearing.

    (a) The hearing official shall determine the form and content of 
hearings granted under this section, pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3(e). All 
oral hearings shall be on the record. Except as otherwise ordered by the 
hearing official, hearings shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim by 
shorthand, mechanical means, electronic sound recording, or any other 
method, subject to the discretion and approval of the hearing official, 
and a transcript thereof shall be made.
    (b) Oral hearings are informal in nature. The Commission, 
represented by an attorney from the Office of General Counsel, and 
accompanied by a program official and the employee, and/or the 
employee's representative, orally

[[Page 226]]

shall explain their respective positions using relevant documentation. 
The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to cross 
examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify where the hearing 
official determines the testimony to be relevant and not redundant. The 
Federal Rules of Evidence serve as a guideline, but are not controlling. 
The employee bears the burdens of proof and persuasion.
    (c) The hearing official shall:
    (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing;
    (2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum and 
avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing; and
    (3) Issue a decision in accordance with Sec. 204.39, Written 
decision, on the basis of the oral hearing and the written record.
    (d) Oral hearings are normally open to the public. However, the 
hearing official may close all or any portion of the hearing at either 
the request of either party or upon the hearing official's initiative 
when doing so is in the best interest[s] of the employee or the public.
    (e) Oral hearings may be conducted by conference call at the request 
of the employee or at the discretion of the hearing official.
    (f) Pre-offset ``paper'' hearing. If a hearing is to be held only 
upon written submissions, the hearing official shall issue a decision 
based solely upon the written record.

[58 FR 38520, July 19, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54132, Oct. 26, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 204.39  Written decision.

    (a) If pre-offset hearing is held. Within 60 days of the filing of 
the employee's petition for a pre-offset hearing, the hearing official 
will issue a written decision setting forth the basis of his/her 
findings in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1104(g)(3).
    (b) If the employee challenges the pre-offset notice under Sec. 
204.34, Employee response and/or Sec. 204.35, Petition for pre-offset 
hearing, without requesting a hearing or a hearing is denied, the 
program official must notify the employee of his/her final determination 
in writing before offset can begin. The agency's execution of a 
voluntary repayment agreement satisfies this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 204.40  Deductions.

    (a) When deductions may begin:
    (1) If a pre-offset hearing is held, deductions shall be made in 
accordance with the hearing official's decision.
    (2) If parties execute a voluntary repayment agreement, deductions 
shall be made in accordance with the terms of that agreement.
    (3) If the employee requests a waiver or reconsideration or the 
program official refuses to accept a proposed alternate repayment 
schedule, deductions shall be made in accordance with the program 
official's written decision.
    (4) If the employee consents to the terms and conditions set forth 
in the Commission's Pre-offset Notice or fails to respond in timely 
fashion to the Pre-offset Notice, or waives his/her right to a hearing 
without otherwise challenging the terms of the Pre-offset Notice, 
deductions shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set 
forth therein.
    (b) Retired or separated employees. If the employee retires, 
resigns, or is terminated before the debt is fully repaid, the remaining 
indebtedness will be offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS.
    (1) To the extent possible, the remaining indebtedness will be 
liquidated from any final payment due the former employee as of the date 
of separation (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.). See 
Sec. 204.40d(3), Offset deductions from final salary and/or lump-sum 
leave payment.
    (2) Thereafter, the remaining indebtedness will be recovered from 
later payments of any kind due the former employee from the United 
States. See the FCCS.
    (c) Method of collection and source of deduction. The method of 
collecting debts under these regulations shall be by salary offset. 
Deductions will be made from the employee's current disposable pay 
account except as provided for in Sec. 204.34b, Employee response.
    (d) Amount and duration of deductions. Debts must be collected in 
one lump sum where possible. If the employee demonstrates financial 
hardship to the Commission's satisfaction or the

[[Page 227]]

amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of the indebted employee's current 
disposable pay, collection must be made in installments over a period 
not greater than the anticipated period of active employment, except as 
provided in Section 34b, Employee Response.
    (1) Installment deductions will be made over the shortest period 
possible. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a 
reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability 
to pay.
    (2) The amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of 
the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. Installment 
payment of less than $100 per pay period will he accepted only in the 
most unusual circumstances.
    (3) Offset deductions from final salary and/or lump-sum leave 
payment. Such an offset deduction may exceed 15 percent of an employee's 
final salary and/or lump-sum leave payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, 
64 CG 907.
    (e) Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this 
part will be assessed and/or waived according to the provisions of 31 
CFR 901.9.

<R05>
Sec. 204.41  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver 
of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any 
other provision of contract or law, unless there are statutory or 
contractual provisions to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 204.42  Refunds.

    (a) The Commission will refund promptly to the appropriate 
individual amounts offset under this regulation when:
    (1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States 
(unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (2) The Commission is directed by an administrative or judicial 
order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.
    (b) Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law 
or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 204.43  Coordinating offset with another federal agency.

    (a) Responsibility of the Commission as the Creditor Agency. When 
possible, salary offset through the centralized administrative offset 
procedures in 5 CFR 550.1108 shall be attempted before applying the 
procedures in this section. If centralized administrative offset is not 
possible, the Commission shall request recovery from the current paying 
agency. Upon completion of the procedures established in these 
regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, 5 CFR 550.1109 the Commission 
must:
    (1) Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount 
and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the date the 
Government's right to collect the debt first accrued and that the 
Commission's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved 
by OPM.
    (2) If the collection must be made in installments, the Commission 
also must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of 
disposable pay to be collected in each installment, and if the 
Commission wishes, the number and the commencing date of the 
installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay 
period is required).
    (3) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) the action(s) was taken (unless the 
employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a 
statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the 
written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency).
    (4) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(4), the 
Commission must submit a debt claim containing the information specified 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section and an installment 
agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, 
to the employee's paying agency.
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission 
must

[[Page 228]]

submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as 
provided in 5 CFR 550.1104(l). Pursuant to 5 CFR 1101, the paying agency 
must certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor 
agency and employee. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is 
entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to 
the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a 
debt (including the amount) and that the paying agency has fully 
complied with the provisions of this section. The Commission must submit 
a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such 
payments before the collection can be made.
    (6) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from 
his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Commission may 
request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the 
employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 
831.1801) or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect 
the debt (See 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).
    (7) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the 
Commission shall not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 
U.S.C. 5514 and subpart B of this part to resume the collection. The 
Commission must review the debt upon receiving the former paying 
agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection 
is resumed by the new paying agency. The Commission must submit a 
properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can 
be resumed.
    (b) Responsibility of the Commission as the paying agency--(1) 
Complete claim. When the Commission receives a properly certified claim 
from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the 
next officially established pay interval. The Commission must notify the 
employee in writing that the Commission has received a certified debt 
claim from the creditor agency (including the amount) and the date 
salary offset will begin and the amount of such deductions.
    (2) Incomplete claim. When the Commission receives an incomplete 
certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Commission must return 
the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 
subpart B of this part must be provided and a properly certified debt 
claim received before action will be taken to collect from the 
employee's current pay account.
    (3) Review. The Commission is not authorized to review the merits of 
the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or 
validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
    (4) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. If, 
after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Commission 
and before the Commission collects the debt in full, the employee 
transfers to another agency, the Commission must certify the total 
amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification must be 
furnished to the employee and one copy to the creditor agency along with 
notice of the employee's transfer.
    (c) Responsibility of the Program Official. (1) The Program Official 
shall coordinate debt collections and shall, as appropriate:
    (i) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petition by a federal 
employee; and
    (ii) Prescribe, upon consultation with the General Counsel, such 
practices and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the intent of 
this regulation.
    (2) The Program Official shall be responsible for:
    (i) Ensuring that each certification of debt sent to a paying agency 
is consistent with the pre-offset notice (Sec. 204.33, Pre-offset 
notice).
    (ii) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to 
Sec. 204.36, Granting of a pre-offset hearing.
    (iii) Ensuring that hearings are properly scheduled.

Sec. 204.52  Notification of intent to collect.

    (a) Notification before tax refund offset. Reduction of an income 
tax refund will be made only after the Commission makes a determination 
that an amount is owed and past-due and gives or makes a reasonable 
attempt to give the debtor 60 days written notice of the intent to 
collect by tax refund offset.
    (b) Contents of notice. The Commission's notice of intent to collect 
by tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state:
    (1) The amount of the debt;
    (2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of 
the Commission's Notice of Intent, the Commission intends to collect the 
debt by requesting a reduction of any amounts payable to the debtor as a 
Federal income tax refund by an amount equal to the amount of the debt 
and all accumulated interest and other charges;
    (3) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and 
a contact name and a telephone number for any questions; and
    (4) That the debtor may present evidence to the Commission that all 
or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable by:
    (i) Sending a written request for a review of the evidence to the 
address provided in the notice;
    (ii) Stating in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why 
the debtor believes that the debt is not past due or is not legally 
enforceable; and
    (iii) Including in the request any documents that the debtor wishes 
to be considered or stating that the additional information will be 
submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period.
    (c) To the extent that a debt owed has not been established by 
judicial or administrative order, a debtor may dispute the existence or 
amount of the debt or the terms of repayment. With respect to debts 
established by a judicial or administrative order, Commission review 
will be limited to issues concerning the payment or other discharge of 
the debt.

Intent, the Commission receives notice that the debtor will submit 
additional evidence or receives additional evidence from the debtor 
within the prescribed time period, tax refund offset will be stayed 
until the Commission can:
    (1) Consider the evidence presented by the debtor; and
    (2) Determine whether or not all or a portion of the debt is still 
past due and legally enforceable; and
    (3) Notify the debtor of its determination.
    (b) Commission action on the debt. (1) The Commission will notify 
the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against 
the debtor's Federal income tax refund if it sustains its decision that 
the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. The Commission will also 
notify the debtor whether the amount of the debt remains the same or is 
modified; and

    (a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the 
information contained in the notification;
    (b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the 
debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt 
referred to FMS for offset; or
    (c) If the debt amount is otherwise incorrect, except that the 
amount of a debt referred to FMS will not be increased unless the

    Source: 66 FR 54132, Oct. 26, 2001, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 204.60  Purpose.

    This subpart provides procedures for the Commission to collect money 
from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage 
garnishment to satisfy a delinquent nontax debt owed to the United 
States.


<R05>
Sec. 204.61  Scope.

    (a) The receipt of payments pursuant to this subpart does not 
preclude the Commission from pursuing other debt collection remedies, 
including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy a delinquent nontax 
debt owed to the United States. The Commission may pursue such debt 
collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative 
wage garnishment.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to the collection of delinquent 
nontax debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal 
employees from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the 
Federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other 
applicable laws.


<R05>
Sec. 204.62  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Debt or delinquent nontax debt means any money, funds or property 
that has been determined to be owed to the Commission by an individual 
that has not been paid by the date specified in the demand or order for 
payment, or applicable agreement. For purposes of this subpart, the 
terms ``debt'' and ``claim'' are synonymous.
    Disposable pay means that part of the debtor's compensation 
(including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and 
vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health 
insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For 
purposes of this subpart, ``amounts required by law to be withheld'' 
include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and 
withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a 
court order.
    Employer means a person or entity that employs the services of 
others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer 
includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does 
not include an agency of the Federal Government.
    Garnishment means the process of withholding amounts from an 
employee's disposable pay and the paying of

[[Page 231]]

those amounts to a creditor in satisfaction of a withholding order.
    Withholding order means any order for withholding or garnishment of 
pay issued by an agency, or judicial or administrative body. For 
purposes of this subpart, the terms ``wage garnishment order'' and 
``garnishment order'' have the same meaning as ``withholding order.''


<R05>
Sec. 204.63  Notice.

    (a) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment 
proceedings, the Commission will mail, by first class mail to the 
debtor's last known address, a written notice informing the debtor of:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) The Commission's intention to initiate proceedings to collect 
the debt through deductions from pay until the debt and all accumulated 
interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; and
    (3) An explanation of the debtor's rights, including those set forth 
in paragraph (b) of this section, and the time frame within which the 
debtor may exercise these rights.
    (b) The debtor will be afforded the opportunity:
    (1) To inspect and copy records related to the debt;
    (2) To enter into a written repayment agreement with the Commission, 
under terms agreeable to the Commission; and
    (3) To the extent that a debt owed has not been established by 
judicial or administrative order, to request a hearing concerning the 
existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the debt's repayment 
schedule. With respect to debts established by a judicial or 
administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing concerning the 
payment or other discharge of the debt. The debtor is not entitled to a 
hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these 
terms have been established by written agreement under paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (c) The notice required by this section may be included with the 
Commission's demand letter required by subpart A of this part.
    (d) The Commission will keep a copy of the certificate of service 
indicating the date of mailing of the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 204.64  Hearing.

    (a) Request for hearing. The Commission will order a hearing, which 
at the Commission's option may be oral or written, if the debtor submits 
a written request for a hearing concerning, for debts not previously 
established by judicial or administrative order, the existence or amount 
of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule (for repayment 
schedules established other than by written agreement under Sec. 
204.63(b)(2)), or for debts established by judicial or administrative 
order, the payment or other discharge of the debt.
    (b) Type of hearing or review. (1) For purposes of this subpart, 
whenever the Commission is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the 
Commission will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an 
oral hearing when the Commission determined that the issues in dispute 
cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, 
when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or 
veracity.
    (2) If the Commission determines that an oral hearing is 
appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established 
by the Commission. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be 
conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel 
expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing 
will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the 
hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.
    (3) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this 
section, the Commission will nevertheless accord the debtor a ``paper 
hearing,'' that is, the Commission will decide the issues in dispute 
based upon a review of the written record.
    (c) Effect of timely request. Subject to paragraph (l) of this 
section, if the debtor's written request is received by the Commission 
on or before the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice 
of the Commission's intent to seek garnishment, the Commission will not 
issue a withholding order until

[[Page 232]]

the debtor has been provided the requested hearing, and a decision in 
accordance with paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section has been 
rendered.
    (d) Failure to timely request a hearing. If the debtor's written 
request is received by the agency after the 15th business day following 
the mailing of the notice of the Commission's intent to seek 
garnishment, the Commission shall provide a hearing to the debtor. 
However, the Commission will not delay issuance of a withholding order 
unless the Commission determines that the delay in filing the request 
was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or the 
Commission receives information that the Commission believes justifies a 
delay or cancellation of the withholding order.
    (e) Hearing official. All hearings shall be presided over by the 
Commission, or if the Commission so orders, by a hearing official. When 
the Commission designates that the hearing official shall be an 
administrative law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall 
select, pursuant to 17 CFR 200.30-10, the administrative law judge to 
preside.
    (f) Procedure. After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing 
official shall notify the debtor of:
    (1) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;
    (2) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or
    (3) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written 
hearing.
    (g) Burden of proof. (1) The Commission will have the burden of 
going forward to prove the existence or amount of the debt.
    (2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of 
the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 
no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, 
the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule 
are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that 
collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
    (h) Record. The hearing official will maintain a record of any 
hearing provided under this section. A hearing is not required to be a 
formal evidentiary-type hearing, however, witnesses who testify in oral 
hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.
    (i) Date of decision. The hearing official shall issue a written 
opinion stating his or her decision, as soon as practicable, but not 
later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the request for such 
hearing was received by the Commission. If the Commission is unable to 
provide the debtor with a hearing and a decision is not rendered within 
sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request for such hearing:
    (1) A withholding order will not be issued until the hearing is held 
and a decision rendered; or
    (2) If a withholding order had previously been issued to the 
debtor's employer, the withholding order will be suspended beginning on 
the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing 
until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.
    (j) Content of decision. The written decision shall include:
    (1) A summary of the facts presented;
    (2) The findings, analysis and conclusions; and
    (3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
    (k) Finality of agency action. Unless the Commission on its own 
initiative orders review of a decision by a hearing official pursuant to 
17 CFR 201.431(c), a decision by a hearing official shall become the 
final decision of the Commission for the purpose of judicial review 
under the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (l) Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor 
who fails to appear at a scheduled hearing will be deemed as not having 
timely filed a request for a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 204.65  Wage garnishment order.

    (a) Unless the Commission receives information that the Commission 
believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the 
Commission will send, by first class mail, a withholding order to the 
debtor's employer within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely 
request for a hearing (i.e., within 15 business days after the mailing 
of the notice of the Commission's intent to seek garnishment) or, if a 
timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30

[[Page 233]]

days after a decision to issue a withholding order becomes final.
    (b) The withholding order sent to the employer will be in the form 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, on the Commission's 
letterhead, and signed by the Chairperson or his or her delegatee. The 
order will contain the information necessary for the employer to comply 
with the withholding order. This information includes the debtor's name, 
address, and social security number, as well as instructions for 
withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.
    (c) The Commission will keep a copy of the certificate of service 
indicating the date of mailing of the order.
    (d) Certification by employer. Along with the withholding order, the 
Commission will send to the employer a certification in a form 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete 
and return the certification to the Commission within the time frame 
prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will 
address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status 
and disposable pay available for withholding.
    (e) Amounts withheld. (1) After receipt of the garnishment order 
issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable 
pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of 
garnishment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of 
this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:
    (i) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the 
debtor's disposable pay; or
    (ii) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on 
Garnishment). The amount set forth at U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by 
which the debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty 
times the minimum wage See 29 CFR 870.10.
    (3) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with 
priority, the following shall apply:
    (i) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders 
issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section and shall have priority over other 
withholding orders which are served later in time. However, withholding 
orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders 
issued under this section.
    (ii) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a 
withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order 
issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family 
support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld 
pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the 
lesser of:
    (A) The amount calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or
    (B) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the 
amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.
    (iii) If a debtor owes more than one debt to the Commission, the 
Commission may issue multiple withholding orders. The total amount 
garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders will not exceed the 
amount set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (e)(2) and 
(e)(3) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the 
debtor.
    (5) The employer shall promptly pay to the Commission all amounts 
withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to 
this section.
    (6) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and 
disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.
    (7) Any assignment or allotment by the employee of the employee's 
earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits 
execution of the withholding order under this section, except for any 
assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or 
order.
    (8) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the 
debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives 
notification from the Commission to discontinue wage withholding. The 
garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time

[[Page 234]]

within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.
    (f) Exclusions from garnishment. The Commission will not garnish the 
wages of a debtor it knows has been involuntarily separated from 
employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at 
least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing the Commission 
of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from 
employment.
    (g) Financial hardship. (1) A debtor whose wages are subject to a 
wage withholding order under this section, may, at any time, request a 
review by the Commission of the amount garnished, based on materially 
changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic 
illness which result in financial hardship.
    (2) A debtor requesting a review under this section shall submit the 
basis for claiming that the current amount of garnishment results in a 
financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation.
    (3) If a financial hardship is found, the Commission will downwardly 
adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the 
Commission, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial 
condition. The Commission will notify the employer of any adjustments to 
the amounts to be withheld.
    (h) Ending garnishment. (2) Once the Commission has fully recovered 
the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs consistent with the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards (31 CFR 901.9), the Commission will send the debtor's employer 
notification to discontinue wage withholding.
    (2) At least annually, the Commission will review its debtors' 
accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts 
that have been paid in full.
    (i) Actions prohibited by the employer. The Debt Collection Act 
prohibits an employer from discharging, refusing to employ, or taking 
disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a 
withholding order under this section (31 U.S.C. 3720D(e)).
    (j) Refunds. (1) If a hearing official determines that a debt is not 
legally due and owing to the United States, the Commission shall 
promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage 
garnishment.
    (2) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this 
section shall not bear interest.
    (k) Right of action. The Commission may sue any employer for any 
amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable 
to an employee in accordance with this section. However, a suit will not 
be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a 
particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid 
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations. For purposes of 
this section, ``termination of the collection action'' occurs when the 
agency has terminated collection action in accordance with the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 903.1-903.5) or other applicable 
standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have 
been deemed to occur if the Commission has not received any payments to 
satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to 
garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.

the debt as overdue to consumer reporting agencies, and provide 
deadlines and method for requesting this relief;
    (4) An explanation of the rate of interest that will accrue on the 
debt, that all costs incurred to collect the debt will be charged to the

consumer reporting agencies to the detriment of the debtor's credit 
rating; and
    (6) A description of the collection actions that the agency may take 
in the future if those presently proposed actions do not result in 
repayment of the loan obligation, including the filing of a lawsuit 
against the borrower by the agency and assignment of the debt for 
collection by offset against Federal income tax refunds or the filing of 
a lawsuit against the debtor by the Federal Government.
    (b) The information that may be disclosed to the consumer reporting 
agency is limited to:
    (1) The debtor's name, address, social security number or taxpayer 
identification number, and any other information necessary to establish 
the identity of the individual;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and
    (3) The Commission program or activity under which the claim arose.

    (b) The Commission will use private collection agencies where it 
determines that their use is in the best interest of the Government. 
Where the Commission determines that there is a need to contract for 
collection services, the contract will provide that:

additional obligations on an attorney not inconsistent with the 
application of this part. Where the standards of a state or other United 
States jurisdiction where an attorney is admitted or practices conflict 
with this part, this part shall govern.

    (2) That the issuer has, as necessary, adopted appropriate remedial 
measures, including appropriate steps or sanctions to stop any material 
violations that are ongoing, to prevent any material violation that has 
yet to occur, and to remedy or otherwise appropriately address any 
material violation that has already occurred and to minimize the 
likelihood of its recurrence; or
    (3) That the issuer, with the consent of the issuer's board of

<R05>
Sec. 205.3  Issuer as client.

    (a) Representing an issuer. An attorney appearing and practicing 
before the Commission in the representation of an issuer owes his or her 
professional and ethical duties to the issuer as an organization. That 
the attorney may work with and advise the issuer's officers, directors, 
or employees in the course of representing the issuer does not make such 
individuals the attorney's clients.
    (b) Duty to report evidence of a material violation. (1) If an 
attorney, appearing and practicing before the Commission in the 
representation of an issuer, becomes aware of evidence of a material 
violation by the issuer or by any officer, director, employee, or agent 
of the issuer, the attorney shall report such evidence to the issuer's 
chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) or to both the issuer's 
chief legal officer and its chief executive officer (or the equivalents 
thereof) forthwith. By communicating such information to the issuer's 
officers or directors, an attorney does not reveal client confidences or 
secrets or privileged or otherwise protected information related to the 
attorney's representation of an issuer.
    (2) The chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) shall cause 
such inquiry into the evidence of a material violation as he or she 
reasonably believes is appropriate to determine whether the material 
violation described in the report has occurred, is ongoing, or is about 
to occur. If the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) 
determines no material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about 
to occur, he or she shall notify the reporting attorney and advise the 
reporting attorney of the basis for such determination. Unless the chief 
legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) reasonably believes that no 
material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur, he or 
she shall take all reasonable steps to cause the issuer to adopt an 
appropriate response, and

[[Page 239]]

shall advise the reporting attorney thereof. In lieu of causing an 
inquiry under this paragraph (b), a chief legal officer (or the 
equivalent thereof) may refer a report of evidence of a material 
violation to a qualified legal compliance committee under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section if the issuer has duly established a qualified 
legal compliance committee prior to the report of evidence of a material 
violation.
    (3) Unless an attorney who has made a report under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section reasonably believes that the chief legal officer or the 
chief executive officer of the issuer (or the equivalent thereof) has 
provided an appropriate response within a reasonable time, the attorney 
shall report the evidence of a material violation to:
    (i) The audit committee of the issuer's board of directors;
    (ii) Another committee of the issuer's board of directors consisting 
solely of directors who are not employed, directly or indirectly, by the 
issuer and are not, in the case of a registered investment company, 
``interested persons'' as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19)) (if the issuer's board of 
directors has no audit committee); or
    (iii) The issuer's board of directors (if the issuer's board of 
directors has no committee consisting solely of directors who are not 
employed, directly or indirectly, by the issuer and are not, in the case 
of a registered investment company, ``interested persons'' as defined in 
section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-
2(a)(19))).
    (4) If an attorney reasonably believes that it would be futile to 
report evidence of a material violation to the issuer's chief legal 
officer and chief executive officer (or the equivalents thereof) under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attorney may report such evidence 
as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (5) An attorney retained or directed by an issuer to investigate 
evidence of a material violation reported under paragraph (b)(1), 
(b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section shall be deemed to be appearing and 
practicing before the Commission. Directing or retaining an attorney to 
investigate reported evidence of a material violation does not relieve 
an officer or director of the issuer to whom such evidence has been 
reported under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section from 
a duty to respond to the reporting attorney.
    (6) An attorney shall not have any obligation to report evidence of 
a material violation under this paragraph (b) if:
    (i) The attorney was retained or directed by the issuer's chief 
legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) to investigate such evidence 
of a material violation and:
    (A) The attorney reports the results of such investigation to the 
chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof); and
    (B) Except where the attorney and the chief legal officer (or the 
equivalent thereof) each reasonably believes that no material violation 
has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur, the chief legal officer 
(or the equivalent thereof) reports the results of the investigation to 
the issuer's board of directors, a committee thereof to whom a report 
could be made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or a 
qualified legal compliance committee; or
    (ii) The attorney was retained or directed by the chief legal 
officer (or the equivalent thereof) to assert, consistent with his or 
her professional obligations, a colorable defense on behalf of the 
issuer (or the issuer's officer, director, employee, or agent, as the 
case may be) in any investigation or judicial or administrative 
proceeding relating to such evidence of a material violation, and the 
chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) provides reasonable and 
timely reports on the progress and outcome of such proceeding to the 
issuer's board of directors, a committee thereof to whom a report could 
be made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or a qualified 
legal compliance committee.
    (7) An attorney shall not have any obligation to report evidence of 
a material violation under this paragraph (b) if such attorney was 
retained or directed by a qualified legal compliance committee:
    (i) To investigate such evidence of a material violation; or

[[Page 240]]

    (ii) To assert, consistent with his or her professional obligations, 
a colorable defense on behalf of the issuer (or the issuer's officer, 
director, employee, or agent, as the case may be) in any investigation 
or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to such evidence of a 
material violation.
    (8) An attorney who receives what he or she reasonably believes is 
an appropriate and timely response to a report he or she has made 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section need do 
nothing more under this section with respect to his or her report.
    (9) An attorney who does not reasonably believe that the issuer has 
made an appropriate response within a reasonable time to the report or 
reports made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this 
section shall explain his or her reasons therefor to the chief legal 
officer (or the equivalent thereof), the chief executive officer (or the 
equivalent thereof), and directors to whom the attorney reported the 
evidence of a material violation pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), 
or (b)(4) of this section.
    (10) An attorney formerly employed or retained by an issuer who has 
reported evidence of a material violation under this part and reasonably 
believes that he or she has been discharged for so doing may notify the 
issuer's board of directors or any committee thereof that he or she 
believes that he or she has been discharged for reporting evidence of a 
material violation under this section.
    (c) Alternative reporting procedures for attorneys retained or 
employed by an issuer that has established a qualified legal compliance 
committee. (1) If an attorney, appearing and practicing before the 
Commission in the representation of an issuer, becomes aware of evidence 
of a material violation by the issuer or by any officer, director, 
employee, or agent of the issuer, the attorney may, as an alternative to 
the reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, report such 
evidence to a qualified legal compliance committee, if the issuer has 
previously formed such a committee. An attorney who reports evidence of 
a material violation to such a qualified legal compliance committee has 
satisfied his or her obligation to report such evidence and is not 
required to assess the issuer's response to the reported evidence of a 
material violation.
    (2) A chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) may refer a 
report of evidence of a material violation to a previously established 
qualified legal compliance committee in lieu of causing an inquiry to be 
conducted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The chief legal 
officer (or the equivalent thereof) shall inform the reporting attorney 
that the report has been referred to a qualified legal compliance 
committee. Thereafter, pursuant to the requirements under Sec. 
205.2(k), the qualified legal compliance committee shall be responsible 
for responding to the evidence of a material violation reported to it 
under this paragraph (c).
    (d) Issuer confidences. (1) Any report under this section (or the 
contemporaneous record thereof) or any response thereto (or the 
contemporaneous record thereof) may be used by an attorney in connection 
with any investigation, proceeding, or litigation in which the 
attorney's compliance with this part is in issue.
    (2) An attorney appearing and practicing before the Commission in 
the representation of an issuer may reveal to the Commission, without 
the issuer's consent, confidential information related to the 
representation to the extent the attorney reasonably believes necessary:
    (i) To prevent the issuer from committing a material violation that 
is likely to cause substantial injury to the financial interest or 
property of the issuer or investors;
    (ii) To prevent the issuer, in a Commission investigation or 
administrative proceeding from committing perjury, proscribed in 18 
U.S.C. 1621; suborning perjury, proscribed in 18 U.S.C. 1622; or 
committing any act proscribed in 18 U.S.C. 1001 that is likely to 
perpetrate a fraud upon the Commission; or
    (iii) To rectify the consequences of a material violation by the 
issuer that caused, or may cause, substantial injury to the financial 
interest or property of the issuer or investors in the

[[Page 241]]

furtherance of which the attorney's services were used.


<R05>
Sec. 205.4  Responsibilities of supervisory attorneys.

    (a) An attorney supervising or directing another attorney who is 
appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of 
an issuer is a supervisory attorney. An issuer's chief legal officer (or 
the equivalent thereof) is a supervisory attorney under this section.
    (b) A supervisory attorney shall make reasonable efforts to ensure 
that a subordinate attorney, as defined in Sec. 205.5(a), that he or 
she supervises or directs conforms to this part. To the extent a 
subordinate attorney appears and practices before the Commission in the 
representation of an issuer, that subordinate attorney's supervisory 
attorneys also appear and practice before the Commission.
    (c) A supervisory attorney is responsible for complying with the 
reporting requirements in Sec. 205.3 when a subordinate attorney has 
reported to the supervisory attorney evidence of a material violation.
    (d) A supervisory attorney who has received a report of evidence of 
a material violation from a subordinate attorney under Sec. 205.3 may 
report such evidence to the issuer's qualified legal compliance 
committee if the issuer has duly formed such a committee.


<R05>
Sec. 205.5  Responsibilities of a subordinate attorney.

    (a) An attorney who appears and practices before the Commission in 
the representation of an issuer on a matter under the supervision or 
direction of another attorney (other than under the direct supervision 
or direction of the issuer's chief legal officer (or the equivalent 
thereof)) is a subordinate attorney.
    (b) A subordinate attorney shall comply with this part 
notwithstanding that the subordinate attorney acted at the direction of 
or under the supervision of another person.
    (c) A subordinate attorney complies with Sec. 205.3 if the 
subordinate attorney reports to his or her supervising attorney under 
Sec. 205.3(b) evidence of a material violation of which the subordinate 
attorney has become aware in appearing and practicing before the 
Commission.
    (d) A subordinate attorney may take the steps permitted or required 
by Sec. 205.3(b) or (c) if the subordinate attorney reasonably believes 
that a supervisory attorney to whom he or she has reported evidence of a 
material violation under Sec. 205.3(b) has failed to comply with Sec. 
205.3.


<R05>
Sec. 205.6  Sanctions and discipline.

    (a) A violation of this part by any attorney appearing and 
practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer 
shall subject such attorney to the civil penalties and remedies for a 
violation of the federal securities laws available to the Commission in 
an action brought by the Commission thereunder.
    (b) An attorney appearing and practicing before the Commission who 
violates any provision of this part is subject to the disciplinary 
authority of the Commission, regardless of whether the attorney may also 
be subject to discipline for the same conduct in a jurisdiction where 
the attorney is admitted or practices. An administrative disciplinary 
proceeding initiated by the Commission for violation of this part may 
result in an attorney being censured, or being temporarily or 
permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission.
    (c) An attorney who complies in good faith with the provisions of 
this part shall not be subject to discipline or otherwise liable under 
inconsistent standards imposed by any state or other United States 
jurisdiction where the attorney is admitted or practices.
    (d) An attorney practicing outside the United States shall not be 
required to comply with the requirements of this part to the extent that 
such compliance is prohibited by applicable foreign law.


<R05>
Sec. 205.7  No private right of action.

    (a) Nothing in this part is intended to, or does, create a private 
right of action against any attorney, law firm, or issuer based upon 
compliance or noncompliance with its provisions.

[[Page 242]]

    (b) Authority to enforce compliance with this part is vested 
exclusively in the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 209.1  Form D-A: Disclosure of assets and financial information.

    (a) Rules 410 and 630 of the Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.410 and 
201.630) provide that under certain circumstances a respondent who 
asserts or intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement, interest 
or penalties may be required to disclose certain financial information. 
Unless otherwise ordered, this form may be used by individuals required 
to supply such information.
    (b) The respondent filing Form D-A is required promptly to notify 
the Commission of any material change in the answer to any question on 
this form.
    (c) Form D-A may not be withheld from the interested division. A 
respondent making financial information disclosures on this form after 
the institution of proceedings may make a motion, pursuant to Rule 322 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.322), for the issuance 
of a protective order to limit disclosure to the public or parties other 
than the interested division of the information submitted on Form D-A. A 
request for a protective order allows the requester an opportunity to 
justify the need for confidentiality. The making of a motion for a 
protective order, however, does not guarantee that disclosure will be 
limited.
    (d) No party receiving information for which a motion for a 
protective order has been made may transfer or convey the information to 
any other person prior to a ruling on the motion without the prior 
permission of the Commission or a hearing officer.
    (e) A person making financial information disclosures on Form D-A 
prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with an offer of 
settlement or otherwise, may request confidential treatment of the 
information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. See the 
Commission's Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') regulations, 17 CFR 
200.83. A request for confidential treatment allows the requester an 
opportunity to substantiate the need for confidentiality. No 
determination as to the validity of any request for confidential 
treatment will be made until a request for disclosure of the information 
under FOIA is received.

Sec. 210.1-01  Application of Regulation S-X (17 CFR part 210).

<R05>
Sec. 210.1-02  Definitions of terms used in Regulation S-X (17 CFR part 210).

    Unless the context otherwise requires, terms defined in the general 
rules and regulations or in the instructions to the applicable form, 
when used in Regulation S-X (this part 210), shall have the respective 
meanings given in such instructions or rules. In addition, the following 
terms shall have the meanings indicated in this section unless the 
context otherwise requires.
    (a)(1) Accountant's report. The term accountant's report, when used 
in regard to financial statements, means a document in which an 
independent public or certified public accountant indicates the scope of 
the audit (or examination) which he has made and sets forth his opinion 
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole, or an assertion to 
the effect that an overall opinion cannot be expressed. When an overall 
opinion cannot be expressed, the reasons therefor shall be stated.
    (2) Attestation report on internal control over financial reporting. 
The term attestation report on internal control over financial reporting 
means a report in which a registered public accounting firm expresses an 
opinion, either unqualified or adverse, as to whether the registrant 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over 
financial reporting (as defined in Sec. 240.13a-15(f) or 240.15d-15(f) 
of this chapter), except in the rare circumstance of a scope limitation 
that cannot be overcome by the registrant or the registered public 
accounting firm which would result in the accounting firm disclaiming an 
opinion.
    (3) Attestation report on assessment of compliance with servicing 
criteria for asset-backed securities. The term attestation report on 
assessment of compliance with servicing criteria for asset-backed 
securities means a report in which a registered public accounting firm, 
as required by Sec. 240.13a-18(c) or 240.15d-18(c) of this chapter,

years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.

election of directors and/or the sum of all interests in an 
unincorporated person.

                Qualifications and Reports of Accountants

July 21, 1972, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 210.2-01  Qualifications of accountants.

                   Preliminary Note to Sec. 210.2-01

    1. Section 210.2-01 is designed to ensure that auditors are 
qualified and independent of their audit clients both in fact and in 
appearance. Accordingly, the rule sets forth restrictions on financial, 
employment, and business relationships between an accountant and an 
audit client and restrictions on an accountant providing certain non-
audit services to an audit client.
    2. Section 210.2-01(b) sets forth the general standard of auditor 
independence. Paragraphs (c)(1) to (c)(5) reflect the application

[[Page 249]]

of the general standard to particular circumstances. The rule does not 
purport to, and the Commission could not, consider all circumstances 
that raise independence concerns, and these are subject to the general 
standard in Sec. 210.2-01(b). In considering this standard, the 
Commission looks in the first instance to whether a relationship or the 
provision of a service: creates a mutual or conflicting interest between 
the accountant and the audit client; places the accountant in the 
position of auditing his or her own work; results in the accountant 
acting as management or an employee of the audit client; or places the 
accountant in a position of being an advocate for the audit client.
    3. These factors are general guidance only and their application may 
depend on particular facts and circumstances. For that reason, Sec. 
210.2-01 provides that, in determining whether an accountant is 
independent, the Commission will consider all relevant facts and 
circumstances. For the same reason, registrants and accountants are 
encouraged to consult with the Commission's Office of the Chief 
Accountant before entering into relationships, including relationships 
involving the provision of services, that are not explicitly described 
in the rule.

    (a) The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified 
public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as 
such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office. 
The Commission will not recognize any person as a public accountant who 
is not in good standing and entitled to practice as such under the laws 
of the place of his residence or principal office.
    (b) The Commission will not recognize an accountant as independent, 
with respect to an audit client, if the accountant is not, or a 
reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and 
circumstances would conclude that the accountant is not, capable of 
exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed 
within the accountant's engagement. In determining whether an accountant 
is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant circumstances, 
including all relationships between the accountant and the audit client, 
and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission.
    (c) This paragraph sets forth a non-exclusive specification of 
circumstances inconsistent with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) Financial relationships. An accountant is not independent if, at 
any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
accountant has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in the accountant's audit client, such as:
    (i) Investments in audit clients. An accountant is not independent 
when:
    (A) The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or any of 
his or her immediate family members, has any direct investment in an 
audit client, such as stocks, bonds, notes, options, or other 
securities. The term direct investment includes an investment in an 
audit client through an intermediary if:
    (1) The accounting firm, covered person, or immediate family member, 
alone or together with other persons, supervises or participates in the 
intermediary's investment decisions or has control over the 
intermediary; or
    (2) The intermediary is not a diversified management investment 
company, as defined by section 5(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 
1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1), and has an investment in the audit client 
that amounts to 20% or more of the value of the intermediary's total 
investments.
    (B) Any partner, principal, shareholder, or professional employee of 
the accounting firm, any of his or her immediate family members, any 
close family member of a covered person in the firm, or any group of the 
above persons has filed a Schedule 13D or 13G (17 CFR 240.13d-101 or 
240.13d-102) with the Commission indicating beneficial ownership of more 
than five percent of an audit client's equity securities or controls an 
audit client, or a close family member of a partner, principal, or 
shareholder of the accounting firm controls an audit client.
    (C) The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or any of 
his or her immediate family members, serves as voting trustee of a 
trust, or executor of an estate, containing the securities of an audit 
client, unless the accounting firm, covered person in the firm, or 
immediate family member has no authority to make investment decisions 
for the trust or estate.
    (D) The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, any of his 
or her

[[Page 250]]

immediate family members, or any group of the above persons has any 
material indirect investment in an audit client. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term material indirect investment does not include 
ownership by any covered person in the firm, any of his or her immediate 
family members, or any group of the above persons of 5% or less of the 
outstanding shares of a diversified management investment company, as 
defined by section 5(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 
U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1), that invests in an audit client.
    (E) The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or any of 
his or her immediate family members:
    (1) Has any direct or material indirect investment in an entity 
where:
    (i) An audit client has an investment in that entity that is 
material to the audit client and has the ability to exercise significant 
influence over that entity; or
    (ii) The entity has an investment in an audit client that is 
material to that entity and has the ability to exercise significant 
influence over that audit client;
    (2) Has any material investment in an entity over which an audit 
client has the ability to exercise significant influence; or
    (3) Has the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity 
that has the ability to exercise significant influence over an audit 
client.
    (ii) Other financial interests in audit client. An accountant is not 
independent when the accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or 
any of his or her immediate family members has:
    (A) Loans/debtor-creditor relationship. Any loan (including any 
margin loan) to or from an audit client, or an audit client's officers, 
directors, or record or beneficial owners of more than ten percent of 
the audit client's equity securities, except for the following loans 
obtained from a financial institution under its normal lending 
procedures, terms, and requirements:
    (1) Automobile loans and leases collateralized by the automobile;
    (2) Loans fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of an 
insurance policy;
    (3) Loans fully collateralized by cash deposits at the same 
financial institution; and
    (4) A mortgage loan collateralized by the borrower's primary 
residence provided the loan was not obtained while the covered person in 
the firm was a covered person.
    (B) Savings and checking accounts. Any savings, checking, or similar 
account at a bank, savings and loan, or similar institution that is an 
audit client, if the account has a balance that exceeds the amount 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any similar 
insurer, except that an accounting firm account may have an uninsured 
balance provided that the likelihood of the bank, savings and loan, or 
similar institution experiencing financial difficulties is remote.
    (C) Broker-dealer accounts. Brokerage or similar accounts maintained 
with a broker-dealer that is an audit client, if:
    (1) Any such account includes any asset other than cash or 
securities (within the meaning of ``security'' provided in the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (``SIPA'') (15 U.S.C. 78aaa 
et seq.));
    (2) The value of assets in the accounts exceeds the amount that is 
subject to a Securities Investor Protection Corporation advance, for 
those accounts, under Section 9 of SIPA (15 U.S.C. 78fff-3); or
    (3) With respect to non-U.S. accounts not subject to SIPA 
protection, the value of assets in the accounts exceeds the amount 
insured or protected by a program similar to SIPA.
    (D) Futures commission merchant accounts. Any futures, commodity, or 
similar account maintained with a futures commission merchant that is an 
audit client.
    (E) Credit cards. Any aggregate outstanding credit card balance owed 
to a lender that is an audit client that is not reduced to $10,000 or 
less on a current basis taking into consideration the payment due date 
and any available grace period.
    (F) Insurance products. Any individual policy issued by an insurer 
that is an audit client unless:
    (1) The policy was obtained at a time when the covered person in the

    (2) The likelihood of the insurer becoming insolvent is remote.
    (G) Investment companies. Any financial interest in an entity that 
is part of an investment company complex that includes an audit client.
    (iii) Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, an accountant will not be deemed not 
independent if:
    (A) Inheritance and gift. Any person acquires an unsolicited 
financial interest, such as through an unsolicited gift or inheritance, 
that would cause an accountant to be not independent under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and the financial interest is 
disposed of as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after the 
person has knowledge of and the right to dispose of the financial 
interest.
    (B) New audit engagement. Any person has a financial interest that 
would cause an accountant to be not independent under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and:
    (1) The accountant did not audit the client's financial statements 
for the immediately preceding fiscal year; and
    (2) The accountant is independent under paragraph (c)(1)(i) and 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section before the earlier of:
    (i) Signing an initial engagement letter or other agreement to 
provide audit, review, or attest services to the audit client; or
    (ii) Commencing any audit, review, or attest procedures (including 
planning the audit of the client's financial statements).
    (C) Employee compensation and benefit plans. An immediate family 
member of a person who is a covered person in the firm only by virtue of 
paragraphs (f)(11)(iii) or (f)(11)(iv) of this section has a financial 
interest that would cause an accountant to be not independent under 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and the acquisition 
of the financial interest was an unavoidable consequence of 
participation in his or her employer's employee compensation or benefits 
program, provided that the financial interest, other than unexercised 
employee stock options, is disposed of as soon as practicable, but no 
later than 30 days after the person has the right to dispose of the 
financial interest.
    (iv) Audit clients' financial relationships. An accountant is not 
independent when:

client has, or has agreed to acquire, any direct investment in the

securities, or the audit client's officers or directors are record or 
beneficial owners of more than 5% of the equity securities of the 
accounting firm.
    (B) Underwriting. An accounting firm engages an audit client to act 
as an underwriter, broker-dealer, market-maker, promoter, or analyst 
with respect to securities issued by the accounting firm.
    (2) Employment relationships. An accountant is not independent if, 
at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the 
accountant has an employment relationship with an audit client, such as:
    (i) Employment at audit client of accountant. A current partner, 
principal, shareholder, or professional employee of the accounting firm 
is employed by the audit client or serves as a member of the board of 
directors or similar management or governing body of the audit client.
    (ii) Employment at audit client of certain relatives of accountant. 
A close family member of a covered person in the firm is in an 
accounting role or financial reporting oversight role at an audit 
client, or was in such a role during any period covered by an audit for 
which the covered person in the firm is a covered person.
    (iii) Employment at audit client of former employee of accounting 
firm. (A) A former partner, principal, shareholder, or professional

when:
    (A) Any audit partner as defined in paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this 
section performs:
    (1) The services of a lead partner, as defined in paragraph 
(f)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, or concurring partner, as defined in

this section, or concurring partner, as defined in paragraph 
(f)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, or a combination of those services, or
    (2) Within the two consecutive year period following the performance 
of services for the maximum period permitted under paragraph 
(c)(6)(i)(A)(2) of this section, performs one or more of the services 
defined in paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Any accounting firm with less than five audit clients that are 
issuers (as defined in section 10A(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j-1(f))) and less than ten partners shall be exempt 
from paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section provided the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board conducts a review at least once every three 
years of each of the audit client engagements that would result in a 
lack of auditor independence under this paragraph.
    (iii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, an audit 
client that is an investment company registered under section 8 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-8), does not include an 
affiliate of the audit client that is an entity in the same investment 
company complex, as defined in paragraph (f)(14) of this section, except 
for another registered investment company in the same investment company 
complex. For purposes of calculating consecutive years of service under 
paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section with respect to investment companies 
in an investment company complex, audits of registered investment 
companies with different fiscal year-ends that are performed in a 
continuous 12-month period count as a single consecutive year.
    (7) Audit committee administration of the engagement. An accountant 
is not independent of an issuer (as defined in section 10A(f) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j-1(f))), other than an 
issuer that is an Asset-Backed Issuer as defined in Sec. 229.1101 of 
this chapter, or an investment company registered under section 8 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-8), other than a unit 
investment trust as defined by section 4(2) of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-4(2)), unless:
    (i) In accordance with Section 10A(i) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j-1(i)) either:
    (A) Before the accountant is engaged by the issuer or its 
subsidiaries, or the registered investment company or its subsidiaries, 
to render audit or non-audit services, the engagement is approved by the 
issuer's or registered investment company's audit committee; or
    (B) The engagement to render the service is entered into pursuant to 
pre-approval policies and procedures established by the audit committee 
of the issuer or registered investment company, provided the policies 
and procedures are detailed as to the particular service and the audit 
committee is informed of each service and such policies and procedures 
do not include delegation of the audit committees responsibilities under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to management; or
    (C) With respect to the provision of services other than audit, 
review or attest services the pre-approval requirement is waived if:
    (1) The aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes 
no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues paid by the 
audit client to its accountant during the fiscal year in which the 
services are provided;
    (2) Such services were not recognized by the issuer or registered 
investment company at the time of the engagement to be non-audit 
services; and
    (3) Such services are promptly brought to the attention of the audit 
committee of the issuer or registered investment company and approved 
prior to the completion of the audit by the audit committee or by one or 
more members of the audit committee who are members of the board of 
directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated 
by the audit committee.
    (ii) A registered investment company's audit committee also must 
pre-approve its accountant's engagements

[[Page 256]]

for non-audit services with the registered investment company's 
investment adviser (not including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily 
portfolio management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another 
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under 
common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing 
services to the registered investment company in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, if the engagement relates directly 
to the operations and financial reporting of the registered investment 
company, except that with respect to the waiver of the pre-approval 
requirement under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of this section, the aggregate 
amount of all services provided constitutes no more than five percent of 
the total amount of revenues paid to the registered investment company's 
accountant by the registered investment company, its investment adviser 
and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with 
the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registered 
investment company during the fiscal year in which the services are 
provided that would have to be pre-approved by the registered investment 
company's audit committee pursuant to this section.
    (8) Compensation. An accountant is not independent of an audit 
client if, at any point during the audit and professional engagement 
period, any audit partner earns or receives compensation based on the 
audit partner procuring engagements with that audit client to provide 
any products or services other than audit, review or attest services. 
Any accounting firm with fewer than ten partners and fewer than five 
audit clients that are issuers (as defined in section 10A(f) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j-1(f))) shall be exempt 
from the requirement stated in the previous sentence.
    (d) Quality controls. An accounting firm's independence will not be 
impaired solely because a covered person in the firm is not independent 
of an audit client provided:
    (1) The covered person did not know of the circumstances giving rise 
to the lack of independence;
    (2) The covered person's lack of independence was corrected as 
promptly as possible under the relevant circumstances after the covered 
person or accounting firm became aware of it; and
    (3) The accounting firm has a quality control system in place that 
provides reasonable assurance, taking into account the size and nature 
of the accounting firm's practice, that the accounting firm and its 
employees do not lack independence, and that covers at least all 
employees and associated entities of the accounting firm participating 
in the engagement, including employees and associated entities located 
outside of the United States.
    (4) For an accounting firm that annually provides audit, review, or 
attest services to more than 500 companies with a class of securities 
registered with the Commission under section 12 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l), a quality control system will not 
provide such reasonable assurance unless it has at least the following 
features:
    (i) Written independence policies and procedures;
    (ii) With respect to partners and managerial employees, an automated 
system to identify their investments in securities that might impair the 
accountant's independence;
    (iii) With respect to all professionals, a system that provides 
timely information about entities from which the accountant is required 
to maintain independence;
    (iv) An annual or on-going firm-wide training program about auditor 
independence;
    (v) An annual internal inspection and testing program to monitor 
adherence to independence requirements;
    (vi) Notification to all accounting firm members, officers, 
directors, and employees of the name and title of the member of senior 
management responsible for compliance with auditor independence 
requirements;
    (vii) Written policies and procedures requiring all partners and 
covered persons to report promptly to the accounting firm when they are 
engaged in employment negotiations with an audit client, and requiring 
the firm to

[[Page 257]]

remove immediately any such professional from that audit client's 
engagement and to review promptly all work the professional performed 
related to that audit client's engagement; and
    (viii) A disciplinary mechanism to ensure compliance with this 
section.
    (e)(1) Transition and grandfathering. Provided the following 
relationships did not impair the accountant's independence under pre-
existing requirements of the Commission, the Independence Standards, 
Board, or the accounting profession in the United States, the existence 
of the relationship on May 6, 2003 will not be deemed to impair an 
accountant's independence:
    (i) Employment relationships that commenced at the issuer prior to 
May 6, 2003 as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (ii) Compensation earned or received, as described in paragraph 
(c)(8) of this section during the fiscal year of the accounting firm 
that includes the effective date of this section.

paragraph (c)(4) of this section provided those services are pursuant to

May 6, 2003 by a ``lead'' partner and other audit partner (other than 
the ``concurring'' partner) providing services in excess of those 
permitted under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. An accountant's 
independence will not be deemed to be impaired until the first day of 
the issuer's fiscal year beginning after May 6, 2004 by a ``concurring'' 
partner providing services in excess of those permitted under paragraph 
(c)(6) of this section. For the purposes of calculating periods of 
service under paragraph (c)(6) of this section:
    (A) For the ``lead'' and ``concurring'' partner, the period of 
service includes time served as the ``lead'' or ``concurring'' partner 
prior to May 6, 2003; and
    (B) For audit partners other than the ``lead'' partner or 
``concurring'' partner, and for audit partners in foreign firms, the 
period of service does not include time served on the audit engagement 
team prior to the first day of issuer's fiscal year beginning on or 
after May 6, 2003.

to which Arthur Andersen LLP or a foreign affiliate of Arthur Andersen 
LLP (``Andersen'') issued an accountants' report. Notwithstanding any 
other Commission rule or regulation, a registrant that cannot obtain an 
accountants' report that meets the technical requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section after reasonable efforts may include in the document 
a copy of the latest signed and dated accountants' report issued by 
Andersen for such period in satisfaction of that requirement, if 
prominent disclosure that the report is a copy of the previously issued 
Andersen accountants' report and that the report has not been reissued 
by Andersen is set forth on such copy.
    (f) Attestation report on internal control over financial reporting. 
Every registered public accounting firm that issues or prepares an 
accountant's report for a registrant, other than an investment company 
registered under section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 
U.S.C. 80a-8), that is included in an annual report required by section 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et 
seq.) containing an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the 
registrant's internal control over financial reporting must clearly 
state the opinion of the accountant, either unqualified or adverse, as 
to whether the registrant maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over

[[Page 261]]

financial reporting, except in the rare circumstance of a scope 
limitation that cannot be overcome by the registrant or the registered 
public accounting firm which would result in the accounting firm 
disclaiming an opinion. The attestation report on internal control over 
financial reporting shall be dated, signed manually, identify the period 
covered by the report and indicate that the accountant has audited the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The 
attestation report on internal control over financial reporting may be 
separate from the accountant's report.
    (g) Attestation report on assessment of compliance with servicing 
criteria for asset-backed securities. The attestation report on 
assessment of compliance with servicing criteria for asset-backed 
securities, as required by Sec. 240.13a-18(c) or 240.15d-18(c) of this 
chapter, shall be dated, signed manually, identify the period covered by 
the report and clearly state the opinion of the registered public 
accounting firm as to whether the asserting party's assessment of 
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated in all material 
respects, or must include an opinion to the effect that an overall 
opinion cannot be expressed. If an overall opinion cannot be expressed, 
explain why.

Sec. 210.3-05  Financial statements of businesses acquired or to be acquired.

    (a) Financial statements required. (1) Financial statements prepared 
and audited in accordance with this regulation should be furnished for 
the periods specified in paragraph (b) below if any of the following 
conditions exist:
    (i) Consummation of a business combination accounted for as a 
purchase has occurred or is probable (for purposes of this rule, the 
term purchase encompasses the purchase of an interest in a business 
accounted for by the equity method); or
    (ii) Consummation of a business combination to be accounted for as a 
pooling of interests is probable.
    (2) For purposes of determining whether the provisions of this rule 
apply, the determination of whether a business has been acquired should 
be made in accordance with the guidance set forth in Sec. 210.11-01(d).
    (3) Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable 
or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end for which 
audited financial statements of the registrant have been filed shall be 
treated under this section as if they are a single business combination. 
The required financial statements of related businesses may be presented 
on a combined basis for any periods they are under common control or 
management. For purposes of this section, businesses shall be deemed to 
be related if:
    (i) They are under common control or management;

[[Page 266]]

    (ii) The acquisition of one business is conditional on the 
acquisition of each other business; or
    (iii) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.
    (4) This rule shall not apply to a business which is totally held by 
the registrant prior to consummation of the transaction.
    (b) Periods to be presented. (1) If securities are being registered 
to be offered to the security holders of the business to be acquired, 
the financial statements specified in Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 
shall be furnished for the business to be acquired, except as provided 
otherwise for filings on Form N-14, S-4 or F-4 (Sec. Sec. 239.23, 
239.25 or 239.34 of this chapter). The financial statements covering 
fiscal years shall be audited except as provided in Item 14 of Schedule 
14A (Sec. 240.14a-101 of this chapter) with respect to certain proxy 
statements or in registration statements filed on Forms N-14, S-4 or F-4 
(Sec. Sec. 239.23, 239.25 or 239.34 of this chapter).
    (2) In all cases not specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
financial statements of the business acquired or to be acquired shall be 
filed for the periods specified in this paragraph (b)(2) or such shorter 
period as the business has been in existence. The periods for which such 
financial statements are to be filed shall be determined using the 
conditions specified in the definition of significant subsidiary in 
Sec. 210.1-02(w) as follows:
    (i) If none of the conditions exceeds 20 percent, financial 
statements are not required. However, if the aggregate impact of the 
individually insignificant businesses acquired since the date of the 
most recent audited balance sheet filed for the registrant exceeds 50%, 
financial statements covering at least the substantial majority of the 
businesses acquired shall be furnished. Such financial statements shall 
be for at least the most recent fiscal year and any interim periods 
specified in Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02.
    (ii) If any of the conditions exceeds 20 percent, but none exceed 40 
percent, financial statements shall be furnished for at least the most 
recent fiscal year and any interim periods specified in Sec. Sec. 
210.3-01 and 210.3-02.
    (iii) If any of the conditions exceeds 40 percent, but none exceed 
50 percent, financial statements shall be furnished for at least the two 
most recent fiscal years and any interim periods specified in Sec. Sec. 
210.3-01 and 210.3-02.
    (iv) If any of the conditions exceed 50 percent, the full financial 
statements specified in Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 shall be 
furnished. However, financial statements for the earliest of the three 
fiscal years required may be omitted if net revenues reported by the 
acquired business in its most recent fiscal year are less than $50 
million.
    (3) The determination shall be made by comparing the most recent 
annual financial statements of each such business, or group of related 
businesses on a combined basis, to the registrant's most recent annual 
consolidated financial statements filed at or prior to the date of 
acquisition. However, if the registrant made a significant acquisition 
subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end and filed a report on Form 8-K 
(Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) which included audited financial 
statements of such acquired business for the periods required by this 
section and the pro forma financial information required by Sec. 
210.11, such determination may be made by using pro forma amounts for 
the latest fiscal year in the report on Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this 
chapter) rather than by using the historical amounts of the registrant. 
The tests may not be made by ``annualizing'' data.
    (4) Financial statements required for the periods specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be omitted to the extent specified 
as follows:
    (i) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of Sec. 
230.419 of this chapter (Regulation C) and proxy statements need not 
include separate financial statements of the acquired or to be acquired 
business if it does not exceed any of the conditions of significance in 
the definition of significant subsidiary in Sec. 210.1-02 at the 50 
percent level, and either:
    (A) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or
    (B) The date of the final prospectus or prospectus supplement 
relating to an offering as filed with the Commission pursuant to Sec. 
230.424(b) of this chapter, or mailing date in the case of

[[Page 267]]

a proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after consummation of the 
business combination, and the financial statements have not previously 
been filed by the registrant.
    (ii) An issuer, other than a foreign private issuer required to file 
reports on Form 6-K, that omits from its initial registration statement 
financial statements of a recently consummated business combination 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section shall furnish those 
financial statements and any pro forma information specified by Article 
11 of this chapter under cover of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this 
chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.
    (iii) Separate financial statements of the acquired business need 
not be presented once the operating results of the acquired business 
have been reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of 
the registrant for a complete fiscal year unless such financial 
statements have not been previously filed or unless the acquired 
business is of such significance to the registrant that omission of such 
financial statements would materially impair an investor's ability to 
understand the historical financial results of the registrant. For 
example, if, at the date of acquisition, the acquired business met at 
least one of the conditions in the definition of significant subsidiary 
in Sec. 210.1-02 at the 80 percent level, the income statements of the 
acquired business should normally continue to be furnished for such 
periods prior to the purchase as may be necessary when added to the time 
for which audited income statements after the purchase are filed to 
cover the equivalent of the period specified in Sec. 210.3-02.
    (iv) A separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is 
not required when the registrant's most recent audited balance sheet 
required by Sec. 210.3-01 is for a date after the date the acquisition 
was consummated.
    (c) Financial statements of foreign business. If the business 
acquired or to be acquired is a foreign business, financial statements 
of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 
249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy this section.

Sec. 210.3-06  Financial statements covering a period of nine to twelve months.

    Except with respect to registered investment companies, the filing 
of financial statements covering a period of 9 to 12 months shall be 
deemed to satisfy a requirement for filing financial statements for a 
period of 1 year where:
    (a) The issuer has changed its fiscal year;
    (b) The issuer has made a significant business acquisition for which 
financial statements are required under Sec. 210.3-05 of this chapter 
and the financial statements covering the interim period pertain to the 
business being acquired; or
    (c) The Commission so permits pursuant to Sec. 210.3-13 of this 
chapter.
    Where there is a requirement for filing financial statements for a 
time period exceeding one year but not exceeding three consecutive years 
(with not more than 12 months included in any period reported upon), the 
filing of financial statements covering a period of nine to 12 months 
shall satisfy a filing requirement of financial statements for one year 
of that time period only if the conditions described in either paragraph 
(a), (b), or (c) of this section exist and financial statements are 
filed that cover the full fiscal year or years for all other years in 
the time period.

Sec. Sec. 210.3-07--210.3-08  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 210.3-09  Separate financial statements of subsidiaries not consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons.

    (a) If any of the conditions set forth in Sec. 210.1-02(w), 
substituting 20 percent for 10 percent in the tests used therein to 
determine a significant subsidiary, are met for a majority-owned 
subsidiary not consolidated by the registrant or by a subsidiary of the 
registrant, separate financial statements of such subsidiary shall be 
filed. Similarly, if either the first or third condition set forth in 
Sec. 210.1-02(w), substituting 20 percent for 10 percent, is met by a 
50 percent or less owned person accounted for by the equity method 
either by the registrant or a subsidiary of the registrant, separate 
financial statements of such 50 percent or less owned person shall be 
filed.
    (b) Insofar as practicable, the separate financial statements 
required by this section shall be as of the same dates and for the same 
periods as the audited consolidated financial statements required by 
Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02. However, these separate financial 
statements are required to be audited only for those fiscal years in 
which either the first or third condition set forth in Sec. 210.1-
02(w), substituting 20 percent for 10 percent, is met. For purposes of a 
filing on Form 10-K (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter):
    (1) If the registrant is an accelerated filer (as defined in Sec. 
240.12b-2 of this chapter) but the 50 percent or less owned person is 
not an accelerated filer, the required financial statements may be filed 
as an amendment to the report within 90 days, or within six months if 
the 50 percent or less owned person is a foreign business, after the end 
of the registrant's fiscal year.
    (2) If the fiscal year of any 50 percent or less owned person ends 
within the registrant's number of filing days before the date of the 
filing, or if the fiscal year ends after the date of the filing, the 
required financial statements may be filed as an amendment to the report 
within the subsidiary's number of filing days, or within six months if 
the 50 percent or less owned person is a foreign business, after the end 
of such subsidiary's or person's fiscal year.
    (3) The term registrant's number of filing days means:
    (i) 60 days (75 days for fiscal years ending before December 15, 
2006) if the registrant is a large accelerated filer;
    (ii) 75 days if the registrant is an accelerated filer; and
    (iii) 90 days for all other registrants.
    (4) The term subsidiary's number of filing days means:
    (i) 60 days (75 days for fiscal years ending before December 15, 
2006) if the 50 percent or less owned person is a large accelerated 
filer;
    (ii) 75 days if the 50 percent or less owned person is an 
accelerated filer; and
    (iii) 90 days for all other 50 percent or less owned persons.
    (c) Notwithstanding the requirements for separate financial 
statements in paragraph (a) of this section, where financial statements 
of two or more majority-owned subsidiaries not consolidated are 
required, combined or consolidated statements of such subsidiaries may 
be filed subject to principles of inclusion and exclusion which clearly 
exhibit the financial position, cash flows and results of operations of 
the combined or consolidated group. Similarly, where financial 
statements of two or more 50 percent or less owned persons are required, 
combined or consolidated statements of such persons may be filed subject 
to the same principles of inclusion or exclusion referred to above.
    (d) If the 50 percent or less owned person is a foreign business, 
financial statements of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 
of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy this section.

<R05>
Sec. 210.3-10  Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered.

    (a)(1) General rule. Every issuer of a registered security that is 
guaranteed

[[Page 269]]

and every guarantor of a registered security must file the financial 
statements required for a registrant by Regulation S-X.
    (2) Operation of this rule. Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of 
this section are exceptions to the general rule of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section. Only one of these paragraphs can apply to a single issuer 
or guarantor. Paragraph (g) of this section is a special rule for 
recently acquired issuers or guarantors that overrides each of these 
exceptions for a specific issuer or guarantor. Paragraph (h) of this 
section defines the following terms used in this section: 100% owned, 
full and unconditional, annual report, quarterly report, no independent 
assets or operations, minor, finance subsidiary and operating 
subsidiary. Paragraph (i) of this section states the requirements for 
preparing the condensed consolidating financial information required by 
paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section.

    Note to paragraph (a)(2). Where paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and 
(f) of this section specify the filing of financial statements of the 
parent company, the financial statements of an entity that is not an 
issuer or guarantor of the registered security cannot be substituted for 
those of the parent company.

    (3) Foreign private issuers. Where any provision of this section 
requires compliance with Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02, a foreign private 
issuer may comply by providing financial statements for the periods 
specified by Item 8.A of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter).
    (b) Finance subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by its parent 
company. When a finance subsidiary issues securities and its parent 
company guarantees those securities, the registration statement, parent 
company annual report, or parent company quarterly report need not 
include financial statements of the issuer if:
    (1) The issuer is 100% owned by the parent company guarantor;
    (2) The guarantee is full and unconditional;
    (3) No other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees the 
securities; and
    (4) The parent company's financial statements are filed for the 
periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include a 
footnote stating that the issuer is a 100%-owned finance subsidiary of 
the parent company and the parent company has fully and unconditionally 
guaranteed the securities. The footnote also must include the narrative 
disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this section.

    Note to paragraph (b). Paragraph (b) is available if a subsidiary 
issuer satisfies the requirements of this paragraph but for the fact 
that, instead of the parent company guaranteeing the security, the 
subsidiary issuer co-issued the security, jointly and severally, with 
the parent company. In this situation, the narrative information 
required by paragraph (b)(4) must be modified accordingly.

    (c) Operating subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by its 
parent company. When an operating subsidiary issues securities and its 
parent company guarantees those securities, the registration statement, 
parent company annual report, or parent company quarterly report need 
not include financial statements of the issuer if:
    (1) The issuer is 100% owned by the parent company guarantor;
    (2) The guarantee is full and unconditional;
    (3) No other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees the 
securities; and
    (4) The parent company's financial statements are filed for the 
periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a 
footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same 
periods with a separate column for:
    (i) The parent company;
    (ii) The subsidiary issuer;
    (iii) Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined 
basis;
    (iv) Consolidating adjustments; and
    (v) The total consolidated amounts.

    Notes to paragraph (c). 1. Instead of the condensed consolidating 
financial information required by paragraph (c)(4), the parent company's 
financial statements may include a footnote stating, if true, that the 
parent company has no independent assets or operations, the guarantee is 
full and unconditional, and any subsidiaries of the parent company other 
than the subsidiary issuer are minor. The footnote also must include the 
narrative disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this 
section.
    2. If the alternative disclosure permitted by Note 1 to this 
paragraph is not applicable because the parent company has independent

[[Page 270]]

assets or operations, the condensed consolidating financial information 
described in paragraph (c)(4) may omit the column for ``any other 
subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined basis'' if those other 
subsidiaries are minor.
    3. Paragraph (c) is available if a subsidiary issuer satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph but for the fact that, instead of the 
parent company guaranteeing the security, the subsidiary issuer co-
issued the security, jointly and severally, with the parent company. In 
this situation, the narrative information required by paragraph (i)(8) 
of this section must be modified accordingly.

    (d) Subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by its parent company 
and one or more other subsidiaries of that parent company. When a 
subsidiary issues securities and both its parent company and one or more 
other subsidiaries of that parent company guarantee those securities, 
the registration statement, parent company annual report, or parent 
company quarterly report need not include financial statements of the 
issuer or any subsidiary guarantor if:
    (1) The issuer and all subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by the 
parent company guarantor;
    (2) The guarantees are full and unconditional;
    (3) The guarantees are joint and several; and
    (4) The parent company's financial statements are filed for the 
periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a 
footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same 
periods with a separate column for:
    (i) The parent company;
    (ii) The subsidiary issuer;
    (iii) The guarantor subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined 
basis;
    (iv) Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined 
basis;
    (v) Consolidating adjustments; and
    (vi) The total consolidated amounts.

    Notes to paragraph (d). 1. Paragraph (d) applies in the same manner 
whether the issuer is a finance subsidiary or an operating subsidiary.
    2. The condensed consolidating financial information described in 
paragraph (d)(4) may omit the column for ``any other subsidiaries of the 
parent company on a combined basis'' if those other subsidiaries are 
minor.
    3. Paragraph (d) is available if a subsidiary issuer satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph but for the fact that, instead of the 
parent company guaranteeing the security, the subsidiary issuer co-
issued the security, jointly and severally, with the parent company. In 
this situation, the narrative information required by paragraph (i)(8) 
of this section must be modified accordingly.
    4. If all of the requirements in paragraph (d) are satisfied except 
that the guarantee of a subsidiary is not joint and several with, as 
applicable, the parent company's guarantee or the guarantees of the 
parent company and the other subsidiaries, then each subsidiary 
guarantor whose guarantee is not joint and several need not include 
separate financial statements, but the condensed consolidating financial 
information should include a separate column for each guarantor whose 
guarantee is not joint and several.
    5. Instead of the condensed consolidating financial information 
required by paragraph (d)(4), the parent company's financial statements 
may include a footnote stating, if true, that the parent company has no 
independent assets or operations, the subsidiary issuer is a 100% owned 
finance subsidiary of the parent company, the parent company has 
guaranteed the securities, all of the parent company's subsidiaries 
other than the subsidiary issuer have guaranteed the securities, all of 
the guarantees are full and unconditional, and all of the guarantees are 
joint and several. The footnote also must include the narrative 
disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this section.

    (e) Single subsidiary guarantor of securities issued by the parent 
company of that subsidiary. When a parent company issues securities and 
one of its subsidiaries guarantees those securities, the registration 
statement, parent company annual report, or parent company quarterly 
report need not include financial statements of the subsidiary guarantor 
if:
    (1) The subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by the parent company 
issuer;
    (2) The guarantee is full and unconditional;
    (3) No other subsidiary of that parent guarantees the securities; 
and
    (4) The parent company's financial statements are filed for the 
periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a 
footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same 
periods with a separate column for:
    (i) The parent company;
    (ii) The subsidiary guarantor;
    (iii) Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined 
basis;
    (iv) Consolidating adjustments; and
    (v) The total consolidated amounts.


[[Page 271]]


    Notes to paragraph (e). 1. Paragraph (e) applies in the same manner 
whether the guarantor is a finance subsidiary or an operating 
subsidiary.
    2. Instead of the condensed consolidating financial information 
required by paragraph (e)(4), the parent company's financial statements 
may include a footnote stating, if true, that the parent company has no 
independent assets or operations, the guarantee is full and 
unconditional, and any subsidiaries of the parent company other than the 
subsidiary guarantor are minor. The footnote also must include the 
narrative disclosures specified in paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this 
section.
    3. If the alternative disclosure permitted by Note 2 to this 
paragraph is not applicable because the parent company has independent 
assets or operations, the condensed consolidating financial information 
described in paragraph (e)(4) may omit the column for ``any other 
subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined basis'' if those other 
subsidiaries are minor.
    4. If, instead of guaranteeing the subject security, a subsidiary 
co-issues the security jointly and severally with its parent company, 
this paragraph (e) does not apply. Instead, the appropriate financial 
information requirement would depend on whether the subsidiary is a 
finance subsidiary or an operating subsidiary. If the subsidiary is a 
finance subsidiary, paragraph (b) applies. If the subsidiary is an 
operating company, paragraph (c) applies.

    (f) Multiple subsidiary guarantors of securities issued by the 
parent company of those subsidiaries. When a parent company issues 
securities and more than one of its subsidiaries guarantee those 
securities, the registration statement, parent company annual report, or 
parent company quarterly report need not include financial statements of 
the subsidiary guarantors if:
    (1) Each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned by the parent 
company issuer;
    (2) The guarantees are full and unconditional;
    (3) The guarantees are joint and several; and
    (4) The parent company's financial statements are filed for the 
periods specified by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 and include, in a 
footnote, condensed consolidating financial information for the same 
periods with a separate column for:
    (i) The parent company;
    (ii) The subsidiary guarantors on a combined basis;
    (iii) Any other subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined 
basis;
    (iv) Consolidating adjustments; and
    (v) The total consolidated amounts.

    Notes to paragraph (f). 1. Instead of the condensed consolidating 
financial information required by paragraph (f)(4), the parent company's 
financial statements may include a footnote stating, if true, that the 
parent company has no independent assets or operations, the guarantees 
are full and unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries 
of the parent company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. 
The footnote also must include the narrative disclosures specified in 
paragraphs (i)(9) and (i)(10) of this section.
    2. If the alternative disclosure permitted by Note 1 to this 
paragraph is not applicable because the parent company has independent 
assets or operations, the condensed consolidating financial information 
described in paragraph (f)(4) may omit the column for ``any other 
subsidiaries of the parent company on a combined basis'' if those other 
subsidiaries are minor.
    3. If any of the subsidiary guarantees is not joint and several with 
the guarantees of the other subsidiaries, then each subsidiary guarantor 
whose guarantee is not joint and several need not include separate 
financial statements, but the condensed consolidating financial 
information must include a separate column for each subsidiary guarantor 
whose guarantee is not joint and several.

    (g) Recently acquired subsidiary issuers or subsidiary guarantors. 
(1) The Securities Act registration statement of the parent company must 
include the financial statements specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section for any subsidiary that otherwise meets the conditions in 
paragraph (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this section for omission of separate 
financial statements if:
    (i) The subsidiary has not been included in the audited consolidated 
results of the parent company for at least nine months of the most 
recent fiscal year; and
    (ii) The net book value or purchase price, whichever is greater, of 
the subsidiary is 20% or more of the principal amount of the securities 
being registered.
    (2) Financial statements required.
    (i) Audited financial statements for a subsidiary described in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be filed for the subsidiary's most 
recent fiscal year preceding the acquisition. In addition, unaudited 
financial statements must

[[Page 272]]

be filed for any interim periods specified in Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 
210.3-02.
    (ii) The financial statements must conform to the requirements of 
Regulation S-X (Sec. Sec. 210.1-01 through 12-29), except that 
supporting schedules need not be filed. If the subsidiary is a foreign 
business, financial statements of the subsidiary meeting the 
requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f) will satisfy this 
item.
    (3) Instructions to paragraph (g).
    (i) The significance test of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section 
should be computed using net book value of the subsidiary as of the most 
recent fiscal year end preceding the acquisition.
    (ii) Information required by this paragraph (g) is not required to 
be included in an annual report or quarterly report.
    (iii) Acquisitions of a group of subsidiary issuers or subsidiary 
guarantors that are related prior to their acquisition shall be 
aggregated for purposes of applying the 20% test in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) 
of this section. Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be related prior to 
their acquisition if:
    (A) They are under common control or management;
    (B) The acquisition of one subsidiary is conditioned on the 
acquisition of each subsidiary; or
    (C) The acquisition of each subsidiary is conditioned on a single 
common event.
    (h) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) A subsidiary is ``100% owned'' if all of its outstanding voting 
shares are owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent company. 
A subsidiary not in corporate form is 100% owned if the sum of all 
interests are owned, either directly or indirectly, by its parent 
company other than:
    (i) Securities that are guaranteed by its parent and, if applicable, 
other 100%-owned subsidiaries of its parent; and
    (ii) Securities that guarantee securities issued by its parent and, 
if applicable, other 100%-owned subsidiaries of its parent.
    (2) A guarantee is ``full and unconditional,'' if, when an issuer of 
a guaranteed security has failed to make a scheduled payment, the 
guarantor is obligated to make the scheduled payment immediately and, if 
it doesn't, any holder of the guaranteed security may immediately bring 
suit directly against the guarantor for payment of all amounts due and 
payable.
    (3) Annual report refers to an annual report on Form 10-K or Form 
20-F (Sec. 249.310 or 249.220f of this chapter).
    (4) Quarterly report refers to a quarterly report on Form 10-Q 
(Sec. 249.308a of this chapter).
    (5) A parent company has no independent assets or operations if each 
of its total assets, revenues, income from continuing operations before 
income taxes, and cash flows from operating activities (excluding 
amounts related to its investment in its consolidated subsidiaries) is 
less than 3% of the corresponding consolidated amount.
    (6) A subsidiary is minor if each of its total assets, stockholders' 
equity, revenues, income from continuing operations before income taxes, 
and cash flows from operating activities is less than 3% of the parent 
company's corresponding consolidated amount.

    Note to paragraph (h)(6). When considering a group of subsidiaries, 
the definition applies to each subsidiary in that group individually and 
to all subsidiaries in that group in the aggregate.

    (7) A subsidiary is a finance subsidiary if it has no assets, 
operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the 
issuance, administration and repayment of the security being registered 
and any other securities guaranteed by its parent company.
    (8) A subsidiary is an operating subsidiary if it is not a finance 
subsidiary.
    (i) Instructions for preparation of condensed consolidating 
financial information required by paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of 
this section.
    (1) Follow the general guidance in Sec. 210.10-01 for the form and 
content for condensed financial statements and present the financial 
information in sufficient detail to allow investors to determine the 
assets, results of operations and cash flows of each of the 
consolidating groups;
    (2) The financial information should be audited for the same periods 
that the parent company financial statements are required to be audited;

[[Page 273]]

    (3) The parent company column should present investments in all 
subsidiaries under the equity method;
    (4) The parent company's basis shall be ``pushed down'' to the 
applicable subsidiary columns to the extent that push down would be 
required or permitted in separate financial statements of the 
subsidiary;
    (5) All subsidiary issuer or subsidiary guarantor columns should 
present the following investments in subsidiaries under the equity 
method:
    (i) Non-guarantor subsidiaries;
    (ii) Subsidiary issuers or subsidiary guarantors that are not 100% 
owned or whose guarantee is not full and unconditional;
    (iii) Subsidiary guarantors whose guarantee is not joint and several 
with the guarantees of the other subsidiaries; and
    (iv) Subsidiary guarantors with differences in domestic or foreign 
laws that affect the enforceability of the guarantees;
    (6) Provide a separate column for each subsidiary issuer or 
subsidiary guarantor that is not 100% owned, whose guarantee is not full 
and unconditional, or whose guarantee is not joint and several with the 
guarantees of other subsidiaries. Inclusion of a separate column does 
not relieve that issuer or guarantor from the requirement to file 
separate financial statements under paragraph (a) of this section. 
However, paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section will provide this 
relief if the particular paragraph is satisfied except that the 
guarantee is not joint and several;
    (7) Provide separate columns for each guarantor by legal 
jurisdiction if differences in domestic or foreign laws affect the 
enforceability of the guarantees;
    (8) Include the following disclosure, if true:
    (i) Each subsidiary issuer or subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by 
the parent company;
    (ii) All guarantees are full and unconditional; and
    (iii) Where there is more than one guarantor, all guarantees are 
joint and several;
    (9) Disclose any significant restrictions on the ability of the 
parent company or any guarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by 
dividend or loan;
    (10) Provide the disclosures prescribed by Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3) with 
respect to the subsidiary issuers and subsidiary guarantors;
    (11) The disclosure:
    (i) May not omit any financial and narrative information about each 
guarantor if the information would be material for investors to evaluate 
the sufficiency of the guarantee;
    (ii) Shall include sufficient information so as to make the 
financial information presented not misleading; and
    (iii) Need not repeat information that would substantially duplicate 
disclosure elsewhere in the parent company's consolidated financial 
statements; and
    (12) Where the parent company's consolidated financial statements 
are prepared on a comprehensive basis other than U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, reconcile the 
information in each column to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles to the extent necessary to allow investors to evaluate the 
sufficiency of the guarantees. The reconciliation may be limited to the 
information specified by Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this 
chapter). The reconciling information need not duplicate information 
included elsewhere in the reconciliation of the consolidated financial 
statements.

Sec. 210.3-11  Financial statements of an inactive registrant.

    If a registrant is an inactive entity as defined below, the 
financial statements required by this regulation for purposes of reports 
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may be unaudited. An 
inactive entity is one meeting all of the following conditions:
    (a) Gross receipts from all sources for the fiscal year are not in 
excess of $100,000;
    (b) The registrant has not purchased or sold any of its own stock, 
granted options therefor, or levied assessments upon outstanding stock,

[[Page 274]]

    (c) Expenditures for all purposes for the fiscal year are not in 
excess of $100,000;
    (d) No material change in the business has occurred during the 
fiscal year, including any bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment or 
succession or any material acquisition or disposition of plants, mines, 
mining equipment, mine rights or leases; and
    (e) No exchange upon which the shares are listed, or governmental 
authority having jurisdiction, requires the furnishing to it or the 
publication of audited financial statements.

Sec. 210.3-12  Age of financial statements at effective date of registration statement or at mailing date of proxy statement.

    (a) If the financial statements in a filing are as of a date the 
number of days specified in paragraph (g) of this section or more before 
the date the filing is expected to become effective, or proposed mailing 
date in the case of a proxy statement, the financial statements shall be 
updated, except as specified in the following paragraphs, with a balance 
sheet as of an interim date within the number of days specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section and with statements of income and cash 
flows for the interim period between the end of the most recent fiscal 
year and the date of the interim balance sheet provided and for the 
corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year. Such interim 
financial statements may be unaudited and need not be presented in 
greater detail than is required by Sec. 210.10-01. Notwithstanding the 
above requirements, the most recent interim financial statements shall 
be at least as current as the most recent financial statements filed 
with the Commission on Form 10-Q.
    (b) Where the anticipated effective date of a filing, or in the case 
of a proxy statement the proposed mailing date, falls within the number 
of days subsequent to the end of the fiscal year specified in paragraph 
(g) of this section, the filing need not include financial statements 
more current than as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of the most 
recently completed fiscal year unless the audited financial statements 
for such fiscal year are available or unless the anticipated effective 
date or proposed mailing date falls after 45 days subsequent to the end 
of the fiscal year and the registrant does not meet the conditions 
prescribed under paragraph (c) of Sec. 210.3-01. If the anticipated 
effective date or proposed mailing date falls after 45 days subsequent 
to the end of the fiscal year and the registrant does not meet the 
conditions prescribed under paragraph (c) of Sec. 210.3-01, the filing 
must include audited financial statements for the most recently 
completed fiscal year.
    (c) Where a filing is made near the end of a fiscal year and audited 
financial statements for that fiscal year are not included in the 
filing, the filing shall be updated with such audited financial 
statements if they become available prior to the anticipated effective 
date, or proposed mailing date in the case of a proxy statement.
    (d) The age of the registrant's most recent audited financial 
statements included in a registration statement filed under the 
Securities Act of 1933 or filed on Form 10 (17 CFR 249.210) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall not be more than one year and 45 
days old at the date the registration statement becomes effective if the 
registration statement relates to the security of an issuer that was not 
subject, immediately before the time of filing the registration 
statement, to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (e) For filings by registered management investment companies, the 
requirements of Sec. 210.3-18 shall apply in lieu of the requirements 
of this section.
    (f) Any foreign private issuer may file financial statements whose 
age is specified in Item 8.A of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this 
chapter). Financial statements of a foreign business which are furnished 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 210.3-05 or 210.3-09 because it is an acquired 
business or a 50 percent or less owned person may be of the age 
specified in Item 8.A of Form 20-F.
    (g)(1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the number of 
days shall be:
    (i) 130 days for large accelerated filers and accelerated filers (as 
defined in Sec. 240.12b-2 of this chapter); and
    (ii) 135 days for all other registrants.

[[Page 275]]

    (2) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the number of 
days shall be:
    (i) 60 days (75 days for fiscal years ending before December 15, 
2006) for large accelerated filers (as defined in Sec. 240.12b-2 of

Sec. 210.3-13  Filing of other financial statements in certain cases.

    The Commission may, upon the informal written request of the 
registrant, and where consistent with the protection of investors, 
permit the omission of one or more of the financial statements herein 
required or the filing in substitution therefor of appropriate 
statements of comparable character. The Commission may also by informal 
written notice require the filing of other financial statements in 
addition to, or in substitution for, the statements herein required in 
any case where such statements are necessary or appropriate for an 
adequate presentation of the financial condition of any person whose 
financial statements are required, or whose statements are otherwise

Sec. 210.3-14  Special instructions for real estate operations to be acquired.

    (a) If, during the period for which income statements are required, 
the registrant has acquired one or more properties which in the 
aggregate are significant, or since the date of the latest balance sheet 
required has acquired or proposes to acquire one or more properties 
which in the aggregate are significant, the following shall be furnished 
with respect to such properties:
    (1) Audited income statements (not including earnings per unit) for 
the three most recent fiscal years, which shall exclude items not 
comparable to the proposed future operations of the property such as 
mortgage interest, leasehold rental, depreciation, corporate expenses 
and Federal and state income taxes: Provided, however, That such audited 
statements need be presented for only the most recent fiscal year if
    (i) The property is not acquired from a related party;
    (ii) Material factors considered by the registrant in assessing the 
property are described with specificity in the filing with regard to the 
property, including sources of revenue (including, but not limited to, 
competition in the rental market, comparative rents, occupancy rates) 
and expense (including, but not limited to, utility rates, ad valorem 
tax rates, maintenance expenses, capital improvements anticipated); and
    (iii) The registrant indicates in the appropriate filing that, after 
reasonable inquiry, the registrant is not aware of any material factors 
relating to that specific property other than those discussed in 
response to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section that would cause the 
reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of 
future operating results.

    Note: The discussion of material factors considered should be 
combined with that required by Item 15 of Form S-11.

    (2) If the property is to be operated by the registrant, there shall 
be furnished a statement showing the estimated taxable operating results 
of the registrant based on the most recent twelve month period including 
such adjustments as can be factually supported. If the property is to be 
acquired subject to a net lease the estimated taxable operating results 
shall be based on the rent to be paid for the first year of the lease. 
In either case, the estimated amount of cash to be made available by 
operations shall be shown. There shall be stated in an introductory 
paragraph the principal assumptions which have been made in preparing 
the statements of estimated taxable operating results and cash to be 
made available by operations.
    (3) If appropriate under the circumstances, there shall be given in 
tablular form for a limited number of years the estimated cash 
distribution per unit showing the portion thereof reportable as taxable 
income and the portion representing a return of capital

[[Page 276]]

together with an explanation of annual variations, if any. If taxable 
net income per unit will become greater than the cash available for 
distribution per unit, that fact and approximate year of occurrence 
shall be stated, if significant.
    (b) Information required by this section is not required to be 
included in a filing on Form 10-K.

sale of properties, extraordinary items and cumulative effects of 
accounting changes, and (ii) gain or loss on sale of properties, less 
applicable income tax.

lieu of the captions required by Sec. 210.5-02.31(a)(3): (i) The 
balance of undistributed income from other than gain or loss on sale of 
properties and (ii) accumulated undistributed net realized gain or loss 
on sale of properties. The information specified in Sec. 210.3-04 shall 
be modified similarly.
    (b) The trust's status as a real estate investment trust under 
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as amended shall be 
stated in a note referred to in the appropriate statements. Such note 
shall also indicate briefly the principal present assumptions on which 
the trust has relied in making or not making provisons for Federal 
income taxes.
    (c) The tax status of distributions per unit shall be stated (e.g., 
ordinary income, capital gain, return of capital).

Sec. 210.3-16  Financial statements of affiliates whose securities collateralize an issue registered or being registered.

    (a) For each of the registrant's affiliates whose securities 
constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any class of 
securities registered or being registered, there shall be filed the 
financial statements that would be required if the affiliate were a 
registrant and required to file financial statements. However, financial 
statements need not be filed pursuant to this section for any person 
whose statements are otherwise separately included in the filing on an 
individual basis or on a basis consolidated with its subsidiaries.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, securities of a person shall 
be deemed to constitute a substantial portion of collateral if the 
aggregate principal amount, par value, or book value of the securities 
as carried by the registrant, or the market value of such securities, 
whichever is the greatest, equals 20 percent or more of the principal 
amount of the secured class of securities.

corporation, business trust, unincorporated association, or similar 
business organization if the person's total investment in such entity 
does not exceed 5 percent of his total assets and the person's total 
income from such entity does not exceed 5 percent of his gross income;

    (1) An audited balance sheet or statement of assets and liabilities 
as of the end of the most recent fiscal year;
    (2) An audited statement of operations for the most recent fiscal 
year conforming to the requirements of Sec. 210.6-07.
    (3) An audited statement of cash flows for the most recent fiscal

principles. (Further references in this rule to the requirement for such 
statement are likewise applicable only to the extent that they are 
consistent with the requirements of generally accepted accounting 
principles.)
    (4) Audited statements of changes in net assets conforming to the 
requirements of Sec. 210.6-09 for the two most recent fiscal years.
    (b) If the filing is made within 60 days after the end of the

recent fiscal year are not available, the balance sheet or statement of 
assets and liabilities may be as of the end of the preceding fiscal year 
and the filing shall include an additional balance sheet or statement of 
assets and liabilities as of an interim date within 245 days of the date 
of filing. In addition, the statements of operations and cash flows (if 
required by generally accepted accounting principles) shall be provided 
for the preceding fiscal year and the statement of changes in net assets 
shall be provided for the two preceding fiscal years and each of the 
statements shall be provided for the interim period between the end of 
the preceding fiscal year and the date of the most recent balance sheet 
or statement of assets and liabilities being filed. Financial statements 
for the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year need not be 
provided.
    (c) If the most current balance sheet or statement of assets and 
liabilities in a filing is as of a date 245 days or more prior to the 
date the filing is expected to become effective, the financial 
statements shall be updated with a balance sheet or statement of assets

Sec. 210.3-20  Currency for financial statements of foreign private issuers.

    (a) A foreign private issuer, as defined in Sec. 230.405 of this 
chapter, shall state amounts in its primary financial statements in the 
currency which it deems appropriate.
    (b) The currency in which amounts in the financial statements are 
stated shall be disclosed prominently on the face of the financial 
statements. If dividends on publicly-held equity securities will be 
declared in a currency other than the reporting currency, a

[[Page 278]]

note to the financial statements shall identify that currency. If there 
are material exchange restrictions or controls relating to the issuer's 
reporting currency, the currency of the issuer's domicile, or the 
currency in which the issuer will pay dividends, prominent disclosure of 
this fact shall be made in the financial statements. If the reporting 
currency is not the U.S. dollar, dollar-equivalent financial statements 
or convenience translations shall not be presented, except a translation 
may be presented of the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent 
interim period presented using the exchange rate as of the most recent 
balance sheet included in the filing, except that a rate as of the most 
recent practicable date shall be used if materially different.
    (c) If the financial statements of a foreign private issuer are 
stated in a currency of a country that has experienced cumulative 
inflationary effects exceeding a total of 100 percent over the most 
recent three year period, and have not been recast or otherwise 
supplemented to include information on a historical cost/constant 
currency or current cost basis prescribed or permitted by appropriate 
authoritative standards, the issuer shall present supplementary 
information to quantify the effects of changing prices upon its 
financial position and results of operations.
    (d) Notwithstanding the currency selected for reporting purposes, 
the issuer shall measure separately its own transactions, and those of 
each of its material operations (e.g., branches, divisions, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures, and similar entities) that is included in 
the issuer's consolidated financial statements and not located in a 
hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the issuer or the operation 
conducts its business. Assets and liabilities so determined shall be 
translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the 
balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses shall be 
translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction 
or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the 
period; and all translation effects of exchange rate changes shall be 
included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') 
of shareholder's equity. For purposes of this paragraph, the currency of 
an operation's primary economic environment is normally the currency in 
which cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary 
environment is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100% 
or more over the most recent three year period. Departures from the 
methodology presented in this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to 
Item 17(c)(2) of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter).
    (e) The issuer shall state its primary financial statements in the 
same currency for all periods for which financial information is 
presented. If the financial statements are stated in a currency that is 
different from that used in financial statements previously filed with 
the Commission, the issuer shall recast its financial statements as if 
the newly adopted currency had been used since at least the earliest 
period presented in the filing. The decision to change and the reason 
for the change in the reporting currency shall be disclosed in a note to 
the financial statements in the period in which the change occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 210.3A-02  Consolidated financial statements of the registrant and its subsidiaries.

    In deciding upon consolidation policy, the registrant must consider 
what financial presentation is most meaningful in the circumstances and 
should follow in the consolidated financial statements principles of 
inclusion or exclusion which will clearly exhibit the

[[Page 279]]

financial position and results of operations of the registrant. There is 
a presumption that consolidated statements are more meaningful than 
separate statements and that they are usually necessary for a fair 
presentation when one entity directly or indirectly has a controlling 
financial interest in another entity. Other particular facts and 
circumstances may require combined financial statements, an equity 
method of accounting, or valuation allowances in order to achieve a fair 
presentation. In any case, the disclosures required by Sec. 210.3A-03 
should clearly explain the accounting policies followed by the 
registrant in this area, including the circumstances involved in any 
departure from the normal practice of consolidating majority owned 
subsidiaries and not consolidating entities that are less than majority 
owned. Among the factors that the registrant should consider in 
determining the most meaningful presentation are the following:
    (a) Majority ownership: Generally, registrants shall consolidate 
entities that are majority owned and shall not consolidate entities that 
are not majority owned. The determination of majority ownership requires 
a careful analysis of the facts and circumstances of a particular 
relationship among entities. In rare situations, consolidation of a 
majority owned subsidiary may not result in a fair presentation, because 
the registrant, in substance, does not have a controlling financial 
interest (for example, when the subsidiary is in legal reorganization or 
in bankruptcy, or when control is likely to be temporary). In other 
situations, consolidation of an entity, notwithstanding the lack of 
technical majority ownership, is necessary to present fairly the 
financial position and results of operations of the registrant, because 
of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than 
record ownership of voting stock.
    (b) Different fiscal periods: Generally, registrants shall not 
consolidate any entity whose financial statements are as of a date or 
for periods substantially different from those of the registrant. 
Rather, the earnings or losses of such entities should be reflected in 
the registrant's financial statements on the equity method of 
accounting. However:
    (1) A difference in fiscal periods does not of itself justify the 
exclusion of an entity from consolidation. It ordinarily is feasible for 
such entity to prepare, for consolidation purposes, statements for a 
period which corresponds with or closely approaches the fiscal year of 
the registrant. Where the difference is not more than 93 days, it is 
usually acceptable to use, for consolidation purposes, such entity's 
statements for its fiscal period. Such difference, when it exists, 
should be disclosed as follows: the closing date of the entity should be 
expressly indicated, and the necessity for the use of different closing 
dates should be briefly explained. Furthermore, recognition should be 
given by disclosure or otherwise to the effect of intervening events 
which materially affect the financial position or results of operations.
    (2) Notwithstanding the 93-day provision specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, in connection with the retroactive combination 
of financial statements of entities following a pooling of interests, 
the financial statements of the constituents may be combined even if 
their respective fiscal periods do not end within 93 days, except that 
the financial statements for the latest fiscal year shall be recast to 
dates which do not differ by more than 93 days, if practicable. 
Disclosure shall be made of the periods combined and of the sales or 
revenues, net income before extraordinary items and net income of any 
interim periods excluded from or included more than once in results of 
operations as a result of such recasting.
    (c) Bank Holding Company Act: Registrants shall not consolidate any 
subsidiary or group of subsidiaries of a registrant subject to the Bank 
Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended as to which (1) a decision 
requiring divestiture has been made, or (2) there is substantial 
likelihood that divestiture will be necessary in order to comply with 
provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act.
    (d) Foreign subsidiaries: Due consideration shall be given to the 
propriety of consolidating with domestic corporations foreign 
subsidiaries which are operated under political, economic or currency 
restrictions. If consolidated,

[[Page 280]]

disclosure should be made as to the effect, insofar as this can 
reasonably be determined, of foreign exchange restrictions upon the 
consolidated financial position and operating results of the registrant 
and its subsidiaries.

Sept. 25, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 210.4-01  Form, order, and terminology.

    (a) Financial statements should be filed in such form and order, and 
should use such generally accepted terminology, as will best indicate 
their significance and character in the light of the provisions 
applicable thereto. The information required with respect to any 
statement shall be furnished as a minimum requirement to which shall be 
added such further material information as is necessary to make the 
required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they 
are made, not misleading.
    (1) Financial statements filed with the Commission which are not 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate, despite footnote or 
other disclosures, unless the Commission has otherwise provided. This 
article and other articles of Regulation S-X provide clarification of 
certain disclosures which must be included in any event, in financial 
statements filed with the Commission.
    (2) In all filings of foreign private issuers (see Sec. 230.405 of 
this chapter), except as stated otherwise in the applicable form, the 
financial statements may be prepared according to a comprehensive set of 
accounting principles, other than those generally accepted in the

[[Page 281]]

United States or International Financial Reporting Standards as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board, if a reconciliation to 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the provisions of 
Regulation S-X of the type specified in Item 18 of Form 20-F (Sec. 
249.220f of this chapter) is also filed as part of the financial 
statements. Alternatively, the financial statements may be prepared 
according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or 
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board.
    (3)(i) Notwithstanding the effective dates set forth in Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based 
Payment (``Statement No. 123R''), financial statements shall be prepared 
in accordance with Statement No. 123R beginning with:
    (A) The first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant's 
first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005, provided the 
registrant does not file as a smaller reporting company; and
    (B) The first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant's 
first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2005, provided the 
registrant files as a smaller reporting company.
    (ii) For periods prior to the effective dates set forth in this 
paragraph, both Statement No. 123R and Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (October 
1995), shall be considered to be generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (b) All money amounts required to be shown in financial statements 
may be expressed in whole dollars or multiples thereof, as appropriate: 
Provided, That, when stated in other than whole dollars, an indication 
to that effect is inserted immediately beneath the caption of the 
statement or schedule, at the top of the money columns, or at an 
appropriate point in narrative material.
    (c) Negative amounts (red figures) shall be shown in a manner which 
clearly distinguishes the negative attribute. When determining methods 
of display, consideration should be given to the limitations of 
reproduction and microfilming processes.

<R05>
Sec. 210.4-02  Items not material.

    If the amount which would otherwise be required to be shown with 
respect to any item is not material, it need not be separately set 
forth. The combination of insignificant amounts is permitted.


<R05>
Sec. 210.4-03  Inapplicable captions and omission of unrequired or inapplicable financial statements.

    (a) No caption should be shown in any financial statement as to 
which the items and conditions are not present.
    (b) Financial statements not required or inapplicable because the 
required matter is not present need not be filed.
    (c) The reasons for the omission of any required financial 
statements shall be indicated.


<R05>
Sec. 210.4-04  Omission of substantially identical notes.

    If a note covering substantially the same subject matter is required 
with respect to two or more financial statements relating to the same or 
affiliated persons, for which separate sets of notes are presented, the 
required information may be shown in a note to only one of such 
statements: Provided, That a clear and specific reference thereto is 
made in each of the other statements with respect to which the note is 
required.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 210.4-05--210.4-06  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 210.4-07  Discount on shares.

    Discount on shares, or any unamortized balance thereof, shall be 
shown separately as a deduction from the applicable account(s) as 
circumstances require.


<R05>
Sec. 210.4-08  General notes to financial statements.

    If applicable to the person for which the financial statements are 
filed, the following shall be set forth on the face

[[Page 282]]

of the appropriate statement or in appropriately captioned notes. The 
information shall be provided for each statement required to be filed, 
except that the information required by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) 
and (f) shall be provided as of the most recent audited balance sheet 
being filed and for paragraph (j) as specified therein. When specific 
statements are presented separately, the pertinent notes shall accompany 
such statements unless cross-referencing is appropriate.
    (a) Principles of consolidation or combination. With regard to 
consolidated or combined financial statements, refer to Sec. Sec. 
210.3A-01 to 3A-08 for requirements for supplemental information in 
notes to the financial statements.
    (b) Assets subject to lien. Assets mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise 
subject to lien, and the approximate amounts thereof, shall be 
designated and the obligations collateralized briefly identified.
    (c) Defaults. The facts and amounts concerning any default in 
principal, interest, sinking fund, or redemption provisions with respect 
to any issue of securities or credit agreements, or any breach of 
covenant of a related indenture or agreement, which default or breach 
existed at the date of the most recent balance sheet being filed and 
which has not been subsequently cured, shall be stated in the notes to 
the financial statements. If a default or breach exists but acceleration 
of the obligation has been waived for a stated period of time beyond the 
date of the most recent balance sheet being filed, state the amount of 
the obligation and the period of the waiver.
    (d) Preferred shares. (1) Aggregate preferences on involuntary 
liquidation, if other than par or stated value, shall be shown 
parenthetically in the equity section of the balance sheet.
    (2) Disclosure shall be made of any restriction upon retained 
earnings that arises from the fact that upon involuntary liquidation the 
aggregate preferences of the preferred shares exceeds the par or stated 
value of such shares.
    (e) Restrictions which limit the payment of dividends by the 
registrant. (1) Describe the most significant restrictions, other than 
as reported under paragraph (d) of this section, on the payment of 
dividends by the registrant, indicating their sources, their pertinent 
provisions, and the amount of retained earnings or net income restricted 
or free of restrictions.
    (2) Disclose the amount of consolidated retained earnings which 
represents undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned persons 
accounted for by the equity method.
    (3) The disclosures in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) and (ii) in this 
section shall be provided when the restricted net assets of consolidated 
and unconsolidated subsidiaries and the parent's equity in the 
undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for 
by the equity method together exceed 25 percent of consolidated net 
assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. For 
purposes of this test, restricted net assets of subsidiaries shall mean 
that amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets (after 
intercompany eliminations) reflected in the balance sheets of its 
consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the most 
recent fiscal year which may not be transferred to the parent company in 
the form of loans, advances or cash dividends by the subsidiaries 
without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, 
foreign government, etc.). Not all limitations on transferability of 
assets are considered to be restrictions for purposes of this test, 
which considers only specific third party restrictions on the ability of 
subsidiaries to transfer funds outside of the entity. For example, the 
presence of subsidiary debt which is secured by certain of the 
subsidiary's assets does not constitute a restriction under this rule. 
However, if there are any loan provisions prohibiting dividend payments, 
loans or advances to the parent by a subsidiary, these are considered 
restrictions for purposes of computing restricted net assets. When a 
loan agreement requires that a subsidiary maintain certain working 
capital, net tangible asset, or net asset levels, or where formal 
compensating arrangements exist, there is considered to be a restriction 
under the rule because the lender's intent is normally to preclude the 
transfer by dividend or

[[Page 283]]

otherwise of funds to the parent company. Similarly, a provision which 
requires that a subsidiary reinvest all of its earnings is a 
restriction, since this precludes loans, advances or dividends in the 
amount of such undistributed earnings by the entity. Where restrictions 
on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the 
amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the 
amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable 
preferred stocks (Sec. 210.5-02.28) and minority interests shall be 
deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this test.
    (i) Describe the nature of any restrictions on the ability of 
consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer 
funds to the registrant in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances 
(i.e., borrowing arrangements, regulatory restraints, foreign 
government, etc.).
    (ii) Disclose separately the amounts of such restricted net assets 
for unconsolidated subsidiaries and consolidated subsidiaries as of the 
end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
    (f) Significant changes in bonds, mortgages and similar debt. Any 
significant changes in the authorized or issued amounts of bonds, 
mortgages and similar debt since the date of the latest balance sheet 
being filed for a particular person or group shall be stated.
    (g) Summarized financial information of subsidiaries not 
consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons. (1) The summarized 
information as to assets, liabilities and results of operations as 
detailed in Sec. 210.1-02(bb) shall be presented in notes to the 
financial statements on an individual or group basis for:
    (i) Subsidiaries not consolidated; or
    (ii) For 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for by the 
equity method by the registrant or by a subsidiary of the registrant, if 
the criteria in Sec. 210.1-02(w) for a significant subsidiary are met:
    (A) Individually by any subsidiary not consolidated or any 50% or 
less owned person; or
    (B) On an aggregated basis by any combination of such subsidiaries 
and persons.
    (2) Summarized financial information shall be presented insofar as 
is practicable as of the same dates and for the same periods as the 
audited consolidated financial statements provided and shall include the 
disclosures prescribed by Sec. 210.1-02(bb). Summarized information of 
subsidiaries not consolidated shall not be combined for disclosure 
purposes with the summarized information of 50 percent or less owned 
persons.
    (h) Income tax expense. (1) Disclosure shall be made in the income 
statement or a note thereto, of (i) the components of income (loss) 
before income tax expense (benefit) as either domestic or foreign; (ii) 
the components of income tax expense, including (A) taxes currently 
payable and (B) the net tax effects, as applicable, of timing 
differences (indicate separately the amount of the estimated tax effect 
of each of the various types of timing differences, such as 
depreciation, warranty costs, etc., where the amount of each such tax 
effect exceeds five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the 
income before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate; 
other differences may be combined.)

    Note: Amounts applicable to United States Federal income taxes, to 
foreign income taxes and the other income taxes shall be stated 
separately for each major component. Amounts applicable to foreign 
income (loss) and amounts applicable to foreign or other income taxes 
which are less than five percent of the total of income before taxes or 
the component of tax expense, respectively, need not be separately 
disclosed. For purposes of this rule, foreign income (loss) is defined 
as income (loss) generated from a registrant's foreign operations, i.e., 
operations that are located outside of the registrant's home country.

    (2) Provide a reconciliation between the amount of reported total 
income tax expense (benefit) and the amount computed by multiplying the 
income (loss) before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax 
rate, showing the estimated dollar amount of each of the underlying 
causes for the difference. If no individual reconciling item amounts to 
more than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income 
before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax

[[Page 284]]

rate, and the total difference to be reconciled is less than five 
percent of such computed amount, no reconciliation need be provided 
unless it would be significant in appraising the trend of earnings. 
Reconciling items that are individually less than five percent of the 
computed amount may be aggregated in the reconciliation. The 
reconciliation may be presented in percentages rather than in dollar 
amounts. Where the reporting person is a foreign entity, the income tax 
rate in that person's country of domicile should normally be used in 
making the above computation, but different rates should not be used for 
subsidiaries or other segments of a reporting entity. When the rate used 
by a reporting person is other than the United States Federal corporate 
income tax rate, the rate used and the basis for using such rate shall 
be disclosed.
    (3) Paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section shall be applied in 
the following manner to financial statements which reflect the adoption 
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 109, Accounting for 
Income Taxes.
    (i) The disclosures required by paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section 
and by the parenthetical instruction at the end of paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section and by the introductory sentence of paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section shall not apply.
    (ii) The instructional note between paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of 
this section and the balance of the requirements of paragraphs (h) (1) 
and (2) of this section shall continue to apply.
    (i) Warrants or rights outstanding. Information with respect to 
warrants or rights outstanding at the date of the related balance sheet 
shall be set forth as follows:
    (1) Title of issue of securities called for by warrants or rights.
    (2) Aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants or rights 
outstanding.
    (3) Date from which warrants or rights are exercisable.
    (4) Price at which warrant or right is exercisable.
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) Related party transactions which affect the financial 
statements. (1) Related party transactions should be identified and the 
amounts stated on the face of the balance sheet, income statement, or 
statement of cash flows.
    (2) In cases where separate financial statements are presented for 
the registrant, certain investees, or subsidiaries, separate disclosure 
shall be made in such statements of the amounts in the related 
consolidated financial statements which are (i) eliminated and (ii) not 
eliminated. Also, any intercompany profits or losses resulting from 
transactions with related parties and not eliminated and the effects 
thereof shall be disclosed.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements--(1) Repurchase 
agreements (assets sold under agreements to repurchase). (i) If, as of 
the most recent balance sheet date, the carrying amount (or market 
value, if higher than the carrying amount or if there is no carrying 
amount) of the securities or other assets sold under agreements to 
repurchase (repurchase agreements) exceeds 10% of total assets, disclose 
separately in the balance sheet the aggregate amount of liabilities 
incurred pursuant to repurchase agreements including accrued interest 
payable thereon.
    (ii)(A) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the carrying 
amount (or market value, if higher than the carrying amount) of 
securities or other assets sold under repurchase agreements, other than 
securities or assets specified in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section, exceeds 10% of total assets, disclose in an appropriately 
captioned footnote containing a tabular presentation, segregated as to 
type of such securities or assets sold under agreements to repurchase 
(e.g., U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations and 
loans), the following information as of the balance sheet date for each 
such agreement or group of agreements (other than agreements involving 
securities or assets specified in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section) maturing (1) overnight; (2) term up to 30 days; (3) term of 30 
to 90 days; (4) term over 90 days and (5) demand:
    (i) The carrying amount and market value of the assets sold under 
agreement to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or 
other assets

[[Page 285]]

on deposit under the repurchase agreements; and
    (ii) The repurchase liability associated with such transaction or 
group of transactions and the interest rate(s) thereon.
    (B) For purposes of paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(A) of this section only, do 
not include securities or other assets for which unrealized changes in 
market value are reported in current income or which have been obtained 
under reverse repurchase agreements.
    (iii) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the amount at 
risk under repurchase agreements with any individual counterparty or 
group of related counterparties exceeds 10% of stockholders' equity (or 
in the case of investment companies, net asset value), disclose the name 
of each such counterparty or group of related counterparties, the amount 
at risk with each, and the weighted average maturity of the repurchase 
agreements with each. The amount at risk under repurchase agreements is 
defined as the excess of carrying amount (or market value, if higher 
than the carrying amount or if there is no carrying amount) of the 
securities or other assets sold under agreement to repurchase, including 
accrued interest plus any cash or other assets on deposit to secure the 
repurchase obligation, over the amount of the repurchase liability 
(adjusted for accrued interest). (Cash deposits in connection with 
repurchase agreements shall not be reported as unrestricted cash 
pursuant to rule 5-02.1.)
    (2) Reverse repurchase agreements (assets purchased under agreements 
to resell). (i) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the 
aggregate carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements (securities 
or other assets purchased under agreements to resell) exceeds 10% of 
total assets: (A) Disclose separately such amount in the balance sheet; 
and (B) disclose in an appropriately captioned footnote: (1) The 
registrant's policy with regard to taking possession of securities or 
other assets purchased under agreements to resell; and (2) whether or 
not there are any provisions to ensure that the market value of the 
underlying assets remains sufficient to protect the registrant in the 
event of default by the counterparty and if so, the nature of those 
provisions.
    (ii) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the amount at 
risk under reverse repurchase agreements with any individual 
counterparty or group of related counterparties exceeds 10% of 
stockholders' equity (or in the case of investment companies, net asset 
value), disclose the name of each such counterparty or group of related 
counterparties, the amount at risk with each, and the weighted average 
maturity of the reverse repurchase agreements with each. The amount at 
risk under reverse repurchase agreements is defined as the excess of the 
carrying amount of the reverse repurchase agreements over the market 
value of assets delivered pursuant to the agreements by the counterparty 
to the registrant (or to a third party agent that has affirmatively 
agreed to act on behalf of the registrant) and not returned to the 
counterparty, exept in exchange for their approximate market value in a 
separate transaction.
    (n) Accounting policies for certain derivative instruments. 
Disclosures regarding accounting policies shall include descriptions of 
the accounting policies used for derivative financial instruments and 
derivative commodity instruments and the methods of applying those 
policies that materially affect the determination of financial position, 
cash flows, or results of operation. This description shall include, to 
the extent material, each of the following items:
    (1) A discussion of each method used to account for derivative 
financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments;
    (2) The types of derivative financial instruments and derivative 
commodity instruments accounted for under each method; (3) The criteria 
required to be met for each accounting method used, including a 
discussion of the criteria required to be met for hedge or deferral 
accounting and accrual or settlement accounting (e.g., whether and how 
risk reduction, correlation, designation, and effectiveness tests are 
applied);
    (4) The accounting method used if the criteria specified in 
paragraph (n)(3) of this section are not met;

[[Page 286]]

    (5) The method used to account for terminations of derivatives 
designated as hedges or derivatives used to affect directly or 
indirectly the terms, fair values, or cash flows of a designated item;
    (6) The method used to account for derivatives when the designated 
item matures, is sold, is extinguished, or is terminated. In addition, 
the method used to account for derivatives designated to an anticipated 
transaction, when the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to 
occur; and
    (7) Where and when derivative financial instruments and derivative 
commodity instruments, and their related gains and losses, are reported 
in the statements of financial position, cash flows, and results of 
operations.

Instructions to paragraph (n): 1. For purposes of this paragraph (n), 
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
(collectively referred to as ``derivatives'') are defined as follows:
    (i) Derivative financial instruments have the same meaning as 
defined by generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB''), Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 119, ``Disclosure about Derivative Financial 
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,'' (``FAS 119'') 
paragraphs 5-7, (October 1994)), and include futures, forwards, swaps, 
options, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics.
    (ii) Derivative commodity instruments include, to the extent such 
instruments are not derivative financial instruments, commodity futures, 
commodity forwards, commodity swaps, commodity options, and other 
commodity instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by 
contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another 
financial instrument. For purposes of this paragraph, settlement in cash 
includes settlement in cash of the net change in value of the derivative 
commodity instrument (e.g., net cash settlement based on changes in the 
price of the underlying commodity).
    2. For purposes of paragraphs (n)(2), (n)(3), (n)(4), and (n)(7), 
the required disclosures should address separately derivatives entered 
into for trading purposes and derivatives entered into for purposes 
other than trading. For purposes of this paragraph, trading purposes has 
the same meaning as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
(see, e.g., FAS 119, paragraph 9a (October 1994)).
    3. For purposes of paragraph (n)(6), anticipated transactions means 
transactions (other than transactions involving existing assets or 
liabilities or transactions necessitated by existing firm commitments) 
an enterprise expects, but is not obligated, to carry out in the normal 
course of business (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 80, ``Accounting for Futures Contracts,'' paragraph 9, 
(August 1984)).
    4. Registrants should provide disclosures required under paragraph 
(n) in filings with the Commission that include financial statements of 
fiscal periods ending after June 15, 1997.

<R05>
Sec. 210.4-10  Financial accounting and reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and 
          Conservation Act of 1975.

    This section prescribes financial accounting and reporting standards 
for registrants with the Commission engaged in oil and gas producing 
activities in filings under the Federal securities laws and for the 
preparation of accounts by persons engaged, in whole or in part, in the 
production of crude oil or natural gas in the United States, pursuant to 
section 503 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 
6383) (EPCA) and section 11(c) of the Energy Supply and Environmental 
Coordination Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 796) (ESECA), as amended by section 
505 of EPCA. The application of this section to those oil and gas 
producing operations of companies regulated for ratemaking purposes on 
an individual-company-cost-of-service basis may, however, give 
appropriate recognition to differences arising because of the effect of 
the ratemaking process.

Exemption. Any person exempted by the Department of Energy from any 
record-keeping or reporting requirements pursuant to section 11(c) of 
ESECA, as amended, is similarly exempted from the related provisions of 
this section in the preparation of accounts pursuant to EPCA. This 
exemption does not affect the applicability of this section to filings 
pursuant to the Federal securities laws.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply to the terms listed 
below as they are used in this section:
    (1) Oil and gas producing activities. (i) Such activities include:
    (A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas 
liquids, or natural gas (oil and gas) in their natural states and 
original locations.
    (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose 
of further exploration and/or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas 
from existing reservoirs on those properties.
    (C) The construction, drilling and production activities necessary 
to retrieve oil and gas from its natural reservoirs, and the 
acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field 
gathering and storage systems--including lifting the oil and gas to the 
surface and gathering, treating, field processing (as in the case of 
processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons) and field storage. For 
purposes of this section, the oil and gas production function shall 
normally be regarded as terminating at the outlet valve on the lease or 
field storage tank; if unusual physical or operational circumstances 
exist, it may be appropriate to regard the production functions as 
terminating at the first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids are 
delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine 
terminal.
    (ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include:
    (A) The transporting, refining and marketing of oil and gas.
    (B) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other 
than oil and gas.
    (C) The production of geothermal steam or the extraction of 
hydrocarbons as a by-product of the production of geothermal steam or 
associated geothermal resources as defined in the Geothermal Steam Act 
of 1970.
    (D) The extraction of hydrocarbons from shale, tar sands, or coal.
    (2) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are the 
estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids 
which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable 
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under 
existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of 
the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes 
in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on 
escalations based upon future conditions.
    (i) Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is 
supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test. The 
area of a reservoir considered proved includes (A) that portion 
delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water contacts, 
if any, and (B) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but 
which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis 
of available geological and engineering data. In the absence of 
information on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of 
hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir.
    (ii) Reserves which can be produced economically through application 
of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included 
in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project, 
or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides 
support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was 
based.
    (iii) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following: (A) 
Oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified 
separately as indicated additional reserves; (B) crude oil, natural gas, 
and natural gas liquids, the recovery of which is subject to reasonable 
doubt because of uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics, 
or economic factors; (C) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas 
liquids, that may occur in undrilled prospects; and (D) crude oil, 
natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may be recovered from oil 
shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.
    (3) Proved developed oil and gas reserves. Proved developed oil and 
gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through 
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional 
oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid 
injection or other improved recovery techniques for

[[Page 288]]

supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery 
should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a 
pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has 
confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be 
achieved.
    (4) Proved undeveloped reserves. Proved undeveloped oil and gas 
reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells 
on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major 
expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage 
shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units 
that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves 
for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be 
demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from 
the existing productive formation. Under no circumstances should 
estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage 
for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery 
technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved 
effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
    (5) Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves.
    (6) Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.
    (7) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves 
have been specifically attributed.
    (8) Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple 
reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological 
structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or 
more reservoirs in a field that are separated vertically by intervening 
impervious, strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. 
Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent 
fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The 
geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are 
intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the 
broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, 
etc.
    (9) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation 
containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is 
confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and 
separate from other reservoirs.
    (10) Exploratory well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or gas 
in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found 
to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir, or to extend a 
known reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not 
a development well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as 
those items are defined below.
    (11) Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an 
oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be 
productive.
    (12) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of 
supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service 
wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air 
injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, 
or injection for in-situ combustion.
    (13) Stratigraphic test well. A drilling effort, geologically 
directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic 
condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intention of 
being completed for hydrocarbon production. This classification also 
includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable 
holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic test wells are 
classified as (i) exploratory-type, if not drilled in a proved area, or 
(ii) development-type, if drilled in a proved area.
    (14) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or 
otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and 
options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable 
to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, 
brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in 
acquiring properties.
    (15) Exploration costs. Costs incurred in identifying areas that may 
warrant examination and in examining specific

[[Page 289]]

areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas 
reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-
type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both 
before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as 
prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of 
exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating 
costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration 
activities, are:
    (i) Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, 
rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries 
and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others 
conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to 
as geological and geophysical or G&G costs.
    (ii) Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as 
delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title 
defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records.
    (iii) Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions.
    (iv) Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells.
    (v) Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells.
    (16) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved 
reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering 
and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, 
including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support 
equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are 
costs incurred to:
    (i) Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, 
including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining 
specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road 
building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to 
the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves.
    (ii) Drill and equip development wells, development-type 
stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of 
platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping 
equipment, and the wellhead assembly.
    (iii) Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as 
lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring 
devices, and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and 
processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems.
    (iv) Provide improved recovery systems.
    (17) Production costs. (i) Costs incurred to operate and maintain 
wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and 
applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other 
costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and 
facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. 
Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are:
    (A) Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and 
facilities.
    (B) Repairs and maintenance.
    (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in 
operating the wells and related equipment and facilities.
    (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and 
wells and related equipment and facilities.
    (E) Severance taxes.
    (ii) Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil 
and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, 
refining, and marketing activities. To the extent that the support 
equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, 
their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, 
development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, 
depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and 
development costs are not production costs but also become part of the 
cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs 
identified above.

                        Successful Efforts Method

    (b) A reporting entity that follows the successful efforts method 
shall comply with the accounting and financial reporting disclosure 
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, as 
amended.

[[Page 290]]

                            Full Cost Method

    (c) Application of the full cost method of accounting. A reporting 
entity that follows the full cost method shall apply that method to all 
of its operations and to the operations of its subsidiaries, as follows:
    (1) Determination of cost centers. Cost centers shall be established 
on a country-by-country basis.
    (2) Costs to be capitalized. All costs associated with property 
acquisition, exploration, and development activities (as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section) shall be capitalized within the 
appropriate cost center. Any internal costs that are capitalized shall 
be limited to those costs that can be directly identified with 
acquisition, exploration, and development activities undertaken by the 
reporting entity for its own account, and shall not include any costs 
related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar 
activities.
    (3) Amortization of capitalized costs. Capitalized costs within a 
cost center shall be amortized on the unit-of-production basis using 
proved oil and gas reserves, as follows:
    (i) Costs to be amortized shall include (A) all capitalized costs, 
less accumulated amortization, other than the cost of properties 
described in paragraph (ii) below; (B) the estimated future expenditures 
(based on current costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves; 
and (C) estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated 
salvage values.
    (ii) The cost of investments in unproved properties and major 
development projects may be excluded from capitalized costs to be 
amortized, subject to the following:
    (A) All costs directly associated with the acquisition and 
evaluation of unproved properties may be excluded from the amortization 
computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be 
assigned to the properties, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Until such a determination is made, the properties shall be 
assessed at least annually to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. 
Unevaluated properties whose costs are individually significant shall be 
assessed individually. Where it is not practicable to individually 
assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not 
individually significant, such properties may be grouped for purposes of 
assessing impairment. Impairment may be estimated by applying factors 
based on historical experience and other data such as primary lease 
terms of the properties, average holding periods of unproved properties, 
and geographic and geologic data to groupings of individually 
insignificant properties and projects. The amount of impairment assessed 
under either of these methods shall be added to the costs to be 
amortized.
    (2) The costs of drilling exploratory dry holes shall be included in 
the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is 
dry.
    (3) If geological and geophysical costs cannot be directly 
associated with specific unevaluated properties, they shall be included 
in the amortization base as incurred. Upon complete evaluation of a 
property, the total remaining excluded cost (net of any impairment) 
shall be included in the full cost amortization base.
    (B) Certain costs may be excluded from amortization when incurred in 
connection with major development projects expected to entail 
significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves 
attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation 
of an offshore drilling platform from which development wells are to be 
drilled, the installation of improved recovery programs, and similar 
major projects undertaken in the expectation of significant additions to 
proved reserves). The amounts which may be excluded are applicable 
portions of (1) the costs that relate to the major development project 
and have not previously been included in the amortization base, and (2) 
the estimated future expenditures associated with the development 
project. The excluded portion of any common costs associated with the 
development project should be based, as is most appropriate in the 
circumstances, on a comparison of either (i) existing proved reserves to 
total proved reserves expected to be established upon completion of the 
project, or (ii) the number of wells to which

[[Page 291]]

proved reserves have been assigned and total number of wells expected to 
be drilled. Such costs may be excluded from costs to be amortized until 
the earlier determination of whether additional reserves are proved or 
impairment occurs.
    (C) Excluded costs and the proved reserves related to such costs 
shall be transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing (well-by-
well or property-by-property) basis as the project is evaluated and 
proved reserves established or impairment determined. Once proved 
reserves are established, there is no further justification for 
continued exclusion from the full cost amortization base even if other 
factors prevent immediate production or marketing.
    (iii) Amortization shall be computed on the basis of physical units, 
with oil and gas converted to a common unit of measure on the basis of 
their approximate relative energy content, unless economic circumstances 
(related to the effects of regulated prices) indicate that use of units 
of revenue is a more appropriate basis of computing amortization. In the 
latter case, amortization shall be computed on the basis of current 
gross revenues (excluding royalty payments and net profits 
disbursements) from production in relation to future gross revenues, 
based on current prices (including consideration of changes in existing 
prices provided only by contractual arrangements), from estimated 
production of proved oil and gas reserves. The effect of a significant 
price increase during the year on estimated future gross revenues shall 
be reflected in the amortization provision only for the period after the 
price increase occurs.
    (iv) In some cases it may be more appropriate to depreciate natural 
gas cycling and processing plants by a method other than the unit-of-
production method.
    (v) Amortization computations shall be made on a consolidated basis, 
including investees accounted for on a proportionate consolidation 
basis. Investees accounted for on the equity method shall be treated 
separately.
    (4) Limitation on capitalized costs. (i) For each cost center, 
capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred 
income taxes, shall not exceed an amount (the cost center ceiling) equal 
to the sum of:
    (A) The present value of estimated future net revenues computed by 
applying current prices of oil and gas reserves (with consideration of 
price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) 
to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the 
date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future 
expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and 
producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of ten 
percent and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions; plus
    (B) the cost of properties not being amortized pursuant to paragraph 
(i)(3)(ii) of this section; plus
    (C) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties 
included in the costs being amortized; less
    (D) income tax effects related to differences between the book and 
tax basis of the properties referred to in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) (B) and 
(C) of this section.
    (ii) If unamortized costs capitalized within a cost center, less 
related deferred income taxes, exceed the cost center ceiling, the 
excess shall be charged to expense and separately disclosed during the 
period in which the excess occurs. Amounts thus required to be written 
off shall not be reinstated for any subsequent increase in the cost 
center ceiling.
    (5) Production costs. All costs relating to production activities, 
including workover costs incurred solely to maintain or increase levels 
of production from an existing completion interval, shall be charged to 
expense as incurred.
    (6) Other transactions. The provisions of paragraph (h) of this 
section, ``Mineral property conveyances and related transactions if the 
successful efforts method of accounting is followed,'' shall apply also 
to those reporting entities following the full cost method except as 
follows:
    (i) Sales and abandonments of oil and gas properties. Sales of oil 
and gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, shall be 
accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no

[[Page 292]]

gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly 
alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of 
oil and gas attributable to a cost center. For instance, a significant 
alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur for sales involving 
less than 25 percent of the reserve quantities of a given cost center. 
If gain or loss is recognized on such a sale, total capitalization costs 
within the cost center shall be allocated between the reserves sold and 
reserves retained on the same basis used to compute amortization, unless 
there are substantial economic differences between the properties sold 
and those retained, in which case capitalized costs shall be allocated 
on the basis of the relative fair values of the properties. Abandonments 
of oil and gas properties shall be accounted for as adjustments of 
capitalized costs; that is, the cost of abandoned properties shall be 
charged to the full cost center and amortized (subject to the limitation 
on capitalized costs in paragraph (b) of this section).
    (ii) Purchases of reserves. Purchases of oil and gas reserves in 
place ordinarily shall be accounted for as additional capitalized costs 
within the applicable cost center; however, significant purchases of 
production payments or properties with lives substantially shorter than 
the composite productive life of the cost center shall be accounted for 
separately.
    (iii) Partnerships, joint ventures and drilling arrangements. (A) 
Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section, all 
consideration received from sales or transfers of properties in 
connection with partnerships, joint venture operations, or various other 
forms of drilling arrangements involving oil and gas exploration and 
development activities (e.g., carried interest, turnkey wells, 
management fees, etc.) shall be credited to the full cost account, 
except to the extent of amounts that represent reimbursement of 
organization, offering, general and administrative expenses, etc., that 
are identifiable with the transaction, if such amounts are currently 
incurred and charged to expense.
    (B) Where a registrant organizes and manages a limited partnership 
involved only in the purchase of proved developed properties and 
subsequent distribution of income from such properties, management fee 
income may be recognized provided the properties involved do not require 
aggregate development expenditures in connection with production of 
existing proved reserves in excess of 10% of the partnership's recorded 
cost of such properties. Any income not recognized as a result of this 
limitation would be credited to the full cost account and recognized 
through a lower amortization provision as reserves are produced.
    (iv) Other services. No income shall be recognized in connection 
with contractual services performed (e.g. drilling, well service, or 
equipment supply services, etc.) in connection with properties in which 
the registrant or an affiliate (as defined in Sec. 210.1-02(b)) holds 
an ownership or other economic interest, except as follows:
    (A) Where the registrant acquires an interest in the properties in 
connection with the service contract, income may be recognized to the 
extent the cash consideration received exceeds the related contract 
costs plus the registrant's share of costs incurred and estimated to be 
incurred in connection with the properties. Ownership interests acquired 
within one year of the date of such a contract are considered to be 
acquired in connection with the service for purposes of applying this 
rule. The amount of any guarantees or similar arrangements undertaken as 
part of this contract should be considered as part of the costs related 
to the properties for purposes of applying this rule.
    (B) Where the registrant acquired an interest in the properties at 
least one year before the date of the service contract through 
transactions unrelated to the service contract, and that interest is 
unaffected by the service contract, income from such contract may be 
recognized subject to the general provisions for elimination of inter-
company profit under generally accepted accounting principles.
    (C) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (i)(6)(iv) (A) and 
(B) of this section, no income may be recognized for contractual 
services performed on

[[Page 293]]

behalf of investors in oil and gas producing activities managed by the 
registrant or an affiliate. Furthermore, no income may be recognized for 
contractual services to the extent that the consideration received for 
such services represents an interest in the underlying property.
    (D) Any income not recognized as a result of these rules would be 
credited to the full cost account and recognized through a lower 
amortization provision as reserves are produced.
    (7) Disclosures. Reporting entities that follow the full cost method 
of accounting shall disclose all of the information required by 
paragraph (k) of this section, with each cost center considered as a 
separate geographic area, except that reasonable groupings may be made 
of cost centers that are not significant in the aggregate. In addition:
    (i) For each cost center for each year that an income statement is 
required, disclose the total amount of amortization expense (per 
equivalent physical unit of production if amortization is computed on 
the basis of physical units or per dollar of gross revenue from 
production if amortization is computed on the basis of gross revenue).
    (ii) State separately on the face of the balance sheet the aggregate 
of the capitalized costs of unproved properties and major development 
projects that are excluded, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3) of this 
section, from the capitalized costs being amortized. Provide a 
description in the notes to the financial statements of the current 
status of the significant properties or projects involved, including the 
anticipated timing of the inclusion of the costs in the amortization 
computation. Present a table that shows, by category of cost, (A) the 
total costs excluded as of the most recent fiscal year; and (B) the 
amounts of such excluded costs, incurred (1) in each of the three most 
recent fiscal years and (2) in the aggregate for any earlier fiscal 
years in which the costs were incurred. Categories of cost to be 
disclosed include acquisition costs, exploration costs, development 
costs in the case of significant development projects and capitalized 
interest.

                              Income Taxes

    (d) Income taxes. Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation by 
a method which complies with generally accepted accounting principles 
shall be followed for intangible drilling and development costs and 
other costs incurred that enter into the determination of taxable income 
and pretax accounting income in different periods.

    (2) Analogous reservoir. Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources 
assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir 
conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but 
are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir 
of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the 
interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When 
used to support proved reserves, an ``analogous reservoir'' refers to a 
reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir 
of interest:
    (i) Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure 
communication with the reservoir of interest);
    (ii) Same environment of deposition;
    (iii) Similar geological structure; and
    (iv) Same drive mechanism.
     Instruction to paragraph (a)(2): Reservoir properties must, in the 
aggregate, be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of 
interest.
    (3) Bitumen. Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is 
petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a 
viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise measured at original 
temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free 
basis. In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and 
other non-hydrocarbons.
    (4) Condensate. Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists 
in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but 
that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and 
temperature.
    (5) Deterministic estimate. The method of estimating reserves or 
resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter 
(from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves 
calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure.
    (6) Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed oil and gas reserves 
are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
    (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating 
methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively 
minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
    (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure 
operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by 
means not involving a well.

                                * * * * *

    (8) Development project. A development project is the means by which 
petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically 
producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, 
an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated 
development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with 
a common ownership may constitute a development project.

                                * * * * *

    (10) Economically producible. The term economically producible, as 
it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that 
exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the 
operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be 
determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as 
defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section.
    (11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Estimated ultimate recovery 
is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative 
production as of that date.

                                * * * * *

    (13) Exploratory well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find 
a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be 
productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory 
well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a 
service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in 
this section.
    (14) Extension well. An extension well is a well drilled to extend 
the limits of a known reservoir.

                                * * * * *

    (16) Oil and gas producing activities. (i) Oil and gas producing 
activities include:
    (A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas 
liquids, or natural gas (``oil and gas'') in their natural states and 
original locations;
    (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose 
of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas 
from such properties;
    (C) The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary 
to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the 
acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field 
gathering and storage systems, such as:
    (1) Lifting the oil and gas to the surface; and
    (2) Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of 
processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and
    (D) Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or 
gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable 
natural resources which are intended to be

[[Page 295]]

upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a 
view to such extraction.
     Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): The oil and gas production 
function shall be regarded as ending at a ``terminal point'', which is 
the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. If unusual physical 
or operational circumstances exist, it may be appropriate to regard the 
terminal point for the production function as:
    a. The first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids, natural or 
synthetic, are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a 
refinery, or a marine terminal; and
    b. In the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded 
into synthetic oil or gas, if those natural resources are delivered to a 
purchaser prior to upgrading, the first point at which the natural 
resources are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a 
refinery, a marine terminal, or a facility which upgrades such natural 
resources into synthetic oil or gas.
     Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): For purposes of this 
paragraph (a)(16), the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons 
that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered.
    (ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include:
    (A) Transporting, refining, or marketing oil and gas;
    (B) Processing of produced oil, gas or natural resources that can be 
upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have 
the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production;
    (C) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other 
than oil, gas, or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can 
be extracted; or
    (D) Production of geothermal steam.
    (17) Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional 
reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
    (i) When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities 
ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding 
proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods 
are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total 
quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus 
probable plus possible reserves estimates.
    (ii) Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir 
adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of 
available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be 
in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define 
clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the 
reservoir by a defined project.
    (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental quantities 
associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in 
place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
    (iv) The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible 
reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and 
commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that 
are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful 
similar projects.
    (v) Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and 
engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir 
within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by 
faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other 
geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a 
wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in 
communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may 
be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the 
proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved 
reservoir.
    (vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where 
direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and 
the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves 
should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir 
above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with 
reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the 
reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be 
assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid 
properties and pressure gradient interpretations.
    (18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional 
reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but 
which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be 
recovered.
    (i) When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that 
actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated 
proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, 
there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities 
recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves 
estimates.
    (ii) Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir 
adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of 
available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir 
continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable 
certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are 
structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in 
communication with the proved reservoir.

[[Page 296]]

    (iii) Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental 
quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the 
hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
    (iv) See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) 
of this section.
    (19) Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or 
resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that 
could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience 
and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible 
outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence.

                                * * * * *

    (22) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are 
those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and 
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be 
economically producible--from a given date forward, from known 
reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, 
and government regulations--prior to the time at which contracts 
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that 
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or 
probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to 
extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be 
reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable 
time.
    (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
    (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, 
if any, and
    (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with 
reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain 
economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience 
and engineering data.
    (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in 
a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen 
in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance 
data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable 
certainty.
    (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a 
highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an 
associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the 
structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, 
engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the 
higher contact with reasonable certainty.
    (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application 
of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid 
injection) are included in the proved classification when:
    (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the 
reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a 
whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an 
analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology 
establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on 
which the project or program was based; and
    (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary 
parties and entities, including governmental entities.
    (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which 
economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price 
shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the 
ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an 
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for 
each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual 
arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

                                * * * * *

    (24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, 
reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the 
quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there 
should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence 
exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, 
as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, 
geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made 
to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR 
is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
    (25) Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one 
or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been 
field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain 
results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being 
evaluated or in an analogous formation.
    (26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil 
and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically 
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects 
to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be 
a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to 
produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of 
delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits 
and financing required to implement the project.
    Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to 
adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until 
those reservoirs are penetrated and

[[Page 297]]

evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to 
areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-
productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low 
reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective 
resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered 
accumulations).

                                * * * * *

    (28) Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to 
exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources 
may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be 
considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and 
undiscovered accumulations.

                                * * * * *

    (30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a 
drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining 
to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled 
without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The 
classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all 
types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. 
Stratigraphic tests are classified as ``exploratory type'' if not 
drilled in a known area or ``development type'' if drilled in a known 
area.
    (31) Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas 
reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered 
from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a 
relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
    (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly 
offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of 
production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology 
exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility 
at greater distances.
    (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped 
reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that 
they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific 
circumstances, justify a longer time.
    (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped 
reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of 
fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, 
unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in 
the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology 
establishing reasonable certainty.

                                * * * * *

    (c) * * *
    (8) For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``current price'' 
shall mean the average price during the 12-month period prior to the 
ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an 
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for 
each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual 
arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Sec. 210.5-02  Balance sheets.

    The purpose of this rule is to indicate the various line items and 
certain additional disclosures which, if applicable, and except as 
otherwise permitted by the Commission, should appear on the face of the 
balance sheets or related notes filed for the persons to whom this 
article pertains (see Sec. 210.4-01(a)).

                         Assets and Other Debits

                    Current Assets, when appropriate

                          [See Sec. 210.4-05]

    1. Cash and cash items. Separate disclosure shall be made of the 
cash and cash items which are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. The 
provisions of any restrictions shall be described in a note to the 
financial

[[Page 298]]

statements. Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits held as 
compensating balances against short-term borrowing arrangements, 
contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention 
with regard to particular deposits; however, time deposits and short-
term certificates of deposit are not generally included in legally 
restricted deposits. In cases where compensating balance arrangements 
exist but are not agreements which legally restrict the use of cash 
amounts shown on the balance sheet, describe in the notes to the 
financial statements these arrangements and the amount involved, if 
determinable, for the most recent audited balance sheet required and for 
any subsequent unaudited balance sheet required in the notes to the 
financial statements. Compensating balances that are maintained under an 
agreement to assure future credit availability shall be disclosed in the 
notes to the financial statements along with the amount and terms of 
such agreement.
    2. Marketable securities. The accounting and disclosure requirements 
for current marketable equity securities are specified by generally 
accepted accounting principles. With respect to all other current 
marketable securities, state, parenthetically or otherwise, the basis of 
determining the aggregate amount shown in the balance sheet, along with 
the alternatives of the aggregate cost or the aggregate market value at 
the balance sheet date.
    3. Accounts and notes receivable. (a) State separately amounts 
receivable from (1) customers (trade); (2) related parties (see Sec. 
210.4-08(k)); (3) underwriters, promoters, and employees (other than 
related parties) which arose in other than the ordinary course of 
business; and (4) others.
    (b) If the aggregate amount of notes receivable exceeds 10 percent 
of the aggregate amount of receivables, the above information shall be 
set forth separately, in the balance sheet or in a note thereto, for 
accounts receivable and notes receivable.
    (c) If receivables include amounts due under long-term contracts 
(see Sec. 210.5-02.6(d)), state separately in the balance sheet or in a 
note to the financial statements the following amounts:
    (1) Balances billed but not paid by customers under retainage 
provisions in contracts.
    (2) Amounts representing the recognized sales value of performance 
and such amounts that had not been billed and were not billable to 
customers at the date of the balance sheet. Include a general 
description of the prerequisites for billing.
    (3) Billed or unbilled amounts representing claims or other similar 
items subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate 
realization. Include a description of the nature and status of the 
principal items comprising such amount.
    (4) With respect to (1) through (3) above, also state the amounts 
included in each item which are expected to be collected after one year. 
Also state, by year, if practicable, when the amounts of retainage (see 
(1) above) are expected to be collected.
    4. Allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable. The amount 
is to be set forth separately in the balance sheet or in a note thereto.
    5. Unearned income.
    6. Inventories. (a) State separately in the balance sheet or in a 
note thereto, if practicable, the amounts of major classes of inventory 
such as: (1) Finished goods; (2) inventoried costs relating to long-term 
contracts or programs (see (d) below and Sec. 210.4-05); (3) work in 
process (see Sec. 210.4-05); (4) raw materials; and (5) supplies. If 
the method of calculating a LIFO inventory does not allow for the 
practical determination of amounts assigned to major classes of 
inventory, the amounts of those classes may be stated under cost flow 
assumptions other that LIFO with the excess of such total amount over 
the agggregate LIFO amount shown as a deduction to arrive at the amount 
of the LIFO inventory.
    (b) The basis of determining the amounts shall be stated.
    If cost is used to determine any portion of the inventory amounts, 
the description of this method shall include the nature of the cost 
elements included in inventory. Elements of cost include, among other 
items, retained costs representing the excess of manufacturing or 
production costs over the amounts charged to cost of sales or delivered 
or in-process units, initial tooling or other deferred startup costs, or 
general and administrative costs.
    The method by which amounts are removed from inventory (e.g., 
average cost, first-in, first-out, last-in, first-out, estimated average 
cost per unit) shall be described. If the estimated average cost per 
unit is used as a basis to determine amounts removed from inventory 
under a total program or similar basis of accounting, the principal 
assumptions (including, where meaningful, the aggregate number of units 
expected to be delivered under the program, the number of units 
delivered to date and the number of units on order) shall be disclosed.
    If any general and administrative costs are charged to inventory, 
state in a note to the financial statements the aggregate amount of the 
general and administrative costs incurred in each period and the actual 
or estimated amount remaining in inventory at the date of each balance 
sheet.
    (c) If the LIFO inventory method is used, the excess of replacement 
or current cost over stated LIFO value shall, if material, be

[[Page 299]]

stated parenthetically or in a note to the financial statements.
    (d) For purposes of Sec. Sec. 210.5-02.3 and 210.5-02.6, long-term 
contracts or programs include (1) all contracts or programs for which 
gross profits are recognized on a percentage-of-completion method of 
accounting or any variant thereof (e.g., delivered unit, cost to cost, 
physical completion), and (2) any contracts or programs accounted for on 
a completed contract basis of accounting where, in either case, the 
contracts or programs have associated with them material amounts of 
inventories or unbilled receivables and where such contracts or programs 
have been or are expected to be performed over a period of more than 
twelve months. Contracts or programs of shorter duration may also be 
included, if deemed appropriate.
    For all long-term contracts or programs, the following information, 
if applicable, shall be stated in a note to the financial statements:
    (i) The aggregate amount of manufacturing or production costs and 
any related deferred costs (e.g., initial tooling costs) which exceeds 
the aggregate estimated cost of all in-process and delivered units on 
the basis of the estimated average cost of all units expected to be 
produced under long-term contracts and programs not yet complete, as 
well as that portion of such amount which would not be absorbed in cost 
of sales based on existing firm orders at the latest balance sheet date. 
In addition, if practicable, disclose the amount of deferred costs by 
type of cost (e.g., initial tooling, deferred production, etc.).
    (ii) The aggregate amount representing claims or other similar items 
subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate 
realization, and include a description of the nature and status of the 
principal items comprising such aggregate amount.
    (iii) The amount of progress payments netted against inventory at 
the date of the balance sheet.
    7. Prepaid expenses.
    8. Other current assets. State separately, in the balance sheet or 
in a note thereto, any amounts in excess of five percent of total 
current assets.
    9. Total current assets, when appropriate.
    10. Securities of related parties. (See Sec. 210.4-08(k).)
    11. Indebtedness of related parties--not current. (See Sec. 210.4-
08(k).)
    12. Other investments. The accounting and disclosure requirements 
for non-current marketable equity securities are specified by generally 
accepted accounting principles. With respect to other security 
investments and any other investment, state, parenthetically or 
otherwise, the basis of determining the aggregate amounts shown in the 
balance sheet, along with the alternate of the aggregate cost or 
aggregate market value at the balance sheet date.
    13. Property, plant and equipment.
    (a) State the basis of determining the amounts.
    (b) Tangible and intangible utility plant of a public utility 
company shall be segregated so as to show separately the original cost, 
plant acquisition adjustments, and plant adjustments, as required by the 
system of accounts prescribed by the applicable regulatory authorities. 
This rule shall not be applicable in respect to companies which are not 
required to make such a classification.
    14. Accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization of 
property, plant and equipment. The amount is to be set forth separately 
in the balance sheet or in a note thereto.
    15. Intangible assets. State separately each class of such assets 
which is in excess of five percent of the total assets, along with the 
basis of determining the respective amounts. Any significant addition or 
deletion shall be explained in a note.
    16. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. 
The amount is to be set forth separately in the balance sheet or in a 
note thereto.
    17. Other assets. State separately, in the balance sheet or in a 
note thereto, any other item not properly classed in one of the 
preceding asset captions which is in excess of five percent to total 
assets. Any significant addition or deletion should be explained in a 
note. With respect to any significant deferred charge, state the policy 
for deferral and amortization.
    18. Total assets.

                  Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity

       Current Liabilities, When Appropriate (See Sec. 210.4-05)

    19. Accounts and notes payable. (a) State separately amounts payable 
to (1) banks for borrowings; (2) factors or other financial institutions 
for borrowings; (3) holders of commercial paper; (4) trade creditors; 
(5) related parties (see Sec. 210.4-08(k)); (6) underwriters, 
promoters, and employees (other than related parties); and (7) others. 
Amounts applicable to (1), (2) and (3) may be stated separately in the 
balance sheet or in a note thereto.
    (b) The amount and terms (including commitment fees and the 
conditions under which lines may be withdrawn) of unused lines of credit 
for short-term financing shall be disclosed, if significant, in the 
notes to the financial statements. The weighted average interest rate on 
short term borrowings outstanding as of the date of each balance sheet 
presented shall be furnished in a note. The amount of these lines of 
credit which support a commercial paper borrowing arrangement or similar 
arrangements shall be separately identified.

[[Page 300]]

    20. Other current liabilities. State separately, in the balance 
sheet or in a note thereto, any item in excess of 5 percent of total 
current liabilities. Such items may include, but are not limited to, 
accrued payrolls, accrued interest, taxes, indicating the current 
portion of deferred income taxes, and the current portion of long-term 
debt. Remaining items may be shown in one amount.
    21. Total current liabilities, when appropriate.

                             Long-Term Debt

    22. Bonds, mortgages and other long-term debt, including capitalized 
leases. (a) State separately, in the balance sheet or in a note thereto, 
each issue or type of obligation and such information as will indicate 
(see Sec. 210.4-06):

Sec. 210.5-04  What schedules are to be filed.

    (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in the applicable form:
    (1) The schedules specified below in this Section as Schedules II 
and III shall be filed as of the date of the most recent audited 
balanced sheet for each person or group.
    (2) Schedule II shall be filed for each period for which an audited 
income statement is required to be filed for each person or group.
    (3) Schedules I and IV shall be filed as of the date and for periods 
specified in the schedule.
    (b) When information is required in schedules for both the 
registrant and the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated it may 
be presented in the form of a single schedule: Provided, That items 
pertaining to the registrant are separately shown and that such single 
schedule affords a properly summarized presentation of the facts. If the 
information required by any schedule (including the notes thereto) may 
be shown in the related financial statement or in a note thereto without 
making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be 
followed and the schedule omitted.
    (c) The schedules shall be examined by the independent accountant if 
the related financial statements are so examined.

    Schedule I--Condensed financial information of registrant. The 
schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be filed when the 
restricted net assets (Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3)) of consolidated 
subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets as of the end 
of the most recently completed fiscal year. For purposes of the above 
test, restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that 
amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of 
the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the 
parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash 
dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory 
agency, foreign government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of 
funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted 
as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least 
restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks 
(Sec. 210.5-02.28) and minority interests shall be deducted in 
computing net assets for purposes of this test.
    Schedule II--Valuation and qualifying accounts. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-09 shall be filed in support of valuation and 
qualifying accounts included in each balance sheet but not included in 
Schedule VI. (See Sec. 210.4-02.)
    Schedule III--Real estate and accumulated depreciation. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-28 shall be filed for real estate (and the 
related accumulated depreciation) held by persons a substantial portion 
of whose business is that of acquiring and holding for investment real 
estate or interests in real estate, or interests in other persons a 
substantial portion of whose business is that of acquiring and holding 
real estate or interests in real estate for investment. Real estate

[[Page 303]]

used in the business shall be excluded from the schedule.
    Schedule IV--Mortgage loans on real estate. The schedule prescribed 
by Sec. 210.12-29 shall be filed by persons specified under Schedule XI 
for investments in mortgage loans on real estate.
    Schedule V--Supplemental Information Concerning Property-casualty 
Insurance Operations. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-18 shall 
be filed when a registrant, its subsidiaries or 50%-or-less-owned equity 
basis investees, have liabilities for property-casualty (``P/C'') 
insurance claims. The required information shall be presented as of the 
same dates and for the same periods for which the information is 
reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements required by 
Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02. The schedule may be omitted if reserves 
for unpaid P/C claims and claims adjustment expenses of the registrant 
and its consolidated subsidiaries, its unconsolidated subsidiaries and 
its 50%-or-less-owned equity basis investees did not, in the aggregate, 
exceed one-half of common stockholders' equity of the registrant and its 
consolidated subsidiaries as of the beginning of the fiscal year. For 
purposes of this test only the proportionate share of the registrant and 
its other subsidiaries in the reserves for unpaid claims and claim 
adjustment expenses of 50%-or-less-owned equity basis investees taken in 
the aggregate after intercompany eliminations shall be taken into 
account.

Revenue Code, as amended, shall be stated in a note referred to in the 
appropriate statements. Such note shall also indicate briefly the 
principal assumptions on which the company relied in making or not 
making provisions for income taxes. However, a company which retains 
realized capital gains and designates such gains as a distribution to 
shareholders in accordance with section 852(b)(3)(D) of the Internal 
Revenue Code shall, on the last day of its taxable year (and not 
earlier), make provision for taxes on such undistributed capital gains

shall, in the case of a person which in essence is comprised of more 
than one separate investment company, be given as if each class or 
series of such investment company were a separate investment company;

information applicable to other classes or series of such person on a 
comparative basis, except as to footnotes which need not be comparative.
    (2) If the particular class or series for which information is

(or such other rate as may be appropriate under the circumstances of a 
particular case) compounded annually, shall provide the minimum maturity 
or face amount of the certificate when due.
    (ii) For certificates of the fully-paid type, such amount which, as 
and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3\1/2\ per centum per annum 
(or such other rate as may be appropriate under the circumstances of a 
particular case) compounded annually, shall provide the amount or 
amounts payable when due.

to the account of any certificate holder in the form of any credit, or 
any dividend, or

[[Page 306]]

be shown in the related financial statement or in a note thereto without 
making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be 
followed and the schedule omitted.
    (c) The schedules shall be examined by the independent accountant.

    Schedule I--Summary of investments--other than investments in 
related parties. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-15 shall be 
filed in support of caption 1 of the most recent audited balance sheet.
    Schedule II--Condensed financial information of registrant. The 
schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be filed when the 
restricted net assets (Sec. 210.4.08(e)(3)) of consolidated 
subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets as of the end 
of the most recently completed fiscal year. For purposes of the above 
test, restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that 
amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of 
the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the 
parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash 
dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory 
agency, foreign government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of 
funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted 
as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least 
restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks 
(Sec. 210.7-03.21) and minority interests shall be deducted in 
computing net assets for purposes of this test.
    Schedule III--Supplementary insurance information. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-16 shall be filed giving segment detail in 
support of various balance sheet and income statement captions. The 
required balance sheet information shall be presented as of the date of 
each audited balance sheet filed, and the income statement information 
shall be presented for each period for which an audited income statement 
is required to be filed, for each person or group.
    Schedule IV--Reinsurance. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-17 
shall be filed for reinsurance ceded and assumed.
    Schedule V--Valuation and qualifying accounts. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-09 shall be filed in support of valuation and 
qualifying accounts included in the balance sheet (see Sec. 210.4-02).
    Schedule VI--Supplemental Information Concerning Property-Casualty 
Insurance Operations. The information required by Sec. 210.12-18 shall 
be presented as of the same dates and for the same periods for which the 
information is reflected in the audited consolidated financial 
statements required by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02. The schedule may be 
omitted if reserves for unpaid property-casualty claims and claim 
adjustment expenses of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries, 
its unconsolidated subsidiaries and its 50%-or-less-owned equity basis 
investees did not in the aggregate, exceed one-half of

[[Page 318]]

common stockholders' equity of the registrant and its consolidated 
subsidiaries as of the beginning of the fiscal year. For purposes of 
this test, only the proportionate share of the registrant and its other 
subsidiaries in the reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment 
expenses of 50%-or-less-owned equity investees taken in the aggregate 
after intercompany eliminations shall be taken into account. Article

      Article 8 Financial Statements of Smaller Reporting Companies

    Source: 73 FR 953, Jan. 4, 2008, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-01  Preliminary Notes to Article 8.

    Sections 210.8-01 to 210.8-08 shall be applicable to financial 
statements filed for smaller reporting companies. These sections are not 
applicable to financial statements prepared for the purposes of Item 17 
or Item 18 of Form 20-F.
    Note 1 to Sec. 210.8: Financial statements of a smaller reporting 
company, as defined by Sec. 229.10(f)(1) of this chapter, its 
predecessors or any businesses to which the smaller reporting company is 
a successor shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States.
    Note 2 to Sec. 210.8: Smaller reporting companies electing to 
prepare their financial statements with the form and content required in 
this article need not apply the other form and content requirements in 
Regulation S-X with the exception of the following:
    a. The report and qualifications of the independent accountant shall 
comply with the requirements of Article 2 of this part;
    b. The description of accounting policies shall comply with Article 
4-08(n) of this part; and
    c. Smaller reporting companies engaged in oil and gas producing 
activities shall follow the financial accounting and reporting standards 
specified in Article 4-10 of this part with respect to such activities.
    To the extent that Article 11-01 of this part (Pro Forma 
Presentation Requirements) offers enhanced guidelines for the 
preparation, presentation and disclosure of pro forma financial 
information, smaller reporting companies may wish to consider these 
items.
    Note 3 to Sec. 210.8: Financial statements for a subsidiary of a 
smaller reporting company that issues securities guaranteed by the 
smaller reporting company or guarantees securities issued by the smaller 
reporting company must be presented as required by Sec. 210.3-10, 
except that the periods presented are those required by Sec. 210.8-02.
    Note 4 to Sec. 210.8: Financial statements for a smaller reporting 
company's affiliates whose securities constitute a substantial portion 
of the collateral for any class of securities registered or being 
registered must be presented as required by Sec. 210.3-16, except that 
the periods presented are those required by Sec. 210.8-02.
    Note 5 to Sec. 210.8: The Commission, where consistent with the 
protection of investors, may permit the omission of one or more of the 
financial statements or the substitution of appropriate statements of 
comparable character. The Commission by informal written notice may 
require the filing of other financial statements where necessary or 
appropriate.
    Note 6 to Sec. 210.8: Section 210.4-01(a)(3) shall apply to the 
preparation of financial statements of smaller reporting companies.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-02  Annual financial statements.

    Smaller reporting companies shall file an audited balance sheet as 
of the end of each of the most recent two fiscal years, or as of a date 
within 135 days if the issuer has existed for a period of less than one 
fiscal year, and audited statements of income, cash flows and changes in 
stockholders' equity for each of the two fiscal years preceding the date 
of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as the 
registrant has been in business).


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-03  Interim financial statements.

    Interim financial statements may be unaudited; however, before 
filing, interim financial statements included in quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q (Sec. 249.308(a) of this chapter) must be reviewed by an 
independent public accountant using professional standards and 
procedures for conducting such reviews, as established by generally 
accepted auditing standards, as may be

[[Page 319]]

modified or supplemented by the Commission. If, in any filing, the 
issuer states that interim financial statements have been reviewed by an 
independent public accountant, a report of the accountant on the review 
must be filed with the interim financial statements. Interim financial 
statements shall include a balance sheet as of the end of the issuer's 
most recent fiscal quarter, a balance sheet as of the end of the 
preceding fiscal year, and income statements and statements of cash 
flows for the interim period up to the date of such balance sheet and 
the comparable period of the preceding fiscal year.
    (a) Condensed format. Interim financial statements may be condensed 
as follows:
    (1) Balance sheets should include separate captions for each balance 
sheet component presented in the annual financial statements that 
represents 10% or more of total assets. Cash and retained earnings 
should be presented regardless of relative significance to total assets. 
Registrants that present a classified balance sheet in their annual 
financial statements should present totals for current assets and 
current liabilities.
    (2) Income statements should include net sales or gross revenue, 
each cost and expense category presented in the annual financial 
statements that exceeds 20% of sales or gross revenues, provision for 
income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and 
cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles or practices. 
(Financial institutions should substitute net interest income for sales 
for purposes of determining items to be disclosed.) Dividends per share 
should be presented.
    (3) Cash flow statements should include cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities as well as cash at the beginning and 
end of each period and the increase or decrease in such balance.
    (4) Additional line items may be presented to facilitate the 
usefulness of the interim financial statements, including their 
comparability with annual financial statements.
    (b) Disclosure required and additional instructions as to content--
(1) Footnotes. Footnote and other disclosures should be provided as 
needed for fair presentation and to ensure that the financial statements 
are not misleading.
    (2) Material subsequent events and contingencies. Disclosure must be 
provided of material subsequent events and material contingencies 
notwithstanding disclosure in the annual financial statements.
    (3) Significant equity investees. Sales, gross profit, net income 
(loss) from continuing operations and net income must be disclosed for 
equity investees that constitute 20% or more of a registrant's 
consolidated assets, equity or income from continuing operations.
    (4) Significant dispositions and purchase business combinations. If 
a significant disposition or purchase business combination has occurred 
during the most recent interim period and the transaction required the 
filing of a Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), pro forma data 
must be presented that reflects revenue, income from continuing 
operations, net income and income per share for the current interim 
period and the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year 
as though the transaction occurred at the beginning of the periods.
    (5) Material accounting changes. Disclosure must be provided of the 
date and reasons for any material accounting change. The registrant's 
independent accountant must provide a letter in the first Form 10-Q 
(Sec. 249.308a of this chapter) filed after the change indicating 
whether or not the change is to a preferable method. Disclosure must be 
provided of any retroactive change to prior period financial statements, 
including the effect of any such change on income and income per share.
    (6) Development stage companies. A registrant in the development 
stage must provide cumulative financial information from inception.

    Instruction 1 to Sec. 210.8-03: Where Article 8 is applicable to a 
Form 10-Q and the interim period is more than one quarter, income 
statements must also be provided for the most recent interim quarter and 
the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year.
    Instruction 2 to Sec. 210.8-03: Interim financial statements must 
include all adjustments

[[Page 320]]

that, in the opinion of management, are necessary in order to make the 
financial statements not misleading. An affirmative statement that the 
financial statements have been so adjusted must be included with the 
interim financial statements.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-04  Financial statements of businesses acquired or to be acquired.

    (a) If a business combination accounted for as a ``purchase'' has 
occurred or is probable, financial statements of the business acquired 
or to be acquired shall be furnished for the periods specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) The term ``purchase'' encompasses the purchase of an interest in 
a business accounted for by the equity method.
    (2) Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable 
or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year end for which 
audited financial statements of the issuer have been filed shall be 
treated as if they are a single business combination for purposes of 
this section. The required financial statements of related businesses 
may be presented on a combined basis for any periods they are under 
common control or management. A group of businesses is deemed to be 
related if:
    (i) They are under common control or management;
    (ii) The acquisition of one business is conditioned on the 
acquisition of each other business; or
    (iii) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.
    (3) Annual financial statements required by this rule shall be 
audited. The form and content of the financial statements shall be in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 210.8-02 and 8-03.
    (b) The periods for which financial statements are to be presented 
are determined by comparison of the most recent annual financial 
statements of the business acquired or to be acquired and the smaller 
reporting company's most recent annual financial statements filed at or 
before the date of acquisition to evaluate each of the following 
conditions:
    (1) Compare the smaller reporting company's investments in and 
advances to the acquiree to the total consolidated assets of the smaller 
reporting company as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal 
year.
    (2) Compare the smaller reporting company's proportionate share of 
the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the acquiree to 
the total consolidated assets of the smaller reporting company as of the 
end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
    (3) Compare the smaller reporting company's equity in the income 
from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items and 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles of the acquiree 
to such consolidated income of the smaller reporting company for the 
most recently completed fiscal year.

    Computational note to Sec. 210.8-04(b): For purposes of making the 
prescribed income test the following guidance should be applied: If 
income of the smaller reporting company and its subsidiaries 
consolidated for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent 
lower than the average of the income for the last five fiscal years, 
such average income should be substituted for purposes of the 
computation. Any loss years should be omitted for purposes of computing 
average income.

    (c)(1) If none of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section exceeds 20%, financial statements are not required. If any of 
the conditions exceed 20%, but none exceeds 40%, financial statements 
shall be furnished for the most recent fiscal year and any interim 
periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03. If any of the conditions exceed 
40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the two most recent 
fiscal years and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03.
    (2) The separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is 
not required when the smaller reporting company's most recent audited 
balance sheet filed is for a date after the acquisition was consummated.
    (3) If the aggregate impact of individually insignificant businesses 
acquired since the date of the most recent audited balance sheet filed 
for the registrant exceeds 50%, financial statements covering at least 
the substantial majority of the businesses acquired shall be furnished. 
Such financial statements shall be for the most recent

[[Page 321]]

fiscal year and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03.
    (4) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of Sec. 
230.419 of this chapter (Regulation C) and proxy statements need not 
include separate financial statements of the acquired or to be acquired 
business if it does not meet or exceed any of the conditions specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section at the 50 percent level, and either:
    (i) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or
    (ii) The effective date of the registration statement, or mailing 
date in the case of a proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after 
consummation of the business combination, and the financial statements 
have not been filed previously by the registrant.
    (5) An issuer that omits from its initial registration statement 
financial statements of a recently consummated business combination 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall furnish those 
financial statements and any pro forma information specified by Sec. 
210.8-05 under cover of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) no 
later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.
    (d) If the smaller reporting company made a significant business 
acquisition after the latest fiscal year end and filed a report on Form 
8-K, which included audited financial statements of such acquired 
business for the periods required by paragraph (c) of this section and 
the pro forma financial information required by Sec. 210.8-05, the 
determination of significance may be made by using pro forma amounts for 
the latest fiscal year in the report on Form 8-K rather than by using 
the historical amounts of the registrant. The tests may not be made by 
``annualizing'' data.
    (e) If the business acquired or to be acquired is a foreign 
business, financial statements of the business meeting the requirements 
of Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-05  Pro forma financial information.

    (a) Pro forma information showing the effects of the acquisition 
shall be furnished if financial statements of a business acquired or to 
be acquired are presented.
    (b) Pro forma statements should be condensed, in columnar form 
showing pro forma adjustments and results, and should include the 
following:
    (1) If the transaction was consummated during the most recent fiscal 
year or subsequent interim period, pro forma statements of income 
reflecting the combined operations of the entities for the latest fiscal 
year and interim period, if any; or
    (2) If consummation of the transaction has occurred or is probable 
after the date of the most recent balance sheet required by Sec. 210.8-
02 or Sec. 210.8-03, a pro forma balance sheet giving effect to the 
combination as of the date of the most recent balance sheet. For a 
purchase, pro forma statements of income reflecting the combined 
operations of the entities for the latest fiscal year and interim 
period, if any, are required.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-06  Real estate operations acquired or to be acquired.

    If, during the period for which income statements are required, the 
smaller reporting company has acquired one or more properties that in 
the aggregate are significant, or since the date of the latest balance 
sheet required by Sec. 210.8-02 or Sec. 210.8-03, has acquired or 
proposes to acquire one or more properties that in the aggregate are 
significant, the following shall be furnished with respect to such 
properties:
    (a) Audited income statements (not including earnings per unit) for 
the two most recent years, which shall exclude items not comparable to 
the proposed future operations of the property such as mortgage 
interest, leasehold rental, depreciation, corporate expenses and federal 
and state income taxes; Provided, however, that such audited statements 
need be presented for only the most recent fiscal year if:
    (1) The property is not acquired from a related party;
    (2) Material factors considered by the smaller reporting company in 
assessing the property are described with specificity in the 
registration statement with regard to the property, including source of 
revenue (including, but not

[[Page 322]]

limited to, competition in the rental market, comparative rents, 
occupancy rates) and expenses (including but not limited to, utilities, 
ad valorem tax rates, maintenance expenses, and capital improvements 
anticipated); and
    (3) The smaller reporting company indicates that, after reasonable 
inquiry, it is not aware of any material factors relating to the 
specific property other than those discussed in response to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section that would cause the reported financial 
information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating 
results.
    (b) If the property will be operated by the smaller reporting 
company, a statement shall be furnished showing the estimated taxable 
operating results of the smaller reporting company based on the most 
recent twelve-month period, including such adjustments as can be 
factually supported. If the property will be acquired subject to a net 
lease, the estimated taxable operating results shall be based on the 
rent to be paid for the first year of the lease. In either case, the 
estimated amount of cash to be made available by operations shall be 
shown. Disclosure must be provided of the principal assumptions that 
have been made in preparing the statements of estimated taxable 
operating results and cash to be made available by operations.
    (c) If appropriate under the circumstances, a table should be 
provided that shows, for a limited number of years, the estimated cash 
distribution per unit, indicating the portion reportable as taxable 
income and the portion representing a return of capital with an 
explanation of annual variations, if any. If taxable net income per unit 
will be greater than the cash available for distribution per unit, that 
fact and the approximate year of occurrence shall be stated, if 
significant.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-07  Limited partnerships.

    (a) Smaller reporting companies that are limited partnerships must 
provide the balance sheets of the general partners as described in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Where a general partner is a corporation, the audited balance 
sheet of the corporation as of the end of its most recently completed 
fiscal year must be filed. Receivables, other than trade receivables, 
from affiliates of the general partner should be deducted from 
shareholders' equity of the general partner. Where an affiliate has 
committed itself to increase or maintain the general partner's capital, 
the audited balance sheet of such affiliate must also be presented.
    (c) Where a general partner is a partnership, there shall be filed 
an audited balance sheet of such partnership as of the end of its most 
recently completed fiscal year.
    (d) Where the general partner is a natural person, there shall be 
filed, as supplemental information, a balance sheet of such natural 
person as of a recent date. Such balance sheet need not be audited. The 
assets and liabilities should be carried at estimated fair market value, 
with provisions for estimated income taxes on unrealized gains. The net 
worth of such general partner(s), based on such balance sheet(s), singly 
or in the aggregate, shall be disclosed in the registration statement.


<R05>
Sec. 210.8-08  Age of financial statements.

    At the date of filing, financial statements included in filings 
other than filings on Form 10-K must be not less current than the 
financial statements that would be required in Forms 10-K and 10-Q if 
such reports were required to be filed. If required financial statements 
are as of a date 135 days or more before the date a registration 
statement becomes effective or proxy material is expected to be mailed, 
the financial statements shall be updated to include financial 
statements for an interim period ending within 135 days of the effective 
or expected mailing date. Interim financial statements must be prepared 
and presented in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) When the anticipated effective or mailing date falls within 45 
days after the end of the fiscal year, the filing may include financial 
statements only as current as of the end of the third fiscal quarter; 
Provided, however, that if the audited financial statements for the 
recently completed fiscal year are available or become available before 
effectiveness or mailing, they must be included in the filing; and

[[Page 323]]

    (b) If the effective date or anticipated mailing date falls after 45 
days but within 90 days of the end of the smaller reporting company's 
fiscal year, the smaller reporting company is not required to provide 
the audited financial statements for such year end provided that the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) If the smaller reporting company is a reporting company, all 
reports due must have been filed;
    (2) For the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial 
statements are not yet available, the smaller reporting company 
reasonably and in good faith expects to report income from continuing 
operations before taxes; and
    (3) For at least one of the two fiscal years immediately preceding 
the most recent fiscal year the smaller reporting company reported 
income from continuing operations before taxes.

    (ii) This disclosure need not be furnished when the aggregate amount 
of such loans at the balance sheet date (or with respect to the latest 
fiscal year, the maximum amount outstanding during the period) does not 
exceed 5 percent of stockholders equity at the balance sheet date.
    (2) If a significant portion of the aggregate amount of loans 
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year disclosed pursuant to 
(e)(1)(i) above relates to loans which are disclosed as nonaccrual, past 
due, restructured or potential problems (see Item III.C. 1. or 2. of 
Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies), so 
state and disclose the aggregate amounts of such loans along with such 
other information necessary to an understanding of the effects of the 
transactions on the financial statements.
    (3) Notwithstanding the aggregate disclosure called for by (e)(1) 
above, if any loans were not made in the ordinary course of business 
during any period for which an income statement is required to be filed, 
provide an appropriate description of each such loan (see Sec. 210.4-
08(L)(3)).
    (4) Definition of terms. For purposes of this rule, the following 
definitions shall apply:
    Associate means (i) a corporation, venture or organization of which 
such person is a general partner or is, directly or indirectly, the 
beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of any class of equity

    9. Due from customers on acceptances. Include amounts receivable 
from customers on unmatured drafts and bills of exchange that have been

bank, on the reporting date. (If held by a bank subsidiary, they should 
be reported as ``loans'' under Sec. 210.9-03.7.)

established subsequent to acquisition should be deducted from other real 
estate. For each period for which an income statement is required, 
disclosures should be made in a note as to the changes in the 
allowances, including balance at beginning and end of period, provision 
charged to income, and losses charged to the allowance.
    11. Total assets.

<R05>
Sec. 210.9-05  Foreign activities.

    (a) General requirement. Separate disclosure concerning foreign 
activities shall be made for each period in which either (1) assets, or

valuation allowances) associated with foreign activities.
    (2) For each period for which an income statement is filed, state 
the amount of revenue, income (loss) before taxes, and net income (loss)

<R05>
Sec. 210.9-06  Condensed financial information of registrant.

    The information prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be presented in 
a note to the financial statements when the restricted net assets (Sec. 
210.4-08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of 
consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed 
fiscal year. The investment in and indebtedness of and to bank 
subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet 
from amounts for other subsidiaries; the amount of cash dividends paid 
to the registrant for each of the last three years by bank subsidiaries 
shall be stated separately in the condensed income statement from 
amounts for other subsidiaries. For purposes of the above test, 
restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that 
amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of 
the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the 
parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash 
dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory 
agency, foreign government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of 
funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted 
as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least 
restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks 
(Sec. 210.5-02.28) and minority interests shall be deducted in 
computing net assets for purposes of this test.


<R05>
Sec. 210.9-07  [Reserved]

                      Interim Financial Statements


<R05>
Sec. 210.10-01  Interim financial statements.

    (a) Condensed statements. Interim financial statements shall follow 
the general form and content of presentation prescribed by the other 
sections of this Regulation with the following exceptions:
    (1) Interim financial statements required by this rule need only be 
provided as to the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and may 
be

[[Page 327]]

unaudited. Separate statements of other entities which may otherwise be 
required by this regulation may be omitted.
    (2) Interim balance sheets shall include only major captions (i.e., 
numbered captions) prescribed by the applicable sections of this 
Regulation with the exception of inventories. Data as to raw materials, 
work in process and finished goods inventories shall be included either 
on the face of the balance sheet or in the notes to the financial 
statements, if applicable. Where any major balance sheet caption is less 
than 10% of total assets, and the amount in the caption has not 
increased or decreased by more than 25% since the end of the preceding 
fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.
    (3) Interim statements of income shall also include major captions 
prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation. When any major 
income statement caption is less than 15% of average net income for the 
most recent three fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not 
increased or decreased by more than 20% as compared to the corresponding 
interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined 
with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be 
excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the most recent three 
years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. 
Notwithstanding these tests, Sec. 210.4-02 applies and de minimis 
amounts therefore need not be shown separately, except that registrants 
reporting under Sec. 210.9 shall show investment securities gains or 
losses separately regardless of size.
    (4) The statement of cash flows may be abbreviated starting with a 
single figure of net cash flows from operating activities and showing 
cash changes from investing and financing activities individually only 
when they exceed 10% of the average of net cash flows from operating 
activities for the most recent three years. Notwithstanding this test, 
Sec. 210.4-02 applies and de minimis amounts therefore need not be 
shown separately.
    (5) The interim financial information shall include disclosures 
either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying 
footnotes sufficient so as to make the interim information presented not 
misleading. Registrants may presume that users of the interim financial 
information have read or have access to the audited financial statements 
for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional 
disclosure needed for a fair presentation, except in regard to material 
contingencies, may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote 
disclosure which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained 
in the most recent annual report to security holders or latest audited 
financial statements, such as a statement of significant accounting 
policies and practices, details of accounts which have not changed 
significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year, and detailed disclosures prescribed by 
Rule 4-08 of this Regulation, may be omitted. However, disclosure shall 
be provided where events subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal 
year have occurred which have a material impact on the registrant. 
Disclosures should encompass for example, significant changes since the 
end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as: 
accounting principles and practices; estimates inherent in the 
preparation of financial statements; status of long-term contracts; 
capitalization including significant new borrowings or modification of 
existing financing arrangements; and the reporting entity resulting from 
business combinations or dispositions. Notwithstanding the above, where 
material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be 
provided even though a significant change since year end may not have 
occurred.
    (6) Detailed schedules otherwise required by this Regulation may be 
omitted for purposes of preparing interim financial statements.
    (7) In addition to the financial statements required by paragraphs 
(a) (2), (3) and (4) of this section, registrants in the development 
stage shall provide the cumulative financial statements

[[Page 328]]

(condensed to the same degree as allowed in this paragraph) and 
disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
7, ``Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises'' to the 
date of the latest balance sheet presented.
    (b) Other instructions as to content. The following additional 
instructions shall be applicable for purposes of preparing interim 
financial statements:
    (1) Summarized income statement information shall be given 
separately as to each subsidiary not consolidated or 50 percent or less 
owned persons or as to each group of such subsidiaries or fifty percent 
or less owned persons for which separate individual or group statements 
would otherwise be required for annual periods. Such summarized 
information, however, need not be furnished for any such unconsolidated 
subsidiary or person which would not be required pursuant to Rule 13a-13 
or 15d-13 to file quarterly financial information with the Commission if 
it were a registrant.
    (2) If appropriate, the income statement shall show earnings per 
share and dividends declared per share applicable to common stock. The 
basis of the earnings per share computation shall be stated together 
with the number of shares used in the computation. In addition, see Item 
601(b)(11) of Regulation S-K, (17 CFR 229.601(b)(11)).
    (3) If, during the most recent interim period presented, the 
registrant or any of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a 
business combination treated for accounting purposes as a pooling of 
interests, the interim financial statements for both the current year 
and the preceding year shall reflect the combined results of the pooled 
businesses. Supplemental disclosure of the separate results of the 
combined entities for periods prior to the combination shall be given, 
with appropriate explanations.
    (4) Where a material business combination accounted for as a 
purchase has occurred during the current fiscal year, pro forma 
disclosure shall be made of the results of operations for the current 
year up to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided 
(and for the corresponding period in the preceding year) as though the 
companies had combined at the beginning of the period being reported on. 
This pro forma information should as a minimum show revenue, income 
before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting 
changes, including such income on a per share basis, and net income and 
net income per share.
    (5) Where the registrant has disposed of any significant segment of 
its business (as defined in paragraph 13 of Accounting Principles Board 
Opinion No. 30) during any of the periods covered by the interim 
financial statements, the effect thereof on revenues and net income--
total and per share--for all periods shall be disclosed.
    (6) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by 
existing standards for accounting changes, the registrant shall state 
the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making 
it. In addition, for filings on Form 10-Q, a letter from the 
registrant's independent accountant shall be filed as an exhibit (in 
accordance with the provisions of Item 601 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 
229.601) in the first Form 10-Q after the date of an accounting change 
indicating whether or not the change is to an alternative principle 
which, in the accountant's judgment, is preferable under the 
circumstances; except that no letter from the accountant need be filed 
when the change is made in response to a standard adopted by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board that requires such change.
    (7) Any material retroactive prior period adjustment made during any 
period convered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, 
together with the effect thereof upon net income--total and per share--
of any prior period included and upon the balance of retained earnings. 
If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted 
retroactively by such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of 
such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be 
made.
    (8) Any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall 
reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, 
necessary to a fair

[[Page 329]]

statement of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement 
to that effect shall be included. Such adjustments shall include, for 
example, appropriate estimated provisions for bonus and profit sharing 
arrangements normally determined or settled at year-end. If all such 
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, a statement to that effect 
shall be made; otherwise, there shall be furnished information 
describing in appropriate detail the nature and amount of any 
adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments entering into the 
determination of the results shown.
    (c) Periods to be covered. The periods for which interim financial 
statements are to be provided in registration statements are prescribed 
elsewhere in this Regulation (see Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02). For 
filings on Form 10-Q, financial statements shall be provided as set 
forth in this paragraph (c):
    (1) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal 
quarter and a balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal year 
shall be provided. The balance sheet as of the end of the preceding 
fiscal year may be condensed to the same degree as the interim balance 
sheet provided. An interim balance sheet as of the end of the 
corresponding fiscal quarter of the preceding fiscal year need not be 
provided unless necessary for an understanding of the impact of seasonal 
fluctuations on the registrant's financial condition.
    (2) Interim statements of income shall be provided for the most 
recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding 
fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the 
corresponding periods of the preceding fiscal year. Such statements may 
also be presented for the cumulative twelve month period ended during 
the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding 
period.
    (3) Interim statements of cash flows shall be provided for the 
period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the 
most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding period of the 
preceding fiscal year. Such statements may also be presented for the 
cumulative twelve month period ended during the most recent fiscal 
quarter and for the corresponding preceding period.
    (4) Registrants engaged in seasonal production and sale of a single-
crop agricultural commodity may provide interim statements of income and 
cash flows for the twelve month period ended during the most recent 
fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding period in lieu of the 
year-to-date statements specified in (2) and (3) above.
    (d) Interim review by independent public accountant. Prior to 
filing, interim financial statements included in quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308(a)) must be reviewed by an independent public 
accountant using professional standards and procedures for conducting 
such reviews, as established by generally accepted auditing standards, 
as may be modified or supplemented by the Commission. If, in any filing, 
the company states that interim financial statements have been reviewed 
by an independent public accountant, a report of the accountant on the 
review must be filed with the interim financial statements.
    (e) Filing of other interim financial information in certain cases. 
The Commission may, upon the informal written request of the registrant, 
and where consistent with the protection of investors, permit the 
omission of any of the interim financial information herein required or 
the filing in substitution thereof of appropriate information of 
comparable character. The Commission may also by informal written notice 
require the filing of other information in addition to, or in 
substitution for, the interim information herein required in any case 
where such information is necessary or appropriate for an adequate 
presentation of the financial condition of any person for which interim 
financial information is required, or whose financial information is 
otherwise necessary for the protection of investors.

balance sheet filed pursuant to that section the registrant has acquired 
or proposes to acquire one or more operations or properties which in the 
aggregate are significant.
    (6) Pro forma financial information required by Sec. 229.914 is 
required to be provided in connection with a roll-up transaction as 
defined in Sec. 229.901(c).
    (7) The registrant previously was a part of another entity and such 
presentation is necessary to reflect operations and financial position 
of the registrant as an autonomous entity; or
    (8) Consummation of other events or transactions has occurred or is 
probable for which disclosure of pro forma financial information would 
be material to investors.
    (b) A business combination or disposition of a business shall be 
considered significant if:
    (1) A comparison of the most recent annual financial statements of 
the business acquired or to be acquired and the registrant's most recent 
annual consolidated financial statements filed at or prior to the date 
of acquisition indicates that the business would be a significant 
subsidiary pursuant to the conditions specified in Sec. 210.1-02(w), 
substituting 20 percent for 10 percent each place it appears therein; or
    (2) The business to be disposed of meets the conditions of a 
significant subsidiary in Sec. 210.1-02(w).
    (c) The pro forma effects of a business combination need not be 
presented pursuant to this section if separate financial statements of 
the acquired business are not included in the filing.
    (d) For purposes of this rule, the term business should be evaluated 
in light of the facts and circumstances involved and whether there is 
sufficient continuity of the acquired entity's operations prior to and 
after the transactions so that disclosure of prior financial information 
is material to an understanding of future operations. A presumption 
exists that a separate entity, a subsidiary, or a division is a 
business. However, a lesser component of an entity may also constitute a 
business. Among the facts and circumstances which should be considered 
in evaluating whether an acquisition of a lesser component of an entity 
constitutes a business are the following:

[[Page 331]]

    (1) Whether the nature of the revenue-producing activity of the 
component will remain generally the same as before the transaction; or
    (2) Whether any of the following attributes remain with the 
component after the transaction:
    (i) Physical facilities,
    (ii) Employee base,
    (iii) Market distribution system,
    (iv) Sales force,
    (v) Customer base,
    (vi) Operating rights,
    (vii) Production techniques, or
    (viii) Trade names.
    (e) This rule does not apply to transactions between a parent 
company and its totally held subsidiary.

<R05>
Sec. 210.11-02  Preparation requirements.

    (a) Objective. Pro forma financial information should provide 
investors with information about the continuing impact of a particular 
transaction by showing how it might have affected historical financial 
statements if the transaction had been consummated at an earlier time. 
Such statements should assist investors in analyzing the future 
prospects of the registrant because they illustrate the possible scope 
of the change in the registrant's historical financial position and 
results of operations caused by the transaction.
    (b) Form and content. (1) Pro forma financial information shall 
consist of a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma condensed 
statements of income, and accompanying explanatory notes. In certain 
circumstances (i.e., where a limited number of pro forma adjustments are 
required and those adjustments are easily understood), a narrative 
description of the pro forma effects of the transaction may be furnished 
in lieu of the statements described herein.
    (2) The pro forma financial information shall be accompanied by an 
introductory paragraph which briefly sets forth a description of (i) the 
transaction, (ii) the entities involved, and (iii) the periods for which 
the pro forma information is presented. In addition, an explanation of 
what the pro forma presentation shows shall be set forth.
    (3) The pro forma condensed financial information need only include 
major captions (i.e., the numbered captions) prescribed by the 
applicable sections of this Regulation. Where any major balance sheet 
caption is less than 10 percent of total assets, the caption may be 
combined with others. When any major income statement caption is less 
than 15 percent of average net income of the registrant for the most 
recent three fiscal years, the caption may be combined with others. In 
calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded unless 
losses were incurred in each of the most recent three years, in which 
case the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. 
Notwithstanding these tests, de minimis amounts need not be shown 
separately.
    (4) Pro forma statements shall ordinarily be in columnar form 
showing condensed historical statements, pro forma adjustments, and the 
pro forma results.
    (5) The pro forma condensed income statement shall disclose income 
(loss) from continuing operations before nonrecurring charges or credits 
directly attributable to the transaction. Material nonrecurring charges 
or credits and related tax effects which result directly from the 
transaction and which will be included in the income of the registrant 
within the 12 months succeeding the transaction shall be disclosed 
separately. It should be clearly indicated that such charges or credits 
were not considered in the pro forma condensed income statement. If the 
transaction for which pro forma financial information is presented 
relates to the disposition of a business, the pro forma results should 
give effect to the disposition and be presented under an appropriate 
caption.
    (6) Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed income 
statement shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at 
the beginning of the fiscal year presented and shall include adjustments 
which give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the 
transaction,

[[Page 332]]

(ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the registrant, and (iii) 
factually supportable. Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma 
condensed balance sheet shall be computed assuming the transaction was 
consummated at the end of the most recent period for which a balance 
sheet is required by Sec. 210.3-01 and shall include adjustments which 
give effect to events that are directly attributable to the transaction 
and factually supportable regardless of whether they have a continuing 
impact or are nonrecurring. All adjustments should be referenced to 
notes which clearly explain the assumptions involved.
    (7) Historical primary and fully diluted per share data based on 
continuing operations (or net income if the registrant does not report 
either discontinued operations, extraordinary items, or the cumulative 
effects of accounting changes) for the registrant, and primary and fully 
diluted pro forma per share data based on continuing operations before 
nonrecurring charges or credits directly attributable to the transaction 
shall be presented on the face of the pro forma condensed income 
statement together with the number of shares used to compute such per 
share data. For transactions involving the issuance of securities, the 
number of shares used in the calculation of the pro forma per share data 
should be based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
during the period adjusted to give effect to shares subsequently issued 
or assumed to be issued had the particular transaction or event taken 
place at the beginning of the period presented. If a convertible 
security is being issued in the transaction, consideration should be 
given to the possible dilution of the pro forma per share data.
    (8) If the transaction is structured in such a manner that 
significantly different results may occur, additional pro forma 
presentations shall be made which give effect to the range of possible 
results.

    Instructions: 1. The historical statement of income used in the pro 
forma financial information shall not report operations of a segment 
that has been discontinued, extraordinary items, or the cumulative 
effects of accounting changes. If the historical statement of income 
includes such items, only the portion of the income statement through 
``income from continuing operations'' (or the appropriate modification 
thereof) should be used in preparing pro forma results.
    2. For a purchase transaction, pro forma adjustments for the income 
statement shall include amortization of goodwill, depreciation and other 
adjustments based on the allocated purchase price of net assets 
acquired. In some transactions, such as in financial institution 
acquisitions, the purchase adjustments may include significant discounts 
of the historical cost of the acquired assets to their fair value at the 
acquisition date. When such adjustments will result in a significant 
effect on earnings (losses) in periods immediately subsequent to the 
acquisition which will be progressively eliminated over a relatively 
short period, the effect of the purchase adjustments on reported results 
of operations for each of the next five years should be disclosed in a 
note.
    3. For a disposition transaction, the pro forma financial 
information shall begin with the historical financial statements of the 
existing entity and show the deletion of the business to be divested 
along with the pro forma adjustments necessary to arrive at the 
remainder of the existing entity. For example, pro forma adjustments 
would include adjustments of interest expense arising from revised debt 
structures and expenses which will be or have been incurred on behalf of 
the business to be divested such as advertising costs, executive 
salaries and other costs.
    4. For entities which were previously a component of another entity, 
pro forma adjustments should include adjustments similar in nature to 
those referred to in Instruction 3 above. Adjustments may also be 
necessary when charges for corporate overhead, interest, or income taxes 
have been allocated to the entity on a basis other than one deemed 
reasonable by management.
    5. Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of real estate operations 
or properties for the pro forma income statement shall include a 
depreciation charge based on the new accounting basis for the assets, 
interest financing on any additional or refinanced debt, and other 
appropriate adjustments that can be factually supported. See also 
Instruction 4 above.
    6. When consummation of more than one transaction has occurred or is 
probable during a fiscal year, the pro forma financial information may 
be presented on a combined basis; however, in some circumstances (e.g., 
depending upon the combination of probable and consummated transactions, 
and the nature of the filing) it may be more useful to present the pro 
forma financial information on a disaggregated basis even though some or 
all of the transactions would not meet the tests of significance 
individually. For combined presentations, a note should explain

[[Page 333]]

the various transactions and disclose the maximum variances in the pro 
forma financial information which would occur for any of the possible 
combinations. If the pro forma financial information is presented in a 
proxy or information statement for purposes of obtaining shareholder 
approval of one of the transactions, the effects of that transaction 
must be clearly set forth.
    7. Tax effects, if any, of pro forma adjustments normally should be 
calculated at the statutory rate in effect during the periods for which 
pro forma condensed income statements are presented and should be 
reflected as a separate pro forma adjustment.

    (c) Periods to be presented. (1) A pro forma condensed balance sheet 
as of the end of the most recent period for which a consolidated balance 
sheet of the registrant is required by Sec. 210.3-01 shall be filed 
unless the transaction is already reflected in such balance sheet.
    (2)(i) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be filed for 
only the most recent fiscal year and for the period from the most recent 
fiscal year end to the most recent interim date for which a balance 
sheet is required. A pro forma condensed statement of income may be 
filed for the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year. 
A pro forma condensed statement of income shall not be filed when the 
historical income statement reflects the transaction for the entire 
period.
    (ii) For a business combination accounted for as a pooling of 
interests, the pro forma income statements (which are in effect a 
restatement of the historical income statements as if the combination 
had been consummated) shall be filed for all periods for which 
historical income statements of the registrant are required.
    (3) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be presented 
using the registrant's fiscal year end. If the most recent fiscal year 
end of any other entity involved in the transaction differs from the 
registrant's most recent fiscal year end by more than 93 days, the other 
entity's income statement shall be brought up to within 93 days of the 
registrant's most recent fiscal year end, if practicable. This updating 
could be accomplished by adding subsequent interim period results to the 
most recent fiscal year-end information and deducting the comparable 
preceding year interim period results. Disclosure shall be made of the 
periods combined and of the sales or revenues and income for any periods 
which were excluded from or included more than once in the condensed pro 
forma income statements (e.g., an interim period that is included both 
as part of the fiscal year and the subsequent interim period). For 
investment companies subject to Sec. Sec. 210.6-01 to 210.6-10, the 
periods covered by the pro forma statements must be the same.
    (4) Whenever unusual events enter into the determination of the 
results shown for the most recently completed fiscal year, the effect of 
such unusual events should be disclosed and consideration should be 
given to presenting a pro forma condensed income statement for the most 
recent twelve-month period in addition to those required in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) above if the most recent twelve-month period is more 
representative of normal operations.

Sec. 210.11-03  Presentation of financial forecast.

    (a) A financial forecast may be filed in lieu of the pro forma 
condensed statements of income required by Sec. 210.11-02(b)(1).
    (1) The financial forecast shall cover a period of at least 12 
months from the latest of (i) the most recent balance sheet included in 
the filing or (ii) the consummation date or estimated consummation date 
of the transaction.
    (2) The forecasted statement of income shall be presented in the 
same degree of detail as the pro forma condensed statement of income 
required by Sec. 210.11-02(b)(3).
    (3) Assumptions particularly relevant to the transaction and effects 
thereof should be clearly set forth.
    (4) Historical condensed financial information of the registrant and 
the business acquired or to be acquired, if any, shall be presented for 
at least a recent 12 month period in parallel columns with the financial 
forecast.
    (b) Such financial forecast shall be presented in accordance with 
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants.

[[Page 334]]

    (c) Forecasted earnings per share data shall be substituted for pro 
forma per share data.
    (d) This rule does not permit the filing of a financial forecast in 
lieu of pro forma information required by generally accepted accounting 
principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Each issue shall be listed separately: Provided, however, that an
  amount not exceeding five percent of the total of Column C may be
  listed in one amount as ``Miscellaneous securities,'' provided the
  securities so listed are not restricted, have been held for not more
  than one year prior to the date of the related balance sheet, and have
  not previously been reported by name to the shareholders of the person
  for which the schedule is filed or to any exchange, or set forth in
  any registration statement, application, or annual report or otherwise
  made available to the public. If any securities are listed as
  ``Miscellaneous securities,'' briefly explain in a footnote what the
  term represents.
\2\ Categorize the schedule by (i) the type of investment (such as
  common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities, fixed income
  securities, government securities, options purchased, warrants, loan
  participations and assignments, commercial paper, bankers'
  acceptances, certificates of deposit, short-term securities,
  repurchase agreements, other investment companies, and so forth); and
  (ii) the related industry, country, or geographic region of the
  investment. Short-term debt instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose
  maturities or expiration dates at the time of acquisition are one year
  or less) of the same issuer may be aggregated, in which case the range
  of interest rates and maturity dates shall be indicated. For issuers
  of periodic payment plan certificates and unit investment trusts, list
  separately: (i) Trust shares in trusts created or serviced by the
  depositor or sponsor of this trust; (ii) trust shares in other trusts;
  and (iii) securities of other investment companies. Restricted
  securities shall not be combined with unrestricted securities of the
  same issuer. Repurchase agreements shall be stated separately showing
  for each the name of the party or parties to the agreement, the date
  of the agreement, the total amount to be received upon repurchase, the
  repurchase date and description of securities subject to the
  repurchase agreements.
\3\ The subtotals for each category of investments, subdivided by
  business grouping or instrument type, shall be shown together with
  their percentage value compared to net assets (Sec. Sec.  210.6-
  04.19 or 210.6-05.4).
\4\ Column C shall be totaled. The total of column C shall agree with
  the correlative amounts shown on the related balance sheet.
\5\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities which is
  non-income producing. Evidences of indebtedness and preferred shares
  may be deemed to be income producing if, on the respective last
  interest payment date or date for the declaration of dividends prior
  to the date of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial
  payment of interest or a declaration of only a partial amount of the
  dividends payable; in such case, however, each such issue shall be
  indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the effect
  that, on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was
  paid or partial dividends declared. If, on such respective last
  interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no cash or in kind
  dividends declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income
  producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to be income producing
  unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance
  sheet, there was at least one dividend paid upon such common shares.
\6\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted
  securities. State the following in a footnote: (a) As to each such
  issue: (1) Acquisition date, (2) carrying value per unit of investment
  at date of related balance sheet, e.g., a percentage of current market
  value of unrestricted securities of the same issuer, etc., and (3) the
  cost of such securities; (b) as to each issue acquired during the year
  preceding the date of the related balance sheet, the carrying value
  per unit of investment of unrestricted securities of the same issuer
  at: (1) The day the purchase price was agreed to; and (2) the day on
  which an enforceable right to acquire such securities was obtained;
  and (c) the aggregate value of all restricted securities and the
  percentage which the aggregate value bears to net assets.
\7\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities held in
  connection with open put or call option contracts or loans for short
  sales.
\8\ State in a footnote the following amounts based on cost for Federal
  income tax purposes: (a) Aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for
  all securities in which there is an excess of value over tax cost, (b)
  the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in
  which there is an excess of tax cost over value, (c) the net
  unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and (d) the aggregate cost of
  securities for Federal income tax purposes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Categorize the schedule by (a) the type of investment (such as common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible
  securities, fixed income securities, government securities, options purchased, warrants, loan participations
  and assignments, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit, short-term securities,
  repurchase agreements, other investment companies, and so forth); and (b) the related industry, country, or
  geographic region of the investment.
\2\ The subtotals for each category of investments, subdivided by industry, country, or geographic region, shall
  be shown together with their percentage value compared to net assets.
\3\ Except as provided in note 5, list separately the 50 largest issues and any other issue the value of which
  exceeded one percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period. For purposes of the
  list (including, in the case of short-term debt instruments, the first sentence of note 4), aggregate and
  treat as a single issue, respectively, (a) short-term debt instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose
  maturities or expiration dates at the time of acquisition are one year or less) of the same issuer (indicating
  the range of interest rates and maturity dates); and (b) fully collateralized repurchase agreements (indicate
  in a footnote the range of dates of the repurchase agreements, the total purchase price of the securities, the
  total amount to be received upon repurchase, the range of repurchase dates, and description of securities
  subject to the repurchase agreements). Restricted and unrestricted securities of the same issue should be
  aggregated for purposes of determining whether the issue is among the 50 largest issues, but should not be
  combined in the schedule. For purposes of determining whether the value of an issue exceeds one percent of net
  asset value, aggregate and treat as a single issue all securities of any one issuer, except that all fully
  collateralized repurchase agreements shall be aggregated and treated as a single issue. The U.S. Treasury and
  each agency, instrumentality, or corporation, including each government-sponsored entity, that issues U.S.
  government securities is a separate issuer.
\4\ If multiple securities of an issuer aggregate to greater than one percent of net asset value, list each
  issue of the issuer separately (including separate listing of restricted and unrestricted securities of the
  same issue) except that the following may be aggregated and listed as a single issue: (a) Fixed-income
  securities of the same issuer which are not among the 50 largest issues and whose value does not exceed one
  percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period (indicating the range of interest
  rates and maturity dates); and (b) U.S. government securities of a single agency, instrumentality, or
  corporation, which are not among the 50 largest issues and whose value does not exceed one percent of net
  asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period (indicating the range of interest rates and
  maturity dates). For each category identified pursuant to note 1, group all issues that are neither separately
  listed nor included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue in a sub-
  category labeled ``Other securities,'' and provide the information for Columns C and D.
\5\ Any securities that would be required to be listed separately or included in a group of securities that is
  listed in the aggregate as a single issue may be listed in one amount as ``Miscellaneous securities,''
  provided the securities so listed are eligible to be, and are, categorized as ``Miscellaneous securities'' in
  the registrant's Schedule of Investments in Securities of Unaffiliated Issuers required under Sec.  210.12-
  12. However, if any security that is included in ``Miscellaneous securities'' would otherwise be required to
  be included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue, the remaining
  securities of that group must nonetheless be listed as required by notes 3 and 4 even if the remaining
  securities alone would not otherwise be required to be listed in this manner (e.g., because the combined value
  of the security listed in ``Miscellaneous securities'' and the remaining securities of the same issuer exceeds
  one percent of net asset value, but the value of the remaining securities alone does not exceed one percent of
  net asset value).
\6\ If any securities are listed as ``Miscellaneous securities'' pursuant to note 5 or ``Other securities''
  pursuant to note 4, briefly explain in a footnote what those terms represent.
\7\ Total Column C. The total of column C should equal the total shown on the related balance sheet for
  investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers.
\8\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities which is non-income producing. Evidences of
  indebtedness and preferred shares may be deemed to be income producing if, on the respective last interest
  payment date or date for the declaration of dividends prior to the date of the related balance sheet, there
  was only a partial payment of interest or a declaration of only a partial amount of the dividends payable; in
  such case, however, each such issue shall be indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the
  effect that, on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was paid or partial dividends
  declared. If, on such respective last interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no cash or in kind
  dividends declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to
  be income producing unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance sheet, there was at
  least one dividend paid upon such common shares.
\9\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted securities. State the following in a footnote:
  (a) as to each such issue: (1) Acquisition date, (2) carrying value per unit of investment at date of related
  balance sheet, e.g., a percentage of current market value of unrestricted securities of the same issuer, etc.,
  and (3) the cost of such securities; (b) as to each issue acquired during the year preceding the date of the
  related balance sheet, the carrying value per unit of investment of unrestricted securities of the same issuer
  at: (1) The day the purchase price was agreed to; and (2) the day on which an enforceable right to acquire
  such securities was obtained; and (c) the aggregate value of all restricted securities and the percentage
  which the aggregate value bears to net assets.
\10\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities held in connection with open put or call option
  contracts or loans for short sales.
\11\ State in a footnote the following amounts based on cost for Federal income tax purposes: (a) Aggregate
  gross unrealized appreciation for all securities in which there is an excess of value over tax cost, (b) the
  aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there is an excess of tax cost over value,
  (c) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and (d) the aggregate cost of securities for Federal
  income tax purposes.

 \1\ (a) The required information is to be given as to all securities
  held as of the close of the period of report. Each issue shall be
  listed separately.
(b) Indicate by an appropriate symbol those securities which are non-
  income-producing securities. Evidences of indebtedness and preferred
  shares may be deemed to be income-producing if, on the respective last
  interest payment date or dates for the declaration of dividends prior
  to the date of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial
  payment of interest or a declaration of only a partial amount of the
  dividends payable; in such case, however, each such issue shall be
  indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the effect
  that, on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was
  paid or partial dividends declared. If, on such respective last
  interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no dividends
  declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income-producing. Common
  shares shall not be deemed to be income-producing unless, during the
  last year preceding the date of the related balance sheet, there was
  at least one dividend paid upon such common shares. List separately
  (1) bonds; (2) preferred shares; (3) common shares. Within each of
  these subdivisions classify according to type of business, insofar as
  practicable: e.g., investment companies, railroads, utilities, banks,
  insurance companies, or industrials. Give totals for each group,
  subdivision, and class.
\2\ Indicate any securities subject to option at the end of the most
  recent period and state in a note the amount subject to option, the
  option prices, and the dates within which such options may be
  exercised.
\3\ Columns C and D shall be totaled. The totals of columns C and D
  should agree with the correlative amounts required to be shown by the
  related balance sheet captions. State in a footnote to column C the
  aggregate cost for Federal income tax purposes.
\4\ If any investments have been written down or reserved against by
  such companies pursuant to Sec.  210.6-21(f), indicate each such item
  by means of an appropriate symbol and explain in a footnote.
\5\ Where value is determined on any other basis than closing prices
  reported on any national securities exchange, explain such other basis
  in a footnote.

  dividends and interest included in the profit and loss or income statement in respect of investments in
  affiliates not held at the close of the period. The total of this column should agree with the amounts shown
  under such caption. Include in column E(2) all other dividends and interest. Explain briefly in an appropriate
  footnote the treatment accorded each item. Identify by an appropriate symbol all non-cash dividends and
  explain the circumstances in a footnote. See Sec. Sec.  210.6-22(b) and 210.6-23(a).

<R05>
Sec. 229.10  (Item 10) General.

    (a) Application of Regulation S-K. This part (together with the 
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq., as amended (Securities Act), and the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., as amended (Exchange Act) 
(parts 230 and 240 of this chapter), the Interpretative Releases under 
these Acts (parts 231 and 241 of this chapter) and the forms under these 
Acts (parts 239 and 249 of this chapter)) states the requirements 
applicable to the content of the non-financial statement portions of:
    (1) Registration statements under the Securities Act (part 239 of 
this chapter) to the extent provided in the forms to be used for 
registration under such Act; and
    (2) Registration statements under section 12 (subpart C of part 249 
of this chapter), annual or other reports under sections 13 and 15(d) 
(subparts D and E of part 249 of this chapter), going-private 
transaction statements under section 13 (part 240 of this chapter), 
tender offer statements under sections 13 and 14 (part 240 of this 
chapter), annual reports to security holders and proxy and information 
statements under section 14 (part 240 of this chapter), and any other 
documents required to be filed under the Exchange Act, to the extent

[[Page 350]]

provided in the forms and rules under that Act.
    (b) Commission policy on projections. The Commission encourages the 
use in documents specified in Rule 175 under the Securities Act (Sec. 
230.175 of this chapter) and Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 
240.3b-6 of this chapter) of management's projections of future economic 
performance that have a reasonable basis and are presented in an 
appropriate format. The guidelines set forth herein represent the 
Commission's views on important factors to be considered in formulating 
and disclosing such projections.
    (1) Basis for projections. The Commission believes that management 
must have the option to present in Commission filings its good faith 
assessment of a registrant's future performance. Management, however, 
must have a reasonable basis for such an assessment. Although a history 
of operations or experience in projecting may be among the factors 
providing a basis for management's assessment, the Commission does not 
believe that a registrant always must have had such a history or 
experience in order to formulate projections with a reasonable basis. An 
outside review of management's projections may furnish additional 
support for having a reasonable basis for a projection. If management 
decides to include a report of such a review in a Commission filing, 
there also should be disclosure of the qualifications of the reviewer, 
the extent of the review, the relationship between the reviewer and the 
registrant, and other material factors concerning the process by which 
any outside review was sought or obtained. Moreover, in the case of a 
registration statement under the Securities Act, the reviewer would be 
deemed an expert and an appropriate consent must be filed with the 
registration statement.
    (2) Format for projections. In determining the appropriate format 
for projections included in Commission filings, consideration must be 
given to, among other things, the financial items to be projected, the 
period to be covered, and the manner of presentation to be used. 
Although traditionally projections have been given for three financial 
items generally considered to be of primary importance to investors 
(revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share), projection 
information need not necessarily be limited to these three items. 
However, management should take care to assure that the choice of items 
projected is not susceptible of misleading inferences through selective 
projection of only favorable items. Revenues, net income (loss) and 
earnings (loss) per share usually are presented together in order to 
avoid any misleading inferences that may arise when the individual items 
reflect contradictory trends. There may be instances, however, when it 
is appropriate to present earnings (loss) from continuing operations, or 
income (loss) before extraordinary items in addition to or in lieu of 
net income (loss). It generally would be misleading to present sales or 
revenue projections without one of the foregoing measures of income. The 
period that appropriately may be covered by a projection depends to a 
large extent on the particular circumstances of the company involved. 
For certain companies in certain industries, a projection covering a two 
or three year period may be entirely reasonable. Other companies may not 
have a reasonable basis for projections beyond the current year. 
Accordingly, management should select the period most appropriate in the 
circumstances. In addition, management, in making a projection, should 
disclose what, in its opinion, is the most probable specific amount or 
the most reasonable range for each financial item projected based on the 
selected assumptions. Ranges, however, should not be so wide as to make 
the disclosures meaningless. Moreover, several projections based on 
varying assumptions may be judged by management to be more meaningful 
than a single number or range and would be permitted.
    (3) Investor understanding. (i) When management chooses to include 
its projections in a Commission filing, the

[[Page 351]]

disclosures accompanying the projections should facilitate investor 
understanding of the basis for and limitations of projections. In this 
regard investors should be cautioned against attributing undue certainty 
to management's assessment, and the Commission believes that investors 
would be aided by a statement indicating management's intention 
regarding the furnishing of updated projections. The Commission also 
believes that investor understanding would be enhanced by disclosure of 
the assumptions which in management's opinion are most significant to 
the projections or are the key factors upon which the financial results 
of the enterprise depend and encourages disclosure of assumptions in a 
manner that will provide a framework for analysis of the projection.
    (ii) Management also should consider whether disclosure of the 
accuracy or inaccuracy of previous projections would provide investors 
with important insights into the limitations of projections. In this 
regard, consideration should be given to presenting the projections in a 
format that will facilitate subsequent analysis of the reasons for 
differences between actual and forecast results. An important benefit 
may arise from the systematic analysis of variances between projected 
and actual results on a continuing basis, since such disclosure may 
highlight for investors the most significant risk and profit-sensitive 
areas in a business operation.
    (iii) With respect to previously issued projections, registrants are 
reminded of their responsibility to make full and prompt disclosure of 
material facts, both favorable and unfavorable, regarding their 
financial condition. This responsibility may extend to situations where 
management knows or has reason to know that its previously disclosed 
projections no longer have a reasonable basis.
    (iv) Since a registrant's ability to make projections with relative 
confidence may vary with all the facts and circumstances, the 
responsibility for determining whether to discontinue or to resume 
making projections is best left to management. However, the Commission 
encourages registrants not to discontinue or to resume projections in 
Commission filings without a reasonable basis.
    (c) Commission policy on security ratings. In view of the importance 
of security ratings (ratings) to investors and the marketplace, the 
Commission permits registrants to disclose, on a voluntary basis, 
ratings assigned by rating organizations to classes of debt securities, 
convertible debt securities and preferred stock in registration 
statements and periodic reports. In addition, the Commission permits, 
pursuant to Rule 134(a)(14) under the Securities Act (Sec. 
230.134(a)(14) of this chapter), voluntary disclosure of ratings 
assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
(NRSROs) in certain communications deemed not to be a prospectus 
(tombstone advertisements). Set forth herein are the Commission's views 
on important matters to be considered in disclosing security ratings.
    (1) Securities Act filings. (i) If a registrant includes in a 
registration statement filed under the Securities Act any rating(s) 
assigned to a class of securities, it should consider including: (A) Any 
other rating intended for public dissemination assigned to such class by 
a NRSRO (additional NRSRO rating) that is available on the date of the 
initial filing of the document and that is materially different from any 
rating disclosed; and (B) the name of each rating organization whose 
rating is disclosed; each such rating organization's definition or 
description of the category in which it rated the class of securities; 
the relative rank of each rating within the assigning rating 
organization's overall classification system; and a statement informing 
investors that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or 
hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any 
time by the assigning rating organization, and that each rating should 
be evaluated independently of any other rating. The registrant also 
should include the written consent of any rating organization that is 
not a NRSRO whose rating is included. With respect to the written 
consent of any NRSRO whose rating is included, see Rule 436(g) under the 
Securities Act (Sec. 230.436(g) of this chapter). When the registrant 
has filed a

[[Page 352]]

registration statement on Form F-9 (Sec. 239.39 of this chapter), see 
Rule 436(g) (Sec. 230.436(g) of this chapter) under the Securities Act 
with respect to the written consent of any rating organization specified 
in the Instruction to paragraph (a)(2) of General Instruction I of Form 
F-9.
    (ii) If a change in a rating already included is available 
subsequent to the filing of the registration statement, but prior to its 
effectiveness, the registrant should consider including such rating 
change in the final prospectus. If the rating change is material or if a 
materially different rating from any disclosed becomes available during 
this period, the registrant should consider amending the registration 
statement to include the rating change or additional rating and 
recirculating the preliminary prospectus.
    (iii) If a materially different additional NRSRO rating or a 
material change in a rating already included becomes available during 
any period in which offers or sales are being made, the registrant 
should consider disclosing such additional rating or rating change by 
means of post-effective amendment or sticker to the prospectus pursuant 
to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.424(b) of this 
chapter), unless, in the case of a registration statement on Form S-3 
(Sec. 239.13 of this chapter), it has been disclosed in a document 
incorporated by reference into the registration statement subsequent to 
its effectiveness and prior to the termination of the offering.
    (2) Exchange Act filings. (i) If a registrant includes in a 
registration statement or periodic report filed under the Exchange Act 
any rating(s) assigned to a class of securities, it should consider 
including the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) and (B) 
of this section.
    (ii) If there is a material change in the rating(s) assigned by any 
NRSRO(s) to any outstanding class(es) of securities of a registrant 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act, the registrant should consider filing a report on Form 8-K 
(Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) or other appropriate report under the 
Exchange Act disclosing such rating change.
    (d) Incorporation by Reference. Where rules, regulations, or 
instructions to forms of the Commission permit incorporation by 
reference, a document may be so incorporated by reference to the 
specific document and to the prior filing or submission in which such 
document was physically filed or submitted. Except where a registrant or 
issuer is expressly required to incorporate a document or documents by 
reference (or for purposses of Item 1100(c) of Regulation AB (Sec. 
229.1100(c)) with respect to an asset-backed issuer, as that term is 
defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1101)), reference may 
not be made to any document which incorporates another document by 
reference if the pertinent portion of the doucment containing the 
information or financial statements to be incorporated by reference 
includes an incorporation by reference to another document. No document 
on file with the Commission for more than five years may be incorporated 
by reference except:
    (1) Documents contained in registration statements, which may be 
incorporated by reference as long as the registrant has a reporting 
requirement with the Commission; or
    (2) Documents that the registrant specifically identifies by 
physical location by SEC file number reference, provided such materials 
have not been disposed of by the Commission pursuant to its Records 
Control Schedule (17 CFR 200.80f).
    (e) Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings. (1) 
Whenever one or more non-GAAP financial measures are included in a 
filing with the Commission:
    (i) The registrant must include the following in the filing:
    (A) A presentation, with equal or greater prominence, of the most 
directly comparable financial measure or measures calculated and 
presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP);
    (B) A reconciliation (by schedule or other clearly understandable 
method), which shall be quantitative for historical non-GAAP measures 
presented,

[[Page 353]]

and quantitative, to the extent available without unreasonable efforts, 
for forward-looking information, of the differences between the non-GAAP 
financial measure disclosed or released with the most directly 
comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in 
accordance with GAAP identified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section;
    (C) A statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant's 
management believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure 
provides useful information to investors regarding the registrant's 
financial condition and results of operations; and
    (D) To the extent material, a statement disclosing the additional 
purposes, if any, for which the registrant's management uses the non-
GAAP financial measure that are not disclosed pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(1)(i)(C) of this section; and
    (ii) A registrant must not:
    (A) Exclude charges or liabilities that required, or will require, 
cash settlement, or would have required cash settlement absent an 
ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures, 
other than the measures earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization 
(EBITDA);
    (B) Adjust a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth 
items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the 
nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to 
recur within two years or there was a similar charge or gain within the 
prior two years;
    (C) Present non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the 
registrant's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or in 
the accompanying notes;
    (D) Present non-GAAP financial measures on the face of any pro forma 
financial information required to be disclosed by Article 11 of 
Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.11-01 through 210.11-03); or
    (E) Use titles or descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures that 
are the same as, or confusingly similar to, titles or descriptions used 
for GAAP financial measures; and
    (iii) If the filing is not an annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-
F (17 CFR 249.220f), a registrant need not include the information 
required by paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(C) and (e)(1)(i)(D) of this section if 
that information was included in its most recent annual report on Form 
10-K or Form 20-F or a more recent filing, provided that the required 
information is updated to the extent necessary to meet the requirements 
of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(C) and (e)(1)(i)(D) of this section at the time 
of the registrant's current filing.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a non-GAAP financial measure 
is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial 
performance, financial position or cash flows that:
    (i) Excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the 
effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly 
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in 
the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or 
equivalent statements) of the issuer; or
    (ii) Includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the 
effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly 
comparable measure so calculated and presented.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph (e), GAAP refers to generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States, except that:
    (i) In the case of foreign private issuers whose primary financial 
statements are prepared in accordance with non-U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles, GAAP refers to the principles under which those 
primary financial statements are prepared; and
    (ii) In the case of foreign private issuers that include a non-GAAP 
financial measure derived from or based on a measure calculated in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP 
refers to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for purposes of 
the application of the requirements of this paragraph (e) to the 
disclosure of that measure.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (e), non-GAAP financial measures 
exclude:
    (i) Operating and other statistical measures; and

[[Page 354]]

    (ii) Ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively one 
or both of:
    (A) Financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP; and
    (B) Operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP 
financial measures.
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph (e), non-GAAP financial measures 
exclude financial measures required to be disclosed by GAAP, Commission 
rules, or a system of regulation of a government or governmental 
authority or self-regulatory organization that is applicable to the 
registrant. However, the financial measure should be presented outside 
of the financial statements unless the financial measure is required or 
expressly permitted by the standard-setter that is responsible for 
establishing the GAAP used in such financial statements.
    (6) The requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall not 
apply to a non-GAAP financial measure included in disclosure relating to 
a proposed business combination, the entity resulting therefrom or an 
entity that is a party thereto, if the disclosure is contained in a 
communication that is subject to Sec. 230.425 of this chapter, Sec. 
240.14a-12 or Sec. 240.14d-2(b)(2) of this chapter or Sec. 229.1015 of 
this chapter.
    (7) The requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall not 
apply to investment companies registered under section 8 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-8).

    Note to paragraph (e). A non-GAAP financial measure that would 
otherwise be prohibited by paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section is 
permitted in a filing of a foreign private issuer if:
    1. The non-GAAP financial measure relates to the GAAP used in the 
registrant's primary financial statements included in its filing with 
the Commission;
    2. The non-GAAP financial measure is required or expressly permitted 
by the standard-setter that is responsible for establishing the GAAP 
used in such financial statements; and
    3. The non-GAAP financial measure is included in the annual report 
prepared by the registrant for use in the jurisdiction in which it is 
domiciled, incorporated or organized or for distribution to its security 
holders.
    (f) Smaller reporting companies. The requirements of this part apply 
to smaller reporting companies. A smaller reporting company may comply 
with either the requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies 
or the requirements applicable to other companies for each item, unless 
the requirements for smaller reporting companies specify that smaller 
reporting companies must comply with the smaller reporting company 
requirements. The following items of this part set forth requirements 
for smaller reporting companies that are different from requirements 
applicable to other companies:

    (1) Definition of smaller reporting company. As used in this part, 
the term smaller reporting company means an issuer that is not an 
investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as defined in Sec. 
229.1101), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a 
smaller reporting company and that:
    (i) Had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last 
business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, 
computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its 
voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates

[[Page 355]]

by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of 
the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for 
the common equity; or
    (ii) In the case of an initial registration statement under the 
Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a 
public float of less than $75 million as of a date within 30 days of the 
date of the filing of the registration statement, computed by 
multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-
affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act 
registration statement, the number of such shares included in the 
registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the 
shares; or
    (iii) In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated 
under paragraph (i) or (ii) of this definition was zero, had annual 
revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed 
fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.
    (2) Determination: Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting 
company is determined on an annual basis.
    (i) For issuers that are required to file reports under section 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the determination is based on 
whether the issuer came within the definition of smaller reporting 
company, using the amounts specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this 
Item, as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of the 
issuer's previous fiscal year. An issuer in this category must reflect 
this determination in the information it provides in its quarterly 
report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of the next year, 
indicating on the cover page of that filing, and in subsequent filings 
for that fiscal year, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company, 
except that, if a determination based on public float indicates that the 
issuer is newly eligible to be a smaller reporting company, the issuer 
may choose to reflect this determination beginning with its first 
quarterly report on Form 10-Q following the determination, rather than 
waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next year.
    (ii) For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or 
Exchange Act registration statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this 
Item, the issuer must reflect the determination in the information it 
provides in the registration statement and must appropriately indicate 
on the cover page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal 
year in which the filing is made, whether or not it is a smaller 
reporting company. The issuer must redetermine its status at the end of 
its second fiscal quarter and then reflect any change in status as 
provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this Item. In the case of a 
determination based on an initial Securities Act registration statement, 
an issuer that was not determined to be a smaller reporting company has 
the option to redetermine its status at the conclusion of the offering 
covered by the registration statement based on the actual offering price 
and number of shares sold.
    (iii) Once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller reporting company 
status, it will remain unqualified unless it determines that its public 
float, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this Item, 
was less than $50 million as of the last business day of its second 
fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because the 
issuer had no public equity outstanding or no market price for its 
equity existed, if the issuers had annual revenues of less than $40 
million during its previous fiscal year.

                        Subpart 229.100_Business


<R05>
Sec. 229.101  (Item 101) Description of business.

    (a) General development of business. Describe the general 
development of the business of the registrant, its subsidiaries and any 
predecessor(s) during the past five years, or such shorter period as the 
registrant may have been engaged in business. Information shall be 
disclosed for earlier periods if material to an understanding of the 
general development of the business.

[[Page 356]]

    (1) In describing developments, information shall be given as to 
matters such as the following: the year in which the registrant was 
organized and its form of organization; the nature and results of any 
bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings with respect to the 
registrant or any of its significant subsidiaries; the nature and 
results of any other material reclassification, merger or consolidation 
of the registrant or any of its significant subsidiaries; the 
acquisition or disposition of any material amount of assets otherwise 
than in the ordinary course of business; and any material changes in the 
mode of conducting the business.
    (2) Registrants:
    (i) Filing a registration statement on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of 
this chapter) under the Securities Act or on Form 10 (Sec. 249.210 of 
this chapter) under the Exchange Act;
    (ii) Not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act immediately before the filing of such 
registration statement; and
    (iii) That (including predecessors) have not received revenue from 
operations during each of the three fiscal years immediately before the 
filing of such registration statement, shall provide the following 
information:
    (A) If the registration statement is filed prior to the end of the 
registrant's second fiscal quarter, a description of the registrant's 
plan of operation for the remainder of the fiscal year; or
    (B) If the registration statement is filed subsequent to the end of 
the registrant's second fiscal quarter, a descripition of the 
registrant's plan of operation for the remainder of the fiscal year and 
for the first six months of the next fiscal year. If such information is 
not available, the reasons for its not being available shall be stated. 
Disclosure relating to any plan shall include such matters as:
    (1) In the case of a registration statement on Form S-1, a statement 
in narrative form indicating the registrant's opinion as to the period 
of time that the proceeds from the offering will satisfy cash 
requirements and whether in the next six months it will be necessary to 
raise additional funds to meet the expenditures required for operating 
the business of the registrant; the specific reasons for such opinion 
shall be set forth and categories of expenditures and sources of cash 
resources shall be identified; however, amounts of expenditures and cash 
resources need not be provided; in addition, if the narrative statement 
is based on a cash budget, such budget shall be furnished to the 
Commission as supplemental information, but not as part of the 
registration statement;
    (2) An explanation of material product research and development to 
be performed during the period covered in the plan;
    (3) Any anticipated material acquisition of plant and equipment and 
the capacity thereof;
    (4) Any anticipated material changes in number of employees in the 
various departments such as research and development, production, sales 
or administration; and
    (5) Other material areas which may be peculiar to the registrant's 
business.
    (b) Financial information about segments. Report for each segment, 
as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, revenues from 
external customers, a measure of profit or loss and total assets. A 
registrant must report this information for each of the last three 
fiscal years or for as long as it has been in business, whichever period 
is shorter. If the information provided in response to this paragraph 
(b) conforms with generally accepted accounting principles, a registrant 
may include in its financial statements a cross reference to this data 
in lieu of presenting duplicative information in the financial 
statements; conversely, a registrant may cross reference to the 
financial statements.
    (1) If a registrant changes the structure of its internal 
organization in a manner that causes the composition of its reportable 
segments to change, the registrant must restate the corresponding 
information for earlier periods, including interim periods, unless it is 
impracticable to do so. Following a change in the composition of its 
reportable segments, a registrant shall disclose whether it has restated 
the corresponding items of segment information for earlier periods. If 
it has not restated the items from earlier periods,

[[Page 357]]

the registrant shall disclose in the year in which the change occurs 
segment information for the current period under both the old basis and 
the new basis of segmentation, unless it is impracticable to do so.
    (2) If the registrant includes, or is required by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210) to include, interim financial statements, 
discuss any facts relating to the performance of any of the segments 
during the period which, in the opinion of management, indicate that the 
three year segment financial data may not be indicative of current or 
future operations of the segment. Comparative financial information 
shall be included to the extent necessary to the discussion.
    (c) Narrative description of business. (1) Describe the business 
done and intended to be done by the registrant and its subsidiaries, 
focusing upon the registrant's dominant segment or each reportable 
segment about which financial information is presented in the financial 
statements. To the extent material to an understanding of the 
registrant's business taken as a whole, the description of each such 
segment shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) 
through (x) of this section. The matters specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
(xi) through (xiii) of this section shall be discussed with respect to 
the registrant's business in general; where material, the segments to 
which these matters are significant shall be identified.
    (i) The principal products produced and services rendered by the 
registrant in the segment and the principal markets for, and methods of 
distribution of, the segment's principal products and services. In 
addition, state for each of the last three fiscal years the amount or 
percentage of total revenue contributed by any class of similar products 
or services which accounted for 10 percent or more of consolidated 
revenue in any of the last three fiscal years or 15 percent or more of 
consolidated revenue, if total revenue did not exceed $50,000,000 during 
any of such fiscal years.
    (ii) A description of the status of a product or segment (e.g. 
whether in the planning stage, whether prototypes exist, the degree to 
which product design has progressed or whether further engineering is 
necessary), if there has been a public announcement of, or if the 
registrant otherwise has made public information about, a new product or 
segment that would require the investment of a material amount of the 
assets of the registrant or that otherwise is material. This paragraph 
is not intended to require disclosure of otherwise nonpublic corporate 
information the disclosure of which would affect adversely the 
registrant's competitive position.
    (iii) The sources and availability of raw materials.
    (iv) The importance to the segment and the duration and effect of 
all patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions held.
    (v) The extent to which the business of the segment is or may be 
seasonal.
    (vi) The practices of the registrant and the industry (respective 
industries) relating to working capital items (e.g., where the 
registrant is required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet 
rapid delivery requirements of customers or to assure itself of a 
continuous allotment of goods from suppliers; where the registrant 
provides rights to return merchandise; or where the registrant has 
provided extended payment terms to customers).
    (vii) The dependence of the segment upon a single customer, or a few 
customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a material 
adverse effect on the segment. The name of any customer and its 
relationship, if any, with the registrant or its subsidiaries shall be 
disclosed if sales to the customer by one or more segments are made in 
an aggregate amount equal to 10 percent or more of the registrant's 
consolidated revenues and the loss of such customer would have a 
material adverse effect on the registrant and its subsidiaries taken as 
a whole. The names of other customers may be included, unless in the 
particular case the effect of including the names would be misleading. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a group of customers under common 
control or customers that are affiliates of each other shall be regarded 
as a single customer.

[[Page 358]]

    (viii) The dollar amount of backlog orders believed to be firm, as 
of a recent date and as of a comparable date in the preceding fiscal 
year, together with an indication of the portion thereof not reasonably 
expected to be filled within the current fiscal year, and seasonal or 
other material aspects of the backlog. (There may be included as firm 
orders government orders that are firm but not yet funded and contracts 
awarded but not yet signed, provided an appropriate statement is added 
to explain the nature of such orders and the amount thereof. The portion 
of orders already included in sales or operating revenues on the basis 
of percentage of completion or program accounting shall be excluded.)
    (ix) A description of any material portion of the business that may 
be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or 
subcontracts at the election of the Government.
    (x) Competitive conditions in the business involved including, where 
material, the identity of the particular markets in which the registrant 
competes, an estimate of the number of competitors and the registrant's 
competitive position, if known or reasonably available to the 
registrant. Separate consideration shall be given to the principal 
products or services or classes of products or services of the segment, 
if any. Generally, the names of competitors need not be disclosed. The 
registrant may include such names, unless in the particular case the 
effect of including the names would be misleading. Where, however, the 
registrant knows or has reason to know that one or a small number of 
competitors is dominant in the industry it shall be identified. The 
principal methods of competition (e.g., price, service, warranty or 
product performance) shall be identified, and positive and negative 
factors pertaining to the competitive position of the registrant, to the 
extent that they exist, shall be explained if known or reasonably 
available to the registrant.
    (xi) If material, the estimated amount spent during each of the last 
three fiscal years on company-sponsored research and development 
activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. In addition, state, if material, the estimated dollar amount 
spent during each of such years on customer-sponsored research 
activities relating to the development of new products, services or 
techniques or the improvement of existing products, services or 
techniques.
    (xii) Appropriate disclosure also shall be made as to the material 
effects that compliance with Federal, State and local provisions which 
have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into 
the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the 
environment, may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings and 
competitive position of the registrant and its subsidiaries. The 
registrant shall disclose any material estimated capital expenditures 
for environmental control facilities for the remainder of its current 
fiscal year and its succeeding fiscal year and for such further periods 
as the registrant may deem materials.
    (xiii) The number of persons employed by the registrant.
    (d) Financial information about geographic areas. (1) State for each 
of the registrant's last three fiscal years, or for each fiscal year the 
registrant has been engaged in business, whichever period is shorter:
    (i) Revenues from external customers attributed to:
    (A) The registrant's country of domicile;
    (B) All foreign countries, in total, from which the registrant 
derives revenues; and
    (C) Any individual foreign country, if material. Disclose the basis 
for attributing revenues from external customers to individual 
countries.
    (ii) Long-lived assets, other than financial instruments, long-term 
customer relationships of a financial institution, mortgage and other 
servicing rights, deferred policy acquisition costs, and deferred tax 
assets, located in:
    (A) The registrant's country of domicile;
    (B) All foreign countries, in total, in which the registrant holds 
assets; and
    (C) Any individual foreign country, if material.

[[Page 359]]

    (2) A registrant shall report the amounts based on the financial 
information that it uses to produce the general-purpose financial 
statements. If providing the geographic information is impracticable, 
the registrant shall disclose that fact. A registrant may wish to 
provide, in addition to the information required by paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, subtotals of geographic information about groups of 
countries. To the extent that the disclosed information conforms with 
generally accepted accounting principles, the registrant may include in 
its financial statements a cross reference to this data in lieu of 
presenting duplicative data in its financial statements; conversely, a 
registrant may cross-reference to the financial statements.
    (3) A registrant shall describe any risks attendant to the foreign 
operations and any dependence on one or more of the registrant's 
segments upon such foreign operations, unless it would be more 
appropriate to discuss this information in connection with the 
description of one or more of the registrant's segments under paragraph 
(c) of this item.
    (4) If the registrant includes, or is required by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210), to include, interim financial statements, 
discuss any facts relating to the information furnished under this 
paragraph (d) that, in the opinion of management, indicate that the 
three year financial data for geographic areas may not be indicative of 
current or future operations. To the extent necessary to the discussion, 
include comparative information.
    (e) Available information. Disclose the information in paragraphs 
(e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section in any registration statement 
you file under the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), and disclose

    (3) You are encouraged to give your Internet address, if available,

    (4)(i) Whether you make available free of charge on or through your 
Internet website, if you have one, your annual report on Form 10-K,

reports on Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), and amendments to 
those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 78o(d)) as soon as reasonably 
practicable after you electronically file such material with, or furnish 
it to, the SEC;
    (ii) If you do not make your filings available in this manner, the 
reasons you do not do so (including, where applicable, that you do not

include a reconciliation of this information with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.
    (g) Enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons. 
Disclose the following if you are a foreign private issuer filing a

    (1) Whether or not investors may bring actions under the civil 
liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws against the 
foreign private issuer, any of its officers and directors who are 
residents of a foreign country, any underwriters or experts named in the 
registration statement that are residents of a foreign country, and 
whether investors may enforce these civil liability provisions when the 
assets of the issuer or these other persons are located outside of the 
United States. The disclosure must address the following matters:
    (i) The investor's ability to effect service of process within the 
United States on the foreign private issuer or any person;
    (ii) The investor's ability to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. 
courts against foreign persons based upon the civil liability provisions

defined by Sec. 229.10(f)(1), may satisfy its obligations under this 
Item by describing the development of its business during the last three 
years. If the smaller reporting company has not been in business for 
three years, give the same information for predecessor(s) of the smaller 
reporting company if there are any. This business development 
description should include:
    (1) Form and year of organization;
    (2) Any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding; and

the report will include audited financial statements;
    (ii) Whether you file reports with the Securities and Exchange

operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Commission at 1-
800-SEC-0330. State that the Commission maintains an Internet site that 
contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other 
information regarding issuers that file electronically with the 
Commission and state the address of that site (http://www.sec.gov). You 
are encouraged to give your Internet address, if available.
    (6) Foreign issuers. Provide the information required by Item 101(g) 
of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.101(g)).

Instructions to Item 101: 1. In determining what information about the 
segments is material to an understanding of the registrant's business 
taken as a whole and therefore required to be disclosed, pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this Item, the registrant should take into account both 
quantitative and qualitative factors such as the significance of the 
matter to the registrant (e.g., whether a matter with a relatively minor 
impact on the registrant's business is represented by management to be 
important to its future profitability), the pervasiveness of the matter 
(e.g., whether it affects or may affect numerous items in the segment 
information), and the impact of the matter (e.g., whether it distorts 
the trends reflected in the segment information). Situations may arise 
when information should be disclosed about a segment, although the 
information in quantitative terms may not appear significant to the 
registrant's business taken as a whole.
    2. Base the determination of whether information about segments is 
required for a particular year upon an evaluation of interperiod 
comparability. For instance, interperiod comparability would require a 
registrant to report segment information in the current period even if 
not material under the criteria for reportability of SFAS No. 131 if a 
segment has been significant in the immediately preceding period and the 
registrant expects it to be significant in the future.
    3. The Commission, upon written request of the registrant and where 
consistent with the protection of investors, may permit the omission of 
any of the information required by this Item or the furnishing in 
substitution thereof of appropriate information of comparable character.

Sec. 229.102  (Item 102) Description of property.

    State briefly the location and general character of the principal 
plants, mines and other materially important physical properties of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries. In addition, identify the segment(s), 
as reported in the financial statements, that use the properties 
described. If any such property is not held in fee or is held subject to 
any major encumbrance, so state and describe briefly how held.

Instructions to Item 102: 1. What is required is such information as 
reasonably will inform investors as to the suitability, adequacy, 
productive capacity and extent of utilization of the facilities by the 
registrant. Detailed descriptions of the physical characteristics of 
individual properties or legal descriptions by metes and bounds are not 
required and shall not be given.
    2. In determining whether properties should be described, the 
registrant should take into account both quantitative and qualitative 
factors. See Instruction 1 to Item 101 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 
229.101).
    3. In the case of an extractive enterprise, material information 
shall be given as to production, reserves, locations, development and 
the nature of the registrant's interest. If individual properties are of 
major significance to an industry segment:
    A. More detailed information concerning these matters shall be 
furnished; and

[[Page 362]]

    B. Appropriate maps shall be used to disclose location data of 
significant properties except in cases for which numerous maps would be 
required.
    4. A. If reserve estimates are referred to in the document, the 
staff of the Office of Engineering, Division of Corporation Finance of 
the Commission, shall be consulted. That Office may request that a copy 
of the full report of the engineer or other expert who estimated the 
reserves be furnished as supplemental information and not as part of the 
filing. See Rule 418 of Regulation C (Sec. 230.418 of this chapter) and 
Rule 12b-4 of Regulation 12B (Sec. 240.12b-4 of this chapter) with 
respect to the submission to, and return by, the Commission of 
supplemental information.
    B. If the estimates of reserves, or any estimated valuation thereof, 
are represented as being based on estimates prepared or reviewed by 
independent consultants, those independent consultants shall be named in 
the document.
    5. Estimates of oil or gas reserves other than proved or, in the 
case of other extractive reserves, estimates other than proved or 
probable reserves, and any estimated values of such reserves shall not 
be disclosed in any document publicly filed with the Commission, unless 
such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign 
or state law; provided, however, that where such estimates previously 
have been provided to a person (or any of its affiliates) that is 
offering to acquire, merge or consolidate with the registrant or 
otherwise to acquire the registrant's securities, such estimates may be 
included in documents relating to such acquisition.
    6. The definitions in Sec. 210.4-10(a) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 
210] shall apply to this Item with respect to oil and gas operations.
    7. The attention of issuers engaged in significant mining operations 
is directed to the information called for in Guide 7 (Sec. 229.801(g) 
and Sec. 229.802(g)).
    8. The attention of issuers engaged in oil and gas producing 
activities is directed to the information called for in Guides 2 and 4 
(Sec. 229.801(b), Sec. 229.802(b) and Sec. 299.801(d), Sec. 
229.802(d)).
    9. The attention of issuers engaged in real estate activities is 
directed to the information called for in Guide 5 (Sec. 229.801(e) of 
this chapter).

Sec. 229.103  (Item 103) Legal proceedings.

    Describe briefly any material pending legal proceedings, other than 
ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the 
registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of 
their property is the subject. Include the name of the court or agency 
in which the proceedings are pending, the date instituted, the principal 
parties thereto, a description of the factual basis alleged to underlie 
the proceeding and the relief sought. Include similar information as to 
any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental 
authorities.


[[Page 363]]


Instructions to Item 103: 1. If the business ordinarily results in 
actions for negligence or other claims, no such action or claim need be 
described unless it departs from the normal kind of such actions.
    2. No information need be given with respect to any proceeding that 
involves primarily a claim for damages if the amount involved, exclusive 
of interest and costs, does not exceed 10 percent of the current assets 
of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. However, 
if any proceeding presents in large degree the same legal and factual 
issues as other proceedings pending or known to be contemplated, the 
amount involved in such other proceedings shall be included in computing 
such percentage.
    3. Notwithstanding Instructions 1 and 2, any material bankruptcy, 
receivership, or similar proceeding with respect to the registrant or 
any of its significant subsidiaries shall be described.
    4. Any material proceedings to which any director, officer or 
affiliate of the registrant, any owner of record or beneficially of more 
than five percent of any class of voting securities of the registrant, 
or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate of the 
registrant, or security holder is a party adverse to the registrant or 
any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the 
registrant or any of its subsidiaries also shall be described.
    5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an administrative or judicial 
proceeding (including, for purposes of A and B of this Instruction, 
proceedings which present in large degree the same issues) arising under 
any Federal, State or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted 
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primary 
for the purpose of protecting the environment shall not be deemed 
``ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business'' and shall be 
described if:
    A. Such proceeding is material to the business or financial 
condition of the registrant;
    B. Such proceeding involves primarily a claim for damages, or 
involves potential monetary sanctions, capital expenditures, deferred 
charges or charges to income and the amount involved, exclusive of 
interest and costs, exceeds 10 percent of the current assets of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; or
    C. A governmental authority is a party to such proceeding and such 
proceeding involves potential monetary sanctions, unless the registrant 
reasonably believes that such proceeding will result in no monetary 
sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of 
less than $100,000; provided, however, that such proceedings which are 
similar in nature may be grouped and described generically.

              Subpart 229.200_Securities of the Registrant


<R05>
Sec. 229.201  (Item 201) Market price of and dividends on the registrant's common equity and related stockholder matters.

    (a) Market information. (1)(i) Identify the principal United States 
market or markets in which each class of the registrant's common equity 
is being traded. Where there is no established public trading market for 
a class of common equity, furnish a statement to that effect. For 
purposes of this Item the existence of limited or sporadic quotations 
should not of itself be deemed to constitute an ``established public 
trading market.'' In the case of foreign registrants, also identify the 
principal established foreign public trading market, if any, for each 
class of the registrant's common equity.
    (ii) If the principal United States market for such common equity is 
an exchange, state the high and low sales prices for the equity for each 
full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years and any 
subsequent interim period for which financial statements are included, 
or are required to be included by Article 3-01 through 3-04 of 
Regulation S-X ( Sec. 210.3-01 through 3-04 of this chapter), or 
Article 8-02 through 8-03 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.8-02 through 8-03 
of this chapter) in the case of smaller reporting companies, as reported 
in the consolidated transaction reporting system or, if not so reported, 
as reported on the principal exchange market for such equity.
    (iii) If the principal United States market for such common equity 
is not an exchange, state the range of high and low bid information for 
the equity for each full quarterly period within the two most recent 
fiscal years and any subsequent interim period for which financial 
statements are included, or are required to be included by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X, as regularly quoted in the automated quotation system of 
a registered securities association, or where the equity is not quoted 
in such a system, the range of reported high and low bid quotations, 
indicating the source of

[[Page 364]]

such quotations. Indicate, as applicable, that such over-the-counter 
market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, 
mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual 
transactions. Where there is an absence of an established public trading 
market, reference to quotations shall be qualified by appropriate 
explanation.
    (iv) Where a foreign registrant has identified a principal 
established foreign trading market for its common equity pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this Item, also provide market price information 
comparable, to the extent practicable, to that required for the 
principal United States market, including the source of such 
information. Such prices shall be stated in the currency in which they 
are quoted. The registrant may translate such prices into United States 
currency at the currency exchange rate in effect on the date the price 
disclosed was reported on the foreign exchange. If the primary United 
States market for the registrant's common equity trades using American 
Depositary Receipts, the United States prices disclosed shall be on that 
basis.
    (v) If the information called for by this Item is being presented in 
a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act or a proxy 
or information statement filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, the 
document also shall include price information as of the latest 
practicable date, and, in the case of securities to be issued in 
connection with an acquisition, business combination or other 
reorganization, as of the date immediately prior to the public 
announcement of such transaction.
    (2) If the information called for by this paragraph (a) is being 
presented in a registration statement on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of this 
chapter) under the Securities Act or on Form 10 (Sec. 249.210 of this 
chapter) under the Exchange Act relating to a class of common equity for 
which at the time of filing there is no established United States public 
trading market, indicate the amount(s) of common equity:
    (i) That is subject to outstanding options or warrants to purchase, 
or securities convertible into, common equity of the registrant;
    (ii) That could be sold pursuant to Sec. 230.144 of this chapter or 
that the registrant has agreed to register under the Securities Act for 
sale by security holders; or
    (iii) That is being, or has been publicly proposed to be, publicly 
offered by the registrant (unless such common equity is being offered 
pursuant to an employee benefit plan or dividend reinvestment plan), the 
offering of which could have a material effect on the market price of 
the registrant's common equity.
    (b) Holders. (1) Set forth the approximate number of holders of each 
class of common equity of the registrant as of the latest practicable 
date.
    (2) If the information called for by this paragraph (b) is being 
presented in a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities 
Act or a proxy statement or information statement filed pursuant to the 
Exchange Act that relates to an acquisition, business combination or 
other reorganization, indicate the effect of such transaction on the 
amount and percentage of present holdings of the registrant's common 
equity owned beneficially by (i) any person (including any group as that 
term is used in section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) who is known to 
the registrant to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of 
any class of the registrant's common equity and (ii) each director and 
nominee and (iii) all directors and officers as a group, and the 
registrant's present commitments to such persons with respect to the 
issuance of shares of any class of its common equity.
    (c) Dividends. (1) State the frequency and amount of any cash 
dividends declared on each class of its common equity by the registrant 
for the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period 
for which financial statements are required to be presented by Sec. 
210.3 of Regulation S-X. Where there are restrictions (including, where 
appropriate, restrictions on the ability of registrant's subsidiaries to 
transfer funds to the registrant in the form of cash dividends, loans or 
advances) that currently materially limit the registrant's ability to 
pay such

[[Page 365]]

dividends or that the registrant reasonably believes are likely to limit 
materially the future payment of dividends on the common equity so state 
and either (i) describe briefly (where appropriate quantify) such 
restrictions, or (ii) cross reference to the specific discussion of such 
restrictions in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial 
condition and operating results prescribed by Item 303 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.303) and the description of such restrictions required by 
Regulation S-X in the registrant's financial statements.
    (2) Where registrants have a record of paying no cash dividends 
although earnings indicate an ability to do so, they are encouraged to 
consider the question of their intention to pay cash dividends in the 
foreseeable future and, if no such intention exists, to make a statement 
of that fact in the filing. Registrants which have a history of paying 
cash dividends also are encouraged to indicate whether they currently 
expect that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the 
future and, if not, the nature of the change in the amount or rate of 
cash dividend payments.
    (d) Securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation 
plans. (1) In the following tabular format, provide the information 
specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this Item as of the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year with respect to compensation plans 
(including individual compensation arrangements) under which equity 
securities of the registrant are authorized for issuance, aggregated as 
follows:
    (i) All compensation plans previously approved by security holders; 
and
    (ii) All compensation plans not previously approved by security 
holders.

    (2) The table shall include the following information as of the end 
of the most recently completed fiscal year for each category of equity 
compensation plan described in paragraph (d)(1) of this Item:
    (i) The number of securities to be issued upon the exercise of 
outstanding options, warrants and rights (column (a));
    (ii) The weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding options, 
warrants and rights disclosed pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
Item (column (b)); and
    (iii) Other than securities to be issued upon the exercise of the 
outstanding options, warrants and rights disclosed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this Item, the number of securities remaining available for 
future issuance under the plan (column (c)).
    (3) For each compensation plan under which equity securities of the 
registrant are authorized for issuance that was adopted without the 
approval of security holders, describe briefly, in narrative form, the 
material features of the plan.

Instructions to paragraph (d). 1. Disclosure shall be provided with 
respect to any compensation plan and individual compensation arrangement 
of the registrant (or parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the registrant) 
under which equity securities of the registrant are authorized for 
issuance to employees or non-employees (such as directors, consultants, 
advisors, vendors, customers, suppliers or lenders) in exchange for 
consideration in the form of goods or services as described in Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for

[[Page 366]]

Stock-Based Compensation, or any successor standard. No disclosure is 
required with respect to:
    a. Any plan, contract or arrangement for the issuance of warrants or 
rights to all security holders of the registrant as such on a pro rata 
basis (such as a stock rights offering) or
    b. Any employee benefit plan that is intended to meet the 
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue 
Code (26 U.S.C. 401(a)).
    2. For purposes of this paragraph, an ``individual compensation 
arrangement'' includes, but is not limited to, the following: a written 
compensation contract within the meaning of ``employee benefit plan'' 
under Sec. 230.405 of this chapter and a plan (whether or not set forth 
in any formal document) applicable to one person as provided under Item 
402(a)(6)(ii) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.402(a)(6)(ii)).
    3. If more than one class of equity security is issued under its 
equity compensation plans, a registrant should aggregate plan 
information for each class of security.
    4. A registrant may aggregate information regarding individual 
compensation arrangements with the plan information required under 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this Item, as applicable.
    5. A registrant may aggregate information regarding a compensation 
plan assumed in connection with a merger, consolidation or other 
acquisition transaction pursuant to which the registrant may make 
subsequent grants or awards of its equity securities with the plan 
information required under paragraph (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this Item, as 
applicable. A registrant shall disclose on an aggregated basis in a 
footnote to the table the information required under paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
and (ii) of this Item with respect to any individual options, warrants 
or rights assumed in connection with a merger, consolidation or other 
acquisition transaction.
    6. To the extent that the number of securities remaining available 
for future issuance disclosed in column (c) includes securities 
available for future issuance under any compensation plan or individual 
compensation arrangement other than upon the exercise of an option, 
warrant or right, disclose the number of securities and type of plan 
separately for each such plan in a footnote to the table.
    7. If the description of an equity compensation plan set forth in a 
registrant's financial statements contains the disclosure required by 
paragraph (d)(3) of this Item, a cross-reference to such description 
will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this Item.
    8. If an equity compensation plan contains a formula for calculating 
the number of securities available for issuance under the plan, 
including, without limitation, a formula that automatically increases 
the number of securities available for issuance by a percentage of the 
number of outstanding securities of the registrant, a description of 
this formula shall be disclosed in a footnote to the table.
    9. Except where it is part of a document that is incorporated by 
reference into a prospectus, the information required by this paragraph 
need not be provided in any registration statement filed under the 
Securities Act.

    (e) Performance graph. (1) Provide a line graph comparing the yearly 
percentage change in the registrant's cumulative total shareholder 
return on a class of common stock registered under section 12 of the 
Exchange Act (as measured by dividing the sum of the cumulative amount 
of dividends for the measurement period, assuming dividend reinvestment, 
and the difference between the registrant's share price at the end and 
the beginning of the measurement period; by the share price at the 
beginning of the measurement period) with:
    (i) The cumulative total return of a broad equity market index 
assuming reinvestment of dividends, that includes companies whose equity 
securities are traded on the same exchange or are of comparable market 
capitalization; provided, however, that if the registrant is a company 
within the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, the registrant must use 
that index; and
    (ii) The cumulative total return, assuming reinvestment of 
dividends, of:
    (A) A published industry or line-of-business index;
    (B) Peer issuer(s) selected in good faith. If the registrant does 
not select its peer issuer(s) on an industry or line-of-business basis, 
the registrant shall disclose the basis for its selection; or
    (C) Issuer(s) with similar market capitalization(s), but only if the 
registrant does not use a published industry or line-of-business index 
and does not believe it can reasonably identify a peer group. If the 
registrant uses this alternative, the graph shall be accompanied by a 
statement of the reasons for this selection.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this Item, the term 
``measurement period'' shall be the period beginning at the 
``measurement point'' established by the market close on the last 
trading

[[Page 367]]

day before the beginning of the registrant's fifth preceding fiscal 
year, through and including the end of the registrant's last completed 
fiscal year. If the class of securities has been registered under 
section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l) for a shorter period of 
time, the period covered by the comparison may correspond to that time 
period.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this Item, the term 
``published industry or line-of-business index'' means any index that is 
prepared by a party other than the registrant or an affiliate and is 
accessible to the registrant's security holders; provided, however, that 
registrants may use an index prepared by the registrant or affiliate if 
such index is widely recognized and used.
    (4) If the registrant selects a different index from an index used 
for the immediately preceding fiscal year, explain the reason(s) for 
this change and also compare the registrant's total return with that of 
both the newly selected index and the index used in the immediately 
preceding fiscal year.

Instructions to Item 201(e): 1. In preparing the required graphic 
comparisons, the registrant should:
    a. Use, to the extent feasible, comparable methods of presentation 
and assumptions for the total return calculations required by paragraph 
(e)(1) of this Item; provided, however, that if the registrant 
constructs its own peer group index under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B), the 
same methodology must be used in calculating both the registrant's total 
return and that on the peer group index; and
    b. Assume the reinvestment of dividends into additional shares of 
the same class of equity securities at the frequency with which 
dividends are paid on such securities during the applicable fiscal year.
    2. In constructing the graph:
    a. The closing price at the measurement point must be converted into 
a fixed investment, stated in dollars, in the registrant's stock (or in 
the stocks represented by a given index) with cumulative returns for 
each subsequent fiscal year measured as a change from that investment; 
and
    b. Each fiscal year should be plotted with points showing the 
cumulative total return as of that point. The value of the investment as 
of each point plotted on a given return line is the number of shares 
held at that point multiplied by the then-prevailing share price.
    3. The registrant is required to present information for the 
registrant's last five fiscal years, and may choose to graph a longer 
period; but the measurement point, however, shall remain the same.
    4. Registrants may include comparisons using performance measures in 
addition to total return, such as return on average common shareholders' 
equity.
    5. If the registrant uses a peer issuer(s) comparison or comparison 
with issuer(s) with similar market capitalizations, the identity of 
those issuers must be disclosed and the returns of each component issuer 
of the group must be weighted according to the respective issuer's stock 
market capitalization at the beginning of each period for which a return 
is indicated.
    6. Smaller reporting companies. A registrant that qualifies as a 
smaller reporting company, as defined by Sec. 229.10(f)(1), is not 
required to provide the information required by paragraph (e) of this 
Item.
    7. The information required by paragraph (e) of this Item need not 
be provided in any filings other than an annual report to security 
holders required by Exchange Act Rule 14a-3 (17 CFR 240.14a-3) or 
Exchange Act Rule 14c-3 (17 CFR 240.14c-3) that precedes or accompanies 
a registrant's proxy or information statement relating to an annual 
meeting of security holders at which directors are to be elected (or 
special meeting or written consents in lieu of such meeting). Such 
information will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any 
filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the 
extent that the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference.
    8. The information required by paragraph (e) of this Item shall not 
be deemed to be ``soliciting material'' or to be ``filed'' with the 
Commission or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C (17 CFR 240.14a-1-
240.14a-104 or 240.14c-1-240.14c-101), other than as provided in this 
item, or to the liabilities of section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 
78r), except to the extent that the registrant specifically requests 
that such information be treated as soliciting material or specifically 
incorporates it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or 
the Exchange Act.

Instructions to Item 201: 1. Registrants, the common equity of which is 
listed for trading on more than one securities exchange registered under 
the Exchange Act, are required to indicate each such exchange pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this Item; such registrants, however, need 
only report one set of price quotations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
of this Item; where available, these shall be the prices as reported in 
the consolidated transaction reporting system and, where the prices are 
not so reported, the prices on the most significant (in terms of volume) 
securities exchange for such shares.

[[Page 368]]

    2. Market prices and dividends reported pursuant to this Item shall 
be adjusted to give retroactive effect to material changes resulting 
from stock dividends, stock splits and reverse stock splits.
    3. The computation of the approximate number of holders of 
registrant's common equity may be based upon the number of record 
holders or also may include individual participants in security position 
listings. See Rule 17Ad-8 under the Exchange Act. The method of 
computation that is chosen shall be indicated.
    4. If the registrant is a foreign issuer, describe briefly:
    A. Any governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the country in 
which the registrant is organized that restrict the export or import of 
capital, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange controls, or 
that affect the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident 
holders of the registrant's common equity; and
    B. All taxes, including withholding provisions, to which United 
States common equity holders are subject under existing laws and 
regulations of the foreign country in which the registrant is organized. 
Include a brief description of pertinent provisions of any reciprocal 
tax treaty between such foreign country and the United States regarding 
withholding. If there is no such treaty, so state.
    5. If the registrant is a foreign private issuer whose common equity 
of the class being registered is wholly or partially in bearer form, the 
response to this Item shall so indicate together with as much 
information as the registrant is able to provide with respect to 
security holdings in the United States. If the securities being 
registered trade in the United States in the form of American Depositary 
Receipts or similar certificates, the response to this Item shall so 
indicate together with the name of the depositary issuing such receipts 
and the number of shares or other units of the underlying security 
representing the trading units in such receipts.

Sec. 229.202  (Item 202) Description of registrant's securities.

    Note: If the securities being described have been accepted for 
listing on an exchange, the exchange may be identified. The document 
should not however, convey the impression that the registrant may apply 
successfully for listing of the securities on an exchange or that, in 
the case of an underwritten offering, the underwriters may request the 
registrant to apply for such listing, unless there is reasonable 
assurance that the securities to be offered will be acceptable to a 
securities exchange for listing.

    (a) Capital stock. If capital stock is to be registered, state the 
title of the class and describe such of the matters listed in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (5) as are relevant. A complete legal description of the 
securities need not be given.
    (1) Outline briefly: (i) dividend rights; (ii) terms of conversion; 
(iii) sinking fund provisions; (iv) redemption provisions; (v) voting 
rights, including any provisions specifying the vote required by 
security holders to take action; (vi) any classification of the Board of 
Directors, and the impact of such classification where cumulative voting 
is permitted or required; (vii) liquidation rights; (viii) preemption 
rights; and (ix) liability to further calls or to assessment by the 
registrant and for liabilities of the registrant imposed on its 
stockholders under state statutes (e.g., to laborers, servants or 
employees of the registrant), unless such disclosure would be immaterial 
because the financial resources of the registrant or other factors make 
it improbable that liability under such state statues would be imposed; 
(x) any restriction on alienability of the securities to be registered; 
and (xi) any provision discriminating against any existing or 
prospective holder of such securities as a result of such security 
holder owning a substantial amount of securities.
    (2) If the rights of holders of such stock may be modified otherwise 
than by a vote of a majority or more of the shares outstanding, voting 
as a class, so state and explain briefly.
    (3) If preferred stock is to be registered, describe briefly any 
restriction on the repurchase or redemption of shares by the registrant 
while there is any arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund 
installments. If there is no such restriction, so state.
    (4) If the rights evidenced by, or amounts payable with respect to, 
the shares to be registered are, or may be, materially limited or 
qualified by the rights of any other authorized class of securities, 
include the information regarding such other securities as will enable 
investors to understand such

[[Page 369]]

limitations or qualifications. No information need be given, however, as 
to any class of securities all of which will be retired, provided 
appropriate steps to ensure such retirement will be completed prior to 
or upon delivery by the registrant of the shares.
    (5) Describe briefly or cross-reference to a description in another 
part of the document, any provision of the registrant's charter or by-
laws that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a 
change in control of the registrant and that would operate only with 
respect to an extraordinary corporate transaction involving the 
registrant (or any of its subsidiaries), such as a merger, 
reorganization, tender offer, sale or transfer of substantially all of 
its assets, or liquidation. Provisions and arrangements required by law 
or imposed by governmental or judicial authority need not be described 
or discussed pursuant to this paragraph (a)(5). Provisions or 
arrangements adopted by the registrant to effect, or further, compliance 
with laws or governmental or judicial mandate are not subject to the 
immediately preceding sentence where such compliance did not require the 
specific provisions or arrangements adopted.
    (b) Debt securities. If debt securities are to be registered, state 
the title of such securities, the principal amount being offered, and, 
if a series, the total amount authorized and the total amount 
outstanding as of the most recent practicable date; and describe such of 
the matter listed in paragraphs (b) (1) through (10) as are relevant. A 
complete legal description of the securities need not be given. For 
purposes solely of this Item, debt securities that differ from one 
another only as to the interest rate or maturity shall be regarded as 
securities of the same class. Outline briefly:
    (1) Provisions with respect to maturity, interest, conversion, 
redemption, amortization, sinking fund, or retirement;
    (2) Provisions with respect to the kind and priority of any lien 
securing the securities, together with a brief identification of the 
principal properties subject to such lien;
    (3) Provisions with respect to the subordination of the rights of 
holders of the securities to other security holders or creditors of the 
registrant; where debt securities are designated as subordinated in 
accordance with Instruction 1 to this Item, set forth the aggregate 
amount of outstanding indebtedness as of the most recent practicable 
date that by the terms of such debt securities would be senior to such 
subordinated debt and describe briefly any limitation on the issuance of 
such additional senior indebtedness or state that there is no such 
limitation;
    (4) Provisions restricting the declaration of dividends or requiring 
the maintenance of any asset ratio or the creation or maintenance of 
reserves;
    (5) Provisions restricting the incurrence of additional debt or the 
issuance of additional securities; in the case of secured debt, whether 
the securities being registered are to be issued on the basis of 
unbonded bondable property, the deposit of cash or otherwise; as of the 
most recent practicable date, the approximate amount of unbonded 
bondable property available as a basis for the issuance of bonds; 
provisions permitting the withdrawal of cash deposited as a basis for 
the issuance of bonds; and provisions permitting the release or 
substitution of assets securing the issue; Provided, however, That 
provisions permitting the release of assets upon the deposit of 
equivalent funds or the pledge of equivalent property, the release of 
property no longer required in the business, obsolete property, or 
property taken by eminent domain or the application of insurance moneys, 
and other similar provisions need not be described;
    (6) The general type of event that constitutes a default and whether 
or not any periodic evidence is required to be furnished as to the 
absence of default or as to compliance with the terms of the indenture;
    (7) Provisions relating to modification of the terms of the security 
or the rights of security holders;
    (8) If the rights evidenced by the securities to be registered are, 
or may be, materially limited or qualified by the rights of any other 
authorized class of securities, the information regarding such other 
securities as will enable investors to understand the rights evidenced 
by the securities; to the extent

[[Page 370]]

not otherwise disclosed pursuant to this Item; no information need be 
given, however, as to any class of securities all of which will be 
retired, provided appropriate steps to ensure such retirement will be 
completed prior to or upon delivery by the registrant of the securities;
    (9) If debt securities are to be offered at a price such that they 
will be deemed to be offered at an ``original issue discount'' as 
defined in paragraph (a) of section 1273 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(26 U.S.C. 1273), or if a debt security is sold in a package with 
another security and the allocation of the offering price between the 
two securities may have the effect of offering the debt security at such 
an original issue discount, the tax effects thereof pursuant to sections 
1271-1278;
    (10) The name of the trustee(s) and the nature of any material 
relationship with the registrant or with any of its affiliates; the 
percentage of securities of the class necessary to require the trustee 
to take action; and what indemnification the trustee may require before 
proceeding to enforce the lien.
    (c) Warrants and rights. If the securities described are to be 
offered pursuant to warrants or rights state:
    (1) The amount of securities called for by such warrants or rights;
    (2) The period during which and the price at which the warrants or 
rights are exercisable;
    (3) The amount of warrants or rights outstanding;
    (4) Provisions for changes to or adjustments in the exercise price; 
and
    (5) Any other material terms of such rights on warrants.
    (d) Other securities. If securities other than capital stock, debt, 
warrants or rights are to be registered, include a brief description 
(comparable to that required in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Item 202) 
of the rights evidenced thereby.
    (e) Market information for securities other than common equity. If 
securities other than common equity are to be registered and there is an 
established public trading market for such securities (as that term is 
used in Item 201 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.201 of this chapter)) 
provide market information with respect to such securities comparable to 
that required by paragraph (a) of Item 201 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 
229.201).
    (f) American Depositary Receipts. If Depositary Shares represented 
by American Depositary Receipts are being registered, furnish the 
following information:
    (1) The name of the depositary and the address of its principal 
executive office.
    (2) State the title of the American Depositary Receipts and identify 
the deposited security. Describe briefly the terms of deposit, including 
the provisions, if any, with respect to:
    (i) The amount of deposited securities represented by one unit of 
American Depositary Receipts;
    (ii) The procedure for voting, if any, the deposited securities;
    (iii) The collection and distribution of dividends;
    (iv) The transmission of notices, reports and proxy soliciting 
material;
    (v) The sale or exercise of rights;
    (vi) The deposit or sale of securities resulting from dividends, 
splits or plans of reorganization;
    (vii) Amendment, extension or termination of the deposit;
    (viii) Rights of holders of receipts to inspect the transfer books 
of the depositary and the list of holders of receipts;
    (ix) Restrictions upon the right to deposit or withdraw the 
underlying securities;
    (x) Limitation upon the liability of the depositary.
    (3) Describe all fees and charges which may be imposed directly or 
indirectly against the holder of the American Depositary Receipts, 
indicating the type of service, the amount of fee or charges and to whom 
paid.

Instructions to Item 202: 1. Wherever the title of securities is 
required to be stated, there shall be given such information as will 
indicate the type and general character of the securities, including the 
following:
    A. In the case of shares, the par or stated value, if any; the rate 
of dividends, if fixed, and whether cumulative or non-cumulative; a 
brief indication of the preference, if any; and if convertible or 
redeemable, a statement to that effect;
    B. In the case of debt, the rate of interest; the date of maturity 
or, if the issue matures serially, a brief indication of the serial 
maturities, such as ``maturing serially from 1955 to 1960''; if the 
payment of principal or

[[Page 371]]

interest is contingent, an appropriate indication of such contingency; a 
brief indication of the priority of the issue; and, if convertible or 
callable, a statement to that effect; or
    C. In the case of any other kind of security, appropriate 
information of comparable character.
    2. If the registrant is a foreign registrant, include (to the extent 
not disclosed in the document pursuant to Item 201 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.201) or otherwise) in the description of the securities:
    A. A brief description of any limitations on the right of 
nonresident or foreign owners to hold or vote such securities imposed by 
foreign law or by the charter or other constituent document of the 
registrant, or if no such limitations are applicable, so state;
    B. A brief description of any governmental laws, decrees or 
regulations in the country in which the registrant is organized 
affecting the remittance of dividends, interest and other payments to 
nonresident holders of the securities being registered;
    C. A brief outline of all taxes, including withholding provisions, 
to which United States security holders are subject under existing laws 
and regulations of the foreign country in which the registrant is 
organized; and
    D. A brief description of pertinent provisions of any reciprocal tax 
treaty between such foreign country and the United States regarding 
withholding or, if there is no such treaty, so state.
    3. Section 305(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.S.C. 
77aaa et seq., as amended (``Trust Indenture Act''), shall not be deemed 
to require the inclusion in a registration statement or in a prospectus 
of any information not required by this Item.
    4. Where convertible securities or stock purchase warrants are being 
registered that are subject to redemption or call, the description of 
the conversion terms of the securities or material terms of the warrants 
shall disclose:
    A. Whether the right to convert or purchase the securities will be 
forfeited unless it is exercised before the date specified in a notice 
of the redemption or call;
    B. The expiration or termination date of the warrants;
    C. The kinds, frequency and timing of notice of the redemption or 
call, including the cities or newspapers in which notice will be 
published (where the securities provide for a class of newspapers or 
group of cities in which the publication may be made at the discretion 
of the registrant, the registrant should describe such provision); and
    D. In the case of bearer securities, that investors are responsible 
for making arrangements to prevent loss of the right to convert or 
purchase in the event of redemption of call, for example, by reading the 
newspapers in which the notice of redemption or call may be published.
    5. The response to paragraph (f) shall include information with 
respect to fees and charges in connection with (A) the deposit or 
substitution of the underlying securities; (B) receipt and distribution 
of dividends; (C) the sale or exercise of rights; (D) the withdrawal of 
the underlying security; and (E) the transferring, splitting or grouping 
of receipts. Information with respect to the right to collect the fees

Sec. 229.301  (Item 301) Selected financial data.

    Furnish in comparative columnar form the selected financial data for 
the registrant referred to below, for
    (a) Each of the last five fiscal years of the registrant (or for the 
life of the registrant and its predecessors, if less), and
    (b) Any additional fiscal years necessary to keep the information 
from being misleading.
    (c) Smaller reporting companies. A registrant that qualifies as a 
smaller reporting company, as defined by Sec. 229.10(f)(1), is not 
required to provide the information required by this Item.

Instructions to Item 301: 1. The purpose of the selected financial data 
shall be to supply in a convenient and readable format selected 
financial data which highlight certain significant trends in the 
registrant's financial condition and results of operations.
    2. Subject to appropriate variation to conform to the nature of the 
registrant's business, the following items shall be included in the 
table of financial data: net sales or operating revenues; income (loss) 
from continuing operations; income (loss) from continuing operations per 
common share; total assets; long-term obligations and redeemable 
preferred stock (including long-term debt, capital leases, and 
redeemable preferred stock as defined in Sec. 210.5-02.28(a) of 
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210]; and cash dividends declared per common 
share. Registrants may include additional items which they believe would 
enhance an understanding of and would highlight other trends in their 
financial condition and results of operations.


[[Page 372]]


Briefly describe, or cross-reference to a discussion thereof, factors 
such as accounting changes, business combinations or dispositions of 
business operations, that materially affect the comparability of the 
information reflected in selected financial data. Discussion of, or 
reference to, any material uncertainties should also be included where 
such matters might cause the data reflected herein not to be indicative 
of the registrant's future financial condition or results of operations.
    3. All references to the registrant in the table of selected 
financial data and in this Item shall mean the registrant and its 
subsidiaries consolidated.
    4. If interim period financial statements are included, or are 
required to be included, by Article 3 of Regulation S-X, registrants 
should consider whether any or all of the selected financial data need 
to be updated for such interim periods to reflect a material change in 
the trends indicated; where such updating information is necessary, 
registrants shall provide the information on a comparative basis unless 
not necessary to an understanding of such updating information.
    5. A foreign private issuer shall disclose also the following 
information in all filings containing financial statements:
    A. In the forepart of the document and as of the latest practicable 
date, the exchange rate into U.S. currency of the foreign currency in 
which the financial statements are denominated;
    B. A history of exchange rates for the five most recent years and 
any subsequent interim period for which financial statements are 
presented setting forth the rates for period end, the average rates, and 
the range of high and low rates for each year; and
    C. If equity securities are being registered, a five year summary of 
dividends per share stated in both the currency in which the financial 
statements are denominated and United States currency based on the 
exchange rates at each respective payment date.
    6. A foreign private issuer shall present the selected financial 
data in the same currency as its financial statements. The issuer may 
present the selected financial data on the basis of the accounting 
principles used in its primary financial statements but in such case 
shall present this data also on the basis of any reconciliations of such 
data to United States generally accepted accounting principles and 
Regulation S-X made pursuant to Rule 4-01 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 
210.4-01 of this chapter).
    7. For purposes of this rule, the rate of exchange means the noon 
buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies 
as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York. The average rate means the average of the exchange rates on the 
last day of each month during a year.

Sec. 229.302  (Item 302) Supplementary financial information.

    (a) Selected quarterly financial data. Registrants specified in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this Item shall provide the information specified 
below.
    (1) Disclosure shall be made of net sales, gross profit (net sales 
less costs and expenses associated directly with or allocated to 
products sold or services rendered), income (loss) before extraordinary 
items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting, per share data 
based upon such income (loss), and net income (loss), for each full 
quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent 
interim period for which financial statements are included or are 
required to be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210].
    (2) When the data supplied pursuant to this paragraph (a) vary from 
the amounts previously reported on the Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB (Sec. 
249.308a of this chapter) filed for any quarter, such as would be the 
case when a pooling of interests occurs or where an error is corrected, 
reconcile the amounts given with those previously reported and describe 
the reason for the difference.
    (3) Describe the effect of any disposals of segments of a business, 
and extraordinary, unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in 
each full quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any 
subsequent interim period for which financial statements are included or 
are required to be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X, as well as 
the aggregate effect and the nature of year-end or other adjustments 
which are material to the results of that quarter.
    (4) If the financial statements to which this information relates 
have been reported on by an accountant, appropriate professional 
standards and procedures, as enumerated in the Statements of Auditing 
Standards issued by the Auditing Standards

[[Page 373]]

Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, shall 
be followed by the reporting accountant with regard to the data required 
by this paragraph (a).
    (5) This paragraph (a) applies to any registrant, except a foreign 
private issuer, that has securities registered pursuant to sections 
12(b) (15 U.S.C. Sec. 78l(b)) (other than mutual life insurance 
companies) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 78l(g)).
    (b) Information about oil and gas producing activities. Registrants 
engaged in oil and gas producing activities shall present the 
information about oil and gas producing activities (as those activities 
are defined in Regulation S-X, Sec. 210.4-10(a)) specified in 
paragraphs 9-34 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(``SFAS'') No. 69, ``Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing 
Activities.'' If such oil and gas producing activities are regarded as 
significant under one or more of the tests set forth in paragraph 8 of 
SFAS No. 69.

Instructions to paragraph (b): 1. (a) SFAS No. 69 disclosures that 
relate to annual periods shall be presented for each annual period for 
which an income statement is required. (b) SFAS No. 69 disclosures 
required as of the end of an annual period shall be presented as of the 
date of each audited balance sheet required, and (c) SFAS No. 69 
disclosures required as of the beginning of an annual period shall be 
presented as of the beginning of each annual period for which an income 
statement is required.
    2. This paragraph, together with Sec. 210.4-10 of Regulation S-X, 
prescribes financial reporting standards for the preparation of accounts 
by persons engaged, in whole or in part, in the production of crude oil 
or natural gas in the United States, pursuant to Section 503 of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 8383) (``EPCA'') 
and Section 11(c) of the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination 
Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 796) (``ESECA'') as amended by Section 506 of 
EPCA. The application of the paragraph to those oil and gas producing 
operations of companies regulated for ratemaking purposes on an 
individual-company-cost-of-service basis may, however, give appropriate 
recognition to differences arising because of the effect of the 
ratemaking process.
    3. Any person exempted by the Department of Energy from any record-
keeping or reporting requirements pursuant to Section 11(c) of ESECA, as 
amended, is similarly exempted from the related provisions of this 
paragraph in the preparation of accounts pursuant to EPCA. This 
exemption does not affect the applicability of this paragraph to filings 
pursuant to the federal securities laws.
    (c) Smaller reporting companies. A registrant that qualifies as a 
smaller reporting company, as defined by Sec. 229.10(f)(1), is not 
required to provide the information required by this Item.

[47 FR 11401, Mar. 16, 1982, as amended at 47 FR 57914, Dec. 29, 1982;

<R05>
Sec. 229.303  (Item 303) Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

    (a) Full fiscal years. Discuss registrant's financial condition, 
changes in financial condition and results of operations. The discussion 
shall provide information as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) 
of this Item and also shall provide such other information that the 
registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial 
condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. 
Discussions of liquidity and capital resources may be combined whenever 
the two topics are interrelated. Where in the registrant's judgment a 
discussion of segment information or of other subdivisions of the 
registrant's business would be appropriate to an understanding of such 
business, the discussion shall focus on each relevant, reportable 
segment or other subdivision of the business and on the registrant as a 
whole.
    (1) Liquidity. Identify any known trends or any known demands, 
commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are 
reasonably likely to result in the registrant's liquidity increasing or 
decreasing in any material way. If a material deficiency is identified, 
indicate the course of action that the registrant has taken or proposes 
to take to remedy the deficiency. Also identify and separately describe 
internal and external sources of liquidity, and briefly discuss any 
material unused sources of liquid assets.
    (2) Capital resources. (i) Describe the registrant's material 
commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal 
period, and indicate the general purpose of such commitments and the 
anticipated source of

[[Page 374]]

funds needed to fulfill such commitments.
    (ii) Describe any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, 
in the registrant's capital resources. Indicate any expected material 
changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. The discussion 
shall consider changes between equity, debt and any off-balance sheet 
financing arrangements.
    (3) Results of operations. (i) Describe any unusual or infrequent 
events or transactions or any significant economic changes that 
materially affected the amount of reported income from continuing 
operations and, in each case, indicate the extent to which income was so 
affected. In addition, describe any other significant components of 
revenues or expenses that, in the registrant's judgment, should be 
described in order to understand the registrant's results of operations.
    (ii) Describe any known trends or uncertainties that have had or 
that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or 
unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing 
operations. If the registrant knows of events that will cause a material 
change in the relationship between costs and revenues (such as known 
future increases in costs of labor or materials or price increases or 
inventory adjustments), the change in the relationship shall be 
disclosed.
    (iii) To the extent that the financial statements disclose material 
increases in net sales or revenues, provide a narrative discussion of 
the extent to which such increases are attributable to increases in 
prices or to increases in the volume or amount of goods or services 
being sold or to the introduction of new products or services.
    (iv) For the three most recent fiscal years of the registrant or for 
those fiscal years in which the registrant has been engaged in business, 
whichever period is shortest, discuss the impact of inflation and 
changing prices on the registrant's net sales and revenues and on income 
from continuing operations.
    (4) Off-balance sheet arrangements. (i) In a separately-captioned 
section, discuss the registrant's off-balance sheet arrangements that 
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the 
registrant's financial condition, changes in financial condition, 
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital 
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. The 
disclosure shall include the items specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A), 
(B), (C) and (D) of this Item to the extent necessary to an 
understanding of such arrangements and effect and shall also include 
such other information that the registrant believes is necessary for 
such an understanding.
    (A) The nature and business purpose to the registrant of such off-
balance sheet arrangements;
    (B) The importance to the registrant of such off-balance sheet 
arrangements in respect of its liquidity, capital resources, market risk 
support, credit risk support or other benefits;
    (C) The amounts of revenues, expenses and cash flows of the 
registrant arising from such arrangements; the nature and amounts of any 
interests retained, securities issued and other indebtedness incurred by 
the registrant in connection with such arrangements; and the nature and 
amounts of any other obligations or liabilities (including contingent 
obligations or liabilities) of the registrant arising from such 
arrangements that are or are reasonably likely to become material and 
the triggering events or circumstances that could cause them to arise; 
and
    (D) Any known event, demand, commitment, trend or uncertainty that 
will result in or is reasonably likely to result in the termination, or 
material reduction in availability to the registrant, of its off-balance 
sheet arrangements that provide material benefits to it, and the course 
of action that the registrant has taken or proposes to take in response 
to any such circumstances.
    (ii) As used in this paragraph (a)(4), the term off-balance sheet 
arrangement means any transaction, agreement or other contractual 
arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a 
party, under which the registrant has:
    (A) Any obligation under a guarantee contract that has any of the 
characteristics identified in paragraph 3 of FASB Interpretation No. 45, 
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for

[[Page 375]]

Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others 
(November 2002) (``FIN 45''), as may be modified or supplemented, and 
that is not excluded from the initial recognition and measurement 
provisions of FIN 45 pursuant to paragraphs 6 or 7 of that 
Interpretation;
    (B) A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an 
unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, 
liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets;
    (C) Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a 
contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except 
that it is both indexed to the registrant's own stock and classified in 
stockholders' equity in the registrant's statement of financial 
position, and therefore excluded from the scope of FASB Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities (June 1998), pursuant to paragraph 
11(a) of that Statement, as may be modified or supplemented; or
    (D) Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out 
of a variable interest (as referenced in FASB Interpretation No. 46, 
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (January 2003), as may be 
modified or supplemented) in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, 
and material to, the registrant, where such entity provides financing, 
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, 
hedging or research and development services with, the registrant.
    (5) Tabular disclosure of contractual obligations. (i) In a tabular 
format, provide the information specified in this paragraph (a)(5) as of 
the latest fiscal year end balance sheet date with respect to the 
registrant's known contractual obligations specified in the table that 
follows this paragraph (a)(5)(i). The registrant shall provide amounts, 
aggregated by type of contractual obligation. The registrant may 
disaggregate the specified categories of contractual obligations using 
other categories suitable to its business, but the presentation must 
include all of the obligations of the registrant that fall within the 
specified categories. A presentation covering at least the periods 
specified shall be included. The tabular presentation may be accompanied 
by footnotes to describe provisions that create, increase or accelerate 
obligations, or other pertinent data to the extent necessary for an 
understanding of the timing and amount of the registrant's specified 
contractual obligations.

    (ii) Definitions: The following definitions apply to this paragraph 
(a)(5):
    (A) Long-Term Debt Obligation means a payment obligation under long-
term borrowings referenced in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 47 Disclosure of Long-Term Obligations (March 1981), as 
may be modified or supplemented.
    (B) Capital Lease Obligation means a payment obligation under a 
lease classified as a capital lease pursuant to FASB Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 Accounting for Leases (November 
1976), as may be modified or supplemented.
    (C) Operating Lease Obligation means a payment obligation under a 
lease classified as an operating lease and disclosed pursuant to FASB 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13

[[Page 376]]

Accounting for Leases (November 1976), as may be modified or 
supplemented.
    (D) Purchase Obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or 
services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that 
specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities 
to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the 
approximate timing of the transaction.

Instructions to paragraph 303(a): 1. The registrant's discussion and 
analysis shall be of the financial statements and other statistical data 
that the registrant believes will enhance a reader's understanding of 
its financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of 
operations. Generally, the discussion shall cover the three-year period 
covered by the financial statements and shall use year-to-year 
comparisons or any other formats that in the registrant's judgment 
enhance a reader's understanding. However, where trend information is 
relevant, reference to the five-year selected financial data appearing 
pursuant to Item 301 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.301) may be necessary. 
A smaller reporting company's discussion shall cover the two-year period 
required in Article 8 of Regulation S-X and shall use year-to-year 
comparisons or any other formats that in the registrant's judgment 
enhance a reader's understanding.
    2. The purpose of the discussion and analysis shall be to provide to 
investors and other users information relevant to an assessment of the 
financial condition and results of operations of the registrant as 
determined by evaluating the amounts and certainty of cash flows from 
operations and from outside sources.
    3. The discussion and analysis shall focus specifically on material 
events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported 
financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future 
operating results or of future financial condition. This would include 
descriptions and amounts of (A) matters that would have an impact on 
future operations and have not had an impact in the past, and (B) 
matters that have had an impact on reported operations and are not 
expected to have an impact upon future operations.
    4. Where the consolidated financial statements reveal material 
changes from year to year in one or more line items, the causes for the 
changes shall be described to the extent necesary to an understanding of 
the registrant's businesses as a whole; Provided, however, That if the 
causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no 
repetition is required and a line-by-line analysis of the financial 
statements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate. 
Registrants need not recite the amounts of changes from year to year 
which are readily computable from the financial statements. The 
discussion shall not merely repeat numerical data contained in the 
consolidated financial statements.
    5. The term ``liquidity'' as used in this Item refers to the ability 
of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the 
enterprise's needs for cash. Except where it is otherwise clear from the 
discussion, the registrant shall indicate those balance sheet conditions 
or income or cash flow items which the registrant believes may be 
indicators of its liquidity condition. Liquidity generally shall be 
discussed on both a long-term and short-term basis. The issue of 
liquidity shall be discussed in the context of the registrant's own 
business or businesses. For example a discussion of working capital may 
be appropriate for certain manufacturing, industrial or related 
operations but might be inappropriate for a bank or public utility.
    6. Where financial statements presented or incorporated by reference 
in the registration statement are required by Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3) of 
Regulation S-X [17 CFR part 210] to include disclosure of restrictions 
on the ability of both consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries to 
transfer funds to the registrant in the form of cash dividends, loans or 
advances, the discussion of liquidity shall include a discussion of the 
nature and extent of such restrictions and the impact such restrictions 
have had and are expected to have on the ability of the parent company 
to meet its cash obligations.
    7. Any forward-looking information supplied is expressly covered by 
the safe harbor rule for projections. See Rule 175 under the Securities 
Act [17 CFR 230.175], Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.3b-6] 
and Securities Act Release No. 6084 (June 25, 1979) (44 FR 38810).
    8. Registrants are only required to discuss the effects of inflation 
and other changes in prices when considered material. This discussion 
may be made in whatever manner appears appropriate under the 
circumstances. All that is required is a brief textual presentation of 
management's views. No specific numerical financial data need be 
presented except as Rule 3-20(c) of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.3-20(c) of 
this chapter) otherwise requires. However, registrants may elect to 
voluntarily disclose supplemental information on the effects of changing 
prices as provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 89, ``Financial Reporting and Changing Prices'' or through other 
supplemental disclosures. The Commission encourages experimentation with 
these disclosures in order to provide the most meaningful presentation 
of the impact of price changes on the registrant's financial statements.

[[Page 377]]

    9. Registrants that elect to disclose supplementary information on 
the effects of changing prices as specified by SFAS No. 89, ``Financial 
Reporting and Changing Prices,'' may combine such explanations with the 
discussion and analysis required pursuant to this Item or may supply 
such information separately with appropriate cross reference.
    10. All references to the registrant in the discussion and in this 
Item shall mean the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated.
    11. Foreign private registrants also shall discuss briefly any 
pertinent governmental economic, fiscal, monetary, or political policies 
or factors that have materially affected or could materially affect, 
directly or indirectly, their operations or investments by United States 
nationals.
    12. If the registrant is a foreign private issuer, the discussion 
shall focus on the primary financial statements presented in the 
registration statement or report. There shall be a reference to the 
reconciliation to United States generally accepted accounting 
principles, and a discussion of any aspects of the difference between 
foreign and United States generally accepted accounting principles, not 
discussed in the reconciliation, that the registrant believes is 
necessary for an understanding of the financial statements as a whole.
    13. The attention of bank holding companies is directed to the 
information called for in Guide 3 (Sec. 229.801(c) and Sec. 
229.802(c)).
    14. The attention of property-casualty insurance companies is 
directed to the information called for in Guide 6 (Sec. 229.801(f)).
    Instructions to paragraph 303(a)(4): 1. No obligation to make 
disclosure under paragraph (a)(4) of this Item shall arise in respect of 
an off-balance sheet arrangement until a definitive agreement that is 
unconditionally binding or subject only to customary closing conditions 
exists or, if there is no such agreement, when settlement of the 
transaction occurs.
    2. Registrants should aggregate off-balance sheet arrangements in 
groups or categories that provide material information in an efficient 
and understandable manner and should avoid repetition and disclosure of 
immaterial information. Effects that are common or similar with respect 
to a number of off-balance sheet arrangements must be analyzed in the 
aggregate to the extent the aggregation increases understanding. 
Distinctions in arrangements and their effects must be discussed to the 
extent the information is material, but the discussion should avoid 
repetition and disclosure of immaterial information.
    3. For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this Item only, contingent 
liabilities arising out of litigation, arbitration or regulatory actions 
are not considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements.
    4. Generally, the disclosure required by paragraph (a)(4) shall 
cover the most recent fiscal year. However, the discussion should 
address changes from the previous year where such discussion is 
necessary to an understanding of the disclosure.
    5. In satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this Item, 
the discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements need not repeat 
information provided in the footnotes to the financial statements, 
provided that such discussion clearly cross-references to specific 
information in the relevant footnotes and integrates the substance of 
the footnotes into such discussion in a manner designed to inform 
readers of the significance of the information that is not included 
within the body of such discussion.

    (b) Interim periods. If interim period financial statements are 
included or are required to be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X 
(17 CFR 210), a management's discussion and analysis of the financial 
condition and results of operations shall be provided so as to enable 
the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results 
of operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (b) (1) and 
(2) of this Item. The discussion and analysis shall include a discussion 
of material changes in those items specifically listed in paragraph (a) 
of this Item, except that the impact of inflation and changing prices on 
operations for interim periods need not be addressed.
    (1) Material changes in financial condition. Discuss any material 
changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year 
to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the 
interim financial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the 
corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material 
changes in financial condition from that date to the date of the most 
recent interim balance sheet provided also shall be discussed. If 
discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim 
date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be 
combined at the discretion of the registrant.
    (2) Material changes in results of operations. Discuss any material 
changes in the registrant's results of operations with respect to the 
most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is 
provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of

[[Page 378]]

the preceding fiscal year. If the registrant is required to or has 
elected to provide an income statement for the most recent fiscal 
quarter, such discussion also shall cover material changes with respect 
to that fiscal quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the 
preceding fiscal year. In addition, if the registrant has elected to 
provide an income statement for the twelve-month period ended as of the 
date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided, the discussion 
also shall cover material changes with respect to that twelve-month 
period and the twelve-month period ended as of the corresponding interim 
balance sheet date of the preceding fiscal year. Notwithstanding the 
above, if for purposes of a registration statement a registrant subject 
to paragraph (b) of Sec. 210.3-03 of Regulation S-X provides a 
statement of income for the twelve-month period ended as of the date of 
the most recent interim balance sheet provided in lieu of the interim 
income statements otherwise required, the discussion of material changes 
in that twelve-month period will be in respect to the preceding fiscal 
year rather than the corresponding preceding period.

Instructions to paragraph (b) of Item 303: 1. If interim financial 
statements are presented together with financial statements for full 
fiscal years, the discussion of the interim financial information shall 
be prepared pursuant to this paragraph (b) and the discussion of the 
full fiscal year's information shall be prepared pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this Item. Such discussions may be combined.
    2. In preparing the discussion and analysis required by this 
paragraph (b), the registrant may presume that users of the interim 
financial information have read or have access to the discussion and 
analysis required by paragraph (a) for the preceding fiscal year.
    3. The discussion and analysis required by this paragraph (b) is 
required to focus only on material changes. Where the interim financial 
statements reveal material changes from period to period in one or more 
significant line items, the causes for the changes shall be described if 
they have not already been disclosed: Provided, however, That if the 
causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no 
repetition is required. Registrants need not recite the amounts of 
changes from period to period which are readily computable from the 
financial statements. The discussion shall not merely repeat numerical 
data contained in the financial statements. The information provided 
shall include that which is available to the registrant without undue 
effort or expense and which does not clearly appear in the registrant's 
condensed interim financial statements.
    4. The registrant's discussion of material changes in results of 
operations shall identify any significant elements of the registrant's 
income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from or are 
not necessarily representative of the registrant's ongoing business.
    5. The registrant shall discuss any seasonal aspects of its business 
which have had a material effect upon its financial condition or results 
of operation.
    6. Any forward-looking information supplied is expressly covered by 
the safe harbor rule for projections. See Rule 175 under the Securities 
Act [17 CFR 230. 175], Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 249.3b-
6] and Securities Act Release No. 6084 (June 25, 1979) (44 FR 38810).
    7. The registrant is not required to include the table required by 
paragraph (a)(5) of this Item for interim periods. Instead, the 
registrant should disclose material changes outside the ordinary course 
of the registrant's business in the specified contractual obligations 
during the interim period.
    (c) Safe harbor. (1) The safe harbor provided in section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77z-2) and section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u-5) (``statutory safe 
harbors'') shall apply to forward-looking information provided pursuant 
to paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this Item, provided that the disclosure 
is made by: an issuer; a person acting on behalf of the issuer; an 
outside reviewer retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of 
the issuer; or an underwriter, with respect to information provided by 
the issuer or information derived from information provided by the 
issuer.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this Item only:
    (i) All information required by paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this 
Item is deemed to be a forward looking statement as that term is defined 
in the statutory safe harbors, except for historical facts.
    (ii) With respect to paragraph (a)(4) of this Item, the meaningful 
cautionary statements element of the statutory safe harbors will be 
satisfied if a registrant satisfies all requirements of that same 
paragraph (a)(4) of this Item.

[[Page 379]]

    (d) Smaller reporting companies. A smaller reporting company, as 
defined by Sec. 229.10(f)(1), may provide the information required in 
paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this Item for the last two most recent fiscal 
years of the registrant if it provides financial information on net 
sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations for only two 
years. A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the 
information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item.

Sec. 229.304  (Item 304) Changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.

    (a)(1) If during the registrant's two most recent fiscal years or 
any subsequent interim period, an independent accountant who was 
previously engaged as the principal accountant to audit the registrant's 
financial statements, or an independent accountant who was previously 
engaged to audit a significant subsidiary and on whom the principal 
accountant expressed reliance in its report, has resigned (or indicated 
it has declined to stand for re-election after the completion of the 
current audit) or was dismissed, then the registrant shall:
    (i) State whether the former accountant resigned, declined to stand 
for re-election or was dismissed and the date thereof.
    (ii) State whether the principal accountant's report on the 
financial statements for either of the past two years contained an 
adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified or modified 
as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles; and also 
describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, 
modification, or qualification.
    (iii) State whether the decision to change accountants was 
recommended or approved by:
    (A) Any audit or similar committee of the board of directors, if the 
issuer has such a committee; or
    (B) The board of directors, if the issuer has no such committee.
    (iv) State whether during the registrant's two most recent fiscal 
years and any subsequent interim period preceding such resignation, 
declination or dismissal there were any disagreements with the former 
accountant on any matter of accounting principles or practices, 
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which 
disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former 
accountant, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter 
of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report. Also, (A) describe 
each such disagreement; (B) state whether any audit or similar committee 
of the board of directors, or the board of directors, discussed the 
subject matter of each of such disagreements with the former accountant; 
and (C) state whether the registrant has authorized the former 
accountant to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor accountant 
concerning the subject matter of each of such disagreements and, if not, 
describe the nature of any limitation thereon and the reason therefore. 
The disagreements required to be reported in response to this Item 
include both those resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction and 
those not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. 
Disagreements contemplated by this Item are those that occur at the 
decision-making level, i.e., between personnel of the registrant 
responsible for presentation of its financial statements and personnel 
of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report.
    (v) Provide the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
Item for each of the kinds of events (even though the registrant and the 
former accountant did not express a difference of opinion regarding the 
event) listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v) (A) through (D) of this section, 
that occurred within the registrant's two most recent fiscal years and 
any subsequent interim period preceding the former accountant's 
resignation, declination to stand for re-election, or dismissal 
(``reportable events''). If the event led to a disagreement or 
difference of opinion, then the event should be reported as a 
disagreement under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) and

[[Page 380]]

need not be repeated under this paragraph.
    (A) The accountant's having advised the registrant that the internal 
controls necessary for the registrant to develop reliable financial 
statements do not exist;
    (B) The accountant's having advised the registrant that information 
has come to the accountant's attention that has led it to no longer be 
able to rely on management's representations, or that has made it 
unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by 
management;
    (C) (1) The accountant's having advised the registrant of the need 
to expand significantly the scope of its audit, or that information has 
come to the accountant's attention during the time period covered by 
Item 304(a)(1)(iv), that if further investigated may:
    (i) Materially impact the fairness or reliability of either: a 
previously issued audit report or the underlying financial statements; 
or the financial statements issued or to be issued covering the fiscal 
period(s) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements 
covered by an audit report (including information that may prevent it 
from rendering an unqualified audit report on those financial 
statements), or
    (ii) Cause it to be unwilling to rely on management's 
representations or be associated with the registrant's financial 
statements, and
    (2) Due to the accountant's resignation (due to audit scope 
limitations or otherwise) or dismissal, or for any other reason, the 
accountant did not so expand the scope of its audit or conduct such 
further investigation; or
    (D)(1) The accountant's having advised the registrant that 
information has come to the accountant's attention that it has concluded 
materially impacts the fairness or reliability of either (i) a 
previously issued audit report or the underlying financial statements, 
or (ii) the financial statements issued or to be issued covering the 
fiscal period(s) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial 
statements covered by an audit report (including information that, 
unless resolved to the accountant's satisfaction, would prevent it from 
rendering an unqualified audit report on those financial statements), 
and
    (2) Due to the accountant's resignation, dismissal or declination to 
stand for re-election, or for any other reason, the issue has not been 
resolved to the accountant's satisfaction prior to its resignation, 
dismissal or declination to stand for re-election.
    (2) If during the registrant's two most recent fiscal years or any 
subsequent interim period, a new independent accountant has been engaged 
as either the principal accountant to audit the registrant's financial 
statements, or as an independent accountant to audit a significant 
subsidiary and on whom the principal accountant is expected to express 
reliance in its report, then the registrant shall identify the newly 
engaged accountant and indicate the date of such accountant's 
engagement. In addition, if during the registrant's two most recent 
fiscal years, and any subsequent interim period prior to engaging that 
accountant, the registrant (or someone on its behalf) consulted the 
newly engaged accountant regarding:
    (i) Either: The application of accounting principles to a specified 
transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion 
that might be rendered on the registrant's financial statements, and 
either a written report was provided to the registrant or oral advice 
was provided that the new accountant concluded was an important factor 
considered by the registrant in reaching a decision as to the 
accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or
    (ii) Any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as 
defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) and the related instructions to this 
item) or a reportable event (as described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v)), 
then the registrant shall:
    (A) So state and identify the issues that were the subjects of those 
consultations;
    (B) Briefly describe the views of the newly engaged accountant as 
expressed orally or in writing to the registrant on each such issue and, 
if written views were received by the registrant, file

[[Page 381]]

them as an exhibit to the report or registration statement requiring 
compliance with this Item 304(a);
    (C) State whether the former accountant was consulted by the 
registrant regarding any such issues, and if so, provide a summary of 
the former accountant's views; and
    (D) Request the newly engaged accountant to review the disclosure 
required by this Item 304(a) before it is filed with the Commission and 
provide the new accountant the opportunity to furnish the registrant 
with a letter addressed to the Commission containing any new 
information, clarification of the registrant's expression of its views, 
or the respects in which it does not agree with the statements made by 
the registrant in response to Item 304(a). The registrant shall file any 
such letter as an exhibit to the report or registration statement 
containing the disclosure required by this Item.
    (3) The registrant shall provide the former accountant with a copy 
of the disclosures it is making in response to this Item 304(a) that the 
former accountant shall receive no later than the day that the 
disclosures are filed with the Commission. The registrant shall request 
the former accountant to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed 
to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by 
the registrant in response to this Item 304(a) and, if not, stating the 
respects in which it does not agree. The registrant shall file the 
former accountant's letter as an exhibit to the report on registration 
statement containing this disclosure. If the former accountant's letter 
is unavailable at the time of filing such report or registration 
statement, then the registrant shall request the former accountant to 
provide the letter as promptly as possible so that the registrant can 
file the letter with the Commission within ten business days after the 
filing of the report or registration statement. Notwithstanding the ten 
business day period, the registrant shall file the letter by amendment 
within two business days of receipt; if the letter is received on a 
Saturday, Sunday or holiday on which the Commission is not open for 
business, then the two business day period shall begin to run on and 
shall include the first business day thereafter. The former accountant 
may provide the registrant with an interim letter highlighting specific 
areas of concern and indicating that a more detailed letter will be 
forthcoming within the ten business day period noted above. If not filed 
with the report or registration statement containing the registrant's 
disclosure under this Item 304(a), then the interim letter, if any, 
shall be filed by the registrant by amendment within two business days 
of receipt.
    (b) If: (1) In connection with a change in accountants subject to 
paragraph (a) of this Item 304, there was any disagreement of the type 
described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) or any reportable event as described 
in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this Item;
    (2) During the fiscal year in which the change in accountants took 
place or during the subsequent fiscal year, there have been any 
transactions or events similar to those which involved such disagreement 
or reportable event; and
    (3) Such transactions or events were material and were accounted for 
or disclosed in a manner different from that which the former 
accountants apparently would have concluded was required, the registrant 
shall state the existence and nature of the disagreement or reportable 
event and also state the effect on the financial statements if the 
method had been followed which the former accountants apparently would 
have concluded was required.

These disclosures need not be made if the method asserted by the former 
accountants ceases to be generally accepted because of authoritative 
standards or interpretations subsequently issued.

Instructions to Item 304: 1. The disclosure called for by paragraph (a) 
of this Item need not be provided if it has been previously reported as 
that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 
240.12b-2 of this chapter); the disclosure called for by paragraph (a) 
must be provided, however, notwithstanding prior disclosure, if required 
pursuant to Item 9 of Schedule 14A (Sec. 240.14a-101 of this chapter). 
The disclosure called for by paragraph (b) of this section must be 
furnished, where required, notwithstanding any prior disclosure about 
accountant changes or disagreements.

[[Page 382]]

    2. When disclosure is required by paragraph (a) of this section in 
an annual report to security holders pursuant to Rule 14a-3 (Sec. 
240.14a-3 of this chapter) or Rule 14c-3 (Sec. 240.14c-3 of this 
chapter), or in a proxy or information statement filed pursuant to the 
requirements of Schedule 14A or 14C (Sec. 240.14a-101 or Sec. 240.14c-
101 of this chapter), in lieu of a letter pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(D) or (a)(3), prior to filing such materials with or furnishing 
such materials to the Commission, the registrant shall furnish the 
disclosure required by paragraph (a) of this section to any former 
accountant engaged by the registrant during the period set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section and to the newly engaged accountant. If 
any such accountant believes that the statements made in response to 
paragraph (a) of this section are incorrect or incomplete, it may 
present its views in a brief statement, ordinarily expected not to 
exceed 200 words, to be included in the annual report or proxy or 
information statement. This statement shall be submitted to the 
registrant within ten business days of the date the accountant receives 
the registrant's disclosure. Further, unless the written views of the 
newly engaged accountant required to be filed as an exhibit by paragraph 
(a)(2)(B) of this Item 304 have been previously filed with the 
Commission the registrant shall file a Form 8-K concurrently with the 
annual report or proxy or information statement for the purpose of 
filing the written views as exhibits thereto.
    3. The information required by Item 304(a) need not be provided for 
a company being acquired by the registrant that is not subject to the 
filing requirements of either section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act, or, because of section 12(i) of the Exchange Act, has not furnished 
an annual report to security holders pursuant to Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-
3 for its latest fiscal year.
    4. The term ``disagreements'' as used in this Item shall be 
interpreted broadly, to include any difference of opinion concerning any 
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement 
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which (if not resolved to the 
satisfaction of the former accountant) would have caused it to make 
reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with 
its report. It is not necessary for there to have been an argument to 
have had a disagreement, merely a difference of opinion. For purposes of 
this Item, however, the term disagreements does not include initial 
differences of opinion based on incomplete facts or preliminary 
information that were later resolved to the former accountant's 
satisfaction by, and providing the registrant and the accountant do not 
continue to have a difference of opinion upon, obtaining additional 
relevant facts or information.
    5. In determining whether any disagreement or reportable event has 
occurred, an oral communication from the engagement partner or another 
person responsible for rendering the accounting firm's opinion (or their 
designee) will generally suffice as the accountant advising the 
registrant of a reportable event or as a statement of a disagreement at 
the ``decision-making level'' within the accounting firm and require 
disclosure under this Item.

<R05>
Sec. 229.305  (Item 305) Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

    (a) Quantitative information about market risk. (1) Registrants 
shall provide, in their reporting currency, quantitative information 
about market risk as of the end of the latest fiscal year, in accordance 
with one of the following three disclosure alternatives. In preparing 
this quantitative information, registrants shall categorize market risk 
sensitive instruments into instruments entered into for trading purposes 
and instruments entered into for purposes other than trading purposes. 
Within both the trading and other than trading portfolios, separate 
quantitative information shall be presented, to the extent material, for 
each market risk exposure category (i.e., interest rate risk, foreign 
currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other relevant 
market risks, such as equity price risk). A registrant may use one of 
the three alternatives set forth in this section for all of the required 
quantitative disclosures about market risk. A registrant also may 
choose, from among the three alternatives, one disclosure alternative 
for market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
and another disclosure alternative for market risk sensitive instruments 
entered into for other than trading purposes. Alternatively, a 
registrant may choose any disclosure alternative, from among the three 
alternatives, for each risk exposure category within the trading and 
other than trading portfolios. The three disclosure alternatives are:
    (i)(A)(1) Tabular presentation of information related to market risk 
sensitive instruments; such information shall include fair values of the 
market

[[Page 383]]

risk sensitive instruments and contract terms sufficient to determine 
future cash flows from those instruments, categorized by expected 
maturity dates.
    (2) Tabular information relating to contract terms shall allow 
readers of the table to determine expected cash flows from the market 
risk sensitive instruments for each of the next five years. Comparable 
tabular information for any remaining years shall be displayed as an 
aggregate amount.
    (3) Within each risk exposure category, the market risk sensitive 
instruments shall be grouped based on common characteristics. Within the 
foreign currency exchange rate risk category, the market risk sensitive 
instruments shall be grouped by functional currency and within the 
commodity price risk category, the market risk sensitive instruments 
shall be grouped by type of commodity.
    (4) See the Appendix to this Item for a suggested format for 
presentation of this information; and
    (B) Registrants shall provide a description of the contents of the 
table and any related assumptions necessary to understand the 
disclosures required under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this Item 305; or
    (ii)(A) Sensitivity analysis disclosures that express the potential 
loss in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk 
sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical 
changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity 
prices, and other relevant market rates or prices over a selected period 
of time. The magnitude of selected hypothetical changes in rates or 
prices may differ among and within market risk exposure categories; and
    (B) Registrants shall provide a description of the model, 
assumptions, and parameters, which are necessary to understand the 
disclosures required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this Item 305; or
    (iii)(A) Value at risk disclosures that express the potential loss 
in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk sensitive 
instruments over a selected period of time, with a selected likelihood 
of occurrence, from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices;
    (B)(1) For each category for which value at risk disclosures are 
required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this Item 305, provide 
either:
    (i) The average, high and low amounts, or the distribution of the 
value at risk amounts for the reporting period; or
    (ii) The average, high and low amounts, or the distribution of 
actual changes in fair values, earnings, or cash flows from the market 
risk sensitive instruments occurring during the reporting period; or
    (iii) The percentage or number of times the actual changes in fair 
values, earnings, or cash flows from the market risk sensitive 
instruments exceeded the value at risk amounts during the reporting 
period;
    (2) Information required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B)(1) of this 
Item 305 is not required for the first fiscal year end in which a 
registrant must present Item 305 information; and
    (C) Registrants shall provide a description of the model, 
assumptions, and parameters, which are necessary to understand the 
disclosures required under paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this 
Item 305.
    (2) Registrants shall discuss material limitations that cause the 
information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this Item 305 not to 
reflect fully the net market risk exposures of the entity. This 
discussion shall include summarized descriptions of instruments, 
positions, and transactions omitted from the quantitative market risk 
disclosure information or the features of instruments, positions, and 
transactions that are included, but not reflected fully in the 
quantitative market risk disclosure information.
    (3) Registrants shall present summarized market risk information for 
the preceding fiscal year. In addition, registrants shall discuss the 
reasons for material quantitative changes in market risk exposures 
between the current and preceding fiscal years. Information required by 
this paragraph (a)(3), however, is not required if disclosure is not 
required under paragraph (a)(1) of this

[[Page 384]]

Item 305 for the current fiscal year. Information required by this 
paragraph (a)(3) is not required for the first fiscal year end in which 
a registrant must present Item 305 information.
    (4) If registrants change disclosure alternatives or key model 
characteristics, assumptions, and parameters used in providing 
quantitative information about market risk (e.g., changing from tabular 
presentation to value at risk, changing the scope of instruments 
included in the model, or changing the definition of loss from fair 
values to earnings), and if the effects of any such change is material, 
the registrant shall:
    (i) Explain the reasons for the change; and
    (ii) Either provide summarized comparable information, under the new 
disclosure method, for the year preceding the current year or, in 
addition to providing disclosure for the current year under the new 
method, provide disclosures for the current year and preceding fiscal 
year under the method used in the preceding year.

Instructions to paragraph 305(a): 1. Under paragraph 305(a)(1):
    A. For each market risk exposure category within the trading and 
other than trading portfolios, registrants may report the average, high, 
and low sensitivity analysis or value at risk amounts for the reporting 
period, as an alternative to reporting year-end amounts.
    B. In determining the average, high, and low amounts for the fiscal 
year under instruction 1.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 305(a), 
registrants should use sensitivity analysis or value at risk amounts 
relating to at least four equal time periods throughout the reporting 
period (e.g., four quarter-end amounts, 12 month-end amounts, or 52 
week-end amounts).
    C. Functional currency means functional currency as defined by 
generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, ``Foreign Currency Translation'', 
(``FAS 52'') paragraph 20 (December 1981)).
    D. Registrants using the sensitivity analysis and value at risk 
disclosure alternatives are encouraged, but not required, to provide 
quantitative amounts that reflect the aggregate market risk inherent in 
the trading and other than trading portfolios.
    2. Under paragraph 305(a)(1)(i):
    A. Examples of contract terms sufficient to determine future cash 
flows from market risk sensitive instruments include, but are not 
limited to:
    i. Debt instruments--principal amounts and weighted average 
effective interest rates;
    ii. Forwards and futures--contract amounts and weighted average 
settlement prices;
    iii. Options--contract amounts and weighted average strike prices;
    iv. Swaps--notional amounts, weighted average pay rates or prices, 
and weighted average receive rates or prices; and
    v. Complex instruments--likely to be a combination of the contract 
terms presented in 2.A.i. through iv. of this Instruction;
    B. When grouping based on common characteristics, instruments should 
be categorized, at a minimum, by the following characteristics, when 
material:
    i. Fixed rate or variable rate assets or liabilities;
    ii. Long or short forwards and futures;
    iii. Written or purchased put or call options with similar strike 
prices;
    iv. Receive fixed and pay variable swaps, receive variable and pay 
fixed swaps, and receive variable and pay variable swaps;
    v. The currency in which the instruments' cash flows are 
denominated;
    vi. Financial instruments for which foreign currency transaction 
gains and losses are reported in the same manner as translation 
adjustments under generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., 
FAS 52 paragraph 20 (December 1981)); and
    vii. Derivatives used to manage risks inherent in anticipated 
transactions;
    C. Registrants may aggregate information regarding functional 
currencies that are economically related, managed together for internal 
risk management purposes, and have statistical correlations of greater 
than 75% over each of the past three years;
    D. Market risk sensitive instruments that are exposed to rate or 
price changes in more than one market risk exposure category should be 
presented within the tabular information for each of the risk exposure 
categories to which those instruments are exposed;
    E. If a currency swap (see, e.g., FAS 52 Appendix E for a definition 
of currency swap) eliminates all foreign currency exposures in the cash 
flows of a foreign currency denominated debt instrument, neither the 
currency swap nor the foreign currency denominated debt instrument are 
required to be disclosed in the foreign currency risk exposure category. 
However, both the currency swap and the foreign currency denominated 
debt instrument should be disclosed in the interest rate risk exposure 
category; and
    F. The contents of the table and related assumptions that should be 
described include, but are not limited to:
    i. The different amounts reported in the table for various 
categories of the market risk sensitive instruments (e.g., principal

[[Page 385]]

amounts for debt, notional amounts for swaps, and contract amounts for 
options and futures);
    ii. The different types of reported market rates or prices (e.g., 
contractual rates or prices, spot rates or prices, forward rates or 
prices); and
    iii. Key prepayment or reinvestment assumptions relating to the 
timing of reported amounts.
    3. Under paragraph 305(a)(1)(ii):
    A. Registrants should select hypothetical changes in market rates or 
prices that are expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term 
changes in those rates and prices. In this regard, absent economic 
justification for the selection of a different amount, registrants 
should use changes that are not less than 10 percent of end of period 
market rates or prices;
    B. For purposes of instruction 3.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 
305(a), the term reasonably possible has the same meaning as defined by 
generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, ``Accounting for Contingencies,'' 
(``FAS 5'') paragraph 3 (March 1975));
    C. For purposes of instruction 3.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 
305(a), the term near term means a period of time going forward up to 
one year from the date of the financial statements (see generally AICPA, 
Statement of Position 94-6, ``Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks 
and Uncertainties,'' (``SOP 94-6'') at paragraph 7 (December 30, 1994));
    D. Market risk sensitive instruments that are exposed to rate or 
price changes in more than one market risk exposure category should be 
included in the sensitivity analysis disclosures for each market risk 
category to which those instruments are exposed;
    E. Registrants with multiple foreign currency exchange rate 
exposures should prepare foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
disclosures that measure the aggregate sensitivity to changes in all 
foreign currency exchange rate exposures, including the effects of 
changes in both transactional currency/functional currency exchange rate 
exposures and functional currency/reporting currency exchange rate 
exposures. For example, assume a French division of a registrant 
presenting its financial statements in U.S. dollars ($US) invests in a 
deutschmark(DM)-denominated debt security. In these circumstances, the 
$US is the reporting currency and the DM is the transactional currency. 
In addition, assume this division determines that the French franc (FF) 
is its functional currency according to FAS 52. In preparing the foreign 
currency sensitivity analysis disclosures, this registrant should report 
the aggregate potential loss from hypothetical changes in both the DM/FF 
exchange rate exposure and the FF/$US exchange rate exposure; and
    F. Model, assumptions, and parameters that should be described 
include, but are not limited to, how loss is defined by the model (e.g., 
loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows), a general description of 
the modeling technique (e.g., duration modeling, modeling that measures 
the change in net present values arising from selected hypothetical 
changes in market rates or prices, and a description as to how 
optionality is addressed by the model), the types of instruments covered 
by the model (e.g., derivative financial instruments, other financial 
instruments, derivative commodity instruments, and whether other 
instruments are included voluntarily, such as certain commodity 
instruments and positions, cash flows from anticipated transactions, and 
certain financial instruments excluded under instruction 3.C.ii. of the 
General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b)), and other 
relevant information about the model's assumptions and parameters, 
(e.g., the magnitude and timing of selected hypothetical changes in 
market rates or prices used, the method by which discount rates are 
determined, and key prepayment or reinvestment assumptions).
    4. Under paragraph 305(a)(1)(iii):
    A. The confidence intervals selected should reflect reasonably 
possible near-term changes in market rates and prices. In this regard, 
absent economic justification for the selection of different confidence 
intervals, registrants should use intervals that are 95 percent or 
higher;
    B. For purposes of instruction 4.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 
305(a), the term reasonably possible has the same meaning as defined by 
generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FAS 5, paragraph 3 
(March 1975));
    C. For purposes of instruction 4.A. of the Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a), the term near term means a period of time going 
forward up to one year from the date of the financial statements (see 
generally SOP 94-6, at paragraph 7 (December 30, 1994));
    D. Registrants with multiple foreign currency exchange rate 
exposures should prepare foreign currency value at risk analysis 
disclosures that measure the aggregate sensitivity to changes in all 
foreign currency exchange rate exposures, including the aggregate 
effects of changes in both transactional currency/functional currency 
exchange rate exposures and functional currency/reporting currency 
exchange rate exposures. For example, assume a French division of a 
registrant presenting its financial statements in U.S. dollars ($US) 
invests in a deutschmark(DM)-denominated debt security. In these 
circumstances, the $US is the reporting currency and the DM is the 
transactional currency. In addition, assume this division determines 
that the French franc

[[Page 386]]

(FF) is its functional currency according to FAS 52. In preparing the 
foreign currency value at risk disclosures, this registrant should 
report the aggregate potential loss from hypothetical changes in both 
the DM/FF exchange rate exposure and the FF/$US exchange rate exposure; 
and
    E. Model, assumptions, and parameters that should be described 
include, but are not limited to, how loss is defined by the model (e.g., 
loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows), the type of model used 
(e.g., variance/covariance, historical simulation, or Monte Carlo 
simulation and a description as to how optionality is addressed by the 
model), the types of instruments covered by the model (e.g., derivative 
financial instruments, other financial instruments, derivative commodity 
instruments, and whether other instruments are included voluntarily, 
such as certain commodity instruments and positions, cash flows from 
anticipated transactions, and certain financial instruments excluded 
under instruction 3.C.ii. of the General Instructions to Paragraphs 
305(a) and 305(b)), and other relevant information about the model's 
assumptions and parameters, (e.g., holding periods, confidence 
intervals, and, when appropriate, the methods used for aggregating value 
at risk amounts across market risk exposure categories, such as by 
assuming perfect positive correlation, independence, or actual observed 
correlation).
    5. Under paragraph 305(a)(2), limitations that should be considered 
include, but are not limited to:
    A. The exclusion of certain market risk sensitive instruments, 
positions, and transactions from the disclosures required under 
paragraph 305(a)(1) (e.g., derivative commodity instruments not 
permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with 
another financial instrument, commodity positions, cash flows from 
anticipated transactions, and certain financial instruments excluded 
under instruction 3.C.ii. of the General Instructions to Paragraphs 
305(a) and 305(b)). Failure to include such instruments, positions, and 
transactions in preparing the disclosures under paragraph 305(a)(1) may 
be a limitation because the resulting disclosures may not fully reflect 
the net market risk of a registrant; and
    B. The ability of disclosures required under paragraph 305(a)(1) to 
reflect fully the market risk that may be inherent in instruments with 
leverage, option, or prepayment features (e.g., options, including 
written options, structured notes, collateralized mortgage obligations, 
leveraged swaps, and options embedded in swaps).

    (b) Qualitative information about market risk. (1) To the extent 
material, describe:
    (i) The registrant's primary market risk exposures;
    (ii) How those exposures are managed. Such descriptions shall 
include, but not be limited to, a discussion of the objectives, general 
strategies, and instruments, if any, used to manage those exposures; and
    (iii) Changes in either the registrant's primary market risk 
exposures or how those exposures are managed, when compared to what was 
in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year and what is 
known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.
    (2) Qualitative information about market risk shall be presented 
separately for market risk sensitive instruments entered into for 
trading purposes and those entered into for purposes other than trading.

Instructions to paragraph 305(b): 1. For purposes of disclosure under 
paragraph 305(b), primary market risk exposures means:
    A. The following categories of market risk: interest rate risk, 
foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other 
relevant market rate or price risks (e.g., equity price risk); and
    B. Within each of these categories, the particular markets that 
present the primary risk of loss to the registrant. For example, if a 
registrant has a material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate 
risk and, within this category of market risk, is most vulnerable to 
changes in dollar/yen, dollar/pound, and dollar/peso exchange rates, the 
registrant should disclose those exposures. Similarly, if a registrant 
has a material exposure to interest rate risk and, within this category 
of market risk, is most vulnerable to changes in short-term U.S. prime 
interest rates, it should disclose the existence of that exposure.
    2. For purposes of disclosure under paragraph 305(b), registrants 
should describe primary market risk exposures that exist as of the end 
of the latest fiscal year, and how those exposures are managed.

General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b): 1. The disclosures 
called for by paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b) are intended to clarify the 
registrant's exposures to market risk associated with activities in 
derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments, and 
derivative commodity instruments.
    2. In preparing the disclosures under paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), 
registrants are required to include derivative financial instruments, 
other financial instruments, and derivative commodity instruments.
    3. For purposes of paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), derivative 
financial instruments,

[[Page 387]]

other financial instruments, and derivative commodity instruments 
(collectively referred to as ``market risk sensitive instruments'') are 
defined as follows:
    A. Derivative financial instruments has the same meaning as defined 
by generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FASB, Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119, ``Disclosure about Derivative 
Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,'' (``FAS 
119'') paragraphs 5-7 (October 1994)), and includes futures, forwards, 
swaps, options, and other financial instruments with similar 
characteristics;
    B. Other financial instruments means all financial instruments as 
defined by generally accepted accounting principles for which fair value 
disclosures are required (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 107, ``Disclosures about Fair Value of 
Financial Instruments,'' (``FAS 107'') paragraphs 3 and 8 (December 
1991)), except for derivative financial instruments, as defined above;
    C.i. Other financial instruments include, but are not limited to, 
trade accounts receivable, investments, loans, structured notes, 
mortgage-backed securities, trade accounts payable, indexed debt 
instruments, interest-only and principal-only obligations, deposits, and 
other debt obligations;
    ii. Other financial instruments exclude employers' and plans' 
obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefits, 
substantively extinguished debt, insurance contracts, lease contracts, 
warranty obligations and rights, unconditional purchase obligations, 
investments accounted for under the equity method, minority interests in 
consolidated enterprises, and equity instruments issued by the 
registrant and classified in stockholders' equity in the statement of 
financial position (see, e.g., FAS 107, paragraph 8 (December 1991)). 
For purposes of this item, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts 
payable need not be considered other financial instruments when their 
carrying amounts approximate fair value; and
    D. Derivative commodity instruments include, to the extent such 
instruments are not derivative financial instruments, commodity futures, 
commodity forwards, commodity swaps, commodity options, and other 
commodity instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by 
contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another 
financial instrument. For purposes of this paragraph, settlement in cash 
includes settlement in cash of the net change in value of the derivative 
commodity instrument (e.g., net cash settlement based on changes in the 
price of the underlying commodity).
    4.A. In addition to providing required disclosures for the market 
risk sensitive instruments defined in instruction 2. of the General 
Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants are encouraged 
to include other market risk sensitive instruments, positions, and 
transactions within the disclosures required under paragraphs 305(a) and 
305(b). Such instruments, positions, and transactions might include 
commodity positions, derivative commodity instruments that are not 
permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with 
another financial instrument, cash flows from anticipated transactions, 
and certain financial instruments excluded under instruction 3.C.ii. of 
the General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b).
    B. Registrants that voluntarily include other market risk sensitive 
instruments, positions and transactions within their quantitative 
disclosures about market risk under the sensitivity analysis or value at 
risk disclosure alternatives are not required to provide separate market 
risk disclosures for any voluntarily selected instruments, positions, or 
transactions. Instead, registrants selecting the sensitivity analysis 
and value at risk disclosure alternatives are permitted to present 
comprehensive market risk disclosures, which reflect the combined market 
risk exposures inherent in both the required and any voluntarily 
selected instruments, position, or transactions. Registrants that choose 
the tabular presentation disclosure alternative should present 
voluntarily selected instruments, positions, or transactions in a manner 
consistent with the requirements in Item 305(a) for market risk 
sensitive instruments.
    C. If a registrant elects to include voluntarily a particular type 
of instrument, position, or transaction in their quantitative 
disclosures about market risk, that registrant should include all, 
rather than some, of those instruments, positions, or transactions 
within those disclosures. For example, if a registrant holds in 
inventory a particular type of commodity position and elects to include 
that commodity position within their market risk disclosures, the 
registrant should include the entire commodity position, rather than 
only a portion thereof, in their quantitative disclosures about market 
risk.
    5.A. Under paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), a materiality assessment 
should be made for each market risk exposure category within the trading 
and other than trading portfolios.
    B. For purposes of making the materiality assessment under 
instruction 5.A. of the General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 
305(b), registrants should evaluate both:
    i. The materiality of the fair values of derivative financial 
instruments, other financial instruments, and derivative commodity 
instruments outstanding as of the end of the latest fiscal year; and
    ii. The materiality of potential, near-term losses in future 
earnings, fair values, and/or

[[Page 388]]

cash flows from reasonably possible near-term changes in market rates or 
prices.
    iii. If either paragraphs B.i. or B.ii. in this instruction of the 
General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b) are material, the 
registrant should disclose quantitative and qualitative information 
about market risk, if such market risk for the particular market risk 
exposure category is material.
    C. For purposes of instruction 5.B.i. of the General Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants generally should not net fair 
values, except to the extent allowed under generally accepted accounting 
principles (see, e.g., FASB Interpretation No. 39, ``Offsetting of 
Amounts Related to Certain Contracts'' (March 1992)). For example, under 
this instruction, the fair value of assets generally should not be 
netted with the fair value of liabilities.
    D. For purposes of instruction 5.B.ii. of the General Instructions 
to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants should consider, among 
other things, the magnitude of:
    i. Past market movements;
    ii. Reasonably possible, near-term market movements; and
    iii. Potential losses that may arise from leverage, option, and 
multiplier features.
    E. For purposes of instructions 5.B.ii and 5.D.ii of the General 
Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), the term near term means a 
period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the 
financial statements (see generally SOP 94-6, at paragraph 7 (December 
30, 1994)).
    F. For the purpose of instructions 5.B.ii. and 5.D.ii. of the 
General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), the term 
reasonably possible has the same meaning as defined by generally 
accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FAS 5, paragraph 3 (March 
1975)).
    6. For purposes of paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants should 
present the information outside of, and not incorporate the information 
into, the financial statements (including the footnotes to the financial 
statements). In addition, registrants are encouraged to provide the 
required information in one location. However, alternative presentation, 
such as inclusion of all or part of the information in Management's 
Discussion and Analysis, may be used at the discretion of the 
registrant. If information is disclosed in more than one location, 
registrants should provide cross-references to the locations of the 
related disclosures.
    7. For purposes of the instructions to paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), 
trading purposes has the same meaning as defined by generally accepted 
accounting principles (see, e.g., FAS 119, paragraph 9a (October 1994)). 
In addition, anticipated transactions means transactions (other than 
transactions involving existing assets or liabilities or transactions 
necessitated by existing firm commitments) an enterprise expects, but is 
not obligated, to carry out in the normal course of business (see, e.g., 
FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 80, ``Accounting 
for Futures Contracts,'' paragraph 9, (August 1984)).

    (c) Interim periods. If interim period financial statements are 
included or are required to be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X 
(17 CFR 210), discussion and analysis shall be provided so as to enable 
the reader to assess the sources and effects of material changes in 
information that would be provided under Item 305 of Regulation S-K from 
the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the most recent 
interim balance sheet.

Instructions to Paragraph 305(c): 1. Information required under 
paragraph (c) of this Item 305 is not required until after the first 
fiscal year end in which this Item 305 is applicable.

    (d) Safe harbor. (1) The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77z-2) and Section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u-5) (``statutory safe 
harbors'') shall apply, with respect to all types of issuers and 
transactions, to information provided pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of this Item 305, provided that the disclosure is made by: an 
issuer; a person acting on behalf of the issuer; an outside reviewer 
retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of the issuer; or an 
underwriter, with respect to information provided by the issuer or 
information derived from information provided by the issuer.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (d) of this Item 305 only:
    (i) All information required by paragraphs (a), (b)(1)(i), 
(b)(1)(iii), and (c) of this Item 305 is considered forward looking 
statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbors, except for 
historical facts such as the terms of particular contracts and the 
number of market risk sensitive instruments held during or at the end of 
the reporting period; and
    (ii) With respect to paragraph (a) of this Item 305, the meaningful 
cautionary statements prong of the statutory safe harbors will be 
satisfied if a registrant satisfies all requirements of that same 
paragraph (a) of this Item 305.
    (e) Smaller reporting companies. A smaller reporting company, as 
defined

[[Page 389]]

by Sec. 229.10(f)(1), is not required to provide the information 
required by this Item.

General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a), 305(b), 305(c), 305(d), and 
305(e): 1. Bank registrants, thrift registrants, and non-bank and non-
thrift registrants with market capitalizations on January 28, 1997 in 
excess of $2.5 billion should provide Item 305 disclosures in filings 
with the Commission that include annual financial statements for fiscal 
years ending after June 15, 1997. Non-bank and non-thrift registrants 
with market capitalizations on January 28, 1997 of $2.5 billion or less 
should provide Item 305 disclosures in filings with the Commission that 
include financial statements for fiscal years ending after June 15, 
1998.
    2.A. For purposes of instruction 1. of the General Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a), 305(b), 305(c), 305(d), and 305(e), bank registrants 
and thrift registrants include any registrant which has control over a 
depository institution.
    B. For purposes of instruction 2.A. of the General Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a), 305(b), 305(c), 305(d), and 305(e), a registrant has 
control over a depository institution if:
    i. The registrant directly or indirectly or acting through one or 
more other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25% or more of 
any class of voting securities of the depository institution;
    ii. The registrant controls in any manner the election of a majority 
of the directors or trustees of the depository institution; or
    iii. The Federal Reserve Board or Office of Thrift Supervision 
determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the 
registrant directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over 
the management or policies of the depository institution.
    C. For purposes of instruction 2.B. of the General Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a), 305(b), 305(c), 305(d), and 305(e), a depository 
institution means any of the following:
    i. An insured depository institution as defined in section 3(c)(2) 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1813 (c));
    ii. An institution organized under the laws of the United States, 
any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any territory 
of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Somoa, or the Virgin 
Islands, which both accepts demand deposits or deposits that the 
depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third 
parties or others and is engaged in the business of making commercial 
loans.
    D. For purposes of instruction 1. of the General Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a), 305(b), 305(c), 305(d) and 305(e), market 
capitalization is the aggregate market value of common equity as set 
forth in General Instruction I.B.1. of Form S-3; provided however, that 
common equity held by affiliates is included in the calculation of 
market capitalization; and provided further that instead of using the 60 
day period prior to filing referenced in General Instruction I.B.1. of 
Form S-3, the measurement date is January 28, 1997.

                Appendix to Item 305--Tabular Disclosures

    The tables set forth below are illustrative of the format that might 
be used when a registrant elects to present the information required by 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of Item 305 regarding terms and information about 
derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments, and 
derivative commodity instruments. These examples are for illustrative 
purposes only. Registrants are not required to display the information 
in the specific format illustrated below. Alternative methods of display 
are permissible as long as the disclosure requirements of the section 
are satisfied. Furthermore, these examples were designed primarily to 
illustrate possible formats for presentation of the information required 
by the disclosure item and do not purport to illustrate the broad range 
of derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments, and 
derivative commodity instruments utilized by registrants.

                        Interest Rate Sensitivity

    The table below provides information about the Company's derivative 
financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive 
to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt 
obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash 
flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity 
dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and 
weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity 
dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments 
to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are 
based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. 
The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the 
Company's reporting currency. The instrument's actual cash flows are 
denominated in both U.S. dollars ($US) and German deutschmarks (DM), as 
indicated in parentheses.

                        Exchange Rate Sensitivity

    The table below provides information about the Company's derivative 
financial instruments, other financial instruments, and firmly committed 
sales transactions by functional currency and presents such information 
in U.S. dollar equivalents. \1\ The table summarizes information on 
instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency 
exchange rates, including foreign currency forward exchange agreements, 
deutschmark (DM)-denominated debt obligations, and firmly committed DM 
sales transactions. For debt obligations, the table presents principal 
cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected 
maturity dates. For firmly committed DM-sales transactions, sales 
amounts are presented by the expected transaction date, which are not 
expected to exceed two years. For foreign currency forward exchange 
agreements, the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average 
exchange rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. These notional 
amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be 
exchanged under the contract.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The information is presented in U.S. dollars because that is the 
registrant's reporting currency.

the futures contracts the table presents the notional amounts in 
bushels, the weighted average contract prices, and the total dollar 
contract amount by expected maturity dates, the latest of which occurs 
one year from the reporting date. Contract amounts are used to calculate 
the contractual payments and quantity of corn to be exchanged under the 
futures contracts.

This discussion must include disclosure of any material weakness in the 
registrant's internal control over financial reporting identified by

registrant's internal control over financial reporting is effective if 
there are one or more material weaknesses in the registrant's internal 
control over financial reporting; and
    (4) A statement that the registered public accounting firm that 
audited the financial statements included in the annual report 
containing the disclosure required by this Item has issued an

or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal 
control over financial reporting.

Instructions to Item 308: 1. A registrant need not comply with 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Item until it either had been required to

control over financial reporting.
    (4) A statement in substantially the following form: ``This annual 
report does not include an attestation report of the company's

than the number fixed by or pursuant to the governing instruments, state 
the reasons for this procedure and that the proxies cannot be voted for

during the past five years; the name and principal business of any 
corporation or other organization in which such occupations and

is a parent, subsidiary or other affiliate of the registrant. When an 
executive officer or person named in response to paragraph (c) of Item 
401 has been employed by the registrant or a subsidiary of the 
registrant for less than five years, a brief explanation shall be 
included as to the nature of the responsibility undertaken by the 
individual in prior positions to provide adequate disclosure of his 
prior business experience. What is required is information relating to 
the level of his professional competence, which may include, depending 
upon the circumstances, such specific information as the size of the 
operation supervised.

[[Page 395]]

director or nominee in such fund complex.

    (f) Involvement in certain legal proceedings. Describe any of the 
following events that occurred during the past five years and that are 
material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any director, 
person nominated to become a director or executive officer of the 
registrant:
    (1) A petition under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any state 
insolvency law was filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or 
similar officer was appointed by a court for the business or property of 
such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or 
within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or 
business association of which he was an executive officer at or within 
two years before the time of such filing;

<R05>
Sec. 229.402  (Item 402) Executive compensation.

    (a) General--(1) Treatment of foreign private issuers. A foreign 
private issuer will be deemed to comply with this Item if it provides 
the information required by Items 6.B and 6.E.2 of Form 20-F (17 CFR 
249.220f), with more detailed information provided if otherwise made 
publicly available or required to be disclosed by the issuer's home 
jurisdiction or a market in which its securities are listed or traded.
    (2) All compensation covered. This Item requires clear, concise and 
understandable disclosure of all plan and non-plan compensation awarded 
to, earned by, or paid to the named executive officers designated under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this Item, and directors covered by paragraph (k) of 
this Item, by any person for all services rendered in all capacities to 
the registrant and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically 
excluded from disclosure in this Item. All such compensation shall be 
reported pursuant to this Item, even if also called for by another 
requirement, including transactions between the registrant and a third 
party where a purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation to 
any such named executive officer or director. No amount reported as 
compensation for one fiscal year need be reported in the same manner as 
compensation for a subsequent fiscal year; amounts reported as 
compensation for one fiscal year may be required to be reported in a 
different manner pursuant to this Item.
    (3) Persons covered. Disclosure shall be provided pursuant to this 
Item for each of the following (the ``named executive officers''):

[[Page 397]]

    (i) All individuals serving as the registrant's principal executive 
officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal 
year (``PEO''), regardless of compensation level;
    (ii) All individuals serving as the registrant's principal financial 
officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal 
year (``PFO''), regardless of compensation level;
    (iii) The registrant's three most highly compensated executive 
officers other than the PEO and PFO who were serving as executive 
officers at the end of the last completed fiscal year; and
    (iv) Up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have 
been provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this Item but for the 
fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of the 
registrant at the end of the last completed fiscal year.

Instructions to Item 402(a)(3). 1. Determination of most highly 
compensated executive officers. The determination as to which executive 
officers are most highly compensated shall be made by reference to total 
compensation for the last completed fiscal year (as required to be 
disclosed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(x) of this Item) reduced by the 
amount required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of 
this Item, provided, however, that no disclosure need be provided for 
any executive officer, other than the PEO and PFO, whose total 
compensation, as so reduced, does not exceed $100,000.
    2. Inclusion of executive officer of subsidiary. It may be 
appropriate for a registrant to include as named executive officers one 
or more executive officers or other employees of subsidiaries in the 
disclosure required by this Item. See Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act 
(17 CFR 240.3b-7).
    3. Exclusion of executive officer due to overseas compensation. It 
may be appropriate in limited circumstances for a registrant not to 
include in the disclosure required by this Item an individual, other 
than its PEO or PFO, who is one of the registrant's most highly 
compensated executive officers due to the payment of amounts of cash 
compensation relating to overseas assignments attributed predominantly 
to such assignments.

    (4) Information for full fiscal year. If the PEO or PFO served in 
that capacity during any part of a fiscal year with respect to which 
information is required, information should be provided as to all of his 
or her compensation for the full fiscal year. If a named executive 
officer (other than the PEO or PFO) served as an executive officer of 
the registrant (whether or not in the same position) during any part of 
the fiscal year with respect to which information is required, 
information shall be provided as to all compensation of that individual 
for the full fiscal year.
    (5) Omission of table or column. A table or column may be omitted if 
there has been no compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to any of 
the named executive officers or directors required to be reported in 
that table or column in any fiscal year covered by that table.
    (6) Definitions. For purposes of this Item:
    (i) The term stock means instruments such as common stock, 
restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock, phantom stock 
units, common stock equivalent units or any similar instruments that do 
not have option-like features, and the term option means instruments 
such as stock options, stock appreciation rights and similar instruments 
with option-like features. The term stock appreciation rights (``SARs'') 
refers to SARs payable in cash or stock, including SARs payable in cash 
or stock at the election of the registrant or a named executive officer. 
The term equity is used to refer generally to stock and/or options.
    (ii) The term plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
Any plan, contract, authorization or arrangement, whether or not set 
forth in any formal document, pursuant to which cash, securities, 
similar instruments, or any other property may be received. A plan may 
be applicable to one person. Registrants may omit information regarding 
group life, health, hospitalization, or medical reimbursement plans that 
do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive 
officers or directors of the registrant and that are available generally 
to all salaried employees.
    (iii) The term incentive plan means any plan providing compensation 
intended to serve as incentive for performance to occur over a specified 
period, whether such performance is measured by reference to financial 
performance of the registrant or an affiliate, the registrant's stock 
price, or

[[Page 398]]

any other performance measure. An equity incentive plan is an incentive 
plan or portion of an incentive plan under which awards are granted that 
fall within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based 
Payment, as modified or supplemented (``FAS 123R''). A non-equity 
incentive plan is an incentive plan or portion of an incentive plan that 
is not an equity incentive plan. The term incentive plan award means an 
award provided under an incentive plan.
    (iv) The terms date of grant or grant date refer to the grant date 
determined for financial statement reporting purposes pursuant to FAS 
123R.
    (v) Closing market price is defined as the price at which the 
registrant's security was last sold in the principal United States 
market for such security as of the date for which the closing market 
price is determined.
    (b) Compensation discussion and analysis. (1) Discuss the 
compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to the named executive 
officers. The discussion shall explain all material elements of the 
registrant's compensation of the named executive officers. The 
discussion shall describe the following:
    (i) The objectives of the registrant's compensation programs;
    (ii) What the compensation program is designed to reward;
    (iii) Each element of compensation;
    (iv) Why the registrant chooses to pay each element;
    (v) How the registrant determines the amount (and, where applicable, 
the formula) for each element to pay; and
    (vi) How each compensation element and the registrant's decisions 
regarding that element fit into the registrant's overall compensation 
objectives and affect decisions regarding other elements.
    (2) While the material information to be disclosed under 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis will vary depending upon the facts 
and circumstances, examples of such information may include, in a given 
case, among other things, the following:
    (i) The policies for allocating between long-term and currently paid 
out compensation;
    (ii) The policies for allocating between cash and non-cash 
compensation, and among different forms of non-cash compensation;
    (iii) For long-term compensation, the basis for allocating 
compensation to each different form of award (such as relationship of 
the award to the achievement of the registrant's long-term goals, 
management's exposure to downside equity performance risk, correlation 
between cost to registrant and expected benefits to the registrant);
    (iv) How the determination is made as to when awards are granted, 
including awards of equity-based compensation such as options;
    (v) What specific items of corporate performance are taken into 
account in setting compensation policies and making compensation 
decisions;
    (vi) How specific forms of compensation are structured and 
implemented to reflect these items of the registrant's performance, 
including whether discretion can be or has been exercised (either to 
award compensation absent attainment of the relevant performance goal(s) 
or to reduce or increase the size of any award or payout), identifying 
any particular exercise of discretion, and stating whether it applied to 
one or more specified named executive officers or to all compensation 
subject to the relevant performance goal(s);
    (vii) How specific forms of compensation are structured and 
implemented to reflect the named executive officer's individual 
performance and/or individual contribution to these items of the 
registrant's performance, describing the elements of individual 
performance and/or contribution that are taken into account;
    (viii) Registrant policies and decisions regarding the adjustment or 
recovery of awards or payments if the relevant registrant performance 
measures upon which they are based are restated or otherwise adjusted in 
a manner that would reduce the size of an award or payment;
    (ix) The factors considered in decisions to increase or decrease 
compensation materially;
    (x) How compensation or amounts realizable from prior compensation 
are considered in setting other elements of compensation (e.g., how 
gains from

[[Page 399]]

prior option or stock awards are considered in setting retirement 
benefits);
    (xi) With respect to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, 
whether written or unwritten, that provides for payment(s) at, 
following, or in connection with any termination or change-in-control, 
the basis for selecting particular events as triggering payment (e.g., 
the rationale for providing a single trigger for payment in the event of 
a change-in-control);
    (xii) The impact of the accounting and tax treatments of the 
particular form of compensation;
    (xiii) The registrant's equity or other security ownership 
requirements or guidelines (specifying applicable amounts and forms of 
ownership), and any registrant policies regarding hedging the economic 
risk of such ownership;
    (xiv) Whether the registrant engaged in any benchmarking of total 
compensation, or any material element of compensation, identifying the 
benchmark and, if applicable, its components (including component 
companies); and
    (xv) The role of executive officers in determining executive 
compensation.

Instructions to Item 402(b). 1. The purpose of the Compensation 
Discussion and Analysis is to provide to investors material information 
that is necessary to an understanding of the registrant's compensation 
policies and decisions regarding the named executive officers.
    2. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be of the 
information contained in the tables and otherwise disclosed pursuant to 
this Item. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis should also cover 
actions regarding executive compensation that were taken after the 
registrant's last fiscal year's end. Actions that should be addressed 
might include, as examples only, the adoption or implementation of new 
or modified programs and policies or specific decisions that were made 
or steps that were taken that could affect a fair understanding of the 
named executive officer's compensation for the last fiscal year. 
Moreover, in some situations it may be necessary to discuss prior years 
in order to give context to the disclosure provided.
    3. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis should focus on the 
material principles underlying the registrant's executive compensation 
policies and decisions and the most important factors relevant to 
analysis of those policies and decisions. The Compensation Discussion 
and Analysis shall reflect the individual circumstances of the 
registrant and shall avoid boilerplate language and repetition of the 
more detailed information set forth in the tables and narrative 
disclosures that follow.
    4. Registrants are not required to disclose target levels with 
respect to specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related 
factors considered by the compensation committee or the board of 
directors, or any other factors or criteria involving confidential trade 
secrets or confidential commercial or financial information, the 
disclosure of which would result in competitive harm for the registrant. 
The standard to use when determining whether disclosure would cause 
competitive harm for the registrant is the same standard that would 
apply when a registrant requests confidential treatment of confidential 
trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information 
pursuant to Securities Act Rule 406 (17 CFR 230.406) and Exchange Act 
Rule 24b-2 (17 CFR 240.24b-2), each of which incorporates the criteria 
for non-disclosure when relying upon Exemption 4 of the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) and Rule 80(b)(4) (17 CFR 
200.80(b)(4)) thereunder. A registrant is not required to seek 
confidential treatment under the procedures in Securities Act Rule 406 
and Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 if it determines that the disclosure would 
cause competitive harm in reliance on this instruction; however, in that 
case, the registrant must discuss how difficult it will be for the 
executive or how likely it will be for the registrant to achieve the 
undisclosed target levels or other factors.
    5. Disclosure of target levels that are non-GAAP financial measures 
will not be subject to Regulation G (17 CFR 244.100--102) and Item 10(e) 
(Sec. 229.10(e)); however, disclosure must be provided as to how the 
number is calculated from the registrant's audited financial statements.

    (c) Summary compensation table--(1) General. Provide the information 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this Item, concerning the compensation 
of the named executive officers for each of the registrant's last three 
completed fiscal years, in a Summary Compensation Table in the tabular 
format specified below.

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name and principal position of the named executive officer 
(column (a));
    (ii) The fiscal year covered (column (b));
    (iii) The dollar value of base salary (cash and non-cash) earned by 
the named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (c));
    (iv) The dollar value of bonus (cash and non-cash) earned by the 
named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (d));

Instructions to Item 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv). 1. If the amount of salary 
or bonus earned in a given fiscal year is not calculable through the 
latest practicable date, a footnote shall be included disclosing that 
the amount of salary or bonus is not calculable through the latest 
practicable date and providing the date that the amount of salary or 
bonus is expected to be determined, and such amount must then be 
disclosed in a filing under Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308).
    2. Registrants shall include in the salary column (column (c)) or 
bonus column (column (d)) any amount of salary or bonus forgone at the 
election of a named executive officer under which stock, equity-based or 
other forms of non-cash compensation instead have been received by the 
named executive officer. However, the receipt of any such form of non-
cash compensation instead of salary or bonus must be disclosed in a 
footnote added to the salary or bonus column and, where applicable, 
referring to the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table (required by 
paragraph (d) of this Item) where the stock, option or non-equity 
incentive plan award elected by the named executive officer is reported.

    (v) For awards of stock, the dollar amount recognized for financial 
statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in 
accordance with FAS 123R (column (e));
    (vi) For awards of options, with or without tandem SARs, the dollar 
amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with 
respect to the fiscal year in accordance with FAS 123R (column (f));

Instruction to Item 402(c)(2)(v) and (vi). For awards reported in 
columns (e) and (f), disregard the estimate of forfeitures related to 
service-based vesting conditions. Include a footnote describing all 
forfeitures during the year, and disclosing all assumptions made in the 
valuation. Disclose assumptions made in the valuation by reference to a 
discussion of

[[Page 401]]

those assumptions in the registrant's financial statements, footnotes to 
the financial statements, or discussion in the Management's Discussion 
and Analysis. The sections so referenced are deemed part of the 
disclosure provided pursuant to this Item.

    (vii) The dollar value of all earnings for services performed during 
the fiscal year pursuant to awards under non-equity incentive plans as 
defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this Item, and all earnings on any 
outstanding awards (column (g));

Instructions to Item 402(c)(2)(vii). 1. If the relevant performance 
measure is satisfied during the fiscal year (including for a single year 
in a plan with a multi-year performance measure), the earnings are 
reportable for that fiscal year, even if not payable until a later date, 
and are not reportable again in the fiscal year when amounts are paid to 
the named executive officer.
    2. All earnings on non-equity incentive plan compensation must be 
identified and quantified in a footnote to column (g), whether the 
earnings were paid during the fiscal year, payable during the period but 
deferred at the election of the named executive officer, or payable by 
their terms at a later date.

    (viii) The sum of the amounts specified in paragraphs 
(c)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) of this Item (column (h)) as follows:
    (A) The aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the named 
executive officer's accumulated benefit under all defined benefit and 
actuarial pension plans (including supplemental plans) from the pension 
plan measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes 
with respect to the registrant's audited financial statements for the 
prior completed fiscal year to the pension plan measurement date used 
for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 
registrant's audited financial statements for the covered fiscal year; 
and
    (B) Above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is 
deferred on a basis that is not tax-qualified, including such earnings 
on nonqualified defined contribution plans;

Instructions to Item 402(c)(2)(viii). 1. The disclosure required 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii)(A) of this Item applies to each plan 
that provides for the payment of retirement benefits, or benefits that 
will be paid primarily following retirement, including but not limited 
to tax-qualified defined benefit plans and supplemental executive 
retirement plans, but excluding tax-qualified defined contribution plans 
and nonqualified defined contribution plans. For purposes of this 
disclosure, the registrant should use the same amounts required to be 
disclosed pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this Item for the covered 
fiscal year and the amounts that were or would have been required to be 
reported for the executive officer pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of 
this Item for the prior completed fiscal year.
    2. Regarding paragraph (c)(2)(viii)(B) of this Item, interest on 
deferred compensation is above-market only if the rate of interest 
exceeds 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, with compounding 
(as prescribed under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, (26 
U.S.C. 1274(d))) at the rate that corresponds most closely to the rate 
under the registrant's plan at the time the interest rate or formula is 
set. In the event of a discretionary reset of the interest rate, the 
requisite calculation must be made on the basis of the interest rate at 
the time of such reset, rather than when originally established. Only 
the above-market portion of the interest must be included. If the 
applicable interest rates vary depending upon conditions such as a 
minimum period of continued service, the reported amount should be 
calculated assuming satisfaction of all conditions to receiving interest 
at the highest rate. Dividends (and dividend equivalents) on deferred 
compensation denominated in the registrant's stock (``deferred stock'') 
are preferential only if earned at a rate higher than dividends on the 
registrant's common stock. Only the preferential portion of the 
dividends or equivalents must be included. Footnote or narrative 
disclosure may be provided explaining the registrant's criteria for 
determining any portion considered to be above-market.
    3. The registrant shall identify and quantify by footnote the 
separate amounts attributable to each of paragraphs (c)(2)(viii)(A) and 
(B) of this Item. Where such amount pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2)(viii)(A) is negative, it should be disclosed by footnote but 
should not be reflected in the sum reported in column (h).

    (ix) All other compensation for the covered fiscal year that the 
registrant could not properly report in any other column of the Summary 
Compensation Table (column (i)). Each compensation item that is not 
properly reportable in columns (c)-(h), regardless of the amount of the 
compensation item, must be included in column (i). Such compensation 
must include, but is not limited to:

[[Page 402]]

    (A) Perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the 
aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000;
    (B) All ``gross-ups'' or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal 
year for the payment of taxes;
    (C) For any security of the registrant or its subsidiaries purchased 
from the registrant or its subsidiaries (through deferral of salary or 
bonus, or otherwise) at a discount from the market price of such 
security at the date of purchase, unless that discount is available 
generally, either to all security holders or to all salaried employees 
of the registrant, the compensation cost, if any, computed in accordance 
with FAS 123R;
    (D) The amount paid or accrued to any named executive officer 
pursuant to a plan or arrangement in connection with:
    (1) Any termination, including without limitation through 
retirement, resignation, severance or constructive termination 
(including a change in responsibilities) of such executive officer's 
employment with the registrant and its subsidiaries; or
    (2) A change in control of the registrant;
    (E) Registrant contributions or other allocations to vested and 
unvested defined contribution plans;
    (F) The dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf 
of, the registrant during the covered fiscal year with respect to life 
insurance for the benefit of a named executive officer; and
    (G) The dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid on 
stock or option awards, when those amounts were not factored into the 
grant date fair value required to be reported for the stock or option 
award in column (l) of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table required by 
paragraph (d)(2)(viii) of this Item; and

Instructions to Item 402(c)(2)(ix). 1. Non-equity incentive plan awards 
and earnings and earnings on stock and options, except as specified in 
paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(G) of this Item, are required to be reported 
elsewhere as provided in this Item and are not reportable as All Other 
Compensation in column (i).
    2. Benefits paid pursuant to defined benefit and actuarial plans are 
not reportable as All Other Compensation in column (i) unless 
accelerated pursuant to a change in control; information concerning 
these plans is reportable pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2)(viii)(A) and (h) 
of this Item.
    3. Any item reported for a named executive officer pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this Item that is not a perquisite or personal 
benefit and whose value exceeds $10,000 must be identified and 
quantified in a footnote to column (i). This requirement applies only to 
compensation for the last fiscal year. All items of compensation are 
required to be included in the Summary Compensation Table without regard 
to whether such items are required to be identified other than as 
specifically noted in this Item.
    4. Perquisites and personal benefits may be excluded as long as the 
total value of all perquisites and personal benefits for a named 
executive officer is less than $10,000. If the total value of all 
perquisites and personal benefits is $10,000 or more for any named 
executive officer, then each perquisite or personal benefit, regardless 
of its amount, must be identified by type. If perquisites and personal 
benefits are required to be reported for a named executive officer 
pursuant to this rule, then each perquisite or personal benefit that 
exceeds the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of perquisites 
and personal benefits for that officer must be quantified and disclosed 
in a footnote. The requirements for identification and quantification 
apply only to compensation for the last fiscal year. Perquisites and 
other personal benefits shall be valued on the basis of the aggregate 
incremental cost to the registrant. With respect to the perquisite or 
other personal benefit for which footnote quantification is required, 
the registrant shall describe in the footnote its methodology for 
computing the aggregate incremental cost. Reimbursements of taxes owed 
with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits must be included 
in column (i) and are subject to separate quantification and 
identification as tax reimbursements (paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(B) of this 
Item) even if the associated perquisites or other personal benefits are 
not required to be included because the total amount of all perquisites 
or personal benefits for an individual named executive officer is less 
than $10,000 or are required to be identified but are not required to be 
separately quantified.
    5. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(D) of this Item, an accrued 
amount is an amount for which payment has become due.

    (x) The dollar value of total compensation for the covered fiscal 
year (column (j)). With respect to each named executive officer, 
disclose the sum of all amounts reported in columns (c) through (i).


[[Page 403]]


Instructions to Item 402(c). 1. Information with respect to fiscal years 
prior to the last completed fiscal year will not be required if the 
registrant was not a reporting company pursuant to section 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 78o(d)) at any time 
during that year, except that the registrant will be required to provide 
information for any such year if that information previously was 
required to be provided in response to a Commission filing requirement.
    2. All compensation values reported in the Summary Compensation 
Table must be reported in dollars and rounded to the nearest dollar. 
Reported compensation values must be reported numerically, providing a 
single numerical value for each grid in the table. Where compensation 
was paid to or received by a named executive officer in a different 
currency, a footnote must be provided to identify that currency and 
describe the rate and methodology used to convert the payment amounts to 
dollars.
    3. If a named executive officer is also a director who receives 
compensation for his or her services as a director, reflect that 
compensation in the Summary Compensation Table and provide a footnote 
identifying and itemizing such compensation and amounts. Use the 
categories in the Director Compensation Table required pursuant to 
paragraph (k) of this Item.
    4. Any amounts deferred, whether pursuant to a plan established 
under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(k)), or 
otherwise, shall be included in the appropriate column for the fiscal 
year in which earned.

    (d) Grants of plan-based awards table. (1) Provide the information 
specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this Item, concerning each grant of an 
award made to a named executive officer in the last completed fiscal 
year under any plan, including awards that subsequently have been 
transferred, in the following tabular format:

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name of the named executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) The grant date for equity-based awards reported in the table 
(column (b)). If such grant date is different than the date on which the 
compensation committee (or a committee of the board of directors 
performing a similar function or the full board of directors) takes 
action or is deemed to take action to grant such awards, a separate, 
adjoining column shall be added between columns (b) and (c) showing such 
date;
    (iii) The dollar value of the estimated future payout upon 
satisfaction of the conditions in question under non-equity incentive 
plan awards granted in the fiscal year, or the applicable range of 
estimated payouts denominated in dollars (threshold, target and maximum 
amount) (columns (c) through (e)).
    (iv) The number of shares of stock, or the number of shares 
underlying options to be paid out or vested upon satisfaction of the 
conditions in question under equity incentive plan awards granted in the 
fiscal year, or the applicable range of estimated payouts denominated in 
the number of shares of stock, or the number of shares underlying 
options under the award (threshold, target and maximum amount) (columns 
(f) through (h)).
    (v) The number of shares of stock granted in the fiscal year that 
are not required to be disclosed in columns (f) through (h) (column 
(i));
    (vi) The number of securities underlying options granted in the 
fiscal year that are not required to be disclosed in columns (f) through 
(h) (column (j));
    (vii) The per-share exercise or base price of the options granted in 
the fiscal year (column (k)). If such exercise or base price is less 
than the closing market price of the underlying security on the date of 
the grant, a separate, adjoining column showing the closing market price 
on the date of the grant shall be added after column (k) and
    (viii) The grant date fair value of each equity award computed in 
accordance with FAS 123R (column (l)). If at any time during the last 
completed fiscal year, the registrant has adjusted or amended the 
exercise or base price of options, SARs or similar option-like 
instruments previously awarded to a named executive officer, whether 
through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, or any other 
means (``repriced''), or otherwise has materially modified such awards, 
the incremental fair value, computed as of the repricing or modification 
date in accordance with FAS 123R, with respect to that repriced or 
modified award, shall be reported.

Instructions to Item 402(d). 1. Disclosure on a separate line shall be 
provided in the Table for each grant of an award made to a named 
executive officer during the fiscal year. If grants of awards were made 
to a named executive officer during the fiscal year under more than one 
plan, identify the particular plan under which each such grant was made.
    2. For grants of incentive plan awards, provide the information 
called for by columns (c), (d) and (e), or (f), (g) and (h), as 
applicable. For columns (c) and (f), threshold refers to the minimum 
amount payable for a certain level of performance under the plan. For 
columns (d) and (g), target refers to the amount payable if the 
specified performance target(s) are reached. For columns (e) and (h), 
maximum refers to the maximum payout possible under the plan. If the 
award provides only for a single estimated payout, that amount must be 
reported as the target in columns (d) and (g). In columns (d) and (g), 
registrants must provide a representative amount based on the previous 
fiscal year's performance if the target amount is not determinable.
    3. In determining if the exercise or base price of an option is less 
than the closing market price of the underlying security on the date of 
the grant, the registrant may use either the closing market price as 
specified in paragraph (a)(6)(v) of this Item, or if no market exists, 
any other formula prescribed for the security. Whenever the exercise or 
base price reported in column (k) is not the closing market price, 
describe the methodology for determining the exercise or base price 
either by a footnote or accompanying textual narrative.
    4. A tandem grant of two instruments, only one of which is granted 
under an incentive plan, such as an option granted in tandem with a 
performance share, need be reported only in column (i) or (j), as 
applicable. For example, an option granted in tandem with a performance 
share would be reported only as an option grant in column (j), with the 
tandem feature noted either by a footnote or accompanying textual 
narrative.
    5. Disclose the dollar amount of consideration, if any, paid by the 
executive officer

[[Page 406]]

for the award in a footnote to the appropriate column.
    6. If non-equity incentive plan awards are denominated in units or 
other rights, a separate, adjoining column between columns (b) and (c) 
shall be added quantifying the units or other rights awarded.
    7. Options, SARs and similar option-like instruments granted in 
connection with a repricing transaction or other material modification 
shall be reported in this Table. However, the disclosure required by 
this Table does not apply to any repricing that occurs through a pre-
existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award that results in the 
periodic adjustment of the option or SAR exercise or base price, an 
antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a recapitalization or 
similar transaction equally affecting all holders of the class of 
securities underlying the options or SARs.

    (e) Narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of 
plan-based awards table. (1) Provide a narrative description of any 
material factors necessary to an understanding of the information 
disclosed in the tables required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Item. 
Examples of such factors may include, in given cases, among other 
things:
    (i) The material terms of each named executive officer's employment 
agreement or arrangement, whether written or unwritten;
    (ii) If at any time during the last fiscal year, any outstanding 
option or other equity-based award was repriced or otherwise materially 
modified (such as by extension of exercise periods, the change of 
vesting or forfeiture conditions, the change or elimination of 
applicable performance criteria, or the change of the bases upon which 
returns are determined), a description of each such repricing or other 
material modification;
    (iii) The material terms of any award reported in response to 
paragraph (d) of this Item, including a general description of the 
formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable, 
and the vesting schedule. For example, state where applicable that 
dividends will be paid on stock, and if so, the applicable dividend rate 
and whether that rate is preferential. Describe any performance-based 
conditions, and any other material conditions, that are applicable to 
the award. For purposes of the Table required by paragraph (d) of this 
Item and the narrative disclosure required by paragraph (e) of this 
Item, performance-based conditions include both performance conditions 
and market conditions, as those terms are defined in FAS 123R; and
    (iv) An explanation of the amount of salary and bonus in proportion 
to total compensation.

Instructions to Item 402(e)(1). 1. The disclosure required by paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this Item would not apply to any repricing that occurs 
through a pre-existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award that 
results in the periodic adjustment of the option or SAR exercise or base 
price, an antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a 
recapitalization or similar transaction equally affecting all holders of 
the class of securities underlying the options or SARs.
    2. Instructions 4 and 5 to Item 402(b) apply regarding disclosure 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this Item of target levels with respect 
to specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related factors 
considered by the compensation committee or the board of directors, or 
any other factors or criteria involving confidential trade secrets or 
confidential commercial or financial information, the disclosure of 
which would result in competitive harm for the registrant.

    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table. (1) Provide 
the information specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this Item, concerning 
unexercised options; stock that has not vested; and equity incentive 
plan awards for each named executive officer outstanding as of the end 
of the registrant's last completed fiscal year in the following tabular 
format:

    (ix) The total number of shares of stock, units or other rights 
awarded under any equity incentive plan that have not vested and that 
have not been earned, and, if applicable the number of shares underlying 
any such unit or right (column (i)); and
    (x) The aggregate market or payout value of shares of stock, units 
or other rights awarded under any equity incentive plan that have not 
vested and that have not been earned (column (j)).

Instructions to Item 402(f)(2). 1. Identify by footnote any award that 
has been transferred other than for value, disclosing the nature of the 
transfer.

[[Page 408]]

    2. The vesting dates of options, shares of stock and equity 
incentive plan awards held at fiscal-year end must be disclosed by 
footnote to the applicable column where the outstanding award is 
reported.
    3. Compute the market value of stock reported in column (h) and 
equity incentive plan awards of stock reported in column (j) by 
multiplying the closing market price of the registrant's stock at the 
end of the last completed fiscal year by the number of shares or units 
of stock or the amount of equity incentive plan awards, respectively. 
The number of shares or units reported in columns (d) or (i), and the 
payout value reported in column (j), shall be based on achieving 
threshold performance goals, except that if the previous fiscal year's 
performance has exceeded the threshold, the disclosure shall be based on 
the next higher performance measure (target or maximum) that exceeds the 
previous fiscal year's performance. If the award provides only for a 
single estimated payout, that amount should be reported. If the target 
amount is not determinable, registrants must provide a representative 
amount based on the previous fiscal year's performance.
    4. Multiple awards may be aggregated where the expiration date and 
the exercise and/or base price of the instruments is identical. A single 
award consisting of a combination of options, SARs and/or similar 
option-like instruments shall be reported as separate awards with 
respect to each tranche with a different exercise and/or base price or 
expiration date.
    5. Options or stock awarded under an equity incentive plan are 
reported in columns (d) or (i) and (j), respectively, until the relevant 
performance condition has been satisfied. Once the relevant performance 
condition has been satisfied, even if the option or stock award is 
subject to forfeiture conditions, options are reported in column (b) or 
(c), as appropriate, until they are exercised or expire, or stock is 
reported in columns (g) and (h) until it vests.

    (g) Option exercises and stock vested table. (1) Provide the 
information specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this Item, concerning each 
exercise of stock options, SARs and similar instruments, and each 
vesting of stock, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and 
similar instruments, during the last completed fiscal year for each of 
the named executive officers on an aggregated basis in the following 
tabular format:

[[Page 409]]


Instruction to Item 402(g)(2). Report in column (c) the aggregate dollar 
amount realized by the named executive officer upon exercise of the 
options or upon the transfer of such instruments for value. Compute the 
dollar amount realized upon exercise by determining the difference 
between the market price of the underlying securities at exercise and 
the exercise or base price of the options. Do not include the value of 
any related payment or other consideration provided (or to be provided) 
by the registrant to or on behalf of a named executive officer, whether 
in payment of the exercise price or related taxes. (Any such payment or 
other consideration provided by the registrant is required to be 
disclosed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this Item.) Report 
in column (e) the aggregate dollar amount realized by the named 
executive officer upon the vesting of stock or the transfer of such 
instruments for value. Compute the aggregate dollar amount realized upon 
vesting by multiplying the number of shares of stock or units by the 
market value of the underlying shares on the vesting date. For any 
amount realized upon exercise or vesting for which receipt has been 
deferred, provide a footnote quantifying the amount and disclosing the 
terms of the deferral.

    (h) Pension benefits. (1) Provide the information specified in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this Item with respect to each plan that provides 
for payments or other benefits at, following, or in connection with

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) The name of the plan (column (b));
    (iii) The number of years of service credited to the named executive 
officer under the plan, computed as of the same pension plan measurement 
date used for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 
registrant's audited financial statements for the last completed fiscal 
year (column (c));
    (iv) The actuarial present value of the named executive officer's 
accumulated benefit under the plan, computed as of the same pension plan 
measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes with 
respect to the registrant's audited financial statements for the last 
completed fiscal year (column (d)); and
    (v) The dollar amount of any payments and benefits paid to the named 
executive officer during the registrant's last completed fiscal year 
(column (e)).

Instructions to Item 402(h)(2). 1. The disclosure required pursuant to 
this Table applies to each plan that provides for specified retirement 
payments and benefits, or payments and benefits that will be provided 
primarily following retirement, including but not limited to tax-
qualified defined benefit plans and supplemental executive retirement 
plans, but excluding tax-qualified defined contribution plans and 
nonqualified defined contribution plans. Provide a separate row for each 
such plan in which the named executive officer participates.
    2. For purposes of the amount(s) reported in column (d), the 
registrant must use the

[[Page 410]]

same assumptions used for financial reporting purposes under generally 
accepted accounting principles, except that retirement age shall be 
assumed to be the normal retirement age as defined in the plan, or if 
not so defined, the earliest time at which a participant may retire 
under the plan without any benefit reduction due to age. The registrant 
must disclose in the accompanying textual narrative the valuation method 
and all material assumptions applied in quantifying the present value of 
the current accrued benefit. A benefit specified in the plan document or 
the executive's contract itself is not an assumption. Registrants may 
satisfy all or part of this disclosure by reference to a discussion of 
those assumptions in the registrant's financial statements, footnotes to 
the financial statements, or discussion in the Management's Discussion 
and Analysis. The sections so referenced are deemed part of the 
disclosure provided pursuant to this Item.
    3. For purposes of allocating the current accrued benefit between 
tax qualified defined benefit plans and related supplemental plans, 
apply the limitations applicable to tax qualified defined benefit plans 
established by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder 
that applied as of the pension plan measurement date.
    4. If a named executive officer's number of years of credited 
service with respect to any plan is different from the named executive 
officer's number of actual years of service with the registrant, provide 
footnote disclosure quantifying the difference and any resulting benefit 
augmentation.

    (3) Provide a succinct narrative description of any material factors 
necessary to an understanding of each plan covered by the tabular 
disclosure required by this paragraph. While material factors will vary 
depending upon the facts, examples of such factors may include, in given 
cases, among other things:
    (i) The material terms and conditions of payments and benefits 
available under the plan, including the plan's normal retirement payment 
and benefit formula and eligibility standards, and the effect of the 
form of benefit elected on the amount of annual benefits. For this 
purpose, normal retirement means retirement at the normal retirement age 
as defined in the plan, or if not so defined, the earliest time at which 
a participant may retire under the plan without any benefit reduction 
due to age;
    (ii) If any named executive officer is currently eligible for early 
retirement under any plan, identify that named executive officer and the 
plan, and describe the plan's early retirement payment and benefit 
formula and eligibility standards. For this purpose, early retirement 
means retirement at the early retirement age as defined in the plan, or 
otherwise available to the executive under the plan;
    (iii) The specific elements of compensation (e.g., salary, bonus, 
etc.) included in applying the payment and benefit formula, identifying 
each such element;
    (iv) With respect to named executive officers' participation in 
multiple plans, the different purposes for each plan; and
    (v) Registrant policies with regard to such matters as granting 
extra years of credited service.
    (i) Nonqualified defined contribution and other nonqualified 
deferred compensation plans. (1) Provide the information specified in 
paragraph (i)(2) of this Item with respect to each defined contribution 
or other plan that provides for the deferral of compensation on a basis 
that is not tax-qualified in the following tabular format:

                                       Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) The dollar amount of aggregate executive contributions during 
the registrant's last fiscal year (column (b));
    (iii) The dollar amount of aggregate registrant contributions during 
the registrant's last fiscal year (column (c));
    (iv) The dollar amount of aggregate interest or other earnings 
accrued during the registrant's last fiscal year (column (d));
    (v) The aggregate dollar amount of all withdrawals by and 
distributions to the executive during the registrant's last fiscal year 
(column (e)); and
    (vi) The dollar amount of total balance of the executive's account 
as of the end of the registrant's last fiscal year (column (f)).

Instruction to Item 402(i)(2). Provide a footnote quantifying the extent 
to which amounts reported in the contributions and earnings columns are 
reported as compensation in the last completed fiscal year in the 
registrant's Summary Compensation Table and amounts reported in the 
aggregate balance at last fiscal year end (column (f)) previously were 
reported as compensation to the named executive officer in the 
registrant's Summary Compensation Table for previous years.

    (3) Provide a succinct narrative description of any material factors 
necessary to an understanding of each plan covered by tabular disclosure 
required by this paragraph. While material factors will vary depending 
upon the facts, examples of such factors may include, in given cases, 
among other things:
    (i) The type(s) of compensation permitted to be deferred, and any 
limitations (by percentage of compensation or otherwise) on the extent 
to which deferral is permitted;
    (ii) The measures for calculating interest or other plan earnings 
(including whether such measure(s) are selected by the executive or the 
registrant and the frequency and manner in which selections may be 
changed), quantifying interest rates and other earnings measures 
applicable during the registrant's last fiscal year; and
    (iii) Material terms with respect to payouts, withdrawals and other 
distributions.
    (j) Potential payments upon termination or change-in-control. 
Regarding each contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, whether written 
or unwritten, that provides for payment(s) to a named executive officer 
at, following, or in connection with any termination, including without 
limitation resignation, severance, retirement or a constructive 
termination of a named executive officer, or a change in control of the 
registrant or a change in the named executive officer's 
responsibilities, with respect to each named executive officer:
    (1) Describe and explain the specific circumstances that would 
trigger payment(s) or the provision of other benefits, including 
perquisites and health care benefits;
    (2) Describe and quantify the estimated payments and benefits that 
would be provided in each covered circumstance, whether they would or 
could be lump sum, or annual, disclosing the duration, and by whom they 
would be provided;
    (3) Describe and explain how the appropriate payment and benefit 
levels are determined under the various circumstances that trigger 
payments or provision of benefits;
    (4) Describe and explain any material conditions or obligations 
applicable to

[[Page 412]]

the receipt of payments or benefits, including but not limited to non-
compete, non-solicitation, non-disparagement or confidentiality 
agreements, including the duration of such agreements and provisions 
regarding waiver of breach of such agreements; and
    (5) Describe any other material factors regarding each such 
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement.

Instructions to Item 402(j). 1. The registrant must provide quantitative 
disclosure under these requirements, applying the assumptions that the 
triggering event took place on the last business day of the registrant's 
last completed fiscal year, and the price per share of the registrant's 
securities is the closing market price as of that date. In the event 
that uncertainties exist as to the provision of payments and benefits or 
the amounts involved, the registrant is required to make a reasonable 
estimate (or a reasonable estimated range of amounts) applicable to the 
payment or benefit and disclose material assumptions underlying such 
estimates or estimated ranges in its disclosure. In such event, the 
disclosure would require forward-looking information as appropriate.
    2. Perquisites and other personal benefits or property may be 
excluded only if the aggregate amount of such compensation will be less 
than $10,000. Individual perquisites and personal benefits shall be 
identified and quantified as required by Instruction 4 to paragraph 
(c)(2)(ix) of this Item. For purposes of quantifying health care 
benefits, the registrant must use the assumptions used for financial 
reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles.
    3. To the extent that the form and amount of any payment or benefit 
that would be provided in connection with any triggering event is fully 
disclosed pursuant to paragraph (h) or (i) of this Item, reference may 
be made to that disclosure. However, to the extent that the form or 
amount of any such payment or benefit would be enhanced or its vesting 
or other provisions accelerated in connection with any triggering event, 
such enhancement or acceleration must be disclosed pursuant to this 
paragraph.
    4. Where a triggering event has actually occurred for a named 
executive officer and that individual was not serving as a named 
executive officer of the registrant at the end of the last completed 
fiscal year, the disclosure required by this paragraph for that named 
executive officer shall apply only to that triggering event.
    5. The registrant need not provide information with respect to 
contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not 
discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive 
officers of the registrant and that are available generally to all 
salaried employees.

    (k) Compensation of directors. (1) Provide the information specified 
in paragraph (k)(2) of this Item, concerning the compensation of the 
directors for the registrant's last completed fiscal year, in the 
following tabular format:

by footnote to the appropriate column: the grant date fair value of each 
equity award computed in accordance with FAS 123R; for each option, SAR 
or similar option like instrument for which the registrant has adjusted 
or amended the exercise or base price during the last completed fiscal 
year, whether through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, or 
any other means (``repriced''), or otherwise has materially modified 
such awards, the incremental fair value, computed as of the repricing or 
modification date in accordance with FAS 123R; and the aggregate number 
of stock awards and the aggregate number of option awards outstanding at 
fiscal year end. However, the disclosure required by this Instruction 
does not apply to any repricing that occurs through a pre-existing 
formula or mechanism in the plan or award that results in the periodic 
adjustment of the option or SAR exercise or base price, an antidilution 
provision in a plan or award, or a recapitalization or similar 
transaction equally affecting all holders of the class of securities 
underlying the options or SARs.
    (v) The dollar value of all earnings for services performed during

completed fiscal year to the pension plan measurement date used for 
financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the registrant's 
audited financial statements for the covered fiscal year; and
    (B) Above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is 
deferred on a basis that is not tax-qualified, including such earnings 
on nonqualified defined contribution plans;
    (vii) All other compensation for the covered fiscal year that the 
registrant could not properly report in any other column of the Director 
Compensation Table (column (g)). Each compensation item that is not 
properly reportable in columns (b)-(f), regardless of the amount of the 
compensation item, must be included in column (g). Such compensation 
must include, but is not limited to:
    (A) Perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the 
aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000;
    (B) All ``gross-ups'' or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal 
year for the payment of taxes;

to director legacy programs and similar charitable award programs;
    (H) The dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf 
of, the registrant during the covered fiscal year with respect to life 
insurance for the benefit of a director; and
    (I) The dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid on 
stock or option awards, when those amounts were not factored into the 
grant date fair value for the stock or option award; and

Instructions to Item 402(k)(2)(vii). 1. Programs in which registrants 
agree to make donations to one or more charitable institutions in a 
director's name, payable by the registrant currently or upon a 
designated event, such as the retirement or death of the director, are 
charitable awards programs or director legacy programs for purposes of 
the disclosure required by paragraph (k)(2)(vii)(G) of this Item. 
Provide footnote disclosure of the total dollar amount payable under the 
program and other material terms of each such program for which tabular 
disclosure is provided.
    2. Any item reported for a director pursuant to paragraph 
(k)(2)(vii) of this Item that is not a perquisite or personal benefit 
and whose value exceeds $10,000 must be identified and quantified in a 
footnote to column (g). All items of compensation are required to be 
included in the Director Compensation Table without regard to whether 
such items are required to be identified other than as specifically 
noted in this Item.
    3. Perquisites and personal benefits may be excluded as long as the 
total value of all perquisites and personal benefits for a director is 
less than $10,000. If the total value of all perquisites and personal 
benefits is $10,000 or more for any director, then each perquisite or 
personal benefit, regardless of its amount, must be identified by type. 
If perquisites and personal benefits are required to be reported for a 
director pursuant to this rule, then each perquisite or personal benefit 
that exceeds the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of 
perquisites and personal benefits for that director must be quantified 
and disclosed in a footnote. Perquisites and other personal benefits 
shall be valued on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the 
registrant. With respect to the perquisite or other personal benefit for 
which footnote quantification is required, the registrant shall describe 
in the footnote its methodology for computing the aggregate incremental 
cost. Reimbursements of taxes owed with respect to perquisites or other 
personal benefits must be included in column (g) and are subject to 
separate quantification and identification as tax reimbursements 
(paragraph (k)(2)(vii)(B) of this Item) even if the associated 
perquisites or other personal benefits are not required to be included 
because the total amount of all perquisites or personal benefits for an 
individual director is less than $10,000 or are required to be 
identified but are not required to be separately quantified.

    (viii) The dollar value of total compensation for the covered fiscal 
year (column (h)). With respect to each director, disclose the sum of 
all amounts reported in columns (b) through (g).

Instruction to Item 402(k)(2). Two or more directors may be grouped in a 
single row in the Table if all elements of their compensation are 
identical. The names of the directors for whom disclosure is presented 
on a group basis should be clear from the Table.

    (3) Narrative to director compensation table. Provide a narrative 
description of any material factors necessary to an understanding of the 
director compensation disclosed in this Table. While material factors 
will vary depending upon the facts, examples of such factors may 
include, in given cases, among other things:
    (i) A description of standard compensation arrangements (such as 
fees for retainer, committee service, service as chairman of the board 
or a committee, and meeting attendance); and
    (ii) Whether any director has a different compensation arrangement, 
identifying that director and describing the terms of that arrangement.

Instruction to Item 402(k). In addition to the Instruction to paragraphs 
402(k)(2)(iii) and (iv) and the Instructions to paragraph (k)(2)(vii) of 
this Item, the following apply equally to paragraph (k) of this Item: 
Instructions 2 and 4 to paragraph (c) of this Item; Instructions to 
paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this Item; the Instruction to 
paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (vi) of this Item; Instructions to paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii) of this Item; Instructions to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this 
Item; and Instructions 1 and 5 to paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this Item. 
These Instructions

[[Page 415]]

apply to the columns in the Director Compensation Table that are 
analogous to the columns in the Summary Compensation Table to which they 
refer and to disclosures under paragraph (k) of this Item that 
correspond to analogous disclosures provided for in paragraph (c) of 
this Item to which they refer.

    (l) Smaller reporting companies. A registrant that qualifies as a 
``smaller reporting company,'' as defined by Item 10(f) (Sec. 
229.10(f)(1)), may provide the scaled disclosure in paragraphs (m) 
through (r) instead of paragraphs (a) through (k) of this Item.
    (m) Smaller reporting companies--General--(1) All compensation 
covered. This Item requires clear, concise and understandable disclosure 
of all plan and non-plan compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to 
the named executive officers designated under paragraph (m)(2) of this 
Item, and directors covered by paragraph (r) of this Item, by any person 
for all services rendered in all capacities to the smaller reporting 
company and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically excluded 
from disclosure in this Item. All such compensation shall be reported 
pursuant to this Item, even if also called for by another requirement, 
including transactions between the smaller reporting company and a third 
party where a purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation to 
any such named executive officer or director. No amount reported as 
compensation for one fiscal year need be reported in the same manner as 
compensation for a subsequent fiscal year; amounts reported as 
compensation for one fiscal year may be required to be reported in a 
different manner pursuant to this Item.
    (2) Persons covered. Disclosure shall be provided pursuant to this 
Item for each of the following (the ``named executive officers''):
    (i) All individuals serving as the smaller reporting company's 
principal executive officer or acting in a similar capacity during the 
last completed fiscal year (``PEO''), regardless of compensation level;
    (ii) The smaller reporting company's two most highly compensated 
executive officers other than the PEO who were serving as executive 
officers at the end of the last completed fiscal year; and
    (iii) Up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would 
have been provided pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this Item but for 
the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of 
the smaller reporting company at the end of the last completed fiscal 
year.

    Instructions to Item 402(m)(2).
    1. Determination of most highly compensated executive officers. The 
determination as to which executive officers are most highly compensated 
shall be made by reference to total compensation for the last completed 
fiscal year (as required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (n)(2)(x) 
of this Item) reduced by the amount required to be disclosed pursuant to 
paragraph (n)(2)(viii) of this Item, provided, however, that no 
disclosure need be provided for any executive officer, other than the 
PEO, whose total compensation, as so reduced, does not exceed $100,000.
    2. Inclusion of executive officer of a subsidiary. It may be 
appropriate for a smaller reporting company to include as named 
executive officers one or more executive officers or other employees of 
subsidiaries in the disclosure required by this Item. See Rule 3b-7 
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.3b-7).
    3. Exclusion of executive officer due to overseas compensation. It 
may be appropriate in limited circumstances for a smaller reporting 
company not to include in the disclosure required by this Item an 
individual, other than its PEO, who is one of the smaller reporting 
company's most highly compensated executive officers due to the payment 
of amounts of cash compensation relating to overseas assignments 
attributed predominantly to such assignments.

    (3) Information for full fiscal year. If the PEO served in that 
capacity during any part of a fiscal year with respect to which 
information is required, information should be provided as to all of his 
or her compensation for the full fiscal year. If a named executive 
officer (other than the PEO) served as an executive officer of the 
smaller reporting company (whether or not in the same position) during 
any part of the fiscal year with respect to which information is 
required, information shall be provided as to all compensation of that 
individual for the full fiscal year.
    (4) Omission of table or column. A table or column may be omitted if 
there has been no compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to any of 
the named executive officers or directors required

[[Page 416]]

to be reported in that table or column in any fiscal year covered by 
that table.
    (5) Definitions. For purposes of this Item:
    (i) The term stock means instruments such as common stock, 
restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock, phantom stock 
units, common stock equivalent units or any similar instruments that do 
not have option-like features, and the term option means instruments 
such as stock options, stock appreciation rights and similar instruments 
with option-like features. The term stock appreciation rights (``SARs'') 
refers to SARs payable in cash or stock, including SARs payable in cash 
or stock at the election of the smaller reporting company or a named 
executive officer. The term equity is used to refer generally to stock 
and/or options.
    (ii) The term plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
Any plan, contract, authorization or arrangement, whether or not set 
forth in any formal document, pursuant to which cash, securities, 
similar instruments, or any other property may be received. A plan may 
be applicable to one person. Smaller reporting companies may omit 
information regarding group life, health, hospitalization, or medical 
reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in scope, terms or 
operation, in favor of executive officers or directors of the smaller 
reporting company and that are available generally to all salaried 
employees.
    (iii) The term incentive plan means any plan providing compensation 
intended to serve as incentive for performance to occur over a specified 
period, whether such performance is measured by reference to financial 
performance of the smaller reporting company or an affiliate, the 
smaller reporting company's stock price, or any other performance 
measure. An equity incentive plan is an incentive plan or portion of an 
incentive plan under which awards are granted that fall within the scope 
of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, as 
modified or supplemented (``FAS 123R''). A non-equity incentive plan is 
an incentive plan or portion of an incentive plan that is not an equity 
incentive plan. The term incentive plan award means an award provided 
under an incentive plan.
    (iv) The terms date of grant or grant date refer to the grant date 
determined for financial statement reporting purposes pursuant to FAS 
123R.
    (v) Closing market price is defined as the price at which the 
smaller reporting company's security was last sold in the principal 
United States market for such security as of the date for which the 
closing market price is determined.
    (n) Smaller reporting companies--Summary compensation table--(1) 
General. Provide the information specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this 
Item, concerning the compensation of the named executive officers for 
each of the smaller reporting company's last two completed fiscal years, 
in a Summary Compensation Table in the tabular format specified below.

                                                               Summary Compensation Table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name and principal position of the named executive officer 
(column (a));

[[Page 417]]

    (ii) The fiscal year covered (column (b));
    (iii) The dollar value of base salary (cash and non-cash) earned by 
the named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (c));
    (iv) The dollar value of bonus (cash and non-cash) earned by the 
named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (d));

    Instructions to Item 402(n)(2)(iii) and (iv).
    1. If the amount of salary or bonus earned in a given fiscal year is 
not calculable through the latest practicable date, a footnote shall be 
included disclosing that the amount of salary or bonus is not calculable 
through the latest practicable date and providing the date that the 
amount of salary or bonus is expected to be determined, and such amount 
must then be disclosed in a filing under Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K (17 
CFR 249.308).
    2. Smaller reporting companies shall include in the salary column 
(column (c)) or bonus column (column (d)) any amount of salary or bonus 
forgone at the election of a named executive officer under which stock, 
equity-based or other forms of non-cash compensation instead have been 
received by the named executive officer. However, the receipt of any 
such form of non-cash compensation instead of salary or bonus must be 
disclosed in a footnote added to the salary or bonus column and, where 
applicable, referring to the narrative disclosure to the Summary 
Compensation Table (required by paragraph (o) of this Item) where the 
material terms of the stock, option or non-equity incentive plan award 
elected by the named executive officer are reported.
    (v) For awards of stock, the dollar amount recognized for financial 
statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in 
accordance with FAS 123R (column (e));
    (vi) For awards of options, with or without tandem SARs, the dollar 
amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with 
respect to the fiscal year in accordance with FAS 123R (column (f));

    Instruction to Item 402(n)(2)(v) and (vi). For awards reported in 
columns (e) and (f), disregard the estimate of forfeitures related to 
service-based vesting conditions. Include a footnote describing all 
forfeitures during the year, and disclosing all assumptions made in the 
valuation. Disclose assumptions made in the valuation by reference to a 
discussion of those assumptions in the registrant's financial 
statements, footnotes to the financial statements, or discussion in the 
Management's Discussion and Analysis. The sections so referenced are 
deemed part of the disclosure provided pursuant to this Item.

    (vii) The dollar value of all earnings for services performed during 
the fiscal year pursuant to awards under non-equity incentive plans as 
defined in paragraph (m)(5)(iii) of this Item, and all earnings on any 
outstanding awards (column (g));

    Instructions to Item 402(n)(2)(vii).
    1. If the relevant performance measure is satisfied during the 
fiscal year (including for a single year in a plan with a multi-year 
performance measure), the earnings are reportable for that fiscal year, 
even if not payable until a later date, and are not reportable again in 
the fiscal year when amounts are paid to the named executive officer.
    2. All earnings on non-equity incentive plan compensation must be 
identified and quantified in a footnote to column (g), whether the 
earnings were paid during the fiscal year, payable during the period but 
deferred at the election of the named executive officer, or payable by 
their terms at a later date.

    (viii) Above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is 
deferred on a basis that is not tax-qualified, including such earnings 
on nonqualified defined contribution plans (column (h));

    Instruction to Item 402(n)(2)(viii). Interest on deferred 
compensation is above-market only if the rate of interest exceeds 120% 
of the applicable federal long-term rate, with compounding (as 
prescribed under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, (26 
U.S.C. 1274(d))) at the rate that corresponds most closely to the rate 
under the smaller reporting company's plan at the time the interest rate 
or formula is set. In the event of a discretionary reset of the interest 
rate, the requisite calculation must be made on the basis of the 
interest rate at the time of such reset, rather than when originally 
established. Only the above-market portion of the interest must be 
included. If the applicable interest rates vary depending upon 
conditions such as a minimum period of continued service, the reported 
amount should be calculated assuming satisfaction of all conditions to 
receiving interest at the highest rate. Dividends (and dividend 
equivalents) on deferred compensation denominated in the smaller 
reporting company's stock (``deferred stock'') are preferential only if 
earned at a rate higher than dividends on the smaller reporting 
company's common stock. Only the preferential portion of the dividends 
or equivalents must be included. Footnote or narrative disclosure may be 
provided explaining the smaller reporting company's

[[Page 418]]

criteria for determining any portion considered to be above-market.

    (ix) All other compensation for the covered fiscal year that the 
smaller reporting company could not properly report in any other column 
of the Summary Compensation Table (column (i)). Each compensation item 
that is not properly reportable in columns (c) through (h), regardless 
of the amount of the compensation item, must be included in column (i). 
Such compensation must include, but is not limited to:
    (A) Perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the 
aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000;
    (B) All ``gross-ups'' or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal 
year for the payment of taxes;
    (C) For any security of the smaller reporting company or its 
subsidiaries purchased from the smaller reporting company or its 
subsidiaries (through deferral of salary or bonus, or otherwise) at a 
discount from the market price of such security at the date of purchase, 
unless that discount is available generally, either to all security 
holders or to all salaried employees of the smaller reporting company, 
the compensation cost, if any, computed in accordance with FAS 123R;
    (D) The amount paid or accrued to any named executive officer 
pursuant to a plan or arrangement in connection with:
    (1) Any termination, including without limitation through 
retirement, resignation, severance or constructive termination 
(including a change in responsibilities) of such executive officer's 
employment with the smaller reporting company and its subsidiaries; or
    (2) A change in control of the smaller reporting company;
    (E) Smaller reporting company contributions or other allocations to 
vested and unvested defined contribution plans;
    (F) The dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf 
of, the smaller reporting company during the covered fiscal year with 
respect to life insurance for the benefit of a named executive officer; 
and
    (G) The dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid on 
stock or option awards, when those amounts were not factored into the 
grant date fair value for the stock or option award; and

    Instructions to Item 402(n)(2)(ix).
    1. Non-equity incentive plan awards and earnings and earnings on 
stock or options, except as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(ix)(G) of this 
Item, are required to be reported elsewhere as provided in this Item and 
are not reportable as All Other Compensation in column (i).
    2. Benefits paid pursuant to defined benefit and actuarial plans are 
not reportable as All Other Compensation in column (i) unless 
accelerated pursuant to a change in control; information concerning 
these plans is reportable pursuant to paragraph (q)(1) of this Item.
    3. Reimbursements of taxes owed with respect to perquisites or other 
personal benefits must be included in the columns as tax reimbursements 
(paragraph (n)(2)(ix)(B) of this Item) even if the associated 
perquisites or other personal benefits are not required to be included 
because the aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000.
    4. Perquisites and other personal benefits shall be valued on the 
basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the smaller reporting 
company.
    5. For purposes of paragraph (n)(2)(ix)(D) of this Item, an accrued 
amount is an amount for which payment has become due.

    (x) The dollar value of total compensation for the covered fiscal 
year (column (j)). With respect to each named executive officer, 
disclose the sum of all amounts reported in columns (c) through (i).

    Instructions to Item 402(n).
    1. Information with respect to the fiscal year prior to the last 
completed fiscal year will not be required if the smaller reporting 
company was not a reporting company pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 78o(d)) at any time during that 
year, except that the smaller reporting company will be required to 
provide information for any such year if that information previously was 
required to be provided in response to a Commission filing requirement.
    2. All compensation values reported in the Summary Compensation 
Table must be reported in dollars and rounded to the nearest dollar. 
Reported compensation values must be reported numerically, providing a 
single numerical value for each grid in the table. Where compensation 
was paid to or received by a named executive officer in a different 
currency, a footnote must be provided to

[[Page 419]]

identify that currency and describe the rate and methodology used to 
convert the payment amounts to dollars.
    3. If a named executive officer is also a director who receives 
compensation for his or her services as a director, reflect that 
compensation in the Summary Compensation Table and provide a footnote 
identifying and itemizing such compensation and amounts. Use the 
categories in the Director Compensation Table required pursuant to 
paragraph (r) of this Item.
    4. Any amounts deferred, whether pursuant to a plan established 
under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(k)), or 
otherwise, shall be included in the appropriate column for the fiscal 
year in which earned.

    (o) Smaller reporting companies--Narrative disclosure to summary 
compensation table. Provide a narrative description of any material 
factors necessary to an understanding of the information disclosed in 
the Table required by paragraph (n) of this Item. Examples of such 
factors may include, in given cases, among other things:
    (1) The material terms of each named executive officer's employment 
agreement or arrangement, whether written or unwritten;
    (2) If at any time during the last fiscal year, any outstanding 
option or other equity-based award was repriced or otherwise materially 
modified (such as by extension of exercise periods, the change of 
vesting or forfeiture conditions, the change or elimination of 
applicable performance criteria, or the change of the bases upon which 
returns are determined), a description of each such repricing or other 
material modification;
    (3) The waiver or modification of any specified performance target, 
goal or condition to payout with respect to any amount included in non-
stock incentive plan compensation or payouts reported in column (g) to 
the Summary Compensation Table required by paragraph (n) of this Item, 
stating whether the waiver or modification applied to one or more 
specified named executive officers or to all compensation subject to the 
target, goal or condition;
    (4) The material terms of each grant, including but not limited to 
the date of exercisability, any conditions to exercisability, any tandem 
feature, any reload feature, any tax-reimbursement feature, and any 
provision that could cause the exercise price to be lowered;
    (5) The material terms of any non-equity incentive plan award made 
to a named executive officer during the last completed fiscal year, 
including a general description of the formula or criteria to be applied 
in determining the amounts payable and vesting schedule;
    (6) The method of calculating earnings on nonqualified deferred 
compensation plans including nonqualified defined contribution plans; 
and
    (7) An identification to the extent material of any item included 
under All Other Compensation (column (i)) in the Summary Compensation 
Table. Identification of an item shall not be considered material if it 
does not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of all items included in 
the specified category in question set forth in paragraph (n)(2)(ix) of 
this Item. All items of compensation are required to be included in the 
Summary Compensation Table without regard to whether such items are 
required to be identified.

    Instruction to Item 402(o). The disclosure required by paragraph 
(o)(2) of this Item would not apply to any repricing that occurs through 
a pre-existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award that results in 
the periodic adjustment of the option or SAR exercise or base price, an 
antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a recapitalization or 
similar transaction equally affecting all holders of the class of 
securities underlying the options or SARs.

    (p) Smaller reporting companies--Outstanding equity awards at fiscal 
year-end table. (1) Provide the information specified in paragraph 
(p)(2) of this Item, concerning unexercised options; stock that has not 
vested; and equity incentive plan awards for each named executive 
officer outstanding as of the end of the smaller reporting company's 
last completed fiscal year in the following tabular format:

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name of the named executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) On an award-by-award basis, the number of securities underlying 
unexercised options, including awards that have been transferred other 
than for value, that are exercisable and that are not reported in column 
(d) (column (b));
    (iii) On an award-by-award basis, the number of securities 
underlying unexercised options, including awards that have been 
transferred other than for value, that are unexercisable and that are 
not reported in column (d) (column (c));
    (iv) On an award-by-award basis, the total number of shares 
underlying unexercised options awarded under any equity incentive plan 
that have not been earned (column (d));
    (v) For each instrument reported in columns (b), (c) and (d), as 
applicable, the exercise or base price (column (e));
    (vi) For each instrument reported in columns (b), (c) and (d), as 
applicable, the expiration date (column (f));
    (vii) The total number of shares of stock that have not vested and 
that are not reported in column (i) (column (g));
    (viii) The aggregate market value of shares of stock that have not 
vested and that are not reported in column (j) (column (h));
    (ix) The total number of shares of stock, units or other rights 
awarded under any equity incentive plan that have not vested and that 
have not been earned, and, if applicable the number of shares underlying 
any such unit or right (column (i)); and
    (x) The aggregate market or payout value of shares of stock, units 
or other rights awarded under any equity incentive plan that have not 
vested and that have not been earned (column (j)).

    Instructions to Item 402(p)(2).
    1. Identify by footnote any award that has been transferred other 
than for value, disclosing the nature of the transfer.
    2. The vesting dates of options, shares of stock and equity 
incentive plan awards held at fiscal-year end must be disclosed by 
footnote to the applicable column where the outstanding award is 
reported.
    3. Compute the market value of stock reported in column (h) and 
equity incentive plan awards of stock reported in column (j) by 
multiplying the closing market price of the smaller reporting company's 
stock at the end of the last completed fiscal year by the number of 
shares or units of stock or the

[[Page 421]]

amount of equity incentive plan awards, respectively. The number of 
shares or units reported in column (d) or (i), and the payout value 
reported in column (j), shall be based on achieving threshold 
performance goals, except that if the previous fiscal year's performance 
has exceeded the threshold, the disclosure shall be based on the next 
higher performance measure (target or maximum) that exceeds the previous 
fiscal year's performance. If the award provides only for a single 
estimated payout, that amount should be reported. If the target amount 
is not determinable, smaller reporting companies must provide a 
representative amount based on the previous fiscal year's performance.
    4. Multiple awards may be aggregated where the expiration date and 
the exercise and/or base price of the instruments is identical. A single 
award consisting of a combination of options, SARs and/or similar 
option-like instruments shall be reported as separate awards with 
respect to each tranche with a different exercise and/or base price or 
expiration date.
    5. Options or stock awarded under an equity incentive plan are 
reported in columns (d) or (i) and (j), respectively, until the relevant 
performance condition has been satisfied. Once the relevant performance 
condition has been satisfied, even if the option or stock award is 
subject to forfeiture conditions, options are reported in column (b) or 
(c), as appropriate, until they are exercised or expire, or stock is 
reported in columns (g) and (h) until it vests.

    (2) The material terms of each contract, agreement, plan or

[[Page 424]]


Instructions to Item 403: 1. The percentages are to be calculated on the 
basis of the amount of outstanding securities, excluding securities held 
by or for the account of the registrant or its subsidiaries, plus 
securities deemed outstanding pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the 
Exchange Act 17 (CFR 240.13d-3(d)(1)). For purposes of paragraph (b), if 
the percentage of shares beneficially owned by any director or nominee, 
or by all directors and officers of the registrant as a group, does not 
exceed one percent of the class so owned, the registrant may, in lieu of 
furnishing a precise percentage, indicate this fact by means of an 
asterisk and explanatory footnote or other similar means.
    2. For the purposes of this Item, beneficial ownership shall be 
determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 
240.13d-3 of this chapter). Include such additional subcolumns or other 
appropriate explanation of column (3) necessary to reflect amounts as to 
which the beneficial owner has (A) sole voting power, (B) shared voting 
power, (C) sole investment power, or (D) shared investment power.
    3. The registrant shall be deemed to know the contents of any 
statements filed with the Commission pursuant to section 13(d) or 13(g) 
of the Exchange Act. When applicable, a registrant may rely upon 
information set forth in such statements unless the registrant knows or 
has reason to believe that such information is not complete or accurate 
or that a statement or amendment should have been filed and was not.
    4. For purposes of furnishing information pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this Item, the registrant may indicate the source and date of such 
information.
    5. Where more than one beneficial owner is known to be listed for 
the same securities, appropriate disclosure should be made to avoid 
confusion. For purposes of paragraph (b), in computing the aggregate 
number of shares owned by directors and officers of the registrant as a 
group, the same shares shall not be counted more than once.
    6. Paragraph (c) of this Item does not require a description of 
ordinary default provisions contained in the charter, trust indentures 
or other governing instruments relating to securities of the registrant.
    7. Where the holder(s) of voting securities reported pursuant to 
paragraph (a) hold more than five percent of any class of voting 
securities of the registrant pursuant to any voting trust or similar 
agreement, state the title of such securities, the amount held or to be 
held pursuant to the trust or agreement (if not clear from the table) 
and the duration of the agreement. Give the names and addresses of the 
voting trustees and outline briefly their voting rights and other powers

    ii. Were made on substantially the same terms, including interest 
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable 
loans with persons not related to the lender; and
    iii. Did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or 
present other unfavorable features.
    5.a. Disclosure of an employment relationship or transaction 
involving an executive officer and any related compensation solely 
resulting from that employment relationship or transaction need not be 
provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Item if:
    i. The compensation arising from the relationship or transaction is 
reported pursuant to Item 402 (Sec. 229.402); or
    ii. The executive officer is not an immediate family member (as 
specified in Instruction 1 to paragraph (a) of this Item) and such 
compensation would have been reported under Item 402 (Sec. 229.402) as 
compensation earned for services to the registrant if the executive 
officer was a named executive officer as that term is defined in Item 
402(a)(3) (Sec. 229.402(a)(3)), and such compensation had been

Sec. 229.405  (Item 405) Compliance with section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

    Every registrant having a class of equity securities registered 
pursuant to section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l), every 
closed-end investment company registered under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), and every holding company 
registered pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 
(15 U.S.C. 79a et seq.) shall:
    (a) Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 (17 CFR 249.103 and 
249.104) and amendments thereto furnished to the registrant under 17 CFR 
240.16a-3(e) during its most recent fiscal year and Forms 5 and 
amendments thereto (17 CFR 249.105) furnished to the registrant with 
respect to its most recent fiscal year, and any written representation 
referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (1) Under the caption ``Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting 
Compliance,'' identify each person who, at any time during the fiscal 
year, was a director, officer, beneficial owner of more than ten percent 
of any class of equity securities of the registrant registered pursuant 
to section 12 of the Exchange Act, or any other person subject to 
section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to the registrant because of 
the requirements of section 30 of the Investment Company Act or section 
17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (``reporting person'') that 
failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the above Forms, 
reports required by section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the most 
recent fiscal year or prior fiscal years.

[[Page 428]]

    (2) For each such person, set forth the number of late reports, the 
number of transactions that were not reported on a timely basis, and any 
known failure to file a required Form. A known failure to file would 
include, but not be limited to, a failure to file a Form 3, which is 
required of all reporting persons, and a failure to file a Form 5 in the 
absence of the written representation referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, unless the registrant otherwise knows that no Form 5 is 
required.
    Note: The disclosure requirement is based on a review of the forms 
submitted to the registrant during and with respect to its most recent 
fiscal year, as specified above. Accordingly, a failure to file timely 
need only be disclosed once. For example, if in the most recently 
concluded fiscal year a reporting person filed a Form 4 disclosing a 
transaction that took place in the prior fiscal year, and should have 
been reported in that year, the registrant should disclose that late 
filing and transaction pursuant to this Item 405 with respect to the 
most recently concluded fiscal year, but not in material filed with 
respect to subsequent years.

    (b) With respect to the disclosure required by paragraph (a) of this 
section, if the registrant:
    (1) Receives a written representation from the reporting person that 
no Form 5 is required; and
    (2) Maintains the representation for two years, making a copy 
available to the Commission or its staff upon request, the registrant 
need not identify such reporting person pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section as having failed to file a Form 5 with respect to that 
fiscal year.

Sec. 229.406  (Item 406) Code of ethics.

    (a) Disclose whether the registrant has adopted a code of ethics 
that applies to the registrant's principal executive officer, principal 
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or 
persons performing similar functions. If the registrant has not adopted 
such a code of ethics, explain why it has not done so.
    (b) For purposes of this Item 406, the term code of ethics means 
written standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and 
to promote:
    (1) Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of 
actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and 
professional relationships;
    (2) Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in 
reports and documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the 
Commission and in other public communications made by the registrant;
    (3) Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and 
regulations;
    (4) The prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an 
appropriate person or persons identified in the code; and
    (5) Accountability for adherence to the code.
    (c) The registrant must:
    (1) File with the Commission a copy of its code of ethics that 
applies to the registrant's principal executive officer, principal 
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or 
persons performing similar functions, as an exhibit to its annual 
report;
    (2) Post the text of such code of ethics on its Internet website and 
disclose, in its annual report, its Internet address and the fact that 
it has posted such code of ethics on its Internet Web site; or
    (3) Undertake in its annual report filed with the Commission to 
provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of such code 
of ethics and explain the manner in which such request may be made.
    (d) If the registrant intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement 
under Item 10 of Form 8-K regarding an amendment to, or a waiver from, a 
provision of its code of ethics that applies to the registrant's 
principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal 
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar 
functions and that relates to any element of the code of ethics 
definition enumerated in paragraph (b) of this Item by posting such 
information on its Internet website, disclose the registrant's Internet 
address and such intention.

Instructions to Item 406. 1. A registrant may have separate codes of 
ethics for different

[[Page 429]]

types of officers. Furthermore, a code of ethics within the meaning of 
paragraph (b) of this Item may be a portion of a broader document that 
addresses additional topics or that applies to more persons than those 
specified in paragraph (a). In satisfying the requirements of paragraph 
(c), a registrant need only file, post or provide the portions of a 
broader document that constitutes a code of ethics as defined in 
paragraph (b) and that apply to the persons specified in paragraph (a).
    2. If a registrant elects to satisfy paragraph (c) of this Item by 
posting its code of ethics on its website pursuant to paragraph (c)(2), 
the code of ethics must remain accessible on its Web site for as long as 
the registrant remains subject to the requirements of this Item and 
chooses to comply with this Item by posting its code on its Web site 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2).

Sec. 229.407  (Item 407) Corporate governance.

    (a) Director independence. Identify each director and, when the 
disclosure called for by this paragraph is being presented in a proxy or 
information statement relating to the election of directors, each 
nominee for director, that is independent under the independence 
standards applicable to the registrant under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
Item. In addition, if such independence standards contain independence 
requirements for committees of the board of directors, identify each 
director that is a member of the compensation, nominating or audit 
committee that is not independent under such committee independence 
standards. If the registrant does not have a separately designated 
audit, nominating or compensation committee or committee performing 
similar functions, the registrant must provide the disclosure of 
directors that are not independent with respect to all members of the 
board of directors applying such committee independence standards.
    (1) In determining whether or not the director or nominee for 
director is independent for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this Item, 
the registrant shall use the applicable definition of independence, as 
follows:
    (i) If the registrant is a listed issuer whose securities are listed 
on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system 
which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be 
independent, the registrant's definition of independence that it uses 
for determining if a majority of the board of directors is independent 
in compliance with the listing standards applicable to the registrant. 
When determining whether the members of a committee of the board of 
directors are independent, the registrant's definition of independence 
that it uses for determining if the members of that specific committee 
are independent in compliance with the independence standards applicable 
for the members of the specific committee in the listing standards of 
the national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system that 
the registrant uses for determining if a majority of the board of 
directors are independent. If the registrant does not have independence 
standards for a committee, the independence standards for that specific 
committee in the listing standards of the national securities exchange 
or inter-dealer quotation system that the registrant uses for 
determining if a majority of the board of directors are independent.
    (ii) If the registrant is not a listed issuer, a definition of 
independence of a national securities exchange or of an inter-dealer 
quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of 
directors be independent, and state which definition is used. Whatever 
such definition the registrant chooses, it must use the same definition 
with respect to all directors and nominees for director. When 
determining whether the members of a specific committee of the board of 
directors are independent, if the national securities exchange or 
national securities association whose standards are used has 
independence standards for the members of a specific committee, use 
those committee specific standards.
    (iii) If the information called for by paragraph (a) of this Item is 
being presented in a registration statement on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of 
this chapter) under the Securities Act or on a Form 10 (Sec. 249.210 of 
this chapter) under the Exchange Act where the registrant has

[[Page 430]]

applied for listing with a national securities exchange or in an inter-
dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the 
board of directors be independent, the definition of independence that 
the registrant uses for determining if a majority of the board of 
directors is independent, and the definition of independence that the 
registrant uses for determining if members of the specific committee of 
the board of directors are independent, that is in compliance with the 
independence listing standards of the national securities exchange or 
inter-dealer quotation system on which it has applied for listing, or if 
the registrant has not adopted such definitions, the independence 
standards for determining if the majority of the board of directors is 
independent and if members of the committee of the board of directors 
are independent of that national securities exchange or inter-dealer 
quotation system.
    (2) If the registrant uses its own definitions for determining 
whether its directors and nominees for director, and members of specific 
committees of the board of directors, are independent, disclose whether 
these definitions are available to security holders on the registrant's 
Web site. If so, provide the registrant's Web site address. If not, 
include a copy of these policies in an appendix to the registrant's 
proxy statement or information statement that is provided to security 
holders at least once every three fiscal years or if the policies have 
been materially amended since the beginning of the registrant's last 
fiscal year. If a current copy of the policies is not available to 
security holders on the registrant's Web site, and is not included as an 
appendix to the registrant's proxy statement or information statement, 
identify the most recent fiscal year in which the policies were so 
included in satisfaction of this requirement.
    (3) For each director and nominee for director that is identified as 
independent, describe, by specific category or type, any transactions, 
relationships or arrangements not disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) 
(Sec. 229.404(a)), or for investment companies, Item 22(b) of Schedule 
14A (Sec. 240.14a-101 of this chapter), that were considered by the 
board of directors under the applicable independence definitions in 
determining that the director is independent.

Instructions to Item 407(a). 1. If the registrant is a listed issuer 
whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or in an 
inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of 
the board of directors be independent, and also has exemptions to those 
requirements (for independence of a majority of the board of directors 
or committee member independence) upon which the registrant relied, 
disclose the exemption relied upon and explain the basis for the 
registrant's conclusion that such exemption is applicable. The same 
disclosure should be provided if the registrant is not a listed issuer 
and the national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system 
selected by the registrant has exemptions that are applicable to the 
registrant. Any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation 
system which has requirements that at least 50 percent of the members of 
a small business issuer's board of directors must be independent shall 
be considered a national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation 
system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors 
be independent for the purposes of the disclosure required by paragraph 
(a) of this Item.
    2. Registrants shall provide the disclosure required by paragraph 
(a) of this Item for any person who served as a director during any part 
of the last completed fiscal year, except that no information called for 
by paragraph (a) of this Item need be given in a registration statement 
filed at a time when the registrant is not subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 
78m(a) or 78o(d)) respecting any director who is no longer a director at 
the time of effectiveness of the registration statement.
    3. The description of the specific categories or types of 
transactions, relationships or arrangements required by paragraph (a)(3) 
of this Item must be provided in such detail as is necessary to fully 
describe the nature of the transactions, relationships or arrangements.

    (b) Board meetings and committees; annual meeting attendance. (1) 
State the total number of meetings of the board of directors (including 
regularly scheduled and special meetings) which were held during the 
last full fiscal year. Name each incumbent director who during the last 
full fiscal year attended fewer than 75 percent of the aggregate of:
    (i) The total number of meetings of the board of directors (held 
during the

[[Page 431]]

period for which he has been a director); and
    (ii) The total number of meetings held by all committees of the 
board on which he served (during the periods that he served).
    (2) Describe the registrant's policy, if any, with regard to board 
members' attendance at annual meetings of security holders and state the 
number of board members who attended the prior year's annual meeting.

Instruction to Item 407(b)(2). In lieu of providing the information 
required by paragraph (b)(2) of this Item in the proxy statement, the 
registrant may instead provide the registrant's Web site address where 
such information appears.

    (3) State whether or not the registrant has standing audit, 
nominating and compensation committees of the board of directors, or 
committees performing similar functions. If the registrant has such 
committees, however designated, identify each committee member, state 
the number of committee meetings held by each such committee during the 
last fiscal year and describe briefly the functions performed by each 
such committee. Such disclosure need not be provided to the extent it is 
duplicative of disclosure provided in accordance with paragraph (c), (d) 
or (e) of this Item.
    (c) Nominating committee. (1) If the registrant does not have a 
standing nominating committee or committee performing similar functions, 
state the basis for the view of the board of directors that it is 
appropriate for the registrant not to have such a committee and identify 
each director who participates in the consideration of director 
nominees.
    (2) Provide the following information regarding the registrant's 
director nomination process:
    (i) State whether or not the nominating committee has a charter. If 
the nominating committee has a charter, provide the disclosure required 
by Instruction 2 to this Item regarding the nominating committee 
charter;
    (ii) If the nominating committee has a policy with regard to the 
consideration of any director candidates recommended by security 
holders, provide a description of the material elements of that policy, 
which shall include, but need not be limited to, a statement as to 
whether the committee will consider director candidates recommended by 
security holders;
    (iii) If the nominating committee does not have a policy with regard 
to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by security 
holders, state that fact and state the basis for the view of the board 
of directors that it is appropriate for the registrant not to have such 
a policy;
    (iv) If the nominating committee will consider candidates 
recommended by security holders, describe the procedures to be followed 
by security holders in submitting such recommendations;
    (v) Describe any specific minimum qualifications that the nominating 
committee believes must be met by a nominating committee-recommended 
nominee for a position on the registrant's board of directors, and 
describe any specific qualities or skills that the nominating committee 
believes are necessary for one or more of the registrant's directors to 
possess;
    (vi) Describe the nominating committee's process for identifying and 
evaluating nominees for director, including nominees recommended by 
security holders, and any differences in the manner in which the 
nominating committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether 
the nominee is recommended by a security holder;
    (vii) With regard to each nominee approved by the nominating 
committee for inclusion on the registrant's proxy card (other than 
nominees who are executive officers or who are directors standing for 
re-election), state which one or more of the following categories of 
persons or entities recommended that nominee: Security holder, non-
management director, chief executive officer, other executive officer, 
third-party search firm, or other specified source. With regard to each 
such nominee approved by a nominating committee of an investment 
company, state which one or more of the following additional categories 
of persons or entities recommended that nominee: Security holder, 
director, chief executive officer, other executive officer, or employee 
of the investment company's

[[Page 432]]

investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person of 
the investment adviser or principal underwriter;
    (viii) If the registrant pays a fee to any third party or parties to 
identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential 
nominees, disclose the function performed by each such third party; and
    (ix) If the registrant's nominating committee received, by a date 
not later than the 120th calendar day before the date of the 
registrant's proxy statement released to security holders in connection 
with the previous year's annual meeting, a recommended nominee from a 
security holder that beneficially owned more than 5% of the registrant's 
voting common stock for at least one year as of the date the 
recommendation was made, or from a group of security holders that 
beneficially owned, in the aggregate, more than 5% of the registrant's 
voting common stock, with each of the securities used to calculate that 
ownership held for at least one year as of the date the recommendation 
was made, identify the candidate and the security holder or security 
holder group that recommended the candidate and disclose whether the 
nominating committee chose to nominate the candidate, provided, however, 
that no such identification or disclosure is required without the 
written consent of both the security holder or security holder group and 
the candidate to be so identified.

Instructions to Item 407(c)(2)(ix). 1. For purposes of paragraph 
(c)(2)(ix) of this Item, the percentage of securities held by a 
nominating security holder may be determined using information set forth 
in the registrant's most recent quarterly or annual report, and any 
current report subsequent thereto, filed with the Commission pursuant to 
the Exchange Act (or, in the case of a registrant that is an investment 
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the 
registrant's most recent report on Form N-CSR (Sec. Sec. 249.331 and 
274.128 of this chapter)), unless the party relying on such report knows

shareholder's net proceeds. Show this information on both a per share or 
unit basis and for the total amount of the offering. If you make the 
offering on a minimum/maximum basis, show this information based on the 
total minimum and total maximum amount of the offering. You may present 
the information in a table, term sheet format, or other clear 
presentation. You may present the information in any format that fits 
the design of the cover page so long as the information can be easily 
read and is not misleading:

Instructions to paragraph 501(b)(3): 1. If a preliminary prospectus is 
circulated and you are not subject to the reporting requirements of 
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, provide, as applicable:
    (A) A bona fide estimate of the range of the maximum offering price 
and the maximum number of securities offered; or
    (B) A bona fide estimate of the principal amount of the debt 
securities offered.
    2. If it is impracticable to state the price to the public, explain 
the method by which the price is to be determined. If the securities are 
to be offered at the market price, or if the offering price is to be 
determined by a formula related to the market price, indicate the market 
and market price of the securities as of the latest practicable date.

[[Page 439]]

    3. If you file a registration statement on Form S-8, you are not 
required to comply with this paragraph (b)(3).

has approved or disapproved of the securities or passed upon the 
accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures in the prospectus and that any 
contrary representation is a criminal offense. You may use one of the 
following or other clear, plain language:

    Example A: Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any 
state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these 
securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. 
Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
    Example B: Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any 
state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these 
securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any 
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

    (8) Underwriting. (i) Name(s) of the lead or managing underwriter(s) 
and an identification of the nature of the underwriting arrangements;
    (ii) If the offering is not made on a firm commitment basis, a brief 
description of the underwriting arrangements. You may use any clear, 
concise, and accurate description of the underwriting arrangements. You 
may use the following descriptions of underwriting arrangements where 
appropriate:

    Example A: Best efforts offering. The underwriters are not required 
to sell any specific number or dollar amount of securities but will use 
their best efforts to sell the securities offered.
    Example B: Best efforts, minimum-maximum offering. The underwriters 
must sell the minimum number of securities offered (insert number) if 
any are sold. The underwriters are required to use only their best

    (iii) If you offer the securities on a best efforts or best efforts 
minimum/maximum basis, the date the offering will end, any minimum 
purchase requirements, and any arrangements to place the funds in an 
escrow, trust, or similar account. If you have not made any of these 
arrangements, state this fact and describe the effect on investors;

    (iv) The prospectus is not an offer to sell the securities and it is 
not soliciting an offer to buy the securities in any state where offers 
or sales are not permitted. The legend may be in the following or other 
clear, plain language:

    The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be 
changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration 
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is

Sec. 230.421(d) of Regulation C of this chapter.
    (a) Table of contents. On either the inside front or outside back 
cover page of the prospectus, provide a reasonably detailed table of 
contents. It must show the page number of the various sections or 
subdivisions of the prospectus. Include a specific listing of the risk

<R05>
Sec. 229.503  (Item 503) Prospectus summary, risk factors, and ratio of earnings to fixed charges.

    The registrant must furnish this information in plain English. See 
Sec. 230.421(d) of Regulation C of this chapter.
    (a) Prospectus summary. Provide a summary of the information in the 
prospectus where the length or complexity of the prospectus makes a 
summary useful. The summary should be brief. The summary should not 
contain, and is not required to contain, all of the detailed information 
in the prospectus. If you provide summary business or financial 
information, even if you do not caption it as a summary, you still must 
provide that information in plain English.

Instruction to paragraph 503(a): The summary should not merely repeat 
the text of the prospectus but should provide a brief overview of the 
key aspects of the offering. Carefully consider and identify those 
aspects of the offering that are the most significant and determine how 
best to highlight those points in clear, plain language.

    (b) Address and telephone number. Include, either on the cover page 
or in the summary section of the prospectus, the complete mailing 
address and telephone number of your principal executive offices.
    (c) Risk factors. Where appropriate, provide under the caption 
``Risk Factors'' a discussion of the most significant factors that make 
the offering speculative or risky. This discussion must be concise and 
organized logically. Do not present risks that could apply to any issuer 
or any offering. Explain how the risk affects the issuer or the 
securities being offered. Set forth each risk factor under a subcaption 
that adequately describes the risk. The risk factor discussion must 
immediately follow the summary section. If you do not include a summary 
section, the risk factor section must immediately follow the cover page 
of the prospectus or the pricing information section that immediately 
follows the cover page. Pricing information means price and price-
related information that you may omit from the prospectus in an 
effective registration statement based on Sec. 230.430A(a) of this 
chapter.

[[Page 441]]

The risk factors may include, among other things, the following:
    (1) Your lack of an operating history;
    (2) Your lack of profitable operations in recent periods;
    (3) Your financial position;
    (4) Your business or proposed business; or
    (5) The lack of a market for your common equity securities or 
securities convertible into or exercisable for common equity securities.
    (d) Ratio of earnings to fixed charges. If you register debt 
securities, show a ratio of earnings to fixed charges. If you register 
preference equity securities, show the ratio of combined fixed charges 
and preference dividends to earnings. Present the ratio for each of the 
last five fiscal years and the latest interim period for which financial 
statements are presented in the document. If you will use the proceeds 
from the sale of debt or preference securities to repay any of your 
outstanding debt or to retire other securities and the change in the 
ratio would be ten percent or greater, you must include a ratio showing 
the application of the proceeds, commonly referred to as the pro forma 
ratio.

Instructions to paragraph 503(d): 1. Definitions. In calculating the 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, you must use the following 
definitions:
    (A) Fixed charges. The term ``fixed charges'' means the sum of the 
following: (a) interest expensed and capitalized, (b) amortized 
premiums, discounts and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness, 
(c) an estimate of the interest within rental expense, and (d) 
preference security dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries.
    (B) Preference security dividend. The term ``preference security 
dividend'' is the amount of pre-tax earnings that is required to pay the 
dividends on outstanding preference securities. The dividend requirement 
must be computed as the amount of the dividend divided by (1 minus the 
effective income tax rate applicable to continuing operations).
    (C) Earnings. The term ``earnings'' is the amount resulting from 
adding and subtracting the following items. Add the following: (a) Pre-
tax income from continuing operations before adjustment for minority 
interests in consolidated subsidiaries or income or loss from equity 
investees, (b) fixed charges, (c) amortization of capitalized interest, 
(d) distributed income of equity investees, and (e) your share of pre-
tax losses of equity investees for which charges arising from guarantees 
are included in fixed charges. From the total of the added items, 
subtract the following: (a) interest capitalized, (b) preference 
security dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries, and (c) the 
minority interest in pre-tax income of subsidiaries that have not 
incurred fixed charges. Equity investees are investments that you 
account for using the equity method of accounting. Public utilities 
following SFAS 71 should not add amortization of capitalized interest in 
determining earnings, nor reduce fixed charges by any allowance for 
funds used during construction.
    2. Disclosure. Disclose the following information when showing the 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges:
    (A) Deficiency. If a ratio indicates less than one-to-one coverage, 
disclose the dollar amount of the deficiency.
    (B) Pro forma ratio. You may show the pro forma ratio only for the 
most recent fiscal year and the latest interim period. Use the net 
change in interest or dividends from the refinancing to calculate the 
pro forma ratio.
    (C) Foreign private issuers. A foreign private issuer must show the 
ratio based on the figures in the primary financial statement. A foreign 
private issuer must show the ratio based on the figures resulting from 
the reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles if 
this ratio is materially different.
    (D) Summary Section. If you provide a summary or similar section in 
the prospectus, show the ratios in that section.
    3. Exhibit. File an exhibit to the registration statement to show 
the figures used to calculate the ratios. See paragraph (b)(12) of Item 
601 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.601(b)(12)).

    (e) Smaller reporting companies. A registrant that qualifies as a 
smaller reporting company, as defined by Sec. 229.10(f), need not 
comply with paragraph (d) of this Item.

Instruction to Item 503: For asset-backed securities, see also Item 1103 
of Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1103).

<R05>
Sec. 229.504  (Item 504) Use of proceeds.

    State the principal purposes for which the net proceeds to the 
registrant from the securities to be offered are intended to be used and 
the approximate amount intended to be used for each such purpose. Where 
registrant has no current specific plan for the proceeds, or a 
significant portion thereof,

[[Page 442]]

the registrant shall so state and discuss the principal reasons for the 
offering.

Instructions to Item 504: 1. Where less than all the securities to be 
offered may be sold and more than one use is listed for the proceeds, 
indicate the order of priority of such purposes and discuss the 
registrant's plans if substantially less than the maximum proceeds are 
obtained. Such discussion need not be included if underwriting 
arrangements with respect to such securities are such that, if any 
securities are sold to the public, it reasonably can be expected that 
the actual proceeds will not be substantially less than the aggregate 
proceeds to the registrant shown pursuant to Item 501 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.501).
    2. Details of proposed expenditures need not be given; for example, 
there need be furnished only a brief outline of any program of 
construction or addition of equipment. Consideration should be given as 
to the need to include a discussion of certain matters addressed in the 
discussion and analysis of registrant's financial condition and results 
of operations, such as liquidity and capital expenditures.
    3. If any material amounts of other funds are necessary to 
accomplish the specified purposes for which the proceeds are to be 
obtained, state the amounts and sources of such other funds needed for 
each such specified purpose and the sources thereof.
    4. If any material part of the proceeds is to be used to discharge 
indebtedness, set forth the interest rate and maturity of such 
indebtedness. If the indebtedness to be discharged was incurred within 
one year, describe the use of the proceeds of such indebtedness other 
than short-term borrowings used for working capital.
    5. If any material amount of the proceeds is to be used to acquire 
assets, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, describe 
briefly and state the cost of the assets and, where such assets are to 
be acquired from affiliates of the registrant or their associates, give 
the names of the persons from whom they are to be acquired and set forth 
the principle followed in determining the cost to the registrant.
    6. Where the registrant indicates that the proceeds may, or will, be 
used to finance acquisitions of other businesses, the identity of such 
businesses, if known, or, if not known, the nature of the businesses to 
be sought, the status of any negotiations with respect to the 
acquisition, and a brief description of such business shall be included. 
Where, however, pro forma financial statements reflecting such 
acquisition are not required by Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.01 through 
210.12-29), including Rule 8-05 for smaller reporting companies, to be 
included in the registration statement, the possible terms of any 
transaction, the identification of the parties thereto or the nature of 
the business sought need not be disclosed, to the extent that the 
registrant reasonably determines that public disclosure of such 
information would jeopardize the acquisition. Where Regulation S-X, 
including Rule 8-04 for smaller reporting companies, as applicable, 
would require financial statements of the business to be acquired to be 
included, the description of the business to be acquired shall be more 
detailed.
    7. The registrant may reserve the right to change the use of 
proceeds, provided that such reservation is due to certain contingencies 
that are discussed specifically and the alternatives to such use in that 
event are indicated.

<R05>
Sec. 229.505  (Item 505) Determination of offering price.

    (a) Common equity. Where common equity is being registered for which 
there is no established public trading market for purposes of paragraph 
(a) of Item 201 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.201(a)) or where there is a 
material disparity between the offering price of the common equity being 
registered and the market price of outstanding shares of the same class, 
describe the various factors considered in determining such offering 
price.
    (b) Warrants, rights and convertible securities. Where warrants, 
rights or convertible securities exercisable for common equity for which 
there is no established public trading market for purposes of paragraph 
(a) of Item 201 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.201(a)) are being 
registered, describe the various factors considered in determining their 
exercise or conversion price.


<R05>
Sec. 229.506  (Item 506) Dilution.

    Where common equity securities are being registered and there is 
substantial disparity between the public offering price and the 
effective cash cost to officers, directors, promoters and affiliated 
persons of common equity acquired by them in transactions during the 
past five years, or which they have the right to acquire, and the 
registrant is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) 
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act immediately prior to filing of the 
registration statement, there shall be included a comparison of the

[[Page 443]]

public contribution under the proposed public offering and the effective 
cash contribution of such persons. In such cases, and in other instances 
where common equity securities are being registered by a registrant that 
has had losses in each of its last three fiscal years and there is a 
material dilution of the purchasers' equity interest, the following 
shall be disclosed:
    (a) The net tangible book value per share before and after the 
distribution;
    (b) The amount of the increase in such net tangible book value per 
share attributable to the cash payments made by purchasers of the shares 
being offered; and
    (c) The amount of the immediate dilution from the public offering 
price which will be absorbed by such purchasers.


<R05>
Sec. 229.507  (Item 507) Selling security holders.

    If any of the securities to be registered are to be offered for the 
account of security holders, name each such security holder, indicate 
the nature of any position, office, or other material relationship which 
the selling security holder has had within the past three years with the 
registrant or any of its predecessors or affiliates, and state the 
amount of securities of the class owned by such security holder prior to 
the offering, the amount to be offered for the security holder's 
account, the amount and (if one percent or more) the percentage of the 
class to be owned by such security holder after completion of the 
offering.


<R05>
Sec. 229.508  (Item 508) Plan of distribution.

    (a) Underwriters and underwriting obligation. If the securities are 
to be offered through underwriters, name the principal underwriters, and 
state the respective amounts underwritten. Identify each such 
underwriter having a material relationship with the registrant and state 
the nature of the relationship. State briefly the nature of the 
obligation of the underwriter(s) to take the securities.

Instruction to paragraph 508(a): All that is required as to the nature 
of the underwriters' obligation is whether the underwriters are or will 
be committed to take and to pay for all of the securities if any are 
taken, or whether it is merely an agency or the type of best efforts 
arrangement under which the underwriters are required to take and to pay 
for only such securities as they may sell to the public. Conditions 
precedent to the underwriters' taking the securities, including market-
outs, need not be described except in the case of an agency or best 
efforts arrangement.

    (b) New underwriters. Where securities being registered are those of 
a registrant that has not previously been required to file reports 
pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or where a 
prospectus is required to include reference on its cover page to 
material risks pursuant to Item 501 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.501), 
and any one or more of the managing underwriter(s) (or where there are 
no managing underwriters, a majority of the principal underwriters) has 
been organized, reactivated, or first registered as a broker-dealer 
within the past three years, these facts concerning such underwriter(s) 
shall be disclosed in the prospectus together with, where applicable, 
the disclosures that the principal business function of such 
underwriter(s) will be to sell the securities to be registered, or that 
the promoters of the registrant have a material relationship with such 
underwriter(s). Sufficient details shall be given to allow full 
appreciation of such underwriter(s) experience and its relationship with 
the registrant, promoters and their controlling persons.
    (c) Other distributions. Outline briefly the plan of distribution of 
any securities to be registered that are to be offered otherwise than 
through underwriters.
    (1) If any securities are to be offered pursuant to a dividend or 
interest reinvestment plan the terms of which provide for the purchase 
of some securities on the market, state whether the registrant or the 
participant pays fees, commissions, and expenses incurred in connection 
with the plan. If the participant will pay such fees, commissions and 
expenses, state the anticipated cost to participants by transaction or 
other convenient reference.
    (2) If the securities are to be offered through the selling efforts 
of brokers or dealers, describe the plan of distribution and the terms 
of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding

[[Page 444]]

entered into with broker(s) or dealer(s) prior to the effective date of 
the registration statement, including volume limitations on sales, 
parties to the agreement and the conditions under which the agreement 
may be terminated. If known, identify the broker(s) or dealer(s) which 
will participate in the offering and state the amount to be offered 
through each.
    (3) If any of the securities being registered are to be offered 
otherwise than for cash, state briefly the general purposes of the 
distribution, the basis upon which the securities are to be offered, the 
amount of compensation and other expenses of distribution, and by whom 
they are to be borne. If the distribution is to be made pursuant to a 
plan of acquisition, reorganization, readjustment or succession, 
describe briefly the general effect of the plan and state when it became 
or is to become operative. As to any material amount of assets to be 
acquired under the plan, furnish information corresponding to that 
required by Instruction 5 of Item 504 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.504).
    (d) Offerings on exchange. If the securities are to be offered on an 
exchange, indicate the exchange. If the registered securities are to be 
offered in connection with the writing of exchange-traded call options, 
describe briefly such transactions.
    (e) Underwriter's compensation. Provide a table that sets out the 
nature of the compensation and the amount of discounts and commissions 
to be paid to the underwriter for each security and in total. The table 
must show the separate amounts to be paid by the company and the selling 
shareholders. In addition, include in the table all other items 
considered by the National Association of Securities Dealers to be 
underwriting compensation for purposes of that Association's Rules of 
Fair Practice.

Instructions to paragraph 508(e): 1. The term ``commissions'' is defined 
in paragraph (17) of Schedule A of the Securities Act. Show separately 
in the table the cash commissions paid by the registrant and selling 
security holders. Also show in the table commissions paid by other 
persons. Disclose any finder's fee or similar payments in the table.
    2. Disclose the offering expenses specified in Item 511 of 
Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.511).
    3. If the underwriter has any arrangement with the issuer, such as 
an over-allotment option, under which the underwriter may purchase 
additional shares in connection with the offering, indicate that this 
arrangement exists and state the amount of additional shares that the 
underwriter may purchase under the arrangement. Where the underwriter 
has such an arrangement, present maximum-minimum information in a 
separate column to the table, based on the purchase of all or none of 
the shares subject to the arrangement. Describe the key terms of the 
arrangement in the narrative.

    (f) Underwriter's representative on board of directors. Describe any 
arrangement whereby the underwriter has the right to designate or 
nominate a member or members of the board of directors of the 
registrant. The registrant shall disclose the identity of any director 
so designated or nominated, and indicate whether or not a person so 
designated or nominated, or allowed to be designated or nominated by the 
underwriter is or may be a director, officer, partner, employee or 
affiliate of the underwriter.
    (g) Indemnification of underwriters. If the underwriting agreement 
provides for indemnification by the registrant of the underwriters or 
their controlling persons against any liability arising under the 
Securities Act, furnish a brief description of such indemnification 
provisions.
    (h) Dealers' compensation. State briefly the discounts and 
commissions to be allowed or paid to dealers, including all cash, 
securities, contracts or other considerations to be received by any 
dealer in connection with the sale of the securities. If any dealers are 
to act in the capacity of sub-underwriters and are to be allowed or paid 
any additional discounts or commissions for acting in such capacity, a 
general statement to that effect will suffice without giving the 
additional amounts to be sold.
    (i) Finders. Identify any finder and, if applicable, describe the 
nature of any material relationship between such finder and the 
registrant, its officers, directors, principal stockholders, finders or 
promoters or the principal underwriter(s), or if there is a managing

[[Page 445]]

underwriter(s), the managing underwriter(s), (including, in each case, 
affiliates or associates thereof).
    (j) Discretionary accounts. If the registrant was not, immediately 
prior to the filing of the registration statement, subject to the 
requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, identify any 
principal underwriter that intends to sell to any accounts over which it 
exercises discretionary authority and include an estimate of the amount 
of securities so intended to be sold. The response to this paragraph 
shall be contained in a pre-effective amendment which shall be 
circulated if the information is not available when the registration 
statement is filed.
    (k) Passive market making. If the underwriters or any selling group 
members intend to engage in passive market making transactions as 
permitted by Rule 103 of Regulation M (Sec. 242.103 of this chapter), 
indicate such intention and briefly describe passive market making.
    (l) Stabilization and other transactions. (1) Briefly describe any 
transaction that the underwriter intends to conduct during the offering 
that stabilizes, maintains, or otherwise affects the market price of the 
offered securities. Include information on stabilizing transactions, 
syndicate short covering transactions, penalty bids, or any other 
transaction that affects the offered security's price. Describe the 
nature of the transactions clearly and explain how the transactions 
affect the offered security's price. Identify the exchange or other 
market on which these transactions may occur. If true, disclose that the 
underwriter may discontinue these transactions at any time;
    (2) If the stabilizing began before the effective date of the 
registration statement, disclose the amount of securities bought, the 
prices at which they were bought and the period within which they were 
bought. If you use Sec. 230.430A of this chapter, the prospectus you 
file under Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter or include in a post-
effective amendment must contain information on the stabilizing 
transactions that took place before the determination of the public 
offering price; and
    (3) If you are making a warrants or rights offering of securities to 
existing security holders and any securities not purchased by existing 
security holders are to be reoffered to the public, disclose in a 
supplement to the prospectus or in the prospectus used in connection 
with the reoffering:
    (i) The amount of securities bought in stabilization activities 
during the offering period and the price or range of prices at which the 
securities were bought;
    (ii) The amount of the offered securities subscribed for during the 
offering period;
    (iii) The amount of the offered securities subscribed for by the

    In addition to the disclosure prescribed by Item 702 of Regulation 
S-K (Sec. 229.702), if the undertaking required by paragraph (h) of 
Item 512 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512) is not required to be

registrant against liability arising under the Securities Act (including 
any provision of the underwriting agreement which relates to

registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as 
expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable.

maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed 
with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (Sec. 230.424(b) of this 
chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent

    (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan

    (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the 
Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be 
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities 
offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall 
be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

that the registrant includes in the prospectus, by means of a post-
effective amendment, financial statements required pursuant to this

chapter), a post-effective amendment need not be filed to include 
financial statements and information required by Section 10(a)(3) of the

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by 
reference in the Form F-3.
    (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the 
Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:
    (i) If the registrant is relying on Rule 430B (Sec. 230.430B of 
this chapter):
    (A) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 
424(b)(3) (Sec. 230.424(b)(3) of this chapter) shall be deemed to be 
part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus 
was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and
    (B) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), 
(b)(5), or (b)(7) (Sec. 230.424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) of this 
chapter) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B

purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the 
registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of 
prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first 
contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the 
prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the 
issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date 
shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement 
relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that 
prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time 
shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, 
however, that no statement made in a registration statement or 
prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a 
document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the 
registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration 
statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior

this chapter), each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of 
a registration statement relating to an offering, other than 
registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses 
filed in reliance on Rule 430A (Sec. 230.430A of this chapter), shall 
be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of 
the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that 
no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part 
of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or 
deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or 
prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a 
purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, 
supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration 
statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or 
made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.

under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial 
distribution of the securities:

    The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of

    (b) Filings incorporating subsequent Exchange Act documents by 
reference. Include the following if the registration statement 
incorporates by reference any Exchange Act document filed subsequent to 
the effective date of the registration statement:

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of 
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing 
of the registrant's annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section

each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to 
section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is 
incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed

which at that time meets the requirements of section 10(a) of the Act, 
and relating to the securities offered at competitive bidding, as 
contained in the registration statement, together with any supplements 
thereto, and (2) to file an amendment to the registration statement 
reflecting the results of bidding, the terms of the reoffering and 
related matters to the extent required by the applicable form, not later 
than the first use, authorized by the issuer after the opening of bids, 
of a prospectus relating to the securities offered at competitive 
bidding, unless no further public offering of such securities by the 
issuer and no reoffering of such securities by the purchasers is 
proposed to be made.

    (e) Incorporated annual and quarterly reports. Include the following

offering had no obligation to file reports with the Commission pursuant 
to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are being registered for 
sale in an underwritten offering:


[[Page 450]]


The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the 
underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements 
certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as 
required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.

    (g) Registration on Form S-4 or F-4 of securities offered for 
resale. Include the following if the securities are being registered on 
Form S-4 or F-4 (Sec. 239.25, or 34 of this chapter) in connection with 
a transaction specified in paragraph (a) of Rule 145 (Sec. 230.145 of 
this chapter).
    (1) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows: That 
prior to any public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder 
through use of a prospectus which is a part of this registration 
statement, by any person or party who is deemed to be an underwriter 
within the meaning of Rule 145(c), the issuer undertakes that such 
reoffering prospectus will contain the information called for by the 
applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by persons who 
may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the information called for by 
the other Items of the applicable form.
    (2) The registrant undertakes that every prospectus (i) that is 
filed pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) immediately preceding, or (ii) that 
purports to meet the requirements of section 10(a)(3) of the Act and is 
used in connection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415 
(Sec. 230.415 of this chapter), will be filed as a part of an amendment 
to the registration statement and will not be used until such amendment 
is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any liability under 
the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be 
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities 
offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall 
be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
    (h) Request for acceleration of effective date or filing of 
registration statement becoming effective upon filing. Include the 
following if acceleration is requested of the effective date of the 
registration statement pursuant to Rule 461 under the Securities Act 
(Sec. 230.461 of this chapter), if a Form S-3 or Form F-3 will become

or if the registration statement is filed on Form S-8, and:
    (1) Any provision or arrangement exists whereby the registrant may 
indemnify a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant 
against liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or
    (2) The underwriting agreement contains a provision whereby the 
registrant indemnifies the underwriter or controlling persons of the 
underwriter against such liabilities and a director, officer or 
controlling person of the registrant is such an underwriter or 
controlling person thereof or a member of any firm which is such an 
underwriter, and
    (3) The benefits of such indemnification are not waived by such 
persons:

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities 
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling 
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or 
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against 
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities 
(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the 
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by 
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the 
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion 
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such 
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act 
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

    (i) Include the following in a registration statement permitted by 
Rule 430A under the Securities Act of 1933 (Sec. 230.430A of this

Rule 424(b) (1) or

[[Page 451]]

this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
    (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the 
Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a 
form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement 
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such 
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide 
offering thereof.

    (j) Qualification of trust indentures under the Trust Indenture Act 
of 1939 for delayed offerings. Include the following if the registrant 
intends to rely on section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 
for determining the eligibility of the trustee under indentures for 
securities to be issued, offered, or sold on a delayed basis by or on 
behalf of the registrant:

accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission 
under section 305(b)(2) of the Act.
    (k) Filings regarding asset-backed securities incorporating by

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of a third party that is incorporated by 
reference in the registration statement in accordance with Item 
1100(c)(1) of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1100(c)(1)) shall be deemed to 
be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered 
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be 
deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

    (l) Filings regarding asset-backed securities that provide certain 
information through an Internet Web site. Include the following if the 
registration statement is to provide information required by Item 1105 
of Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1105) through an Internet Web site in 
accordance with Rule 312 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.312 of this 
chapter):

    The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, except as 
otherwise provided by Item 1105 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1105),

during the reporting period reflected by a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, it 
shall be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filed for the 
corresponding period. Any amendment or modification to a previously 
filed exhibit to a Form 10, 10-K or 10-Q document shall be filed as an 
exhibit to a Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. Such amendment or modification 
need not be filed where such previously filed exhibit would not be 
currently required.

Instructions to Item 601: 1. If an exhibit to a registration statement 
(other than an opinion or consent), filed in preliminary form, has been 
changed only (A) to insert information as to interest, dividend or 
conversion rates, redemption or conversion prices, purchase or offering 
prices, underwriters' or dealers' commissions, names, addresses or 
participation of underwriters or similar matters, which information 
appears elsewhere in an amendment to the registration statement or a 
prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (Sec. 
230.424(b) of this chapter), or (B) to correct typographical errors, 
insert signatures or make other similar immaterial changes, then, 
notwithstanding any contrary requirement of any rule or form, the 
registrant need not refile such exhibit as so amended. Any such 
incomplete exhibit may not, however, be incorporated by reference in any 
subsequent filing under any Act administered by the Commission.
    2. In any case where two or more indentures, contracts, franchises, 
or other documents required to be filed as exhibits are substantially 
identical in all material respects except as to the parties thereto, the 
dates of execution, or other details, the registrant need file a copy of 
only one of such documents, with a schedule identifying the other 
documents omitted and setting forth the material details in which such 
documents differ from the document a copy of which is filed. The 
Commission may at any time in its discretion require filing of copies of 
any documents so omitted.
    3. Only copies, rather than originals, need be filed of each exhibit 
required except as otherwise specifically noted.
    4. Electronic filings. Whenever an exhibit is filed in paper 
pursuant to a hardship exemption (Sec. Sec. 232.201 and 232.202 of this 
chapter), the letter ``P'' (paper) shall be placed next to the exhibit 
in the list of exhibits required by Item 601(a)(2) of this Rule. 
Whenever an electronic confirming copy of an exhibit is filed pursuant 
to a hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 or Sec. 232.202(d) of this 
chapter), the exhibit index should specify where the confirming 
electronic copy can be located; in addition, the designation ``CE'' 
(confirming electronic) should be placed next to the listed exhibit in 
the exhibit index.

\1\ An exhibit need not be provided about a company if: (1) With respect to such company an election has been made under Form S-4 or F-4 to provide
  information about such company at a level prescribed by Form S-3 or F-3; and (2) the form, the level of which has been elected under Form S-4 or F-4,
  would not require such company to provide such exhibit if it were registering a primary offering.
\2\ A Form 8-K exhibit is required only if relevant to the subject matter reported on the Form 8-K report. For example, if the Form 8-K pertains to the
  departure of a director, only the exhibit described in paragraph (b)(17) of this section need be filed. A required exhibit may be incorporated by
  reference from a previous filing.
\3\ Where incorporated by reference into the text of the prospectus and delivered to security holders along with the prospectus as permitted by the
  registration statement; or, in the case of the Form 10-K, where the annual report to security holders is incorporated by reference into the text of
  the Form 10-K.
\4\ If required pursuant to Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
\5\ Where the opinion of the expert or counsel has been incorporated by reference into a previously filed Securities Act registration statement.
\6\ Pursuant to Sec. Sec.  240.13a-13(b)(3) and 240.15d-13(b)(3) of this chapter, asset-backed issuers are not required to file reports on Form 10-Q.


[[Page 455]]

    (b) Description of exhibits. Set forth below is a description of 
each document listed in the exhibit tables.
    (1) Underwriting agreement. Each underwriting contract or agreement 
with a principal underwriter pursuant to which the securities being 
registered are to be distributed; if the terms of such documents have 
not been determined, the proposed forms thereof. Such agreement may be 
filed as an exhibit to a report on Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this 
chapter) which is incorporated by reference into a registration 
statement subsequent to its effectiveness.
    (2) Plan of acquisition, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation or 
succession. Any material plan of acquisition, disposition, 
reorganization, readjustment, succession, liquidation or arrangement and 
any amendments thereto described in the statement or report. Schedules 
(or similar attachments) to these exhibits shall not be filed unless 
such schedules contain information which is material to an investment 
decision and which is not otherwise disclosed in the agreement or the 
disclosure document. The plan filed shall contain a list briefly 
identifying the contents of all omitted schedules, together with an 
agreement to furnish supplementally a copy of any omitted schedule to 
the Commission upon request.
    (3)(i) Articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation of 
the registrant or instruments corresponding thereto as currently in 
effect and any amendments thereto. Whenever the registrant files an 
amendment to its articles of incorporation, it must file a complete copy 
of the articles as amended. However, if such amendment is being reported 
on Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), the registrant is required 
to file only the text of the amendment as a Form 8-K exhibit. In such 
case, a complete copy of the articles of incorporation as amended must 
be filed as an exhibit to the next Securities Act registration statement 
or periodic report filed by the registrant to which this exhibit 
requirement applies. Where it is impracticable for the registrant to 
file a charter amendment authorizing new securities with the appropriate 
state authority prior to the effective date of the registration 
statement registering such securities, the registrant may file as an 
exhibit to the registration statement the form of amendment to be filed 
with the state authority. In such a case, if material changes are made 
after the copy is filed, the registrant must also file the changed copy.
    (ii) Bylaws. The bylaws of the registrant or instruments 
corresponding thereto as currently in effect and any amendments thereto. 
Whenever the registrant files an amendment to the bylaws, it must file a 
complete copy of the amended bylaws. However, if such amendment is being 
reported on Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), the registrant is 
required to file only the text of the amendment as a Form 8-K exhibit. 
In such case, a complete copy of the bylaws as amended must be filed as 
an exhibit to the next Securities Act registration statement or periodic 
report filed by the registrant to which this exhibit requirement 
applies.
    (4) Instruments defining the rights of security holders, including 
identures. (i) All instruments defining the rights of holders of the 
equity or debt securities being registered including, where applicable, 
the relevant portion of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the 
registrant.
    (ii) Except as set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this Item for 
filings on Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, N-14, and F-4 under the Securities Act 
(Sec. 239.11, 239.25, 239.18, 239.23 and 239.34 of this chapter) and 
Forms 10 and 10-K under the Exchange Act (Sec. Sec. 249.210 and 249.310 
of this chapter) all instruments defining the rights of holders of long-
term debt of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries and for 
any of its unconsolidated subsidiaries for which financial statements 
are required to be filed.
    (iii) Where the instrument defines the rights of holders of long-
term debt of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries and for 
any of its unconsolidated subsidiaries for which financial statements 
are required to be filed, there need not be filed:
    (A) Any instrument with respect to long-term debt not being 
registered if

[[Page 456]]

the total amount of securities authorized thereunder does not exceed 10 
percent of the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a 
consolidated basis and if there is filed an agreement to furnish a copy 
of such agreement to the Commission upon request;
    (B) Any instrument with respect to any class of securities if 
appropriate steps to assure the redemption or retirement of such class 
will be taken prior to or upon delivery by the registrant of the 
securities being registered; or
    (C) Copies of instruments evidencing scrip certificates for 
fractions of shares.
    (iv) If any of the securities being registered are, or will be, 
issued under an indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, 
the copy of such indenture which is filed as an exhibit shall include or 
be accompanied by:
    (A) A reasonably itemized and informative table of contents; and
    (B) A cross-reference sheet showing the location in the indenture of 
the provisions inserted pursuant to sections 310 through 318(a) 
inclusive of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
    (v) With respect to Forms 8-K and 10-Q under the Exchange Act that 
are filed and that disclose, in the text of the Form 10-Q, the interim 
financial statements, or the footnotes thereto the creation of a new 
class of securities or indebtedness or the modification of existing 
rights of security holders, file all instruments defining the rights of 
holders of these securities or indebtedness. However, there need not be 
filed any instrument with respect to long-term debt not being registered 
which meets the exclusion set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this 
Item.

Instruction 1 to paragraph (b)(4): There need not be filed any 
instrument which defines the rights of participants (not as security 
holders) pursuant to an employee benefit plan.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (b)(4) (for electronic filings): If the 
instrument defining the rights of security holders is in the form of a 
certificate, the text appearing on the certificate shall be reproduced 
in an electronic filing together with a description of any other graphic 
and image material appearing on the certificate, as provided in Rule 304 
of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.304 of this chapter).

    (5) Opinion re legality. (i) An opinion of counsel as to the 
legality of the securities being registered, indicating whether they 
will, when sold, be legally issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and, 
if debt securities, whether they will be binding obligations of the 
registrant.
    (ii) If the securities being registered are issued under a plan and 
the plan is subject to the requirements of ERISA furnish either:
    (A) An opinion of counsel which confirms compliance of the 
provisions of the written documents constituting the plan with the 
requirements of ERISA pertaining to such provisions; or
    (B) A copy of the Internal Revenue Service determination letter that 
the plan is qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code; or
    (iii) If the securities being registered are issued under a plan 
which is subject to the requirements of ERISA and the plan has been 
amended subsequent to the filing of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) (A) or (B) 
above, furnish either:
    (A) An opinion of counsel which confirms compliance of the amended 
provisions of the plan with the requirements of ERISA pertaining to such 
provisions; or
    (B) A copy of the Internal Revenue Service determination letter that 
the amended plan is qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue 
Code.

    Note: Attention is directed to Item 8 of Form S-8 for exemptions to 
this exhibit requirement applicable to that Form.

    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) Correspondence from an independent accountant regarding non-
reliance on a previously issued audit report or completed interim 
review. Any written notice from the registrant's current or previously 
engaged independent accountant that the independent accountant is 
withdrawing a previously issued audit report or that a previously issued 
audit report or completed interim review, covering one or more years or 
interim periods for which the registrant is required to provide 
financial statements under Regulation S-X (part 210 of this chapter), 
should no longer be relied upon. In addition, any letter, pursuant to 
Item 4.02(c) of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), from the

[[Page 457]]

independent accountant to the Commission stating whether the independent 
accountant agrees with the statements made by the registrant describing 
the events giving rise to the notice.
    (8) Opinion re tax matters. For filings on Form S-11 under the 
Securities Act (Sec. 239.18) or those to which Securities Act Industry 
Guide 5 applies, an opinion of counsel or of an independent public or 
certified public accountant or, in lieu thereof, a revenue ruling from 
the Internal Revenue Service, supporting the tax matters and 
consequences to the shareholders as described in the filing when such 
tax matters are material to the transaction for which the registration 
statement is being filed. This exhibit otherwise need only be filed with 
the other applicable registration forms where the tax consequences are 
material to an investor and a representation as to tax consequences is 
set forth in the filing. If a tax opinion is set forth in full in the 
filing, an indication that such is the case may be made in lieu of 
filing the otherwise required exhibit. Such tax opinions may be 
conditioned or may be qualified, so long as such conditions and 
qualifications are adequately described in the filing.
    (9) Voting trust agreement. Any voting trust agreements and 
amendments thereto.
    (10) Material contracts. (i) Every contract not made in the ordinary 
course of business which is material to the registrant and is to be 
performed in whole or in part at or after the filing of the registration 
statement or report or was entered into not more than two years before 
such filing. Only contracts need be filed as to which the registrant or 
subsidiary of the registrant is a party or has succeeded to a party by 
assumption or assignment or in which the registrant or such subsidiary 
has a beneficial interest.
    (ii) If the contract is such as ordinarily accompanies the kind of 
business conducted by the registrant and its subsidiaries, it will be 
deemed to have been made in the ordinary course of business and need not 
be filed unless it falls within one or more of the following categories, 
in which case it shall be filed except where immaterial in amount or 
significance:
    (A) Any contract to which directors, officers, promoters, voting 
trustees, security holders named in the registration statement or 
report, or underwriters are parties other than contracts involving only 
the purchase or sale of current assets having a determinable market 
price, at such market price;
    (B) Any contract upon which the registrant's business is 
substantially dependent, as in the case of continuing contracts to sell 
the major part of registrant's products or services or to purchase the 
major part of registrant's requirements of goods, services or raw 
materials or any franchise or license or other agreement to use a 
patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which 
registrant's business depends to a material extent;
    (C) Any contract calling for the acquisition or sale of any 
property, plant or equipment for a consideration exceeding 15 percent of 
such fixed assets of the registrant on a consolidated basis; or
    (D) Any material lease under which a part of the property described 
in the registration statement or report is held by the registrant.
    (iii)(A) Any management contract or any compensatory plan, contract 
or arrangement, including but not limited to plans relating to options, 
warrants or rights, pension, retirement or deferred compensation or 
bonus, incentive or profit sharing (or if not set forth in any formal 
document, a written description thereof) in which any director or any of 
the named executive officers of the registrant, as defined by Item 
402(a)(3) (Sec. 229.402(a)(3)), participates shall be deemed material 
and shall be filed; and any other management contract or any other 
compensatory plan, contract, or arrangement in which any other executive 
officer of the registrant participates shall be filed unless immaterial 
in amount or significance.
    (B) Any compensatory plan, contract or arrangement adopted without 
the approval of security holders pursuant to which equity may be 
awarded, including, but not limited to, options, warrants or rights (or 
if not set forth

[[Page 458]]

in any formal document, a written description thereof), in which any 
employee (whether or not an executive officer of the registrant) 
participates shall be filed unless immaterial in amount or significance. 
A compensation plan assumed by a registrant in connection with a merger, 
consolidation or other acquisition transaction pursuant to which the 
registrant may make further grants or awards of its equity securities 
shall be considered a compensation plan of the registrant for purposes 
of the preceding sentence.
    (C) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(10)(iii)(A) above, the following 
management contracts or compensatory plans, contracts or arrangements 
need not be filed:
    (1) Ordinary purchase and sales agency agreements.
    (2) Agreements with managers of stores in a chain organization or 
similar organization.
    (3) Contracts providing for labor or salesmen's bonuses or payments 
to a class of security holders, as such.
    (4) Any compensatory plan, contract or arrangement which pursuant to 
its terms is available to employees, officers or directors generally and 
which in operation provides for the same method of allocation of 
benefits between management and nonmanagement participants.
    (5) Any compensatory plan, contract or arrangement if the registrant 
is a foreign private issuer that furnishes compensatory information 
under Item 402(a)(1) (Sec. 229.402(a)(1)) and the public filing of the 
plan, contract or arrangement, or portion thereof, is not required in 
the registrant's home country and is not otherwise publicly disclosed by 
the registrant.
    (6) Any compensatory plan, contract, or arrangement if the 
registrant is a wholly owned subsidiary of a company that has a class of 
securities registered pursuant to section 12 or files reports pursuant 
to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and is filing a report on Form 10-K 
or registering debt instruments or preferred stock that are not voting 
securities on Form S-1.

Instruction 1 to paragraph (b)(10): With the exception of management 
contracts, in order to comply with paragraph (iii) above, registrants 
need only file copies of the various compensatory plans and need not 
file each individual director's or executive officer's personal 
agreement under the plans unless there are particular provisions in such 
personal agreements whose disclosure in an exhibit is necessary to an 
investor's understanding of that individual's compensation under the 
plan.
    Instruction 2 to paragraph (b)(10): If a material contract is 
executed or becomes effective during the reporting period reflected by a 
Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, it shall be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-Q 
or Form 10-K filed for the corresponding period. See paragraph (a)(4) of 
this Item. With respect to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, only those 
contracts executed or becoming effective during the most recent period 
reflected in the report shall be filed.

setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of per share 
earnings, unless the computation can be clearly determined from the 
material contained in the registration statement or report. The 
information with respect to the computation of per share earnings on 
both primary and fully diluted basis, presented by exhibit or otherwise, 
must be furnished even though the amounts of per share earnings on the 
fully diluted bases are not required to be presented in the income 
statement under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 
No. 15. That Opinion provides that any reduction of less than 3% need 
not be considered as dilution (see footnote to paragraph 14 of the 
Opinion) and that a computation on the fully diluted basis which results 
in improvement of earnings per share not be taken into account (see 
paragraph 40 of the Opinion).
    (12) Statements re computation of ratios. A statement setting forth 
in reasonable detail the computation of any ratio of earnings to fixed 
charges, any ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred 
stock dividends or any other ratios which appear in the registration 
statement or report. See Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 
229.503(d)).
    (13) Annual report to security holders, Form 10-Q or quarterly 
report to security holders. (i) The registrant's annual report to 
security holders for its last fiscal year, its Form 10-Q (if 
specifically

[[Page 459]]

incorporated by reference in the prospectus) or its quarterly report to 
security holders, if all or a portion thereof is incorporated by 
reference in the filing. Such report, except for those portions thereof 
that are expressly incorporated by reference in the filing, is to be 
furnished for the information of the Commission and is not to be deemed 
``filed'' as part of the filing. If the financial statements in the 
report have been incorporated by reference in the filing, the 
accountant's certificate shall be manually signed in one copy. See Rule 
411(b) (Sec. 230.411(b) of this chapter).
    (ii) Electronic filings. If all, or any portion, of the annual or 
quarterly report to security holders is incorporated by reference into 
any electronic filing, all, or such portion of the annual or quarterly 
report to security holders so incorporated, shall be filed in electronic 
format as an exhibit to the filing.
    (14) Code of ethics. Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that 
is the subject of the disclosure required by Item 406 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.406) or Item 10 of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), 
to the extent that the registrant intends to satisfy the Item 406 or 
Item 10 requirements through filing of an exhibit.
    (15) Letter re unaudited interim financial information. A letter, 
where applicable, from the independent accountant that acknowledges 
awareness of the use in a registration statement of a report on 
unaudited interim financial information that pursuant to Rule 436(c) 
under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.436(c) of this chapter) is not 
considered a part of a registration statement prepared or certified by 
an accountant or a report prepared or certified by an accountant within 
the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of that Act. Such letter may be filed 
with the registration statement, an amendment thereto, or a report on 
Form 10-Q which is incorporated by reference into the registration 
statement.
    (16) Letter re change in certifying accountant. A letter from the 
registrant's former independent accountant regarding its concurrence or 
disagreement with the statements made by the registrant in the current 
report concerning the resignation or dismissal as the registrant's 
principal accountant.
    (17) Correspondence on departure of director. Any written 
correspondence from a former director concerning the circumstances 
surrounding the former director's retirement, resignation, refusal to 
stand for re-election or removal, including any letter from the former 
director to the registrant stating whether the former director agrees 
with statements made by the registrant describing the former director's 
departure.
    (18) Letter re change in accounting principles. Unless previously 
filed, a letter from the registrant's independent accountant indicating 
whether any change in accounting principles or practices followed by the 
registrant, or any change in the method of applying any such accounting 
principles or practices, which affected the financial statements being 
filed with the Commission in the report or which is reasonably certain 
to affect the financial statements of future fiscal years is to an 
alternative principle which in his judgment is preferable under the 
circumstances. No such letter need be filed when such change is made in 
response to a standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board that creates a new accounting principle, that expresses a 
preference for an accounting principle, or that rejects a specific 
accounting principle.
    (19) Report furnished to security holders. If the registrant makes 
available to its security holders or otherwise publishes, within the 
period prescribed for filing the report, a document or statement 
containing information meeting some or all of the requirements of Part I 
of Form 10-Q, the information called for may be incorporated by 
reference to such published document or statement, provided copies 
thereof are included as an exhibit to the registration statement or to 
Part I of the Form 10-Q report.
    (20) Other documents or statements to security holders. If the 
registrant makes available to its stockholders or otherwise publishes, 
within the period prescribed for filing the report, a document or 
statement containing information meeting some or all of the requirements 
of this form the information

[[Page 460]]

called for may be incorporated by reference to such published document 
or statement provided copies thereof are filed as an exhibit to the 
report on this form.
    (21) Subsidiaries of the registrant. (i) List all subsidiaries of 
the registrant, the state or other jurisdiction of incorporation or 
organization of each, and the names under which such subsidiaries do 
business. This list may be incorporated by reference from a document 
which includes a complete and accurate list.
    (ii) The names of particular subsidiaries may be omitted if the 
unnamed subsidiaries, considered in the aggregate as a single 
subsidiary, would not constitute a significant subsidiary as of the end 
of the year covered by this report. (See the definition of ``significant 
subsidiary'' in Rule 1-02(w) (17 CFR 210.1-02(w)) of Regulation S-X.) 
The names of consolidated wholly-owned multiple subsidiaries carrying on 
the same line of business, such as chain stores or small loan companies, 
may be omitted, provided the name of the immediate parent, the line of 
business, the number of omitted subsidiaries operating in the United 
States and the number operating in foreign countries are given. This 
instruction shall not apply, however, to banks, insurance companies, 
savings and loan associations or to any subsidiary subject to regulation 
by another Federal agency.
    (22) Published report regarding matters submitted to vote of 
security holders. Published reports containing all of the information 
called for by Item 4 of Part II of Form 10-Q or Item 4 of Part I of Form 
10-K that is referred to therein in lieu of providing disclosure in Form 
10-Q or 10-K, that are required to be filed as exhibits by Rule 12b-
23(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-23(a)(3) of this 
chapter).
    (23) Consents of experts and counsel--(i) Securities Act filings. 
All written consents required to be filed shall be dated and manually 
signed. Where the consent of an expert or counsel is contained in his 
report or opinion or elsewhere in the registration statement or document 
filed therewith, a reference shall be made in the index to the report, 
the part of the registration statement or document or opinion, 
containing the consent.
    (ii) Exchange Act reports. Where the filing of a written consent is 
required with respect to material incorporated by reference in a 
previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act, such 
consent may be filed as exhibit to the material incorporated by 
reference. Such consents shall be dated and manually signed.
    (24) Power of attorney. If any name is signed to the registration 
statement or report pursuant to a power of attorney, manually signed 
copies of such power of attorney shall be filed. Where the power of 
attorney is contained elsewhere in the registration statement or 
documents filed therewith a reference shall be made in the index to the 
part of the registration statement or document containing such power of 
attorney. In addition, if the name of any officer signing on behalf of 
the registrant is signed pursuant to a power of attorney, certified 
copies of a resolution of the registrant's board of directors 
authorizing such signature shall also be filed. A power of attorney that 
is filed with the Commission shall relate to a specific filing or an 
amendment thereto, provided, however, that a power of attorney relating 
to a registration statement under the Securities Act or an amendment 
thereto also may relate to any registration statement for the same 
offering that is to be effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(b) 
under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.462(b) of this chapter). A power of 
attorney that confers general authority shall not be filed with the 
Commission.
    (25) Statement of eligibility of trustee. (i) A statement of 
eligibility and qualification of each person designated to act as 
trustee under an indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act 
of 1939. Such statement of eligibility shall be bound separately from 
the other exhibits.
    (ii) Electronic filings. The requirement to bind separately the 
statement of eligibility and qualification of each person designated to 
act as a trustee under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 from other 
exhibits shall not apply to statements submitted in electronic format. 
Rather, such statements must be

[[Page 461]]

submitted as exhibits in the same electronic submission as the 
registration statement to which they relate, or in an amendment thereto, 
except that electronic filers that rely on Trust Indenture Act Section 
305(b)(2) for determining the eligibility of the trustee under 
indentures for securities to be issued, offered or sold on a delayed 
basis by or on behalf of the registrant shall file such statements 
separately in the manner prescribed by Sec. 260.5b-1 through Sec. 
260.5b-3 of this chapter and by the EDGAR Filer Manual.
    (26) Invitations for competitive bids. If the registration statement 
covers securities to be offered at competitive bidding, any form of 
communication which is an invitation for competitive bid which will be 
sent or given to any person shall be filed.

other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal 
control over financial reporting.

[Title]

    \1\ With respect to asset-backed issuers, the certification must be 
signed by either: (1) The senior officer in charge of securitization of 
the depositor if the depositor is signing the report on Form 10-K; or 
(2) The senior officer in charge of the servicing function of the 
servicer if the servicer is signing the report on Form 10-K on behalf of 
the issuing entity. See Rules 13a-14(e) and 15d-14(e) (Sec. Sec. 
240.13a-14(e) and 240.15d-14(e)). If multiple servicers are involved in 
servicing the pool assets, the senior officer in charge of the servicing 
function of the master servicer (or entity performing the equivalent 
function) must sign if a representative of the servicer is to sign the 
certification. If there is a master servicer and one or more underlying 
servicers, the references in the certification relate to the master 
servicer. A natural person must sign the certification in his or her 
individual capacity, although the title of that person in the 
organization of which he or she is an officer may be included under the 
signature.
    \2\ The first version of paragraph 4 is to be used when the servicer 
is signing the report on behalf of the issuing entity. The second 
version of paragraph 4 is to be used when the depositor is signing the 
report.
    \3\ The certification refers to the reports prepared by parties 
participating in the servicing function that are required to be included 
as an exhibit to the Form 10-K. See Item 1122 of Regulation AB (Sec. 
229.1122) and Rules 13a-18 and 15d-18 (Sec. Sec. 240.13a-18 and 
240.15d-18 of this chapter). If a report that is otherwise required to 
be included is not attached, disclosure that the report is not included 
and an associated explanation must be provided in the Form 10-K report.
    \4\ Because the signer of the certification must rely in certain 
circumstances on information provided by unaffiliated parties outside of 
the signer's control, this paragraph must be included if the signer is 
reasonably relying on information that unaffiliated trustees, 
depositors, servicers, sub-servicers or co-servicers have provided.
    (32) Section 1350 Certifications. (i) The certifications required by 
Rule 13a-14(b) (17 CFR 240.13a-14(b)) or Rule 15d-14(b) (17 CFR 240.15d-
14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United States 
Code (18 U.S.C. 1350).
    (ii) A certification furnished pursuant to this item will not be 
deemed ``filed'' for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 
U.S.C. 78r), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such 
certification will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into 
any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the 
extent that the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference.
    (33) Report on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria for 
asset-backed securities. Each report on assessment of compliance with

statement required by Sec. 229.1123.
    (36) through (98) [Reserved]
    (99) Additional exhibits. (i) Any additional exhibits which the 
registrant may wish to file shall be so marked as to indicate clearly 
the subject matters to which they refer.
    (ii) Any document (except for an exhibit) or part thereof which is 
incorporated by reference in the filing and is not otherwise required to 
be filed by this Item or is not a Commission filed document incorporated 
by reference in a Securities Act registration statement.
    (iii) If pursuant to Section 11(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 
77k(a)) an issuer makes generally available to its security holders an 
earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning 
after the effective date of the registration statement, and if such 
earnings statement is made available by ``other methods'' than those 
specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Sec. 230.158 of this chapter, it 
must be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-Q or the Form 10-K, as 
appropriate, covering the period in which the earnings statement was 
released.
    (100) XBRL-Related Documents. An electronic filer that participates 
in the voluntary XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) program 
may submit XBRL-Related Documents (Sec. 232.11 of this chapter) in 
electronic format as an exhibit to: the filing to which they relate; an 
amendment to such filing; or a Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) 
that references such filing, if the Form 8-K is submitted no earlier 
than date of that filing.
    (c) Smaller reporting companies. A smaller reporting company need 
not provide the disclosure required in paragraph (b)(12) of this Item, 
Statements re computation of ratios.

  information about such company at a level prescribed by Form S-3 or F-3; and (2) the form, the level of which has been elected under Form S-4 or F-4,
  would not require such company to provide such exhibit if it were registering a primary offering.
\2\ A Form 8-K exhibit is required only if relevant to the subject matter reported on the Form 8-K report. For example, if the Form 8-K pertains to the
  departure of a director, only the exhibit described in paragraph (b)(17) of this section need be filed. A required exhibit may be incorporated by
  reference from a previous filing.

electronic format as an exhibit to: the filing to which they relate; an 
amendment to such filing; or a Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter)

previously were filed with the Commission that have been revised 
pursuant to applicable accounting standards to reflect the effects of 
certain subsequent events, including a discontinued operation, a change 
in reportable segments or a change in accounting principle, and, in such 
case, the Interactive Data File would be required only as to such 
revised financial statements regardless whether the Form 8-K contains 
other financial statements:

state law for managing or directing the management of the business and 
affairs of a partnership that is the subject of a roll-up transaction 
including, but not limited to, the general partner(s), board of 
directors, board of trustees, or other person(s) having a fiduciary duty 
to such partnership.
    (b)(1) Partnership means any:
    (i) Finite-life limited partnership; or

    (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this Item 
(Sec. 229.901(b)(2)(ii)), a limited partnership or other entity is 
``finite-life'' if:
    (A) It operates as a conduit vehicle for investors to participate in 
the ownership of assets for a limited period of time; and
    (B) It has as a policy or purpose distributing to investors proceeds 
from the sale, financing or refinancing of assets or cash from 
operations, rather than reinvesting such proceeds or cash in the 
business (whether for the term of the entity or after an initial period 
of time following commencement of operations).
    (ii) A real estate investment trust as defined in I.R.C. section 856 
is not finite-life solely because of the distribution to investors of 
net income as provided by the I.R.C. if its policies or purposes do not 
include the distribution to investors of proceeds from the sale, 
financing or refinancing of assets, rather than the reinvestment of such 
proceeds in the business.

Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) or any Business

formation of the original partnership;

    (iii) A transaction that involves only issuers that are not required 
to register or report under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l), both before and after the transaction;
    (iv) A transaction that involves the combination or reorganization 
of one or more partnerships in which a non-affiliated party succeeds to 
the interests of a general partner or sponsor, if:
    (A) Such action is approved by not less than 66\2/3\% of the 
outstanding units of each of the participating partnerships; and

will receive only compensation to which they are entitled as expressly 
provided for in the preexisting partnership agreements;

transaction do not exceed 20% of the total outstanding securities of the 
entity, exclusive of any securities of such class held by or for the 
account of the entity or a subsidiary of the entity; and
    (C) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this Item (Sec. 
229.901(c)(2)(v)), a regularly traded security means any security with a 
minimum closing price of $2.00 or more for a majority of the business 
days during the preceding three-month period and a six-month minimum 
average daily trading volume of 1,000 shares;
    (vi) A transaction in which all of the investors' partnership

purchased after the roll-up transaction and no properties were sold or 
purchased during the period covered by the table), describe such changes 
and the effects thereof on the compensation and distributions to be paid 
by the successor.
    (6) Cash distributions made to investors during each of the last 
five fiscal years and most recently completed interim period,

roll-up transaction is fair or unfair to investors and the reasons for 
such belief. Such discussion must address the fairness of the roll-up 
transaction to investors in each of the partnerships and as a whole. If

partnerships consisting of less than all partnerships, or with portions 
of partnerships, the belief stated must address each possible 
combination.
    (b) Discuss in reasonable detail the material factors upon which the

    (2) Describe any material differences among the partnerships (e.g., 
different types of assets or different investment objectives) relating 
to the fairness of the transaction.
    (c) If any offer of the type described in Instruction (2)(viii) to 
this Item (Sec. 229.910) has been received, describe such offer and 
state the reason(s) for its rejection.
    (d) Describe any factors known to the general partner that may 
affect materially the value of the consideration to be received by 
investors in the roll-up transaction, the values assigned to the 
partnerships for purposes of the comparisons to alternatives required by 
paragraph (b) of this Item (Sec. 229.910) and the fairness of the 
transaction to investors.
    (e) State whether the general partner's statements in response to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Item (Sec. 229.910) are based, in whole 
or in part, on any report, opinion or appraisal described in response to 
Item 911 of this subpart (Sec. 229.911). If so, describe any material 
uncertainties known to the general partner that relate to the 
conclusions in any such report, opinion or appraisal including, but not 
limited to, developments or trends that have affected or are reasonably 
likely to affect materially such conclusions.

Instructions to Item 910: (1) A statement that the general partner has 
no reasonable belief as to the fairness of the roll-up transaction to 
investors will not be considered sufficient disclosure in response to 
paragraph (a) of this Item (Sec. 229.910(a)).
    (2) The factors which are important in determining the fairness of a 
roll-up transaction to investors and the weight, if any, which should be 
given to them in a particular context will vary. Normally such factors 
will include, among others, those referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of 
Item 909 (Sec. 229.909(b)(1)) and whether the consideration offered to 
investors constitutes fair value in relation to:
    (i) Current market prices, if any;
    (ii) Historic market prices, if any;
    (iii) Net book value;
    (iv) Going concern value;
    (v) Liquidation value;
    (vi) Purchases of limited partnership interests by the general 
partner or sponsor or their affiliates since the commencement of the 
partnership's second full fiscal year preceding the date of filing of 
the disclosure document for the roll-up transaction;
    (vii) Any report, opinion, or appraisal described in Item 911 of 
this subpart (Sec. 229.911); and
    (viii) Offers of which the general partner or sponsor is aware made 
during the preceding eighteen months for a merger, consolidation, or 
combination of any of the partnerships; an acquisition of any of the 
partnerships or a material amount of their assets; a tender offer for or 
other acquisition of securities of any class issued by any of the 
partnerships; or a change in control of any of the partnerships.
    (3) The discussion concerning fairness should specifically address 
material terms of the transaction including whether the consideration 
offered to investors constitutes fair value in relation to:
    (i) The form and amount of consideration to be received by investors 
and the sponsor in the roll-up transaction;
    (ii) The methods used to determine such consideration; and
    (iii) The compensation to be paid to the sponsor in the future.
    (4) Conclusory statements, such as ``The roll-up transaction is fair 
to investors in relation to net book value, going concern value, 
liquidation value and future prospects of the partnership,'' will not be 
considered sufficient disclosure in response to paragraph (b) of this 
Item (Sec. 229.910(b)).
    (5) Consideration should be given to presenting the comparative 
numerical data as to the value of the consideration being received by 
investors, liquidation value and other values in a tabular format. 
Financial and other information concerning the partnerships should be 
prepared based upon the most recent available information, such as, in 
the case of financial information, the periods covered by interim 
selected financial information included in the prospectus in accordance 
with Item 914 of this subpart (Sec. 229.914).

opinion on the fairness of the proposed roll-up transaction to investors 
in each of the affected partnerships, state the sponsor's or general 
partner's reasons for concluding that such an opinion is not necessary

    Source: 70 FR 1597, Jan. 7, 2005, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 229.1100  (Item 1100) General.

    (a) Application of Regulation AB. Regulation AB (Sec. Sec. 229.1100 
through 229.1123) is the source of various disclosure items and 
requirements for ``asset-backed securities'' filings under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (the ``Securities Act'') 
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.). Unless otherwise specified, definitions to be used 
in this Regulation AB, including the definition of ``asset-backed 
security,'' are set forth in Item 1101.
    (b) Presentation of historical delinquency and loss information. 
Several Items in Regulation AB call for the presentation of historical 
information and data on delinquencies and loss information. In providing 
such information:
    (1) Present delinquency experience in 30 or 31 day increments, as 
applicable, beginning at least with assets that are 30 or 31 days 
delinquent, as applicable, through the point that assets are written off 
or charged off as uncollectable. At a minimum, present such information 
by number of accounts and dollar amount. Present statistical information 
in a tabular or graphical format, if such presentation will aid 
understanding.
    (2) Disclose the total amount of delinquent assets as a percentage 
of the aggregate asset pool.
    (3) Present loss and cumulative loss information, as applicable, 
regarding charge-offs, charge-off rate, gross losses, recoveries and net 
losses (with a description of how these terms are defined), the number 
and amount of assets experiencing a loss and the number and amount of 
assets with a recovery, the ratio of aggregate net losses to average 
portfolio balance and the average of net loss on all assets that have 
experienced a net loss.
    (4) Categorize all delinquency and loss information by pool asset 
type.
    (5) In a registration statement under the Securities Act or the 
Exchange Act or in a prospectus to be filed pursuant to Sec. 230.424, 
describe how delinquencies, charge-offs and uncollectable accounts are 
defined or determined, addressing the effect of any grace period, re-
aging, restructure, partial payments considered current or other 
practices on delinquency and loss experience.
    (6) Describe any other material information regarding delinquencies 
and losses particular to the pool asset type(s), such as repossession 
information, foreclosure information and real estate owned (REO) or 
similar information.
    (c) Presentation of certain third party financial information. If 
financial information of a third party is required in a filing by Item 
1112(b) of this Regulation AB (Information regarding significant 
obligors) or Items 1114(b)(2) or 1115(b) of this Regulation AB 
(Information regarding significant provider of enhancement or other 
support), such information, in lieu of including such information, may 
be provided as follows:
    (1) Incorporation by reference. If the following conditions are met, 
you may incorporate by reference (by means of a statement to that 
effect) the reports filed by the third party (or the entity that 
consolidates the third party) pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 78o(d)):

[[Page 494]]

    (i) Such third party or the entity that consolidates the third party 
is required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to section 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
    (ii) Such third party or the entity that consolidates the third 
party has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by 
such requirements during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period 
that such party was required to file such reports and materials).
    (iii) The reports filed by such third party, or entity that 
consolidates the third party, include (or properly incorporate by 
reference) the financial statements of such third party.
    (iv) If incorporated by reference into a prospectus or registration 
statement, the prospectus also states that all documents subsequently 
filed by such third party, or the entity that consolidates the third 
party, pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act prior to 
the termination of the offering also shall be deemed to be incorporated 
by reference into the prospectus.

significant obligor that is an asset-backed issuer and the pool assets 
relating to such significant obligor are asset-backed securities, then

direct or indirect agreement, arrangement, relationship or 
understanding, written or otherwise, relating to the asset-backed 
securities transaction, and neither the third party nor any of its 
affiliates is an affiliate of the sponsor, depositor, issuing entity or 
underwriter of the asset-backed securities transaction.
    (ii) To the knowledge of the registrant, any of the following is 
true:
    (A) The third party is eligible to use Form S-3 or F-3 (Sec. 239.13 
or 239.33 of this chapter) for a primary offering of non-investment 
grade securities pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1 of such forms.
    (B) The third party meets the requirements of General Instruction 
I.A. of Form S-3 or General Instructions 1.A.1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 of Form F-

section, the criteria in either paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section are met with respect to the third party 
and the requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.3-10 of 
this chapter) are satisfied regarding the information in the reports to 
be referenced.
    (E) The pool assets relating to such third party are asset-backed

and a description of marketing events (including the dates, times, 
locations, and procedures for attending or otherwise accessing them); 
and
    (8) A description of the procedures by which the underwriters will 
conduct the offering and the procedures for transactions in connection 
with the offering with an underwriter or participating dealer (including 
procedures regarding account-opening and submitting indications of 
interest and conditional offers to buy).
    (b) Asset-backed issuer means an issuer whose reporting obligation 
results from either the registration of an offering of asset-backed 
securities under the Securities Act, or the registration of a class of 
asset-backed securities under section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 
78l).
    (c)(1) Asset-backed security means a security that is primarily 
serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of receivables or other 
financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert 
into cash within a finite time period, plus any rights or other assets 
designed to assure the servicing or timely distributions of proceeds to 
the security holders; provided that in the case of financial assets that 
are leases, those assets may convert to cash partially by the cash 
proceeds from the disposition of the physical property underlying such 
leases.
    (2) The following additional conditions apply in order to be 
considered an asset-backed security:
    (i) Neither the depositor nor the issuing entity is an investment 
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et 
seq.) nor will become an investment company as a result of the asset-
backed securities transaction.
    (ii) The activities of the issuing entity for the asset-backed 
securities are limited to passively owning or holding the pool of 
assets, issuing the asset-backed securities supported or serviced by 
those assets, and other activities reasonably incidental thereto.
    (iii) No non-performing assets are part of the asset pool as of the 
measurement date.
    (iv) Delinquent assets do not constitute 50% or more, as measured by 
dollar volume, of the asset pool as of the measurement date.
    (v) With respect to securities that are backed by leases, the 
portion of the securitized pool balance attributable to the residual 
value of the physical property underlying the leases, as determined in 
accordance with the transaction agreements for the securities, does not 
constitute:
    (A) For motor vehicle leases, 65% or more, as measured by dollar 
volume, of

[[Page 498]]

the securitized pool balance as of the measurement date.
    (B) For all other leases, 50% or more, as measured by dollar volume, 
of the securitized pool balance as of the measurement date.
    (3) Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section that the asset pool be a discrete pool of assets, the following 
are considered to be a discrete pool of assets for purposes of being 
considered an asset-backed security:
    (i) Master trusts. The offering related to the securities 
contemplates adding additional assets to the pool that backs such 
securities in connection with future issuances of asset-backed 
securities backed by such pool. The offering related to the securities 
also may contemplate additions to the asset pool, to the extent 
consistent with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (c)(3)(iii) of this section, 
in connection with maintaining minimum pool balances in accordance with 
the transaction agreements for master trusts with revolving periods or 
receivables or other financial assets that arise under revolving 
accounts.
    (ii) Prefunding periods. The offering related to the securities 
contemplates a prefunding account where a portion of the proceeds of 
that offering is to be used for the future acquisition of additional 
pool assets, if the duration of the prefunding period does not extend 
for more than one year from the date of issuance of the securities and 
the portion of the proceeds for such prefunding account does not involve 
in excess of:
    (A) For master trusts, 50% of the aggregate principal balance of the 
total asset pool whose cash flows support the securities; and
    (B) For other offerings, 50% of the proceeds of the offering.
    (iii) Revolving periods. The offering related to the securities 
contemplates a revolving period where cash flows from the pool assets 
may be used to acquire additional pool assets, provided, that, for 
securities backed by receivables or other financial assets that do not 
arise under revolving accounts, the revolving period does not extend for 
more than three years from the date of issuance of the securities and 
the additional pool assets are of the same general character as the 
original pool assets.

Instructions to Item 1101(c). 1. For purposes of determining non-
performing, delinquency and residual value thresholds, the ``measurement 
date'' means either:
    a. The designated cut-off date for the transaction (i.e., the date 
on and after which collections on the pool assets accrue for the benefit 
of asset-backed security holders), if applicable; or
    b. In the case of master trusts, the date as of which delinquency 
and loss information or securitized pool balance information, as 
applicable, is presented in the prospectus for the asset-backed 
securities to be filed pursuant to Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter.
    2. Non-performing and delinquent assets that are not funded or 
purchased by proceeds from the securities and that are not considered in 
cash flow calculations for the securities need not be considered as part 
of the asset pool for purposes of determining non-performing and 
delinquency thresholds.
    3. For purposes of determining non-performing, delinquency and 
residual value thresholds for master trusts, calculations are to be 
measured against the total asset pool whose cash flows support the 
securities.
    4. For purposes of determining residual value thresholds, residual 
values need not be included in measuring against the thresholds to the 
extent a separate party is obligated for such amounts (e.g., through a 
residual value guarantee, residual value insurance or where the lessee 
is obligated to cover any residual losses).
    (d) Delinquent, for purposes of determining if a pool asset is 
delinquent, means if a pool asset is more than 30 or 31 days or a single 
payment cycle, as applicable, past due from the contractual due date, as 
determined in accordance with any of the following:
    (1) The transaction agreements for the asset-backed securities;
    (2) The delinquency recognition policies of the sponsor, any 
affiliate of the sponsor that originated the pool asset or the servicer 
of the pool asset; or
    (3) The delinquency recognition policies applicable to such pool 
asset established by the primary safety and soundness regulator of any 
entity listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or the program or 
regulatory entity that oversees the program under which the pool asset 
was originated.
    (e) Depositor means the depositor who receives or purchases and 
transfers or

[[Page 499]]

sells the pool assets to the issuing entity. For asset-backed securities 
transactions where there is not an intermediate transfer of the assets 
from the sponsor to the issuing entity, the term depositor refers to the 
sponsor. For asset-backed securities transactions where the person 
transferring or selling the pool assets is itself a trust, the depositor 
of the issuing entity is the depositor of that trust.
    (f) Issuing entity means the trust or other entity created at the 
direction of the sponsor or depositor that owns or holds the pool assets 
and in whose name the asset-backed securities supported or serviced by 
the pool assets are issued.
    (g) Non-performing, for purposes of determining if a pool asset is 
non-performing, means a pool asset if any of the following is true:
    (1) The pool asset would be treated as wholly or partially charged-
off under the requirements in the transaction agreements for the asset-
backed securities;
    (2) The pool asset would be treated as wholly or partially charged-
off under the charge-off policies of the sponsor, an affiliate of the 
sponsor that originates the pool asset or a servicer that services the 
pool asset; or
    (3) The pool asset would be treated as wholly or partially charged-
off under the charge-off policies applicable to such pool asset 
established by the primary safety and soundness regulator of any entity 
listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or the program or regulatory 
entity that oversees the program under which the pool asset was 
originated.
    (h) NRSRO has the same meaning as the term ``nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization'' as used in Sec. 240.15c3-
1(c)(2)(vi)(F) of this chapter.
    (i) Obligor means any person who is directly or indirectly committed 
by contract or other arrangement to make payments on all or part of the 
obligations on a pool asset.
    (j) Servicer means any person responsible for the management or 
collection of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to 
holders of the asset-backed securities. The term servicer does not 
include a trustee for the issuing entity or the asset-backed securities 
that makes allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed 
securities if the trustee receives such allocations or distributions 
from a servicer and the trustee does not otherwise perform the functions 
of a servicer.
    (k) Significant obligor means any of the following:
    (1) An obligor or a group of affiliated obligors on any pool asset 
or group of pool assets if such pool asset or group of pool assets 
represents 10% or more of the asset pool.
    (2) A single property or group of related properties securing a pool 
asset or a group of pool assets if such pool asset or group of pool 
assets represents 10% or more of the asset pool.
    (3) A lessee or group of affiliated lessees if the related lease or 
group of leases represents 10% or more of the asset pool.

Instructions to Item 1101(k): 1. Regarding paragraph (k)(3) of this 
section, the calculation must focus on the leases whose cash flow 
supports the asset-backed securities directly or indirectly (including 
the residual value of the physical property underlying the leases if a 
portion of the securitized pool balance is attributable to the residual 
value of such property), regardless of whether the asset pool contains 
the leases themselves, mortgages on properties that are the subject of 
the leases or other assets related to the leases.
    2. If separate pool assets, or properties underlying pool assets, 
are cross-defaulted and/or cross-collateralized, such pool assets are to 
be aggregated and considered together in determining concentration 
levels.
    3. If the pool asset is a mortgage or lease relating to real estate, 
the pool asset is non-recourse to the obligor, and the obligor does not 
manage the property or does not own other assets and has no other 
operations, then the obligor need not be considered a separate 
significant obligor from the real estate. Otherwise, the obligor is a 
separate significant obligor.
    4. The determination of significant obligors is to be made as of the 
designated cut-off date for the transaction (i.e., the date on and after 
which collections on the pool assets accrue for the benefit of asset-
backed security holders), provided, that, in the case of master trusts, 
the determination is to be made as of the cut-off date (or issuance date 
if there is not a cut-off date) for each issuance of asset-backed 
securities backed by the same asset pool. In addition, if disclosure is 
required pursuant to either Item 6.05 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) or in 
a Form 10-

[[Page 500]]

D (17 CFR 249.312) pursuant to Item 1121(b) of this Regulation AB, the 
determination of significant obligors is to be made against the asset 
pool described in such report. However, if the percentage concentration 
regarding an obligor falls below 10% subsequent to the determination 
dates discussed in this Instruction, the obligor no longer need be 
considered a significant obligor.
    (l) Sponsor means the person who organizes and initiates an asset-
backed securities transaction by selling or transferring assets, either 
directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuing 
entity.

Sec. 229.1105  (Item 1105) Static pool information.

    (a) For amortizing asset pools, unless the registrant determines 
that such information is not material:
    (1) Provide static pool information, to the extent material, 
regarding delinquencies, cumulative losses and prepayments for prior 
securitized pools of the sponsor for that asset type.
    (2) If the sponsor has less than three years of experience 
securitizing assets of the type to be included in the offered asset 
pool, consider providing instead static pool information, to the extent 
material, regarding delinquencies, cumulative losses and prepayments by 
vintage origination years regarding originations or purchases by the 
sponsor, as applicable, for that asset type. A vintage origination year 
represents assets originated during the same year.
    (3) In providing the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section:
    (i) Provide the requested information for prior pools or vintage 
origination years, as applicable, relating to the following time period,

of the same asset type (in the case of paragraph (a)(1) of this section) 
or making originations or purchases of assets of the same asset type (in 
the case of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) if less than five years.
    (ii) Present delinquency, cumulative loss and prepayment data for 
each prior securitized pool or vintage origination year, as applicable, 
in periodic increments (e.g., monthly or quarterly), to the extent 
material, over the life of the prior securitized pool or vintage 
origination year. The most recent periodic increment for the data must 
be as of a date no later than 135 days of the date of first use of the 
prospectus.
    (iii) Provide summary information for the original characteristics 
of the prior securitized pools or vintage origination years, as 
applicable and material. While the material summary characteristics may 
vary, these characteristics may include, among other things, the 
following: number of pool assets; original pool balance; weighted 
average initial loan balance; weighted average interest or note rate; 
weighted average original term; weighted average remaining term; 
weighted average and minimum and maximum standardized credit score or 
other applicable measure of obligor credit quality; product type; loan 
purpose; loan-to-value information; distribution of assets by loan or 
note rate; and geographic distribution information.
    (b) For revolving asset master trusts, unless the registrant 
determines that

[[Page 503]]

such information is not material, provide, to the extent material, data 
regarding delinquencies, cumulative losses, prepayments, payment rate, 
yield and standardized credit scores or other applicable measure of 
obligor credit quality in separate increments based on the date of 
origination of the pool assets. While the material increments may vary, 
consider presenting such data at a minimum in 12-month increments 
through the first five years of the account's life (e.g., 0-12 months, 
13-24 months, 25-36 months, 37-48 months, 49-60 months and 61 months or 
more).
    (c) If the information that would otherwise be required by paragraph 
(a)(1), (a)(2) or (b) of this section is not material, but alternative 
static pool information would provide material disclosure, provide such 
alternative information instead. Similarly, information contemplated by 
paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2) or (b) of this section regarding a party or 
parties other than the sponsor may be provided in addition to or in lieu 
of such information regarding the sponsor if appropriate to provide 
material disclosure. In addition, other explanatory disclosure, 
including disclosure explaining the absence of any static pool 
information, may be provided.
    (d) The following information provided in response to this section 
shall not be deemed to be a prospectus or part of a prospectus for the 
asset-backed securities nor shall such information be deemed to be part 
of the registration statement for the asset-backed securities:
    (1) With respect to information regarding prior securitized pools of 
the sponsor that do not include the currently offered pool, information 
regarding prior securitized pools that were established before January 
1, 2006; and
    (2) With respect to information regarding the currently offered 
pool, information about the pool for periods before January 1, 2006.
    (e) For prospectuses to be filed pursuant to Sec. 230.424 of this 
chapter that include information specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) 
of this section, the prospectus shall disclose that such information is 
not deemed to be part of that prospectus or the registration statement 
for the asset-backed securities.
    (f) If any of the information identified in paragraph (d)(1) or 
(d)(2) of this section that is to be provided in response to this 
section is unknown and not available to the registrant without 
unreasonable effort or expense, such information may be omitted, 
provided the registrant provides the information on the subject it 
possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense, and the 
registrant includes a statement in the prospectus showing that 
unreasonable effort or expense would be involved in obtaining the 
omitted information.

    (a) Description of the securities and transaction structure. In 
providing the information required by Item 202 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 
229.202), address the following specific factors relating to the asset-
backed securities, as applicable:
    (1) The types or categories of securities that may be offered, such 
as interest-weighted or principal-weighted classes (including IO 
(interest only) or PO (principal only) securities), planned amortization 
or companion classes or residual or subordinated interests.
    (2) The flow of funds for the transaction, including the payment 
allocations, rights and distribution priorities among all classes of the 
issuing entity's securities, and within each class, with respect to cash 
flows, credit enhancement or other support and any other structural 
features designed to enhance credit, facilitate the timely payment of 
monies due on the pool assets or owing to security holders, adjust the 
rate of return on the asset-backed securities, or preserve monies that 
will or might be distributed to security holders. In addition to an 
appropriate narrative discussion of the allocation and priority 
structure of pool

[[Page 512]]

cash flows, present the flow of funds graphically if doing so will aid 
understanding. In the flow of funds discussion, provide information 
regarding any requirements directing cash flows from the pool assets 
(such as to reserve accounts, cash collateral accounts or expenses) and 
the purpose and operation of such requirements.
    (3) In describing the interest rate or rate of return on the asset-
backed securities and how such amounts are payable, explain how the rate 
is determined and how frequently it will be determined. If the rate to 
be paid can be a combination of two or more rates (such as the lesser of 
a variable rate or the actual weighted average net coupon on the pool 
assets), provide clear information regarding each rate and when each 
rate applies.
    (4) How principal, if any, will be paid on the asset-backed 
securities, including maturity dates, amortization or principal 
distribution schedules, principal distribution dates, formulas for 
calculating principal distributions from the cash flows and other 
factors that will affect the timing or amount of principal payments for 
each class of securities.
    (5) The denominations in which the asset-backed securities may be 
issued.
    (6) Any specified changes to the transaction structure that would be 
triggered upon a default or event of default (such as a change in 
distribution priority among classes).
    (7) Any liquidation, amortization, performance or similar triggers 
or events, and the rights of investors or changes to the transaction 
structure or flow of funds if such events were to occur.
    (8) Whether the servicer or other party is required to provide 
periodic evidence of the absence of a default or of compliance with the 
terms of the transaction agreements.
    (9) If applicable, the extent, expressed as a percentage, the 
transaction is overcollateralized or undercollateralized as measured by 
comparing the principal balance of the asset-backed securities to the 
asset pool.
    (10) Any provisions contained in other securities that could result 
in a cross-default or cross-collateralization.
    (11) Any minimum standards, restrictions or suitability requirements 
regarding potential investors in purchasing the securities or any 
restrictions on ownership or transfer of the securities.
    (12) Security holder vote required to amend the transaction 
documents and allocation of voting rights among security holders.
    (b) Distribution frequency and cash maintenance. (1) Disclose the 
frequency of distribution dates for the asset-backed securities and the 
collection periods for the pool assets.
    (2) Describe how cash held pending distribution or other uses is 
held and invested. Also describe the length of time cash will be held 
pending distributions to security holders. Identify the party or parties 
with access to cash balances and the authority to invest cash balances. 
Specify who determines any decisions regarding the deposit, transfer or 
disbursement of pool asset cash flows and whether there will be any 
independent verification of the transaction accounts or account 
activity.
    (c) Fees and expenses. Provide in a separate table an itemized list 
of all fees and expenses to be paid or payable out of the cash flows 
from the pool assets. In itemizing the fees and expenses, also indicate 
their general purpose, the party receiving such fees or expenses, the 
source of funds for such fees or expenses (if different from other fees 
or expenses or if such fees or expenses are to be paid from a specified 
portion of the cash flows) and the distribution priority of such 
expenses. If the amount of such fees or expenses is not fixed, provide 
the formula used to determine such fees or expenses. The tabular 
presentation should be accompanied by footnotes or other accompanying 
narrative disclosure to the extent necessary for an understanding of the 
timing or amount of such fees or expenses, such as any restrictions or 
limits on fees or whether the estimate may change in certain instances, 
such as in an event of default (and how the fees would change in such an 
instance or the factors that would affect the change). In addition, 
through footnote or other accompanying narrative disclosure, describe if 
any, and if so how,

[[Page 513]]

such fees or expenses can be changed without notice to, or approval by, 
security holders and any restrictions on the ability to change a fee or 
expense amount, such as due to a change in transaction party.
    (d) Excess cash flow. (1) Describe the disposition of residual or 
excess cash flows. Identify who owns any residual or retained interests 
to the cash flows if such person is affiliated with the sponsor, 
depositor, issuing entity or any entity identified in Item 1119(a) of 
this Regulation AB or if such person has rights that may alter the 
transaction structure beyond receipt of residual or excess cash flows. 
Describe such rights, as material.
    (2) Disclose any requirements in the transaction agreements to 
maintain a minimum amount of excess cash flow or spread from, or 
retained interest in, the transaction and any actions that would be 
required or changes to the transaction structure that would occur if 
such requirements were not met.
    (3) To the extent material to an understanding of the asset-backed 
securities, disclose any features or arrangements to facilitate a 
securitization of the excess cash flow or retained interest from the 
transaction, including whether any material changes to the transaction 
structure may be made without the consent of asset-backed security 
holders in connection with these securitizations.
    (e) Master trusts. If one or more additional series or classes have 
been or may be issued that are backed by the same asset pool, provide 
information regarding the additional securities to the extent material 
to an understanding of their effect on the securities being offered, 
including the following:
    (1) Relative priority of such additional securities to the 
securities being offered and rights to the underlying pool assets and 
their cash flows.
    (2) Allocation of cash flow from the asset pool and any expenses or 
losses among the various series or classes.
    (3) Terms under which such additional series or classes may be 
issued and pool assets increased or changed.
    (4) The terms of any security holder approval or notification of 
such additional securities.
    (5) Which party has the authority to determine whether such 
additional securities may be issued. In addition, if there are 
conditions to such additional issuance, disclose whether or not there 
will be an independent verification of such person's exercise of 
authority or determinations.
    (f) Optional or mandatory redemption or termination. (1) If any 
class of the asset-backed securities includes an optional or mandatory 
redemption or termination feature, provide the following information:
    (i) Terms for triggering the redemption or termination.
    (ii) The identity of the party that holds the redemption or 
termination option or obligation, as well as whether such party is an 
affiliate of the sponsor, depositor, issuing entity or any entity 
identified in Item 1119(a) of this Regulation AB.
    (iii) The amount of the redemption or repurchase price or formula 
for determining such amount.
    (iv) The procedures for redemption or termination, including any 
notices to security holders.
    (v) If the amount allocated to security holders is reduced by 
losses, the policy regarding any amounts recovered after redemption or 
termination.
    (2) The title of any class of securities with an optional redemption 
or termination feature that may be exercised when 25% or more of the 
original principal balance of the pool assets is still outstanding must 
include the word ``callable,'' provided, however, that in the case of a 
master trust, a title of a class of securities must include the word 
``callable'' when an optional redemption or termination feature may be 
exercised when 25% or more of the original principal balance of the 
particular series in which the class was issued is still outstanding.
    (g) Prepayment, maturity and yield considerations. (1) Describe any 
models, including the related material assumptions and limitations, used 
as a means to identify cash flow patterns with respect to the pool 
assets.
    (2) Describe to the extent material the degree to which each class 
of securities is sensitive to changes in the rate of payment on the pool 
assets

[[Page 514]]

(e.g., prepayment or interest rate sensitivity), and describe the 
consequences of such changing rate of payment. Provide statistical 
information of such effects, such as the effect of prepayments on yield 
and weighted average life.
    (3) Describe any special allocations of prepayment risks among the 
classes of securities, and whether any class protects other classes from 
the effects of the uncertain timing of cash flow.


<R05>
Sec. 229.1114  (Item 1114) Credit enhancement and other support, except for certain derivatives instruments.

    (a) Descriptive information. To the extent material, describe the 
following, including a clear discussion of the manner in which each 
potential item is designed to affect or ensure timely payment of the 
asset-backed securities:
    (1) Any external credit enhancement designed to ensure that the 
asset-backed securities or pool assets will pay in accordance with their 
terms, such as bond insurance, letters of credit or guarantees.

agreements.
    (3) Any derivatives whose primary purpose is to provide credit 
enhancement related to pool assets or the asset-backed securities.
    (4) Any internal credit enhancement as a result of the structure of 
the transaction that increases the likelihood that payments will be made

Instructions to Item 1114(a): 1. Include a description of the material 
terms of any enhancement or support described, including any limits on 
the timing or amount of the enhancement or support or any conditions

to the performance of the receivables or other financial assets in the 
asset pool.
    (b) Information regarding significant enhancement providers--(1) 
Descriptive information. If an entity or group of affiliated entities

Sec. 229.1115  (Item 1115) Certain derivatives instruments.

    This item relates to derivative instruments, such as interest rate 
and currency swap agreements, that are used to alter the payment 
characteristics of the cashflows from the issuing entity and whose 
primary purpose is not to provide credit enhancement related to the pool

instruments. The ``significance percentage'' is the percentage that the 
amount of the significance estimate represents of the aggregate 
principal balance of the pool assets, provided, that if the derivative 
instrument relates only to one or more classes of the asset-backed 
securities, the ``significance percentage'' is the percentage that the 
amount of the significance estimate represents of the aggregate 
principal balance of such classes.
    (a) Descriptive information. (1) Describe the following regarding 
the external counterparty:

    (4) At a minimum, disclose whether the significance percentage, as 
calculated in accordance with this section, is less than 10%, at least 
10% but less than 20%, or 20% or more.
    (5) File the agreement relating to the derivative instrument as an 
exhibit.
    (b) Financial information. (1) If the aggregate significance 
percentage related to any entity or group of affiliated entities 
providing derivative instruments contemplated by this section is 10% or 
more, but less than 20%, provide financial data required by Item 301 of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.301) for such entity or group of affiliated 
entities.
    (2) If the aggregate significance percentage related to any entity 
or group of affiliated entities providing derivative instruments 
contemplated by this section is 20% or more, provide financial 
statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X (Sec. Sec. 210.1-
01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter), except Sec. 210.3-05 of this 
chapter and Article 11 of Regulation S-X (Sec. Sec. 210.11-01 through 
210.11-03 of this chapter), of such entity or group of affiliated 
entities. Financial statements of such entity and its subsidiaries 
consolidated (as required by Sec. 240.14a-3(b) of this chapter) shall

federal income tax consequences are not expected to be the same for 
investors in all classes offered by the registration statement, describe 
the material differences.
    (c) The substance of counsel's tax opinion, including identification 
of the material consequences upon which counsel has not been asked, or 
is unable, to opine.

    (iii) Principal, interest and other distributions accrued and paid 
on the asset-backed securities by type and by class or series and any 
principal or interest shortfalls or carryovers.
    (iv) The amount of excess cash flow or excess spread and the 
disposition of excess cash flow.
    (4) Beginning and ending principal balances of the asset-backed

each period, and updated pool composition information, such as weighted 
average coupon, weighted average life, weighted average remaining term, 
pool factors and prepayment amounts. For asset-backed securities backed 
by leases where a portion of the securitized pool balance is

repurchases (and purchase rates, if applicable), and cash flows 
available for future purchases, such as the balances of any prefunding 
or revolving accounts, if applicable. Disclose any material changes in 
the solicitation, credit-granting, underwriting, origination, 
acquisition or pool selection criteria or procedures, as applicable, 
used to originate, acquire or select the new pool assets.

new issuance of asset-backed securities backed by the same pool under a 
master trust during the fiscal year of the issuing entity, provide the 
information required by Items 1110, 1111 and 1112 of this Regulation AB 
applied taking the revised pool composition into account in the Form 10-

distribution of the fiscal year of the issuing entity. In addition, 
provide such updated information in the first Form 10-D report for the 
period in which the prefunding or revolving period ends (if applicable).

Instructions to Item 1122: 1. If certain servicing criteria are not 
applicable to the asserting party based on the activities it performs 
with respect to asset-backed securities transactions taken as a whole 
involving such party and that are backed by the same asset type backing 
the class of asset-backed securities, the inapplicability of the 
criteria must be disclosed in that asserting party's and the related 
registered public accounting firm's reports.
    2. If multiple parties are participating in the servicing function, 
a separate assessment report and attestation report must be included for 
each party participating in the servicing function. A party 
participating in the servicing function means any entity (e.g., master 
servicer, primary servicers, trustees) that is performing activities 
that address the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section, unless such 
entity's activities relate only to 5% or less of the pool assets.
    3. If the asset pool backing the asset-backed securities includes a 
pool asset representing an interest in or the right to the payments or 
cash flows of another asset pool and both the issuing entity for the 
asset-backed securities and the entity issuing the asset to be included 
in the issuing entity's asset pool were established under the direction 
of the same sponsor and depositor, see also Item 1100(d)(2) of this 
Regulation AB.

Sec. 229.1123  (Item 1123) Servicer compliance statement.

    Provide as an exhibit a statement of compliance from the servicer, 
signed by an authorized officer of such servicer, to the effect that:
    (a) A review of the servicer's activities during the reporting 
period and of its performance under the applicable servicing agreement 
has been made under such officer's supervision.
    (b) To the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, 
the servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under the agreement in 
all material respects throughout the reporting period or, if there has 
been a failure to fulfill any such obligation in any material respect, 
specifying each such failure known to such officer and the nature and 
status thereof.

Instruction to Item 1123: If multiple servicers are involved in 
servicing the pool assets, a separate servicer compliance statement is 
required from each servicer that meets the criteria in Item 
1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this Regulation AB.

    (2) Disclose, in the aggregate and by geographic area and for each 
country containing 15% or more of the registrant's proved reserves, 
expressed on an oil-equivalent-barrels basis, reserves estimated using 
prices and costs under existing economic conditions, for the product 
types listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this Item, in the following 
categories:
    (i) Proved developed reserves;
    (ii) Proved undeveloped reserves;
    (iii) Total proved reserves;
    (iv) Probable developed reserves (optional);
    (v) Probable undeveloped reserves (optional);
    (vi) Possible developed reserves (optional); and
    (vii) Possible undeveloped reserves (optional).
    Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(2): Disclose updated reserves tables 
as of the close of each fiscal year.
    Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(2): The registrant is permitted, but 
not required, to disclose probable or possible reserves pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) through (a)(2)(vii) of this Item.
    Instruction 3 to paragraph (a)(2): If the registrant discloses 
amounts of a product in barrels of oil equivalent, disclose the basis 
for such equivalency.
    Instruction 4 to paragraph (a)(2): A registrant need not provide 
disclosure of the reserves in a country containing 15% or more of the 
registrant's proved reserves if that country's government prohibits 
disclosure of reserves in that country. In addition, a registrant need 
not provide disclosure of the reserves in a country containing 15% or 
more of the registrant's proved reserves if that country's government 
prohibits disclosure in a particular field and disclosure of reserves in 
that country would have the effect of disclosing reserves in particular 
fields.
    (3) Reported total reserves shall be simple arithmetic sums of all 
estimates for individual properties or fields within each reserves 
category. When probabilistic methods are used, reserves should not be 
aggregated probabilistically beyond the field or property level; 
instead, they should be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation.
    (4) Disclose separately material reserves of the following product 
types:
    (i) Oil;
    (ii) Natural gas;
    (iii) Synthetic oil;
    (iv) Synthetic gas; and
    (v) Sales products of other non-renewable natural resources that are 
intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil and gas.

[[Page 524]]

    (5) If the registrant discloses probable or possible reserves, 
discuss the uncertainty related to such reserves estimates.
    (6) If the registrant has not previously disclosed reserves 
estimates in a filing with the Commission or is disclosing material 
additions to its reserves estimates, the registrant shall provide a 
general discussion of the technologies used to establish the appropriate 
level of certainty for reserves estimates from material properties 
included in the total reserves disclosed. The particular properties do 
not need to be identified.
    (7) Preparation of reserves estimates or reserves audit. Disclose 
and describe the internal controls the registrant uses in its reserves 
estimation effort. In addition, disclose the qualifications of the 
technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of 
the reserves estimates and, if the registrant represents that a third 
party conducted a reserves audit, disclose the qualifications of the 
technical person primarily responsible for overseeing such reserves 
audit.
    (8) Third party reports. If the registrant represents that a third 
party prepared, or conducted a reserves audit of, the registrant's 
reserves estimates, or any estimated valuation thereof, or conducted a 
process review, the registrant shall file a report of the third party as 
an exhibit to the relevant registration statement or other Commission 
filing. If the report relates to the preparation of, or a reserves audit 
of, the registrant's reserves estimates, it must include the following 
disclosure, if applicable to the type of filing:
    (i) The purpose for which the report was prepared and for whom it 
was prepared;
    (ii) The effective date of the report and the date on which the 
report was completed;
    (iii) The proportion of the registrant's total reserves covered by 
the report and the geographic area in which the covered reserves are 
located;
    (iv) The assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used, including 
the percentage of the registrant's total reserves reviewed in connection 
with the preparation of the report, and a statement that such 
assumptions, data, methods, and procedures are appropriate for the 
purpose served by the report;
    (v) A discussion of primary economic assumptions;
    (vi) A discussion of the possible effects of regulation on the 
ability of the registrant to recover the estimated reserves;
    (vii) A discussion regarding the inherent uncertainties of reserves 
estimates;
    (viii) A statement that the third party has used all methods and 
procedures as it considered necessary under the circumstances to prepare 
the report;
    (ix) A brief summary of the third party's conclusions with respect 
to the reserves estimates; and
    (x) The signature of the third party.
    (9) For purposes of this Item 1202, the term reserves audit means 
the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and 
assumptions underlying a reserves estimate prepared by another party and 
the rendering of an opinion about the appropriateness of the 
methodologies employed, the adequacy and quality of the data relied 
upon, the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, the 
classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used, 
and the reasonableness of the estimated reserves quantities.
    (b) Reserves sensitivity analysis (optional). (1) The registrant 
may, but is not required to, provide the information specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this Item in tabular format as provided below:

[[Page 525]]



                                                         Sensitivity of Reserves to Prices by Principal Product Type and Price Scenario

costs that may reasonably be achieved, including standardized futures 
prices or management's own forecasts.
    (3) If the registrant provides disclosure under this paragraph (b), 
disclose the price and cost schedules and assumptions on which the 
disclosed values are based.
    Instruction to Item 1202: Estimates of oil or gas resources other 
than reserves, and any estimated values of such resources, shall not be 
disclosed in any document publicly filed with the Commission, unless 
such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign 
or state law; provided, however, that where such estimates previously 
have been provided to a person (or any of its affiliates) that is 
offering to acquire, merge, or consolidate with the registrant or

    (a) Disclose the total quantity of proved undeveloped reserves at 
year end.
    (b) Disclose material changes in proved undeveloped reserves that 
occurred during the year, including proved undeveloped reserves 
converted into proved developed reserves.
    (c) Discuss investments and progress made during the year to convert 
proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, including, but 
not limited to, capital expenditures.
    (d) Explain the reasons why material amounts of proved undeveloped 
reserves in individual fields or countries remain undeveloped for five

<R05>
Sec. 229.1204  (Item 1204) Oil and gas production, production prices and production costs.

    (a) For each of the last three fiscal years disclose production, by 
final product sold, of oil, gas, and other products. Disclosure shall be 
made by geographical area and for each country and field that contains 
15% or more of the registrant's total proved reserves expressed on an 
oil-equivalent-barrels basis unless prohibited by the country in which 
the reserves are located.
    (b) For each of the last three fiscal years disclose, by 
geographical area:
    (1) The average sales price (including transfers) per unit of oil, 
gas and other products produced; and
    (2) The average production cost, not including ad valorem and 
severance taxes, per unit of production.
    Instruction 1 to Item 1204: Generally, net production should include 
only production that is owned by the registrant and produced to its 
interest, less royalties and production due others. However, in special 
situations (e.g., foreign production) net production before any 
royalties may be provided, if more appropriate. If ``net before 
royalty'' production figures are furnished, the change from the usage of 
``net production'' should be noted.
    Instruction 2 to Item 1204: Production of natural gas should include 
only marketable production of natural gas on an ``as sold'' basis. 
Production will include dry, residue, and wet gas, depending on whether 
liquids have been extracted before the registrant transfers title. 
Flared gas, injected gas, and gas consumed in operations should be 
omitted. Recovered gas-lift gas and reproduced gas should not be 
included until sold. Synthetic gas, when marketed as such, should be 
included in natural gas sales.
    Instruction 3 to Item 1204: If any product, such as bitumen, is sold 
or custody is transferred prior to conversion to synthetic oil or gas, 
the product's production, transfer prices, and production costs should 
be disclosed separately from all other products.
    Instruction 4 to Item 1204: The transfer price of oil and gas 
(natural and synthetic) produced should be determined in accordance with 
SFAS 69.
    Instruction 5 to Item 1204: The average production cost, not 
including ad valorem and severance taxes, per unit of production should 
be computed using production costs disclosed pursuant to SFAS 69. Units 
of production should be expressed in common units of production with 
oil, gas, and other products converted to a common unit of measure on 
the basis used in computing amortization.


<R05>
Sec. 229.1205  (Item 1205) Drilling and other exploratory and development activities.

    (a) For each of the last three fiscal years, by geographical area, 
disclose:
    (1) The number of net productive and dry exploratory wells drilled; 
and
    (2) The number of net productive and dry development wells drilled.

[[Page 527]]

    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this Item 1205, the following terms 
shall be defined as follows:
    (1) A dry well is an exploratory, development, or extension well 
that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient 
quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
    (2) A productive well is an exploratory, development, or extension 
well that is not a dry well.
    (3) Completion refers to installation of permanent equipment for 
production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to 
the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
    (4) The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells 
completed at any time during the fiscal year, regardless of when 
drilling was initiated.
    (c) Disclose, by geographic area, for each of the last three years, 
any other exploratory or development activities conducted, including 
implementation of mining methods for purposes of oil and gas producing 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 229.1206  (Item 1206) Present activities.

    (a) Disclose, by geographical area, the registrant's present 
activities, such as the number of wells in the process of being drilled 
(including wells temporarily suspended), waterfloods in process of being 
installed, pressure maintenance operations, and any other related 
activities of material importance.
    (b) Provide the description of present activities as of a date at 
the end of the most recent fiscal year or as close to the date that the 
registrant files the document as reasonably possible.
    (c) Include only those wells in the process of being drilled at the 
``as of'' date and express them in terms of both gross and net wells.
    (d) Do not include wells that the registrant plans to drill, but has 
not commenced drilling unless there are factors that make such 
information material.


<R05>
Sec. 229.1207  (Item 1207) Delivery commitments.

    (a) If the registrant is committed to provide a fixed and 
determinable quantity of oil or gas in the near future under existing 
contracts or agreements, disclose material information concerning the 
estimated availability of oil and gas from any principal sources, 
including the following:
    (1) The principal sources of oil and gas that the registrant will 
rely upon and the total amounts that the registrant expects to receive 
from each principal source and from all sources combined;
    (2) The total quantities of oil and gas that are subject to delivery 
commitments; and
    (3) The steps that the registrant has taken to ensure that available 
reserves and supplies are sufficient to meet such commitments for the 
next one to three years.
    (b) Disclose the information required by this Item:
    (1) In a form understandable to investors; and
    (2) Based upon the facts and circumstances of the particular 
situation, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Disclosure by geographic area;
    (ii) Significant supplies dedicated or contracted to the registrant;
    (iii) Any significant reserves or supplies subject to priorities or 
curtailments which may affect quantities delivered to certain classes of 
customers, such as customers receiving services under low priority and 
interruptible contracts;
    (iv) Any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by 
Federal or State regulatory agencies, as well as other factors beyond 
the registrant's control that may affect the registrant's ability to 
meet its contractual obligations (the registrant need not provide 
detailed discussions of price regulation);
    (v) Any other factors beyond the registrant's control, such as other 
parties having control over drilling new wells, competition for the 
acquisition of reserves and supplies, and the availability of foreign 
reserves and supplies, which may affect the registrant's ability to 
acquire additional reserves and supplies or to maintain or increase the 
availability of reserves and supplies; and
    (vi) Any impact on the registrant's earnings and financing needs 
resulting from its inability to meet short-term or long-term contractual 
obligations.

[[Page 528]]

(See Items 303 and 1209 of Regulation S-K (Sec. Sec. 229.303 and 
229.1209).)
    (c) If the registrant has been unable to meet any significant 
delivery commitments in the last three years, describe the circumstances 
concerning such events and their impact on the registrant.
    (d) For purposes of this Item, available reserves are estimates of 
the amounts of oil and gas which the registrant can produce from current 
proved developed reserves using presently installed equipment under 
existing economic and operating conditions and an estimate of amounts 
that others can deliver to the registrant under long-term contracts or 
agreements on a per-day, per-month, or per-year basis.


<R05>
Sec. 229.1208  (Item 1208) Oil and gas properties, wells, operations, and acreage.

    (a) Disclose, as of a reasonably current date or as of the end of 
the fiscal year, the total gross and net productive wells, expressed 
separately for oil and gas (including synthetic oil and gas produced 
through wells) and the total gross and net developed acreage (i.e., 
acreage assignable to productive wells) by geographic area.
    (b) Disclose, as of a reasonably current date or as of the end of 
the fiscal year, the amount of undeveloped acreage, both leases and 
concessions, if any, expressed in both gross and net acres by geographic 
area, together with an indication of acreage concentrations, and, if 
material, the minimum remaining terms of leases and concessions.
    (c) Definitions. For purposes of this Item 1208, the following terms 
shall be defined as indicated:
    (1) A gross well or acre is a well or acre in which the registrant 
owns a working interest. The number of gross wells is the total number 
of wells in which the registrant owns a working interest. Count one or 
more completions in the same bore hole as one well. In a footnote, 
disclose the number of wells with multiple completions. If one of the 
multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, classify the well 
as an oil well.
    (2) A net well or acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional 
ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The 
number of net wells or acres is the sum of the fractional working 
interests owned in gross wells or acres expressed as whole numbers and 
fractions of whole numbers.
    (3) Productive wells include producing wells and wells mechanically 
capable of production.
    (4) Undeveloped acreage encompasses those leased acres on which 
wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit 
the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of 
whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Do not confuse 
undeveloped acreage with undrilled acreage held by production under the 
terms of the lease.

Sec. 230.133  Definition for purposes of section 5 of the Act, of ``sale'', ``offer'', ``offer to sell'', and ``offer for sale''.

    (a) For purposes only of section 5 of the Act, no sale, offer to 
sell, or offer for sale shall be deemed to be involved so far as the 
stockholders of a corporation are concerned where, pursuant to statutory 
provisions in the state of incorporation or provisions contained in the 
certificate of incorporation, there is submitted to the vote of such 
stockholders a plan or agreement for a statutory merger or consolidation 
or reclassification of securities, or a proposal for the transfer of 
assets of such corporation to another person in consideration of the 
issuance of securities of such other person or securities of a 
corporation which owns stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total 
combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at 
least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of 
stock of such person, under such circumstances that the vote of a 
required favorable majority (1) will operate to authorize the proposed 
transaction as far as concerns the corporation whose stockholders are 
voting (except for the taking of action by the directors of the 
corporation involved and for compliance with such statutory provisions 
as the filing of the plan or agreement with the appropriate State 
authority), and (2) will bind all stockholders of such corporation 
except to the extent that dissenting shareholders may be entitled, under 
statutory provisions or provisions contained in the certificate of 
incorporation, to receive the appraised or fair value of their holdings.
    (b) Any person who purchases securities of the issuer from security 
holders of a constituent corporation with a view to, or offers or sells 
such securities for such security holders in connection with, a 
distribution thereof pursuant to any contract or arrangement, made in 
connection with any transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section, with the issuer or with any affiliate of the issuer, or with 
any person who in connection with such transaction is acting as an 
underwriter of such securities, shall be deemed to an underwriter of 
such securities within the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act. This 
paragraph does not refer to arrangements limited to provision for the 
matching and combination of fractional interests in securities into 
whole interests, or the purchase and sale of such fractional interests, 
among security holders of the constituent corporation and to the sale on 
behalf of, and as agent for, such security holders of such number of 
fractional or whole interests as may be necessary to adjust for any 
remaining fractional interests after such matching.
    (c) Any constituent corporation, or any person who is an affiliate 
of a constituent corporation at the time any transaction specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, is submitted to a vote of the 
stockholders of such corporation, who acquires securities of the issuer 
in connection with such transaction with a view to the distribution 
thereof shall be deemed to be an underwriter of such securities within 
the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act. A transfer by a constituent 
corporation to its security holders of securities of the issuer upon a 
complete or partial liquidation shall not be deemed a distribution for 
the purpose of this paragraph.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
a person specified therein shall not be deemed to be an underwriter nor 
to be engaged in a distribution with respect to securities acquired in 
any transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section, which are 
sold by him in brokers' transactions within the meaning of section 4(4) 
of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and subject to the 
limitations specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if such person:
    (1) Does not directly or indirectly solicit or arrange for the 
solicitation of orders to buy in anticipation of or in

[[Page 536]]

connection with such brokers' transactions;
    (2) Makes no payment in connection with the execution of such 
brokers' transactions to any person other than the broker; and
    (3) Limits such brokers' transactions to a sale or series of sales 
which, together with all other sales of securities of the same class by 
such person or on his behalf within the preceding six months, will not 
exceed the following:
    (i) If the security is traded only otherwise than on a securities 
exchange, approximately one percent of the shares or units of such 
security outstanding at the time of receipt by the broker of the order 
to execute such transactions, or
    (ii) If the security is admitted to trading on a securities 
exchange, the lesser of approximately (a) one percent of the shares or 
units of such security outstanding at the time of receipt by the broker 
of the order to execute such transactions or (b) the largest aggregate 
reported volume of trading on securities exchanges during any one week 
within the four calendar weeks preceding the receipt of such order.
    (e) For the purposes of paragraph (d) of this section:
    (1) The term brokers' transactions in section 4(4) of the Act shall 
be deemed to include transactions by a broker acting as agent for the 
account of the seller where:
    (i) The broker performs no more than the usual and customary 
broker's functions,
    (ii) The broker does no more than execute an order or orders to sell 
as a broker and receives no more than the usual or customary broker's 
commissions,
    (iii) The broker does not solicit or arrange for the solicitation of 
orders to buy in anticipation of or in connection with such transactions 
and
    (iv) The broker is not aware of any circumstances indicating that 
his principal is failing to comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) 
of this section;
    (2) The term solicitation of such orders in section 4(4) of the Act 
shall be deemed to include the solicitation of an order to buy a 
security, but shall not be deemed to include the solicitation of an 
order to sell a security;
    (3) Where within the previous 60 days a dealer has made a written 
bid for a security or a written solicitation of an offer to sell such 
security, the term solicitation in section 4(4) shall not be deemed to 
include an inquiry regarding the dealer's bid or solicitation.
    (f) For the purposes of this rule, the term constituent corporation 
means any corporation, other than the issuer, which is a party to any 
transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The term 
affiliate means a person controlling, controlled by or under common 
control with a specified person.

    Note: This section is rescinded effective on and after January 1, 
1973, except that it shall remain in effect: (1) For transactions 
submitted before that date for vote or consent of security holders; (2) 
for transactions formally submitted before such date for approval to any 
governmental regulatory agency, if such approval is required by law; and 
(3) for resales of securities received by persons in such transactions.

[6 FR 2052, Apr. 23, 1941]


<R05>
Sec. 230.144  Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not underwriters.

    Preliminary Note: Certain basic principles are essential to an 
understanding of the registration requirements in the Securities Act of 
1933 (the Act or the Securities Act) and the purposes underlying Rule 
144:
    1. If any person sells a non-exempt security to any other person, 
the sale must be registered unless an exemption can be found for the 
transaction.
    2. Section 4(1) of the Securities Act provides one such exemption 
for a transaction ``by a person other than an issuer, underwriter, or 
dealer.'' Therefore, an understanding of the term ``underwriter'' is 
important in determining whether or not the Section 4(1) exemption from 
registration is available for the sale of the securities.
    The term ``underwriter'' is broadly defined in Section 2(a)(11) of 
the Securities Act to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer 
with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the 
distribution of any security, or participates, or has a direct or 
indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a 
participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such 
undertaking. The interpretation of this definition traditionally has 
focused on the words ``with a view to'' in the phrase ``purchased from 
an issuer with a view to * * * distribution.'' An investment banking 
firm which arranges with an issuer for the public sale of its securities 
is clearly an ``underwriter'' under that section. However, individual 
investors who are not professionals in the securities business also may 
be ``underwriters'' if they act as links in a chain of transactions 
through which securities move from an issuer to the public.
    Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the purchaser 
at the time of an acquisition of securities, prior to and since the 
adoption of Rule 144, subsequent acts and

[[Page 549]]

circumstances have been considered to determine whether the purchaser 
took the securities ``with a view to distribution'' at the time of the 
acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on factors such as the length of 
time the person held the securities and whether there has been an 
unforeseeable change in circumstances of the holder. Experience has 
shown, however, that reliance upon such factors alone has led to 
uncertainty in the application of the registration provisions of the 
Act.
    The Commission adopted Rule 144 to establish specific criteria for 
determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution. Rule 144 
creates a safe harbor from the Section 2(a)(11) definition of 
``underwriter.'' A person satisfying the applicable conditions of the 
Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of 
the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities for 
purposes of Section 2(a)(11). Therefore, such a person is deemed not to 
be an underwriter when determining whether a sale is eligible for the 
Section 4(1) exemption for ``transactions by any person other than an 
issuer, underwriter, or dealer.'' If a sale of securities complies with 
all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144:
    1. Any affiliate or other person who sells restricted securities 
will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an 
underwriter for that transaction;
    2. Any person who sells restricted or other securities on behalf of 
an affiliate of the issuer will be deemed not to be engaged in a 
distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction; and
    3. The purchaser in such transaction will receive securities that 
are not restricted securities.
    Rule 144 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet 
all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144 still may claim any other 
available exemption under the Act for the sale of the securities. The 
Rule 144 safe harbor is not available to any person with respect to any 
transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with Rule 144, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration requirements of the Act.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for the 
purposes of this section.
    (1) An affiliate of an issuer is a person that directly, or 
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is 
controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.
    (2) The term person when used with reference to a person for whose 
account securities are to be sold in reliance upon this section

spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person;
    (ii) Any trust or estate in which such person or any of the persons 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section collectively own 10 
percent or more of the total beneficial interest or of which any of such

    (iii) Any corporation or other organization (other than the issuer) 
in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section are the beneficial owners collectively of 10 
percent or more of any class of equity securities or 10 percent or more 
of the equity interest.

    (i) Securities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or 
from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of 
transactions not involving any public offering;

Sec. 230.903 under Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 through Sec. 230.905, 
and Preliminary Notes);
    (vi) Securities acquired in a transaction made under Sec. 230.801

security holder of the class with respect to which the rights offering 
was made were, as of the record date for the rights offering, 
``restricted securities'' within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3);
    (vii) Securities acquired in a transaction made under Sec. 230.802 
to the same extent and proportion that the securities that were tendered 
or exchanged in

[[Page 550]]

the exchange offer or business combination were ``restricted 
securities'' within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3); and
    (viii) Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction subject 
to an exemption under section 4(6) (15 U.S.C. 77d(6)) of the Act.
    (4) The term debt securities means:
    (i) Any security other than an equity security as defined in Sec. 
230.405;
    (ii) Non-participatory preferred stock, which is defined as non-
convertible capital stock, the holders of which are entitled to a 
preference in payment of dividends and in distribution of assets on 
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the issuer, but are not 
entitled to participate in residual earnings or assets of the issuer; 
and
    (iii) Asset-backed securities, as defined in Sec. 229.1101 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Conditions to be met. Subject to paragraph (i) of this section, 
the following conditions must be met:
    (1) Non-affiliates. (i) If the issuer of the securities is, and has 
been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), any person who is 
not an affiliate of the issuer at the time of the sale, and has not been 
an affiliate during the preceding three months, who sells restricted 
securities of the issuer for his or her own account shall be deemed not 
to be an underwriter of those securities within the meaning of section 
2(a)(11) of the Act if all of the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(d) of this section are met. The requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section shall not apply to restricted securities sold for the 
account of a person who is not an affiliate of the issuer at the time of 
the sale and has not been an affiliate during the preceding three 
months, provided a period of one year has elapsed since the later of the 
date the securities were acquired from the issuer or from an affiliate 
of the issuer.
    (ii) If the issuer of the securities is not, or has not been for a 
period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, any 
person who is not an affiliate of the issuer at the time of the sale, 
and has not been an affiliate during the preceding three months, who 
sells restricted securities of the issuer for his or her own account 
shall be deemed not to be an underwriter of those securities within the 
meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Act if the condition of paragraph (d) 
of this section is met.
    (2) Affiliates or persons selling on behalf of affiliates. Any 
affiliate of the issuer, or any person who was an affiliate at any time 
during the 90 days immediately before the sale, who sells restricted 
securities, or any person who sells restricted or any other securities 
for the account of an affiliate of the issuer of such securities, or any 
person who sells restricted or any other securities for the account of a 
person who was an affiliate at any time during the 90 days immediately 
before the sale, shall be deemed not to be an underwriter of those 
securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Act if all of 
the conditions of this section are met.
    (c) Current public information. Adequate current public information 
with respect to the issuer of the securities must be available. Such 
information will be deemed to be available only if the applicable 
condition set forth in this paragraph is met:
    (1) Reporting issuers. The issuer is, and has been for a period of 
at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has filed 
all required reports under section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as 
applicable, during the 12 months preceding such sale (or for such 
shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports), other 
than Form 8-K reports (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter); or
    (2) Non-reporting issuers. If the issuer is not subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, there 
is publicly available the information concerning the issuer specified in 
paragraphs (a)(5)(i) to (xiv), inclusive, and paragraph (a)(5)(xvi) of 
Sec. 240.15c2-11 of this chapter, or, if the issuer is an insurance 
company, the information specified in section 12(g)(2)(G)(i) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l(g)(2)(G)(i)).


[[Page 551]]


    Note to Sec. 230.144(c). With respect to paragraph (c)(1), the 
person can rely upon:
    1. A statement in whichever is the most recent report, quarterly or 
annual, required to be filed and filed by the issuer that such issuer 
has filed all reports required under section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter 
period that the issuer was required to file such reports), other than 
Form 8-K reports (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), and has been subject 
to such filing requirements for the past 90 days; or
    2. A written statement from the issuer that it has complied with 
such reporting requirements.
    3. Neither type of statement may be relied upon, however, if the 
person knows or has reason to believe that the issuer has not complied 
with such requirements.

    (d) Holding period for restricted securities. If the securities sold 
are restricted securities, the following provisions apply:
    (1) General rule. (i) If the issuer of the securities is, and has 
been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act, a minimum of six months must elapse between the later of 
the date of the acquisition of the securities from the issuer, or from 
an affiliate of the issuer, and any resale of such securities in 
reliance on this section for the account of either the acquiror or any 
subsequent holder of those securities.
    (ii) If the issuer of the securities is not, or has not been for a 
period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, a 
minimum of one year must elapse between the later of the date of the 
acquisition of the securities from the issuer, or from an affiliate of 
the issuer, and any resale of such securities in reliance on this 
section for the account of either the acquiror or any subsequent holder 
of those securities.
    (iii) If the acquiror takes the securities by purchase, the holding 
period shall not begin until the full purchase price or other 
consideration is paid or given by the person acquiring the securities 
from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer.
    (2) Promissory notes, other obligations or installment contracts. 
Giving the issuer or affiliate of the issuer from whom the securities 
were purchased a promissory note or other obligation to pay the purchase 
price, or entering into an installment purchase contract with such 
seller, shall not be deemed full payment of the purchase price unless 
the promissory note, obligation or contract:
    (i) Provides for full recourse against the purchaser of the 
securities;
    (ii) Is secured by collateral, other than the securities purchased, 
having a fair market value at least equal to the purchase price of the 
securities purchased; and
    (iii) Shall have been discharged by payment in full prior to the 
sale of the securities.
    (3) Determination of holding period. The following provisions shall 
apply for the purpose of determining the period securities have been 
held:
    (i) Stock dividends, splits and recapitalizations. Securities 
acquired from the issuer as a dividend or pursuant to a stock split, 
reverse split or recapitalization shall be deemed to have been acquired 
at the same time as the securities on which the dividend or, if more 
than one, the initial dividend was paid, the securities involved in the 
split or reverse split, or the securities surrendered in connection with 
the recapitalization.
    (ii) Conversions and exchanges. If the securities sold were acquired 
from the issuer solely in exchange for other securities of the same 
issuer, the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been 
acquired at the same time as the securities surrendered for conversion 
or exchange, even if the securities surrendered were not convertible or 
exchangeable by their terms.

    Note to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(ii). If the surrendered securities 
originally did not provide for cashless conversion or exchange by their 
terms and the holder provided consideration, other than solely 
securities of the same issuer, in connection with the amendment of the 
surrendered securities to permit cashless conversion or exchange, then 
the newly acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at 
the same time as such amendment to the surrendered securities, so long 
as, in the conversion or exchange, the securities sold were acquired 
from the issuer solely in exchange for other securities of the same 
issuer.

[[Page 552]]

    (iii) Contingent issuance of securities. Securities acquired as a 
contingent payment of the purchase price of an equity interest in a 
business, or the assets of a business, sold to the issuer or an 
affiliate of the issuer shall be deemed to have been acquired at the 
time of such sale if the issuer or affiliate was then committed to issue 
the securities subject only to conditions other than the payment of 
further consideration for such securities. An agreement entered into in 
connection with any such purchase to remain in the employment of, or not 
to compete with, the issuer or affiliate or the rendering of services 
pursuant to such agreement shall not be deemed to be the payment of 
further consideration for such securities.
    (iv) Pledged securities. Securities which are bona-fide pledged by 
an affiliate of the issuer when sold by the pledgee, or by a purchaser, 
after a default in the obligation secured by the pledge, shall be deemed 
to have been acquired when they were acquired by the pledgor, except 
that if the securities were pledged without recourse they shall be 
deemed to have been acquired by the pledgee at the time of the pledge or 
by the purchaser at the time of purchase.
    (v) Gifts of securities. Securities acquired from an affiliate of 
the issuer by gift shall be deemed to have been acquired by the donee 
when they were acquired by the donor.
    (vi) Trusts. Where a trust settlor is an affiliate of the issuer, 
securities acquired from the settlor by the trust, or acquired from the 
trust by the beneficiaries thereof, shall be deemed to have been 
acquired when such securities were acquired by the settlor.
    (vii) Estates. Where a deceased person was an affiliate of the 
issuer, securities held by the estate of such person or acquired from 
such estate by the estate beneficiaries shall be deemed to have been 
acquired when they were acquired by the deceased person, except that no 
holding period is required if the estate is not an affiliate of the 
issuer or if the securities are sold by a beneficiary of the estate who 
is not such an affiliate.

    Note to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(vii). While there is no holding period 
or amount limitation for estates and estate beneficiaries which are not 
affiliates of the issuer, paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section apply 
to securities sold by such persons in reliance upon this section.

    (viii) Rule 145(a) transactions. The holding period for securities 
acquired in a transaction specified in Sec. 230.145(a) shall be deemed 
to commence on the date the securities were acquired by the purchaser in 
such transaction, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) 
and (ix) of this section.
    (ix) Holding company formations. Securities acquired from the issuer 
in a transaction effected solely for the purpose of forming a holding 
company shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the 
securities of the predecessor issuer exchanged in the holding company 
formation where:
    (A) The newly formed holding company's securities were issued solely 
in exchange for the securities of the predecessor company as part of a 
reorganization of the predecessor company into a holding company 
structure;
    (B) Holders received securities of the same class evidencing the 
same proportional interest in the holding company as they held in the 
predecessor, and the rights and interests of the holders of such 
securities are substantially the same as those they possessed as holders 
of the predecessor company's securities; and
    (C) Immediately following the transaction, the holding company has 
no significant assets other than securities of the predecessor company 
and its existing subsidiaries and has substantially the same assets and 
liabilities on a consolidated basis as the predecessor company had 
before the transaction.
    (x) Cashless exercise of options and warrants. If the securities 
sold were acquired from the issuer solely upon cashless exercise of 
options or warrants issued by the issuer, the newly acquired securities 
shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the exercised 
options or warrants, even if the options or warrants exercised 
originally did not provide for cashless exercise by their terms.

    Note 1 to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(x). If the options or warrants 
originally did not provide for cashless exercise by their terms and the 
holder provided consideration, other than

[[Page 553]]

solely securities of the same issuer, in connection with the amendment 
of the options or warrants to permit cashless exercise, then the newly 
acquired securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same 
time as such amendment to the options or warrants so long as the 
exercise itself was cashless.
    Note 2 to Sec. 230.144(d)(3)(x). If the options or warrants are not 
purchased for cash or property and do not create any investment risk to 
the holder, as in the case of employee stock options, the newly acquired 
securities shall be deemed to have been acquired at the time the options 
or warrants are exercised, so long as the full purchase price or other 
consideration for the newly acquired securities has been paid or given 
by the person acquiring the securities from the issuer or from an 
affiliate of the issuer at the time of exercise.

    (e) Limitation on amount of securities sold. Except as hereinafter 
provided, the amount of securities sold for the account of an affiliate 
of the issuer in reliance upon this section shall be determined as 
follows:
    (1) If any securities are sold for the account of an affiliate of 
the issuer, regardless of whether those securities are restricted, the 
amount of securities sold, together with all sales of securities of the 
same class sold for the account of such person within the preceding 
three months, shall not exceed the greatest of:
    (i) One percent of the shares or other units of the class 
outstanding as shown by the most recent report or statement published by 
the issuer, or
    (ii) The average weekly reported volume of trading in such 
securities on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through 
the automated quotation system of a registered securities association 
during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of notice required 
by paragraph (h), or if no such notice is required the date of receipt 
of the order to execute the transaction by the broker or the date of 
execution of the transaction directly with a market maker, or
    (iii) The average weekly volume of trading in such securities 
reported pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan or an 
effective national market system plan as those terms are defined in 
Sec. 242.600 of this chapter during the four-week period specified in 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) If the securities sold are debt securities, then the amount of 
debt securities sold for the account of an affiliate of the issuer, 
regardless of whether those securities are restricted, shall not exceed 
the greater of the limitation set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section or, together with all sales of securities of the same tranche 
(or class when the securities are non-participatory preferred stock) 
sold for the account of such person within the preceding three months, 
ten percent of the principal amount of the tranche (or class when the 
securities are non-participatory preferred stock) attributable to the 
securities sold.
    (3) Determination of amount. For the purpose of determining the 
amount of securities specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and, 
as applicable, paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the following 
provisions shall apply:
    (i) Where both convertible securities and securities of the class 
into which they are convertible are sold, the amount of convertible 
securities sold shall be deemed to be the amount of securities of the 
class into which they are convertible for the purpose of determining the 
aggregate amount of securities of both classes sold;
    (ii) The amount of securities sold for the account of a pledgee of 
those securities, or for the account of a purchaser of the pledged 
securities, during any period of three months within six months (or 
within one year if the issuer of the securities is not, or has not been 
for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to 
the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act) 
after a default in the obligation secured by the pledge, and the amount 
of securities sold during the same three-month period for the account of 
the pledgor shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable;

    Note to Sec. 230.144(e)(3)(ii). Sales by a pledgee of securities 
pledged by a borrower will not be aggregated under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) 
with sales of the securities of the same issuer by other pledgees of 
such borrower in the absence of concerted action by such pledgees.


[[Page 554]]


    (iii) The amount of securities sold for the account of a donee of 
those securities during any three-month period within six months (or 
within one year if the issuer of the securities is not, or has not been 
for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to 
the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act) 
after the donation, and the amount of securities sold during the same 
three-month period for the account of the donor, shall not exceed, in 
the aggregate, the amount specified in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this 
section, whichever is applicable;
    (iv) Where securities were acquired by a trust from the settlor of 
the trust, the amount of such securities sold for the account of the 
trust during any three-month period within six months (or within one 
year if the issuer of the securities is not, or has not been for a 
period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act) after 
the acquisition of the securities by the trust, and the amount of 
securities sold during the same three-month period for the account of 
the settlor, shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable;
    (v) The amount of securities sold for the account of the estate of a 
deceased person, or for the account of a beneficiary of such estate, 
during any three-month period and the amount of securities sold during 
the same three-month period for the account of the deceased person prior 
to his death shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable: 
Provided, that no limitation on amount shall apply if the estate or 
beneficiary of the estate is not an affiliate of the issuer;
    (vi) When two or more affiliates or other persons agree to act in 
concert for the purpose of selling securities of an issuer, all 
securities of the same class sold for the account of all such persons 
during any three-month period shall be aggregated for the purpose of 
determining the limitation on the amount of securities sold;
    (vii) The following sales of securities need not be included in 
determining the amount of securities to be sold in reliance upon this 
section:
    (A) Securities sold pursuant to an effective registration statement 
under the Act;
    (B) Securities sold pursuant to an exemption provided by Regulation 
A (Sec. 230.251 through Sec. 230.263) under the Act;
    (C) Securities sold in a transaction exempt pursuant to section 4 of 
the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d) and not involving any public offering; and
    (D) Securities sold offshore pursuant to Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 
through Sec. 230.905, and Preliminary Notes) under the Act.
    (f) Manner of sale. (1) The securities shall be sold in one of the 
following manners:
    (i) Brokers' transactions within the meaning of section 4(4) of the 
Act;
    (ii) Transactions directly with a market maker, as that term is 
defined in section 3(a)(38) of the Exchange Act; or
    (iii) Riskless principal transactions where:
    (A) The offsetting trades must be executed at the same price 
(exclusive of an explicitly disclosed markup or markdown, commission 
equivalent, or other fee);
    (B) The transaction is permitted to be reported as riskless under 
the rules of a self-regulatory organization; and
    (C) The requirements of paragraphs (g)(2)(applicable to any markup 
or markdown, commission equivalent, or other fee), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of 
this section are met.

    Note to Sec. 230.144(f)(1): For purposes of this paragraph, a 
riskless principal transaction means a principal transaction where, 
after having received from a customer an order to buy, a broker or 
dealer purchases the security as principal in the market to satisfy the 
order to buy or, after having received from a customer an order to sell, 
sells the security as principal to the market to satisfy the order to 
sell.

    (2) The person selling the securities shall not:
    (i) Solicit or arrange for the solicitation of orders to buy the 
securities in anticipation of or in connection with such transaction, or

[[Page 555]]

    (ii) Make any payment in connection with the offer or sale of the 
securities to any person other than the broker or dealer who executes 
the order to sell the securities.
    (3) Paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply to:
    (i) Securities sold for the account of the estate of a deceased 
person or for the account of a beneficiary of such estate provided the 
estate or estate beneficiary is not an affiliate of the issuer; or
    (ii) Debt securities.
    (g) Brokers' transactions. The term brokers' transactions in section 
4(4) of the Act shall for the purposes of this rule be deemed to include 
transactions by a broker in which such broker:
    (1) Does no more than execute the order or orders to sell the 
securities as agent for the person for whose account the securities are 
sold;
    (2) Receives no more than the usual and customary broker's 
commission;
    (3) Neither solicits nor arranges for the solicitation of customers' 
orders to buy the securities in anticipation of or in connection with 
the transaction; Provided, that the foregoing shall not preclude:
    (i) Inquiries by the broker of other brokers or dealers who have 
indicated an interest in the securities within the preceding 60 days;
    (ii) Inquiries by the broker of his customers who have indicated an 
unsolicited bona fide interest in the securities within the preceding 10 
business days;
    (iii) The publication by the broker of bid and ask quotations for 
the security in an inter-dealer quotation system provided that such 
quotations are incident to the maintenance of a bona fide inter-dealer 
market for the security for the broker's own account and that the broker 
has published bona fide bid and ask quotations for the security in an 
inter-dealer quotation system on each of at least twelve days within the 
preceding thirty calendar days with no more than four business days in 
succession without such two-way quotations; or
    (iv) The publication by the broker of bid and ask quotations for the 
security in an alternative trading system, as defined in Sec. 242.300 
of this chapter, provided that the broker has published bona fide bid 
and ask quotations for the security in the alternative trading system on 
each of the last twelve business days; and

    Note to Sec. 230.144(g)(3)(ii). The broker should obtain and retain 
in his files written evidence of indications of bona fide unsolicited 
interest by his customers in the securities at the time such indications 
are received.

    (4) After reasonable inquiry is not aware of circumstances 
indicating that the person for whose account the securities are sold is 
an underwriter with respect to the securities or that the transaction is 
a part of a distribution of securities of the issuer. Without limiting 
the foregoing, the broker shall be deemed to be aware of any facts or 
statements contained in the notice required by paragraph (h) of this 
section.

    Notes: (i) The broker, for his own protection, should obtain and 
retain in his files a copy of the notice required by paragraph (h) of 
this section.
    (ii) The reasonable inquiry required by paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section should include, but not necessarily be limited to, inquiry as to 
the following matters:
    (a) The length of time the securities have been held by the person 
for whose account they are to be sold. If practicable, the inquiry 
should include physical inspection of the securities;
    (b) The nature of the transaction in which the securities were 
acquired by such person;
    (c) The amount of securities of the same class sold during the past 
3 months by all persons whose sales are required to be taken into 
consideration pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;
    (d) Whether such person intends to sell additional securities of the 
same class through any other means;
    (e) Whether such person has solicited or made any arrangement for 
the solicitation of buy orders in connection with the proposed sale of 
securities;
    (f) Whether such person has made any payment to any other person in 
connection with the proposed sale of the securities; and
    (g) The number of shares or other units of the class outstanding, or 
the relevant trading volume.

    (h) Notice of proposed sale. (1) If the amount of securities to be 
sold in reliance upon this rule during any period of three months 
exceeds 5,000 shares or other units or has an aggregate sale price in 
excess of $50,000, three copies of a notice on Form 144 (Sec. 239.144 
of this

[[Page 556]]

chapter) shall be filed with the Commission. If such securities are 
admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, one copy of 
such notice also shall be transmitted to the principal exchange on which 
such securities are admitted.
    (2) The Form 144 shall be signed by the person for whose account the 
securities are to be sold and shall be transmitted for filing 
concurrently with either the placing with a broker of an order to 
execute a sale of securities in reliance upon this rule or the execution 
directly with a market maker of such a sale. Neither the filing of such 
notice nor the failure of the Commission to comment on such notice shall 
be deemed to preclude the Commission from taking any action that it 
deems necessary or appropriate with respect to the sale of the 
securities referred to in such notice. The person filing the notice 
required by this paragraph shall have a bona fide intention to sell the 
securities referred to in the notice within a reasonable time after the 
filing of such notice.
    (i) Unavailability to securities of issuers with no or nominal 
operations and no or nominal non-cash assets. (1) This section is not 
available for the resale of securities initially issued by an issuer 
defined below:
    (i) An issuer, other than a business combination related shell 
company, as defined in Sec. 230.405, or an asset-backed issuer, as 
defined in Item 1101(b) of Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1101(b) of this 
chapter), that has:
    (A) No or nominal operations; and
    (B) Either:
    (1) No or nominal assets;
    (2) Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or
    (3) Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and 
nominal other assets; or
    (ii) An issuer that has been at any time previously an issuer 
described in paragraph (i)(1)(i).
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1), if the issuer of the 
securities previously had been an issuer described in paragraph 
(i)(1)(i) but has ceased to be an issuer described in paragraph 
(i)(1)(i); is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act; has filed all reports and other materials 
required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as 
applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period 
that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other 
than Form 8-K reports (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter); and has filed 
current ``Form 10 information'' with the Commission reflecting its 
status as an entity that is no longer an issuer described in paragraph 
(i)(1)(i), then those securities may be sold subject to the requirements 
of this section after one year has elapsed from the date that the issuer 
filed ``Form 10 information'' with the Commission.
    (3) The term ``Form 10 information'' means the information that is 
required by Form 10 or Form 20-F (Sec. 249.210 or Sec. 249.220f of 
this chapter), as applicable to the issuer of the securities, to 
register under the Exchange Act each class of securities being sold 
under this rule. The issuer may provide the Form 10 information in any 
filing of the issuer with the Commission. The Form 10 information is 
deemed filed when the initial filing is made with the Commission.

    b. Submitted electronically and posted on its corporate Web site, if 
any, every Interactive Data File (Sec. 232.11 of this chapter) required 
to be submitted and posted pursuant to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 
232.405 of this chapter), during the preceding 12 months (or for such 
shorter period that the issuer was required to submit and post such 
files); or
    2. A written statement from the issuer that it has complied with 
such reporting, submission or posting requirements.
    3. Neither type of statement may be relied upon, however, if the 
person knows or has reason to believe that the issuer has not complied 
with such requirements.

Sec. 230.144A  Private resales of securities to institutions.

    Preliminary Notes: 1. This section relates solely to the application 
of section 5 of the Act and not to antifraud or other provisions of the 
federal securities laws.
    2. Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an 
exclusive election; any seller hereunder may also claim the availability 
of any other applicable exemption from the registration requirements of 
the Act.
    3. In view of the objective of this section and the policies 
underlying the Act, this section is not available with respect to any 
transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with this section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under 
the Act is required.
    4. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any issuer or any 
other person to comply with the securities registration or broker-dealer 
registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
Exchange Act), whenever such requirements are applicable.
    5. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any person to 
comply with any applicable state law relating to the offer or sale of 
securities.
    6. Securities acquired in a transaction made pursuant to the 
provisions of this section are deemed to be restricted securities within 
the meaning of Sec. 230.144(a)(3) of this chapter.
    7. The fact that purchasers of securities from the issuer thereof 
may purchase such securities with a view to reselling such securities 
pursuant to this section will not affect the availability to such issuer 
of an exemption under section 4(2) of the Act, or Regulation D under the 
Act, from the registration requirements of the Act.

    (a) Definitions. (1) For purposes of this section, qualified 
institutional buyer shall mean:

registered under section 8 of the Investment Company Act nor required to 
be so registered, shall be deemed to be a purchase for the account of 
such insurance company.

Act or any business development company as defined in section 2(a)(48)

be deemed to be owned by such dealer;
    (iii) Any dealer registered pursuant to section 15 of the Exchange 
Act acting in a riskless principal transaction on behalf of a qualified

discretionary basis by an entity shall be the cost of such securities, 
except where the entity reports its securities holdings in its financial 
statements on the basis of their market value, and no current 
information with respect to the cost of those securities has been 
published. In the latter event, the securities may be valued at market 
for purposes of this section.
    (4) In determining the aggregate amount of securities owned by an 
entity and invested on a discretionary basis, securities owned by 
subsidiaries of the entity that are consolidated with the entity in its 
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles may be included if the investments of such 
subsidiaries are managed under the direction of the entity, except that, 
unless the entity is a reporting company under section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act, securities owned by such subsidiaries may not be 
included if the entity itself is a majority-owned subsidiary that would 
be included in the consolidated financial statements of another 
enterprise.
    (5) For purposes of this section, riskless principal transaction 
means a transaction in which a dealer buys a security from any person 
and makes a simultaneous offsetting sale of such security to a qualified 
institutional buyer, including another dealer acting as riskless 
principal for a qualified institutional buyer.
    (6) For purposes of this section, effective conversion premium means 
the amount, expressed as a percentage of the security's conversion 
value, by which the price at issuance of a convertible security exceeds 
its conversion value.

    (b) Sales by persons other than issuers or dealers. Any person, 
other than the issuer or a dealer, who offers or sells securities in 
compliance with the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section shall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such 
securities and therefore not to be an underwriter of such securities 
within the meaning of sections 2(11) and 4(1) of the Act.
    (c) Sales by dealers. Any dealer who offers or sells securities in 
compliance with the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section shall be deemed not to be a participant in a distribution of 
such securities within the meaning of section 4(3)(C) of the Act and not 
to be an underwriter of such securities within the meaning of section 
2(11) of the Act, and such securities shall be deemed not to have been 
offered to the public within the meaning of section 4(3)(A) of the Act.
    (d) Conditions to be met. To qualify for exemption under this 
section, an offer or sale must meet the following conditions:
    (1) The securities are offered or sold only to a qualified 
institutional buyer or to an offeree or purchaser that the seller and 
any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe is a 
qualified institutional buyer. In determining whether a prospective 
purchaser is a qualified institutional buyer, the seller and any person 
acting on its behalf shall be entitled to rely upon the following non-
exclusive methods of establishing the prospective purchaser's ownership 
and discretionary investments of securities:
    (i) The prospective purchaser's most recent publicly available 
financial statements, Provided That such statements present the 
information as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of 
securities under this section in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 
18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser;
    (ii) The most recent publicly available information appearing in 
documents filed by the prospective purchaser with the Commission or 
another United States federal, state, or local governmental agency or 
self-regulatory organization, or with a foreign

[[Page 560]]

governmental agency or self-regulatory organization, Provided That any 
such information is as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of 
sale of securities under this section in the case of a U.S. purchaser 
and within 18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign 
purchaser;
    (iii) The most recent publicly available information appearing in a 
recognized securities manual, Provided That such information is as of a 
date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of securities under 
this section in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 18 months 
preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or
    (iv) A certification by the chief financial officer, a person 
fulfilling an equivalent function, or other executive officer of the 
purchaser, specifying the amount of securities owned and invested on a 
discretionary basis by the purchaser as of a specific date on or since 
the close of the purchaser's most recent fiscal year, or, in the case of 
a purchaser that is a member of a family of investment companies, a 
certification by an executive officer of the investment adviser 
specifying the amount of securities owned by the family of investment 
companies as of a specific date on or since the close of the purchaser's 
most recent fiscal year;
    (2) The seller and any person acting on its behalf takes reasonable 
steps to ensure that the purchaser is aware that the seller may rely on 
the exemption from the provisions of section 5 of the Act provided by 
this section;
    (3) The securities offered or sold:
    (i) Were not, when issued, of the same class as securities listed on 
a national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the 
Exchange Act or quoted in a U.S. automated inter-dealer quotation 
system; Provided, That securities that are convertible or exchangeable 
into securities so listed or quoted at the time of issuance and that had 
an effective conversion premium of less than 10 percent, shall be 
treated as securities of the class into which they are convertible or 
exchangeable; and that warrants that may be exercised for securities so 
listed or quoted at the time of issuance, for a period of less than 3 
years from the date of issuance, or that had an effective exercise 
premium of less than 10 percent, shall be treated as securities of the 
class to be issued upon exercise; and Provided further, That the 
Commission may from time to time, taking into account then-existing 
market practices, designate additional securities and classes of 
securities that will not be deemed of the same class as securities 
listed on a national securities exchange or quoted in a U.S. automated 
inter-dealer quotation system; and
    (ii) Are not securities of an open-end investment company, unit 
investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or is 
required to be registered under section 8 of the Investment Company Act; 
and
    (4)(i) In the case of securities of an issuer that is neither 
subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor exempt from 
reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) (Sec. 240.12g3-2(b) of this 
chapter) under the Exchange Act, nor a foreign government as defined in 
Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405 of this chapter) eligible to register securities 
under Schedule B of the Act, the holder and a prospective purchaser 
designated by the holder have the right to obtain from the issuer, upon 
request of the holder, and the prospective purchaser has received from 
the issuer, the seller, or a person acting on either of their behalf, at 
or prior to the time of sale, upon such prospective purchaser's request 
to the holder or the issuer, the following information (which shall be 
reasonably current in relation to the date of resale under this 
section): a very brief statement of the nature of the business of the 
issuer and the products and services it offers; and the issuer's most 
recent balance sheet and profit and loss and retained earnings 
statements, and similar financial statements for such part of the two 
preceding fiscal years as the issuer has been in operation (the 
financial statements should be audited to the extent reasonably 
available).
    (ii) The requirement that the information be reasonably current will 
be presumed to be satisfied if:
    (A) The balance sheet is as of a date less than 16 months before the 
date of resale, the statements of profit and loss and retained earnings 
are for the 12 months preceding the date of such balance sheet, and if 
such balance

[[Page 561]]

sheet is not as of a date less than 6 months before the date of resale, 
it shall be accompanied by additional statements of profit and loss and 
retained earnings for the period from the date of such balance sheet to 
a date less than 6 months before the date of resale; and
    (B) The statement of the nature of the issuer's business and its 
products and services offered is as of a date within 12 months prior to 
the date of resale; or
    (C) With regard to foreign private issuers, the required information 
meets the timing requirements of the issuer's home country or principal 
trading markets.
    (e) Offers and sales of securities pursuant to this section shall be 
deemed not to affect the availability of any exemption or safe harbor 
relating to any previous or subsequent offer or sale of such securities 
by the issuer or any prior or subsequent holder thereof.

Sec. 230.145  Reclassification of securities, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions of assets.

    Preliminary Note: Rule 145 (Sec. 230.145 of this chapter) is 
designed to make available the protection provided by registration under 
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Act), to persons who are offered 
securities in a business combination of the type described in paragraphs 
(a) (1), (2) and (3) of the rule. The thrust of the rule is that an 
offer, offer to sell, offer for sale, or sale occurs when there is 
submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such 
holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a 
new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security 
in exchange for their existing security. Rule 145 embodies the 
Commission's determination that such transactions are subject to the 
registration requirements of the Act, and that the previously existing 
no-sale theory of Rule 133 is no longer consistent with the statutory 
purposes of the Act. See Release No. 33-5316 (October 6, 1972) [37 FR 
23631]. Securities issued in transactions described in paragraph (a) of 
Rule 145 may be registered on Form S-4 or F-4 (Sec. 239.25 or Sec. 
239.34 of this chapter) or Form N-14 (Sec. 239.23 of this chapter) 
under the Act.

    Transactions for which statutory exemptions under the Act, including 
those contained in sections 3(a)(9), (10), (11) and 4(2), are otherwise 
available are not affected by Rule 145.

    Note 1: Reference is made to Rule 153a (Sec. 230.153a of this 
chapter) describing the prospectus delivery required in a transaction of 
the type referred to in Rule 145.
    Note 2: A reclassification of securities covered by Rule 145 would 
be exempt from registration pursuant to section 3(a)(9) or (11) of the 
Act if the conditions of either of these sections are satisfied.

    (a) Transactions within this section. An offer, offer to sell, offer 
for sale, or sale shall be deemed to be involved, within the meaning of 
section 2(3) of the Act, so far as the security holders of a corporation 
or other person are concerned where, pursuant to statutory provisions of 
the jurisdiction under which such corporation or other person is 
organized, or pursuant to provisions contained in its certificate of 
incorporation or similar controlling instruments, or otherwise, there is 
submitted for the vote or consent of such security holders a plan or 
agreement for:
    (1) Reclassifications. A reclassification of securities of such 
corporation or other person, other than a stock split, reverse stock 
split, or change in par value, which involves the substitution of a 
security for another security;
    (2) Mergers of consolidations. A statutory merger or consolidation 
or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation 
or other person held by such security holders will become or be 
exchanged for securities of any person, unless the sole purpose of the 
transaction is to change an issuer's domicile solely within the United 
States; or
    (3) Transfers of assets. A transfer of assets of such corporation or 
other person, to another person in consideration of the issuance of 
securities of such other person or any of its affiliates, if:
    (i) Such plan or agreement provides for dissolution of the 
corporation or other person whose security holders are voting or 
consenting; or
    (ii) Such plan or agreement provides for a pro rata or similar 
distribution of such securities to the security holders voting or 
consenting; or
    (iii) The board of directors or similar representatives of such 
corporation or other person, adopts resolutions relative to paragraph 
(a)(3) (i) or (ii) of

[[Page 562]]

this section within 1 year after the taking of such vote or consent; or
    (iv) The transfer of assets is a part of a preexisting plan for 
distribution of such securities, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) (i), 
(ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (b) Communications before a Registration Statement is filed. 
Communications made in connection with or relating to a transaction 
described in paragraph (a) of this section that will be registered under 
the Act may be made under Sec. 230.135, Sec. 230.165 or Sec. 230.166.
    (c) Persons and parties deemed to be underwriters. For purposes of 
this section, if any party to a transaction specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section is a shell company, other than a business combination 
related shell company, as those terms are defined in Sec. 230.405, any 
party to that transaction, other than the issuer, or any person who is 
an affiliate of such party at the time such transaction is submitted for 
vote or consent, who publicly offers or sells securities of the issuer 
acquired in connection with any such transaction, shall be deemed to be 
engaged in a distribution and therefore to be an underwriter thereof 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Act.
    (d) Resale provisions for persons and parties deemed underwriters. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), a person or party 
specified in that paragraph shall not be deemed to be engaged in a 
distribution and therefore not to be an underwriter of securities 
acquired in a transaction specified in paragraph (a) that was registered 
under the Act if:
    (1) The issuer has met the requirements applicable to an issuer of 
securities in paragraph (i)(2) of Sec. 230.144; and
    (2) One of the following three conditions is met:
    (i) Such securities are sold by such person or party in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of Sec. 
230.144 and at least 90 days have elapsed since the date the securities 
were acquired from the issuer in such transaction; or
    (ii) Such person or party is not, and has not been for at least 
three months, an affiliate of the issuer, and at least six months, as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 230.144, have 
elapsed since the date the securities were acquired from the issuer in 
such transaction, and the issuer meets the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of Sec. 230.144; or
    (iii) Such person or party is not, and has not been for at least 
three months, an affiliate of the issuer, and at least one year, as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 230.144, has 
elapsed since the date the securities were acquired from the issuer in 
such transaction.

    Note to Sec. 230.145(c) and (d): Paragraph (d) is not available 
with respect to any transaction or series of transactions that, although 
in technical compliance with the rule, is part of a plan or scheme to 
evade the registration requirements of the Act.

    (e) Definitions. (1) The term affiliate as used in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section shall have the same meaning as the definition of 
that term in Sec. 230.144.
    (2) The term party as used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section 
shall mean the corporations, business entities, or other persons, other 
than the issuer, whose assets or capital structure are affected by the 
transactions specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) The term person as used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, when used in reference to a person for whose account securities 
are to be sold, shall have the same meaning as the definition of that 
term in paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 230.144.

Sec. 230.146  Rules under section 18 of the Act.

    (a) Prepared by or on behalf of the issuer. An offering document (as 
defined in Section 18(d)(1) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 77r(d)(1)]) is 
``prepared by or on behalf of the issuer'' for purposes of Section 18 of 
the Act, if the issuer or an agent or representative:
    (1) Authorizes the document's production, and
    (2) Approves the document before its use.
    (b) Covered securities for purposes of Section 18. (1) For purposes 
of Section

[[Page 563]]

18(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77r), the Commission finds that the 
following national securities exchanges, or segments or tiers thereof, 
have listing standards that are substantially similar to those of the 
New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), the American Stock Exchange 
(``Amex''), or the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market 
(``Nasdaq/NGM''), and that securities listed, or authorized for listing, 
on such exchanges shall be deemed covered securities:
    (i) Tier I of the NYSE Arca, Inc.;
    (ii) Tier I of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.;
    (iii) The Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated;
    (iv) Options listed on the International Securities Exchange, LLC; 
and
    (v) The Nasdaq Capital Market.
    (2) The designation of securities in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through 
(v) of this section as covered securities is conditioned on such 
exchanges' listing standards (or segments or tiers thereof) continuing 
to be substantially similar to those of the NYSE, Amex, or Nasdaq/NGM.
    (c)T Temporary definition of eligible contract participant as 
qualified purchaser. For purposes of Section 18(b)(3) of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 77r(b)(3)), the term ``qualified purchaser'' shall mean any 
eligible contract participant (as defined in Section 1a(12) of the 
Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a(12)) as in effect on the date of 
adoption of this section, other than a person who is an eligible 
contract participant under Section 1(a)(12)(C) of the Commodity Exchange 
Act) that has been sold an eligible credit default swap (as defined in 
Rule 239T of this Act) in reliance on Rule 239T of this Act. This 
temporary rule will expire on September 25, 2009.

    Effective Date Note: At 74 FR 3974, Jan. 22, 2009, Sec. 230.146 was

<R05>
Sec. 230.147  ``Part of an issue'', ``person resident'', and ``doing business within'' for purposes of section 3(a)(11).

    Preliminary Notes: 1. This rule shall not raise any presumption that 
the exemption provided by section 3(a)(11) of the Act is not available 
for transactions by an issuer which do not satisfy all of the provisions 
of the rule.
    2. Nothing in this rule obviates the need for compliance with any 
state law relating to the offer and sale of the securities.
    3. Section 5 of the Act requires that all securities offered by the 
use of the mails or by any means or instruments of transportation or 
communication in interstate commerce be registered with the Commission. 
Congress, however, provided certain exemptions in the Act from such 
registration provisions where there was no practical need for 
registration or where the benefits of registration were too remote. 
Among those exemptions is that provided by section 3(a)(11) of the Act 
for transactions in any security which is a part of an issue offered and 
sold only to persons resident within a single State or Territory, where 
the issuer of such security is a person resident and doing business 
within * * * such State or Territory. The legislative history of that 
Section suggests that the exemption was intended to apply only to issues 
genuinely local in character, which in reality represent local financing 
by local industries, carried out through local investment. Rule 147 is 
intended to provide more objective standards upon which responsible 
local businessmen intending to raise capital from local sources may rely 
in claiming the section 3(a)(11) exemption.
    All of the terms and conditions of the rule must be satisfied in 
order for the rule to be available. These are: (i) That the issuer be a 
resident of and doing business within the state or territory in which 
all offers and sales are made; and (ii) that no part of the issue be 
offered or sold to non-residents within the period of time specified in 
the rule. For purposes of the rule the definition of issuer in section 
2(4) of the Act shall apply.
    All offers, offers to sell, offers for sale, and sales which are 
part of the same issue must meet all of the conditions of Rule 147 for 
the rule to be available. The determination whether offers, offers to 
sell, offers for sale and sales of securities are part of the same issue 
(i.e., are deemed to be integrated) will continue to be a question of 
fact and will depend on the particular circumstances. See Securities Act 
of 1933 Release No. 4434 (December 6, 1961) (26 FR 9158). Securities Act 
Release No. 4434 indicated that in determining whether offers and sales 
should be regarded as part of the same issue and thus should be 
integrated any one or more of the following factors may be 
determinative:

[[Page 564]]

    (i) Are the offerings part of a single plan of financing;
    (ii) Do the offerings involve issuance of the same class of 
securities;
    (iii) Are the offerings made at or about the same time;
    (iv) Is the same type of consideration to be received; and
    (v) Are the offerings made for the same general purpose.
    Subparagraph (b)(2) of the rule, however, is designed to provide 
certainty to the extent feasible by identifying certain types of offers 
and sales of securities which will be deemed not part of an issue, for 
purposes of the rule only.
    Persons claiming the availability of the rule have the burden of 
proving that they have satisfied all of its provisions. However, the 
rule does not establish exclusive standards for complying with the 
section 3(a)(11) exemption. The exemption would also be available if the 
issuer satisfied the standards set forth in relevant administrative and 
judicial interpretations at the time of the offering but the issuer 
would have the burden of proving the availability of the exemption. Rule 
147 relates to transactions exempted from the registration requirements 
of section 5 of the Act by section 3(a)(11). Neither the rule nor 
section 3(a)(11) provides an exemption from the registration 
requirements of section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the civil 
liability provisions of section 12(2) of the Act or other provisions of 
the federal securities laws.
    Finally, in view of the objectives of the rule and the purposes and 
policies underlying the Act, the rule shall not be available to any 
person with respect to any offering which, although in technical 
compliance with the rule, is part of a plan or scheme by such person to 
make interstate offers or sales of securities. In such cases 
registration pursuant to the Act is required.
    4. The rule provides an exemption for offers and sales by the issuer 
only. It is not available for offers or sales of securities by other 
persons. Section 3(a)(11) of the Act has been interpreted to permit 
offers and sales by persons controlling the issuer, if the exemption 
provided by that section would have been available to the issuer at the 
time of the offering. See Securities Act Release No. 4434. Controlling 
persons who want to offer or sell securities pursuant to section 
3(a)(11) may continue to do so in accordance with applicable judicial 
and administrative interpretations.

    (a) Transactions covered. Offers, offers to sell, offers for sale 
and sales by an issuer of its securities made in accordance with all of 
the terms and conditions of this rule shall be deemed to be part of an 
issue offered and sold only to persons resident within a single state or 
territory where the issuer is a person resident and doing business 
within such state or territory, within the meaning of section 3(a)(11) 
of the Act.
    (b) Part of an issue. (1) For purposes of this rule, all securities 
of the issuer which are part of an issue shall be offered, offered for 
sale or sold in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this 
rule.
    (2) For purposes of this rule only, an issue shall be deemed not to 
include offers, offers to sell, offers for sale or sales of securities 
of the issuer pursuant to the exemption provided by section 3 or section 
4(2) of the Act or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the 
Act, that take place prior to the six month period immediately preceding 
or after the six month period immediately following any offers, offers 
for sale or sales pursuant to this rule, Provided, That, there are 
during either of said six month periods no offers, offers for sale or 
sales of securities by or for the issuer of the same or similar class as 
those offered, offered for sale or sold pursuant to the rule.

    Note: In the event that securities of the same or similar class as 
those offered pursuant to the rule are offered, offered for sale or sold 
less than six months prior to or subsequent to any offer, offer for sale 
or sale pursuant to this rule, see Preliminary Note 3 hereof as to which 
offers, offers to sell, offers for sale, or sales are part of an issue.

    (c) Nature of the issuer. The issuer of the securities shall at the 
time of any offers and the sales be a person resident and doing business 
within the state or territory in which all of the offers, offers to 
sell, offers for sale and sales are made.
    (1) The issuer shall be deemed to be a resident of the state or 
territory in which:
    (i) It is incorporated or organized, if a corporation, limited 
partnership, trust or other form of business organization that is 
organized under state or territorial law;
    (ii) Its principal office is located, if a general partnership or 
other form of business organization that is not organized under any 
state or territorial law;
    (iii) His principal residence is located if an individual.

[[Page 565]]

    (2) The issuer shall be deemed to be doing business within a state 
or territory if:
    (i) The issuer derived at least 80 percent of its gross revenues and 
those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
    (A) For its most recent fiscal year, if the first offer of any part 
of the issue is made during the first six months of the issuer's current 
fiscal year; or
    (B) For the first six months of its current fiscal year or during 
the twelve-month fiscal period ending with such six-month period, if the 
first offer of any part of the issue is made during the last six months 
of the issuer's current fiscal year from the operation of a business or 
of real property located in or from the rendering of services within 
such state or territory; provided, however, that this provision does not 
apply to any issuer which has not had gross revenues in excess of $5,000 
from the sale of products or services or other conduct of its business 
for its most recent twelve-month fiscal period;
    (ii) The issuer had at the end of its most recent semi-annual fiscal 
period prior to the first offer of any part of the issue, at least 80 
percent of its assets and those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated 
basis located within such state or territory;
    (iii) The issuer intends to use and uses at least 80 percent of the 
net proceeds to the issuer from sales made pursuant to this rule in 
connection with the operation of a business or of real property, the 
purchase of real property located in, or the rendering of services 
within such state or territory; and
    (iv) The principal office of the issuer is located within such state 
or territory.
    (d) Offerees and purchasers: Person resident. Offers, offers to 
sell, offers for sale and sales of securities that are part of an issue 
shall be made only to persons resident within the state or territory of 
which the issuer is a resident. For purposes of determining the 
residence of offerees and purchasers:
    (1) A corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business 
organization shall be deemed to be a resident of a state or territory 
if, at the time of the offer and sale to it, it has its principal office 
within such state or territory.
    (2) An individual shall be deemed to be a resident of a state or 
territory if such individual has, at the time of the offer and sale to 
him, his principal residence in the state or territory.
    (3) A corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business 
organization which is organized for the specific purpose of acquiring 
part of an issue offered pursuant to this rule shall be deemed not to be 
a resident of a state or territory unless all of the beneficial owners 
of such organization are residents of such state or territory.
    (e) Limitation of resales. During the period in which securities 
that are part of an issue are being offered and sold by the issuer, and 
for a period of nine months from the date of the last sale by the issuer 
of such securities, all resales of any part of the issue, by any person, 
shall be made only to persons resident within such state or territory.

    Notes: 1. In the case of convertible securities resales of either 
the convertible security, or if it is converted, the underlying 
security, could be made during the period described in paragraph (e) 
only to persons resident within such state or territory. For purposes of 
this rule a conversion in reliance on section 3(a)(9) of the Act does 
not begin a new period.
    2. Dealers must satisfy the requirements of Rule 15c2-11 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prior to publishing any quotation for a 
security, or submitting any quotation for publication, in any quotation 
medium.

    (f) Precautions against interstate offers and sales. (1) The issuer 
shall, in connection with any securities sold by it pursuant to this 
rule:
    (i) Place a legend on the certificate or other document evidencing 
the security stating that the securities have not been registered under 
the Act and setting forth the limitations on resale contained in 
paragraph (e) of this section;
    (ii) Issue stop transfer instructions to the issuer's transfer 
agent, if any, with respect to the securities, or, if the issuer 
transfers its own securities make a notation in the appropriate records 
of the issuer; and
    (iii) Obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his 
residence.
    (2) The issuer shall, in connection with the issuance of new 
certificates for any of the securities that are part

[[Page 566]]

of the same issue that are presented for transfer during the time period 
specified in paragraph (e), take the steps required by paragraphs (f)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (3) The issuer shall, in connection with any offers, offers to sell, 
offers for sale or sales by it pursuant to this rule, disclose, in 
writing, the limitations on resale contained in paragraph (e) and the 
provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) and paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section.

    (a) Any annuity contract or optional annuity contract (a contract) 
shall be deemed to be within the provisions of section 3(a)(8) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(8)), Provided, That
    (1) The annuity or optional annuity contract is issued by a 
corporation (the insurer) subject to the supervision of the insurance 
commissioner, bank commissioner, or any agency or officer performing 
like functions, of any State or Territory of the United States or the 
District of Columbia;
    (2) The insurer assumes the investment risk under the contract as 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (3) The contract is not marketed primarily as an investment.
    (b) The insurer shall be deemed to assume the investment risk under 
the contract if:
    (1) The value of the contract does not vary according to the 
investment experience of a separate account;
    (2) The insurer for the life of the contract
    (i) Guarantees the principal amount of purchase payments and 
interest credited thereto, less any deduction (without regard to its

(b)(2)(ii) of this section, means a rate of interest under the contract 
that is at least equal to the minimum rate required to be credited by 
the relevant nonforfeiture law in the jurisdiction in which the contract 
is issued. If that jurisdiction does not have any applicable 
nonforfeiture law at the time the contract is issued (or if the minimum 
rate applicable to

[[Page 567]]

an existing contract is no longer mandated in that jurisdiction), the 
specified rate under the contract must at least be equal to the minimum 
rate then required for individual annuity contracts by the NAIC Standard 
Nonforfeiture Law.

<R05>
Sec. 230.151A  Certain contracts not ``annuity contracts'' or ``optional annuity contracts'' under section 3(a)(8).

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a 
contract that is issued by a corporation subject to the supervision of 
the insurance commissioner, bank commissioner, or any agency or officer 
performing like functions, of any State or Territory of the United 
States or the District of Columbia, and that is subject to regulation 
under the insurance laws of that jurisdiction as an annuity is not an 
``annuity contract'' or ``optional annuity contract'' under Section 
3(a)(8) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(8)) if:
    (1) The contract specifies that amounts payable by the issuer under 
the contract are calculated at or after the end of one or more specified 
crediting periods, in whole or in part, by reference to the performance 
during the crediting period or periods of a security, including a group 
or index of securities; and
    (2) Amounts payable by the issuer under the contract are more likely

Sec. 230.154  Delivery of prospectuses to investors at the same address.

    (a) Delivery of a single prospectus. If you must deliver a 
prospectus under the federal securities laws, for purposes of sections 
5(b) and 2(a)(10) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b) and 77b(a)(10)) or Sec. 
240.15c2-8(b) of this chapter, you will be considered to have delivered 
a prospectus to investors who share an address if:
    (1) You deliver a prospectus to the shared address;
    (2) You address the prospectus to the investors as a group (for 
example, ``ABC Fund [or Corporation] Shareholders,'' ``Jane Doe and 
Household,'' ``The Smith Family'') or to each of the investors 
individually (for example, ``John Doe and Richard Jones''); and
    (3) The investors consent in writing to delivery of one prospectus.
    (b) Implied consent. You do not need to obtain written consent from 
an investor under paragraph (a)(3) of this section if all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) The investor has the same last name as the other investors, or 
you reasonably believe that the investors are members of the same 
family;
    (2) You have sent the investor a notice at least 60 days before you 
begin to rely on this section concerning delivery of prospectuses to 
that investor. The notice must be a separate written statement and:
    (i) State that only one prospectus will be delivered to the shared 
address unless you receive contrary instructions;
    (ii) Include a toll-free telephone number or be accompanied by a 
reply form that is pre-addressed with postage provided, that the 
investor can use to notify you that he or she wishes to receive a 
separate prospectus;
    (iii) State the duration of the consent;
    (iv) Explain how an investor can revoke consent;
    (v) State that you will begin sending individual copies to an 
investor within 30 days after you receive revocation of the investor's 
consent; and
    (vi) Contain the following prominent statement, or similar clear and 
understandable statement, in bold-face type: ``Important Notice 
Regarding Delivery of Shareholder Documents.'' This statement also must 
appear on the envelope in which the notice is delivered. Alternatively, 
if the notice is delivered separately from other communications to 
investors, this statement may appear either on the notice or on the 
envelope in which the notice is delivered;

    Note to paragraph (b)(2): The notice should be written in plain 
English. See Sec. 230.421(d)(2) of this chapter for a discussion of 
plain English principles.

    (3) You have not received the reply form or other notification 
indicating that the investor wishes to continue to receive an individual 
copy of the prospectus, within 60 days after you sent the notice; and
    (4) You deliver the prospectus to a post office box or to a 
residential street address. You can assume a street address is a 
residence unless you have information that indicates it is a business.
    (c) Revocation of consent. If an investor, orally or in writing, 
revokes consent to delivery of one prospectus to a shared address 
(provided under paragraphs (a)(3) or (b) of this section), you

[[Page 570]]

must begin sending individual copies to that investor within 30 days 
after you receive the revocation. If the individual's consent concerns 
delivery of the prospectus of a registered open-end management 
investment company, at least once a year you must explain to investors 
who have consented how they can revoke their consent. The explanation 
must be reasonably designed to reach these investors.
    (d) Definition of address. For purposes of this section, address 
means a street address, a post office box number, an electronic mail 
address, a facsimile telephone number, or other similar destination to 
which paper or electronic documents are delivered, unless otherwise 
provided in this section. If you have reason to believe that an address 
is the street address of a multi-unit building, the address must include 
the unit number.

Sec. 230.155  Integration of abandoned offerings.

    Preliminary Note: Compliance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section provides a non-exclusive safe harbor from integration of private

Sec. 230.156  Investment company sales literature.

    (a) Under the federal securities laws, including section 17(a) of 
the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q(a)) and section 10(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j(b)) and Rule 10b-5 
thereunder (17 CFR part 240), it is unlawful for any person, directly or 
indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate 
commerce or of the mails, to use sales literature which is materially 
misleading in connection with the offer or sale of securities issued by 
an investment company. Under these provisions, sales literature is 
materially misleading if it: (1) Contains an untrue statement of a 
material fact or (2) omits to state a material fact necessary in order 
to make a statement made, in the light of the circumstances of its use, 
not misleading.
    (b) Whether or not a particular description, representation, 
illustration, or other statement involving a material fact is misleading 
depends on evaluation of the context in which it is made. In considering 
whether a particular statement involving a material fact is or might be 
misleading, weight should be given to all pertinent factors, including, 
but not limited to, those listed below.
    (1) A Statement could be misleading because of:
    (i) Other statements being made in connection with the offer of sale 
or sale of the securities in question;
    (ii) The absence of explanations, qualifications, limitations or 
other statements necessary or appropriate to make such statement not 
misleading; or
    (iii) General economic or financial conditions or circumstances.
    (2) Representations about past or future investment performance 
could be misleading because of statements or omissions made involving a 
material fact, including situations where:
    (i) Portrayals of past income, gain, or growth of assets convey an 
impression of the net investment results achieved by an actual or 
hypothetical investment which would not be justified under the 
circumstances, including portrayals that omit explanations, 
qualifications, limitations, or other statements necessary or 
appropriate to make the portrayals not misleading; and
    (ii) Representations, whether express or implied, about future 
investment performance, including:
    (A) Representations, as to security of capital, possible future 
gains or income, or expenses associated with an investment;
    (B) Representations implying that future gain or income may be 
inferred from or predicted based on past investment performance; or
    (C) Portrayals of past performance, made in a manner which would 
imply that gains or income realized in the past would be repeated in the 
future.
    (3) A statement involving a material fact about the characteristics 
or attributes of an investment company could be misleading because of:
    (i) Statements about possible benefits connected with or resulting 
from services to be provided or methods of operation which do not give 
equal prominence to discussion of any risks or limitations associated 
therewith;
    (ii) Exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about management skill or 
techniques, characteristics of the investment company or an investment 
in securities issued by such company, services, security of investment 
or funds, effects of government supervision, or other attributes; and
    (iii) Unwarranted or incompletely explained comparisons to other 
investment vehicles or to indexes.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the term sales literature shall be 
deemed to include any communication (whether in writing, by radio, or by 
television) used by any person to offer to sell or induce the sale of 
securities of any investment company. Communications

[[Page 572]]

between issuers, underwriters and dealers are included in this 
definition of sales literature if such communications, or the 
information contained therein, can be reasonably expected to be 
communicated to prospective investors in the offer or sale of securities 
or are designed to be employed in either written or oral form in the 
offer or sale of securities.

    (1) There is included the information required for statements of 
income contained either:
    (i) In Item 8 of Form 10-K (Sec. 239.310 of this chapter), part I, 
Item 1 of Form 10-Q (Sec. 240.308a of this chapter), or Rule 14a-3(b) 
(Sec. 240.14a-3(b) of this chapter) under the Securities Exchange Act

chapter); or
    (ii) On Form 20-F, Form 40-F or Form 6-K (Sec. 249.306 of this

A subsidiary issuing debt securities guaranteed by its parent will be 
deemed to have met the requirements of this paragraph if the parent's 
income statements satisfy the criteria of this paragraph and information 
respecting the subsidiary is included to the same extent as was 
presented in the registration statement. An ``earning statement'' not 
meeting the requirements of this paragraph may otherwise be sufficient 
for purposes of the last paragraph of section 11(a).

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    (2) Has filed its report or reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB,

or has supplied to the Commission copies of the annual report sent to 
security holders pursuant to Rule 14a-3(c), (Sec. 240.14a-3(c) of this

``generally available to its security holders'' for purposes of the last 
paragraph of section 11(a).

only, the effective date of the registration statement is deemed to be 
the date of the latest to occur of:
    (1) The effective date of the registration statement;
    (2) The effective date of the last post-effective amendment to the

of this section next preceding a particular sale of the issuer's 
registered securities to the public; or
    (4) As to the issuer and any underwriter at that time only, the most 
recent effective date of the registration statement for purposes of 
liability under section 11 of the Act of the issuer and any such 
underwriter only at the time of or next preceding a particular sale of 
the issuer's registered securities to the public determined pursuant to 
Rule 430B (Sec. 230.430B).
    (d) If an earnings statement was made available by ``other methods'' 
than those specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
earnings statement must be filed as exhibit 99 to the next periodic 
report required by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act covering the

240.14d-1 through 14d-11 of this chapter; or

would be required if the exchange offer were subject to the requirements 
of Sec. 240.13e-4 or Sec. Sec. 240.14d-1 through 14d-11 of this

    Preliminary Note to Sec. 230.163. Attempted compliance with this 
section does not act as an exclusive election and the issuer also may 
claim the availability of any other applicable exemption or exclusion. 
Reliance on this section does not affect the availability of any other 
exemption or exclusion from the requirements of section 5 of the Act.

    (a) In an offering by or on behalf of a well-known seasoned issuer, 
as defined in Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405), that will be or is at the time 
intended to be registered under the Act, an offer by or on behalf of 
such issuer is exempt from the prohibitions in section 5(c) of the Act 
on offers to sell, offers for sale, or offers to buy its securities 
before a registration statement has been filed, provided that:
    (1) Any written communication that is an offer made in reliance on 
this exemption will be a free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 
and a prospectus under section 2(a)(10) of the Act relating to a public 
offering of securities to be covered by the registration statement to be 
filed; and

[[Page 576]]

    (2) The exemption from section 5(c) of the Act provided in this 
section for such written communication that is an offer shall be 
conditioned on satisfying the conditions in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Conditions--(1) Legend. (i) Every written communication that is 
an offer made in reliance on this exemption shall contain substantially 
the following legend:

    The issuer may file a registration statement (including a 
prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication 
relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that 
registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the 
SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. 
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web 
site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the company will arrange to send you 
the prospectus after filing if you request it by calling toll-free 1-
8[xx-xxx-xxxx].

    (ii) The legend also may provide an e-mail address at which the 
documents can be requested and may indicate that the documents also are 
available by accessing the issuer's Web site, and provide the Internet 
address and the particular location of the documents on the Web site.
    (iii) An immaterial or unintentional failure to include the 
specified legend in a free writing prospectus required by this section 
will not result in a violation of section 5(c) of the Act or the loss of 
the ability to rely on this section so long as:
    (A) A good faith and reasonable effort was made to comply with the 
specified legend condition;
    (B) The free writing prospectus is amended to include the specified 
legend as soon as practicable after discovery of the omitted or 
incorrect legend; and
    (C) If the free writing prospectus has been transmitted without the 
specified legend, the free writing prospectus is retransmitted with the 
legend by substantially the same means as, and directed to substantially 
the same prospective purchasers to whom, the free writing prospectus was 
originally transmitted.
    (2) Filing condition. (i) Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, every written communication that is an offer made in reliance 
on this exemption shall be filed by the issuer with the Commission 
promptly upon the filing of the registration statement, if one is filed, 
or an amendment, if one is filed, covering the securities that have been 
offered in reliance on this exemption.
    (ii) The condition that an issuer shall file a free writing 
prospectus with the Commission under this section shall not apply in 
respect of any communication that has previously been filed with, or 
furnished to, the Commission or that the issuer would not be required to 
file with the Commission pursuant to the conditions of Rule 433 (Sec. 
230.433) if the communication was a free writing prospectus used after 
the filing of the registration statement. The condition that the issuer 
shall file a free writing prospectus with the Commission under this 
section shall be satisfied if the issuer satisfies the filing conditions 
(other than timing of filing which is provided in this section) that 
would apply under Rule 433 if the communication was a free writing 
prospectus used after the filing of the registration statement.
    (iii) An immaterial or unintentional failure to file or delay in 
filing a free writing prospectus to the extent provided in this section 
will not result in a violation of section 5(c) of the Act or the loss of 
the ability to rely on this section so long as:
    (A) A good faith and reasonable effort was made to comply with the 
filing condition; and
    (B) The free writing prospectus is filed as soon as practicable 
after discovery of the failure to file.

    Preliminary Notes to Sec. 230.164. 
    1. This section is not available for any communication that, 
although in technical compliance with this section, is part of a plan or 
scheme to evade the requirements of section 5 of the Act.
    2. Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an 
exclusive election and the person relying on this section also may claim 
the availability of any other applicable exemption or exclusion. 
Reliance on this section does not affect the availability of any other 
exemption or exclusion from the requirements of section 5 of the Act.

    (a) In connection with a registered offering of an issuer meeting

in Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405), of the issuer or any other offering

forth in Rule 433 (Sec. 230.433) are satisfied.
    (b) An immaterial or unintentional failure to file or delay in 
filing a free writing prospectus as necessary to satisfy the filing 
conditions contained in Rule 433 will not result in a violation of

unintentional failure to retain a free writing prospectus as necessary 
to satisfy the record retention condition contained in Rule 433 will not 
result in a violation of section 5(b)(1) of the Act or the loss of the

the Commission's web site and describe which documents are available 
free from the offeror; and
    (2) In an exchange offer, the offer must be made in accordance with 
the applicable tender offer rules (Sec. Sec. 240.14d-1 through 240.14e-

    (1) A good faith and reasonable effort was made to comply with the 
filing requirement; and

of the failure to file.

offer to buy the securities offered for purposes of section 5(c) of the 
Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(c)), so long as the participants take all reasonable 
steps within their control to prevent further distribution or

Sec. 230.170  Prohibition of use of certain financial statements.

    Financial statements which purport to give effect to the receipt and 
application of any part of the proceeds from the sale of securities for 
cash shall not be used unless such securities are to be offered through 
underwriters and the underwriting arrangements are such that the 
underwriters are or will be committed to take and pay for all of the 
securities, if any are taken, prior to or within a reasonable time after 
the commencement of the public offering, or if the securities are not so 
taken to refund to all subscribers the full amount of all subscription 
payments made for the securities. The caption of any such financial 
statement shall clearly set forth the assumptions upon which such 
statement is based. The caption shall be in type at least as large as

information relating to the subject matter of such document is 
nevertheless included in material filed with the Commission pursuant to 
a determination of an appropriate department or agency of the United 
States that disclosure of such information would not be contrary to the 
interests of national defense or foreign policy, a statement from such 
department or agency to that effect shall be submitted for the 
information of the Commission. A registrant may rely upon any such 
statement in filing or omitting any document or information to which the 
statement relates.
    (c) The Commission may protect any information in its possession 
which may require classification in the interests of national defense or 
foreign policy pending determination by an appropriate department or

or information referred to in paragraph (a) of this section to the

Sec. 230.174  Delivery of prospectus by dealers; exemptions under section 4(3) of the Act.

    The obligations of a dealer (including an underwriter no longer 
acting as an underwriter in respect of the security involved in such 
transactions) to deliver a prospectus in transactions in a security as 
to which a registration statement has been filed taking place prior to 
the expiration of the 40- or 90-day period specified in section 4(3) of 
the Act after the effective date of such registration statement or prior 
to the expiration of such period after the first date upon which the 
security was bona fide offered to the public by the issuer or by or 
through an underwriter after such effective date, whichever is later, 
shall be subject to the following provisions:
    (a) No prospectus need be delivered if the registration statement is 
on Form F-6 (Sec. 239.36 of this chapter).
    (b) No prospectus need be delivered if the issuer is subject, 
immediately prior to the time of filing the registration statement, to 
the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934.

[[Page 586]]

    (c) Where a registration statement relates to offerings to be made 
from time to time no prospectus need be delivered after the expiration 
of the initial prospectus delivery period specified in section 4(3) of 
the Act following the first bona fide offering of securities under such 
registration statement.
    (d) If (1) the registration statement relates to the security of an 
issuer that is not subject, immediately prior to the time of filing the 
registration statement, to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (2) as of the offering 
date, the security is listed on a registered national securities 
exchange or authorized for inclusion in an electronic inter-dealer 
quotation system sponsored and governed by the rules of a registered 
securities association, no prospectus need be delivered after the 
expiration of twenty-five calendar days after the offering date. For 
purposes of this provision, the term offering date refers to the later 
of the effective date of the registration statement or the first date on 
which the security was bona fide offered to the public.
    (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the period during which a 
prospectus must be delivered by a dealer shall be:
    (1) As specified in section 4(3) of the Act if the registration 
statement was the subject of a stop order issued under section 8 of the 
Act; or
    (2) As the Commission may provide upon application or on its own 
motion in a particular case.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall affect the obligation to deliver a 
prospectus pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of the Act by a 
dealer who is acting as an underwriter with respect to the securities 
involved or who is engaged in a transaction as to securities 
constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or 
subscription by such dealer as a participant in the distribution of such 
securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.
    (g) If the registration statement relates to an offering of 
securities of a ``blank check company,'' as defined in Rule 419 under 
the Act (17 CFR 230.419), the statutory period for prospectus delivery 
specified in section 4(3) of the Act shall not terminate until 90 days 
after the date funds and securities are released from the escrow or 
trust account pursuant to Rule 419 under the Act.
    (h) Any obligation pursuant to Section 4(3) of the Act and this 
section to deliver a prospectus, other than pursuant to paragraph (g) of 
this section, may be satisfied by compliance with the provisions of Rule 
172 (Sec. 230.172).

Sec. 230.190  Registration of underlying securities in asset-backed securities transactions.

    (a) In an offering of asset-backed securities where the asset pool 
includes securities of another issuer (``underlying securities''), 
unless the underlying securities are themselves exempt from registration 
under section 3 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77c), the offering of the relevant 
underlying securities itself must be registered as a primary offering of 
such securities in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section unless 
all of the following are true. Terms used in this section have the same 
meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1101 of this 
chapter).
    (1) Neither the issuer of the underlying securities nor any of its 
affiliates has a direct or indirect agreement, arrangement, relationship 
or understanding, written or otherwise, relating to the underlying 
securities and the asset-backed securities transaction;
    (2) Neither the issuer of the underlying securities nor any of its 
affiliates is an affiliate of the sponsor, depositor, issuing entity or 
underwriter of the asset-backed securities transaction;
    (3) If the underlying securities are restricted securities, as 
defined in Sec. 230.144(a)(3), Sec. 230.144 must be available for the 
sale of the securities, provided however, that notwithstanding any other 
provision of Sec. 230.144, Sec. 230.144 shall only be so available if 
at least two years have elapsed since the later of the date the 
securities were acquired from the issuer of the underlying securities or 
from an affiliate of the issuer of the underlying securities; and
    (4) The depositor would be free to publicly resell the underlying 
securities without registration under the Act. For example, the offering 
of the asset-backed security does not constitute part of a distribution 
of the underlying securities. An offering of asset-backed securities 
with an asset pool containing underlying securities that at the time of 
the purchase for the asset pool are part of a subscription or unsold 
allotment would be a distribution of the underlying securities. For 
purposes of this section, in an offering of asset-backed securities 
involving a sponsor, depositor or underwriter that was an underwriter or 
an affiliate of an underwriter in a registered offering of the 
underlying securities, the distribution of the asset-backed securities 
will not constitute part of a distribution of the underlying securities

participated in the registered offering of the underlying securities.
    (b) If all of the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section are 
not met, the offering of the relevant underlying securities itself must 
be registered as a primary offering of such securities in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) If the offering of asset-backed securities is registered on Form 
S-3 (Sec. 239.13 of this chapter), the offering of the underlying 
securities itself must be eligible to be registered under Form S-3 or F-
3 (Sec. 239.33 of this chapter) as a primary offering of such 
securities;

offering of the underlying securities contemplates this type of

describes the plan of distribution for both the underlying securities 
and the asset-backed securities;

the prospectus for the offering of the underlying securities will be 
delivered along with, or is combined with, the prospectus for the 
offering of the asset-backed securities;
    (5) The prospectus for the asset-backed securities offering 
identifies the issuing entity, depositor, sponsor and each underwriter

issuing entity, sponsor, depositor, trustee or any

[[Page 590]]

underwriter for information regarding the underlying securities; and
    (7) If the offering of the asset-backed securities and the 
underlying securities is not made on a firm commitment basis, the 
issuing entity or the underwriters for the offering of the asset-backed 
securities must distribute a preliminary prospectus for both the 
underlying securities offering and the asset-backed securities offering 
that identifies the issuer of the underlying securities and the expected 
amount of the issuer's underlying securities that is to be included in 
the asset pool to any person who is expected to receive a confirmation 
of sale of the asset-backed securities at least 48 hours prior to 
sending such confirmation.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the 
asset pool for the asset-backed securities includes a pool asset 
representing an interest in or the right to the payments or cash flows 
of another asset pool, then that pool asset is not considered an 
``underlying security'' for purposes of this section (although its 
distribution in connection with the asset-backed securities transaction 
may need to be separately registered) if the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) Both the issuing entity for the asset-backed securities and the 
entity issuing the pool asset were established under the direction of 
the same sponsor and depositor;
    (2) The pool asset is created solely to satisfy legal requirements 
or otherwise facilitate the structuring of the asset-backed securities 
transaction;
    (3) The pool asset is not part of a scheme to avoid registration or 
the requirements of this section; and
    (4) The pool asset is held by the issuing entity and is a part of 
the asset pool for the asset-backed securities.

    A public offer or sale of securities that meets the following terms

Canada, or any State, Province, Territory or possession thereof, or the 
District of Columbia, with its principal place of business in the United 
States or Canada;

Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) immediately

    (3) Is not a development stage company that either has no specific 
business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to 
merge with an unidentified company or companies;
    (4) Is not an investment company registered or required to be 
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et 
seq.);
    (5) Is not issuing fractional undivided interests in oil or gas

mineral rights; and
    (6) Is not disqualified because of Sec. 230.262.
    (b) Aggregate offering price. The sum of all cash and other 
consideration to be received for the securities (``aggregate offering 
price'') shall not exceed $5,000,000, including no more than $1,500,000 
offered by all selling security holders, less the aggregate offering

from continuing operations in at least one of its last two fiscal years.

    Note: Where a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration is to be 
received, the aggregate offering price shall be based on the price at 
which the securities are offered for cash. Any portion of the aggregate 
offering price attributable to cash received in a foreign currency shall 
be translated into United States currency at a currency exchange rate in 
effect on or at a reasonable time prior to the date of the sale of the 
securities. If securities are not offered for cash, the aggregate 
offering price shall be based on the value of the consideration as 
established by bona fide sales of that consideration made within a 
reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair value as 
determined by an accepted standard. Valuations of non-cash consideration 
must be reasonable at the time made.

reliance on this Regulation A will not be integrated with:
    (1) Prior offers or sales of securities; or

    (v) Made more than six months after the completion of the Regulation 
A offering.

    Note: If the issuer offers or sells securities for which the safe 
harbor rules are unavailable, such offers and sales still may not be 
integrated with the Regulation A offering, depending on the particular 
facts and circumstances. See Securities Act Release No. 4552 (November 
6, 1962) [27 FR 11316].

THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION DOES NOT PASS UPON 
THE MERITS OF OR GIVE ITS APPROVAL TO ANY SECURITIES OFFERED OR THE 
TERMS OF THE OFFERING, NOR DOES IT PASS UPON THE ACCURACY OR 
COMPLETENESS OF ANY OFFERING CIRCULAR OR OTHER SELLING LITERATURE. THESE 
SECURITIES ARE OFFERED PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION WITH 
THE COMMISSION; HOWEVER, THE COMMISSION HAS NOT MADE AN INDEPENDENT 
DETERMINATION THAT THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREUNDER ARE EXEMPT FROM 
REGISTRATION.

    (e) Revisions. (1) An offering circular shall be revised during the

to include, among other things, updated financial statements, 12 months

Sec. 230.254  Solicitation of interest document for use prior to an offering statement.

    (a) An issuer may publish or deliver to prospective purchasers a 
written document or make scripted radio or television broadcasts to 
determine whether there is any interest in a contemplated securities 
offering. Following submission of the written document or script of the 
broadcast to the Commission, as required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, oral communications with prospective investors and other 
broadcasts are permitted. The written documents, broadcasts and oral 
communications are each subject to the antifraud provisions of the 
federal securities laws. No solicitation or acceptance of money or other 
consideration, nor of any commitment, binding or otherwise, from any 
prospective investor is permitted. No sale may be made until 
qualification of the offering statement.
    (b) While not a condition to any exemption pursuant to this section:
    (1) On or before the date of its first use, the issuer shall submit 
a copy of any written document or the script of any broadcast with the 
Commission's main office in Washington, DC. (Attention: Office of Small 
Business Review).The document or broadcast script shall either contain 
or be accompanied by the name and telephone number of a person able to 
answer questions about the document or the broadcast.

    Note: Only solicitation of interest material that contains 
substantive changes from or additions to previously submitted material 
needs to be submitted.

    (2) The written document or script of the broadcast shall:
    (i) State that no money or other consideration is being solicited, 
and if sent in response, will not be accepted;
    (ii) State that no sales of the securities will be made or 
commitment to purchase accepted until delivery of an offering circular 
that includes complete information about the issuer and the offering;
    (iii) State that an indication of interest made by a prospective 
investor involves no obligation or commitment of any kind; and
    (iv) Identify the chief executive officer of the issuer and briefly 
and in general its business and products.
    (3) Solicitations of interest pursuant to this provision may not be 
made after the filing of an offering statement.
    (4) Sales may not be made until 20 calendar days after the last 
publication or delivery of the document or radio or television 
broadcast.
    (c) Any written document under this section may include a coupon, 
returnable to the issuer indicating interest in a potential offering, 
revealing the name, address and telephone number of the prospective 
investor.

[[Page 597]]

    (d) Where an issuer has a bona fide change of intention and decides 
to register an offering after using the process permitted by this 
section without having filed the offering statement prescribed by Sec. 
230.252, the Regulation A exemption for offers made in reliance upon 
this section will not be subject to integration with the registered 
offering, if at least 30 calendar days have elapsed between the last 
solicitation of interest and the filing of the registration statement 
with the Commission, and all solicitation of interest documents have 
been submitted to the Commission. With respect to integration with other 
offerings, see Sec. 230.251(c).
    (e) Written solicitation of interest materials submitted to the 
Commission and otherwise in compliance with this section shall not be 
deemed to be a prospectus as defined in section 2(10) of the Securities 
Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(10)).

Sec. 230.255  Preliminary Offering Circulars.

    (a) Prior to qualification of the required offering statement, but 
after its filing, a written offer of securities may be made if it meets 
the following requirements:
    (1) The outside front cover page of the material bears the caption 
``Preliminary Offering Circular,'' the date of issuance, and the 
following statement, which shall run along the left hand margin of the 
page and be printed perpendicular to the text, in boldfaced type at 
least as large as that used generally in the body of such offering 
circular:

An offering statement pursuant to Regulation A relating to these 
securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Information contained in this Preliminary Offering Circular is 
subject to completion or amendment. These securities may not be sold nor 
may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time an offering circular 
which is not designated as a Preliminary Offering Circular is delivered 
and the offering statement filed with the Commission becomes qualified. 
This Preliminary Offering Circular shall not constitute an offer to sell 
or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sales of 
these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale 
would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
of any such state.

    (2) The Preliminary Offering Circular contains substantially the 
information required in an offering circular by Form 1-A (Sec. 239.90 
of this chapter), except that information with respect to offering 
price, underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or commissions 
to dealers, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, or other 
matters dependent upon the offering price may be omitted. The outside 
front cover page of the Preliminary Offering Circular shall include a 
bona fide estimate of the range of the maximum offering price and 
maximum number of shares or other units of securities to be offered or a 
bona fide estimate of the principal amount of debt securities to be 
offered.
    (3) The material is filed as a part of the offering statement.
    (b) If a Preliminary Offering Circular is inaccurate or inadequate 
in any material respect, a revised Preliminary Offering Circular or a 
complete Offering Circular shall be furnished to all persons to whom 
securities are to be sold at least 48 hours prior to the mailing of any 
confirmation of sale to such persons, or shall be sent to such persons 
under such circumstances that it would normally be received by them 48 
hours prior to receipt of confirmation of the sale.

Sec. 230.256  Filing of sales material.

    While not a condition to an exemption pursuant to this provision, 
seven copies of any advertisement or written communication, or the 
script of any radio or television broadcast, shall be filed with the 
main office of the Commission in Washington, DC.

    Note: Only sales material that contains substantive changes from or 
additions from previously filed material needs to be filed.

<R05>
Sec. 230.257  Reports of sales and use of proceeds.

    While not a condition to an exemption pursuant to this provision, 
the issuer and/or each selling security holder shall file seven copies 
of a report concerning sales and use of proceeds on Form 2-A (Sec. 
239.91 of this chapter), or other prescribed form with the main office 
of the Commission in Washington, DC. This report shall be filed at the 
following times:
    (a) Every six months after the qualification of the offering 
statement or any amendment until substantially all the proceeds have 
been applied; and
    (b) within 30 calendar days after the termination, completion or 
final sale of securities in the offering, or the application of the 
proceeds from the offering, whichever is the latest event. This report 
should be labelled the final report. For purposes of this section, the 
temporary investment of proceeds pending final application shall not 
constitute application of the proceeds.

[57 FR 36468, Aug. 13, 1992, as amended at 61 FR 67202, Dec. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 230.258  Suspension of the exemption.

    (a) The Commission may at any time enter an order temporarily 
suspending a Regulation A exemption if it has reason to believe that:
    (1) No exemption is available or any of the terms, conditions or 
requirements of the Regulation have not been complied with, including 
failures to provide the Commission a copy of the document or broadcast 
script under Sec. 230.254, to file any sales material as required by 
Sec. 230.256 or report as required by Sec. 230.257;
    (2) The offering statement, any sales or solicitation of interest 
material contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to 
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in 
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
    (3) The offering is being made or would be made in violation of 
section 17 of the Securities Act;
    (4) An event has occurred after the filing of the offering statement 
which would have rendered the exemption hereunder unavailable if it had 
occurred prior to such filing;
    (5) Any person specified in paragraph (a) of Sec. 230.262 has been 
indicted for any crime or offense of the character specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of 230.262, or any proceeding has been initiated for 
the purpose of enjoining any such person from engaging in or continuing 
any conduct or practice of the character specified in paragraph (a)(4) 
of Sec. 230.262;
    (6) Any person specified in paragraph (b) of Sec. 230.262 has been 
indicted for any crime or offense of the character specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 230.262, or any proceeding has been initiated 
for the purpose of enjoining any such person from engaging in or 
continuing any conduct or practice of the character specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 230.262; or
    (7) The issuer or any promoter, officer, director or underwriter has 
failed to cooperate, or has obstructed or refused to permit the making 
of an investigation by the Commission in connection with any offering 
made or proposed to be made in reliance on Regulation A.
    (b) Upon the entry of an order under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Commission will promptly give notice to the issuer, any underwriter 
and any selling security holder:
    (1) That such order has been entered, together with a brief 
statement of the reasons for the entry of the order; and
    (2) That the Commission, upon receipt of a written request within 30 
calendar days after the entry of the order, will within 20 calendar days 
after receiving the request, order a hearing at a place to be designated 
by the Commission.
    (c) If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the 
Commission, an order entered under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
become permanent on the 30th calendar day after its entry and shall 
remain in effect unless or until it is modified or vacated by the 
Commission. Where a hearing is requested or is ordered by the 
Commission, the Commission will, after notice of and opportunity for 
such hearing, either vacate the order or enter an order permanently 
suspending the exemption.

[[Page 599]]

    (d) The Commission may, at any time after notice of and opportunity 
for hearing, enter an order permanently suspending the exemption for any 
reason upon which it could have entered a temporary suspension order 
under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such order shall remain in 
effect until vacated by the Commission.
    (e) All notices required by this section shall be given by personal 
service, registered or certified mail to the addresses given by the 
issuer, any underwriter and any selling security holder in the offering 
statement.


<R05>
Sec. 230.259  Withdrawal or abandonment of offering statements.

    (a) If none of the securities which are the subject of an offering 
statement have been sold and such offering statement is not the subject 
of a proceeding under Sec. 230.258, the offering statement may be 
withdrawn with the Commission's consent. The application for withdrawal 
shall state the reason the offering statement is to be withdrawn, shall 
be signed by an authorized representative of the issuer and shall be 
provided to the main office of the Commission in Washington, DC.
    (b) When an offering statement has been on file with the Commission 
for nine months without amendment and has not become qualified, the 
Commission may, in its discretion, proceed in the following manner to 
determine whether such offering statement has been abandoned by the 
issuer. If the offering statement has been amended, the 9-month period 
shall be computed from the date of the latest amendment.
    (1) Notice will be sent to the issuer, and to any counsel for the 
issuer named in the offering statement, by registered or certified mail, 
return receipt requested, addressed to the most recent addresses for the 
issuer and issuer's counsel as reflected in the offering statement. Such 
notice will inform the issuer and issuer's counsel that the offering 
statement or amendments thereto is out of date and must be either 
amended to comply with applicable requirements of Regulation A or be 
withdrawn within 30 calendar days after the notice.
    (2) If the issuer or issuer's counsel fail to respond to such notice 
by filing a substantive amendment or withdrawing the offering statement 
or does not furnish a satisfactory explanation as to why the issuer has 
not done so within 30 calendar days, the Commission may declare the 
offering statement abandoned.

<R05>
Sec. 230.260  Insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation A.

    (a) A failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement of 
Regulation A will not result in the loss of the exemption from the 
requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act for any offer or sale to 
a particular individual or entity, if the person relying on the 
exemption establishes:
    (1) The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or 
requirement directly intended to protect that particular individual or 
entity;
    (2) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the 
offering as a whole, provided that any failure to comply with paragraphs 
(a), (b), (d) (1) and (3) Of Sec. 230.251 shall be deemed to be 
significant to the offering as a whole; and
    (3) A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all 
applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Regulation A.
    (b) A transaction made in reliance upon Regulation A shall comply 
with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of the 
regulation. Where an exemption is established only through reliance upon 
paragraph (a) of this section, the failure to comply shall nonetheless 
be actionable by the Commission under section 20 of the Act.
    (c) This provision provides no relief or protection from a 
proceeding under Sec. 230.258.


<R05>
Sec. 230.261  Definitions.

    As used in this Regulation A, all terms have the same meanings as in 
Sec. 230.405, except that all references to ``registrant'' in those 
definitions shall refer to the issuer of the securities to be offered 
and sold under Regulation A. In addition, these terms have the following 
meanings:

[[Page 600]]

offer or sale of securities, if:
    (a) The issuer, any of its predecessors or any affiliated issuer:
    (1) Has filed a registration statement which is the subject of any

who was in control of the affiliated entity at the time of such entry

making of a false filing with the Commission, or arising out of the 
conduct of the business of an underwriter, broker, dealer, municipal 
securities dealer, or investment adviser;

<R05>
Sec. 230.401  Requirements as to proper form.

    (a) The form and contents of a registration statement and prospectus 
shall conform to the applicable rules and forms as in effect on the 
initial filing date of such registration statement and prospectus.
    (b) If an amendment to a registration statement and prospectus is 
filed for the purpose of meeting the requirements of section 10(a)(3) of 
the Act or pursuant to the provisions of section 24(e) or 24(f) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, the form and contents of such an 
amendment shall conform to the applicable rules and forms as in effect 
on the filing date of such amendment.
    (c) An amendment to a registration statement and prospectus, other 
than an amendment described in paragraph (b) of this section, may be 
filed on any shorter Securities Act registration form for which it is 
eligible on the filing date of the amendment. At the issuer's option, 
the amendment also may be filed on the same Securities Act registration 
form used for the most recent amendment described in paragraph (b) of 
this section or, if no such amendment has been filed, the initial 
registration statement and prospectus.
    (d) The form and contents of a prospectus forming part of a 
registration statement which is the subject of a stop order entered 
under section 8(d) of the Act, if used after the date such stop order 
ceases to be effective, shall conform to the applicable rules and forms 
as in effect on the date such stop order ceases to be effective.
    (e) A prospectus filed as part of an amendment to an effective 
registration statement, or other amendment to such registration 
statement, on any form may be prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of any other form which would then be appropriate for the 
registration of securities to which the prospectus or other amendment 
relates, provided that all of the other requirements of such other form 
and applicable rules (including any required undertakings) are met.
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a registrant (1) 
shall comply with the rules and forms as in effect at a date different 
from those specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section 
if the rules or forms or amendments thereto specifically so provide; and 
(2) may comply voluntarily with the rules and forms as in effect at 
dates subsequent to those specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) 
of this section, provided that all of the requirements of the particular 
rules and forms in effect at such dates (including any required 
undertakings) are met.
    (g)(1) Subject to paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section, 
except for registration statements and post-effective amendments that 
become effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462 and Rule 464 (Sec.

thereto is deemed filed on the proper registration form unless the 
Commission objects to the registration form before the effective date.
    (2) An automatic shelf registration statement as defined in Rule 405 
(Sec. 230.405) and any post-effective amendment thereto are deemed 
filed on the proper registration form unless and until the Commission 
notifies the issuer of its objection to the use of such form. Following 
any such notification, the issuer must amend its automatic shelf 
registration statement onto the registration form it is then eligible to 
use, provided, however, that any continuous offering of securities 
pursuant to Rule 415 (Sec. 230.415) that the issuer has commenced 
pursuant to the

[[Page 603]]

registration statement before the Commission has notified the issuer of 
its objection to the use of such form may continue until the effective 
date of a new registration statement or post-effective amendment to the 
registration statement that the issuer has filed on the proper 
registration form, if the issuer files promptly after notification the 
new registration statement or post-effective amendment and if the 
offering is permitted to be made under the new registration statement or 
post-effective amendment.
    (3) Violations of General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 or General 
Instruction I.B.5. of Form F-3 will also violate the requirements as to 
proper form under this section notwithstanding that the registration 
statement may have been declared effective previously.

French text to comply with the requirements of the Canadian securities 
administrator or other Canadian authority and, for an electronic filing,

    (c) The prospectus shall contain the information called for by all

and negative answers to any item in Part I may be omitted. A copy of the 
prospectus may be filed as a part of the registration statement in lieu 
of furnishing the information in item-and-answer form. Wherever a copy 
of the prospectus is filed in lieu of information in item-and-answer 
form, the text of the items of the form is to be omitted from the 
registration statement, as well as from the prospectus, except to the 
extent provided in paragraph (d) of this rule.
    (d) Where any items of a form call for information not required to

of such items, including the numbers and captions thereof, together with 
the answers thereto shall be filed with the prospectus under cover of 
the facing sheet of the form as a part of the registration statement. 
However, the text of such items may be omitted provided the answers are 
so prepared as to indicate the coverage of the item without the 
necessity of reference to the text of the item. If any such item is 
inapplicable, or the answer thereto is in the negative, a statement to 
that effect shall be made. Any financial statements not required to be 
included in the prospectus

[[Page 606]]

shall also be filed as a part of the registration statement proper, 
unless incorporated by reference pursuant to Rule 411 (Sec. 230.411).

and/or one or more of the parent's other majority-owned subsidiaries.
    Material. The term material, when used to qualify a requirement for 
the furnishing of information as to any subject, limits the information 
required to those matters to which there is a substantial likelihood 
that a reasonable investor would attach importance in determining 
whether to purchase the security registered.
    Officer. The term officer means a president, vice president, 
secretary, treasurer or principal financial officer, comptroller or 
principal accounting officer, and any person routinely performing 
corresponding functions with respect to any organization whether

such person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
    Predecessor. The term predecessor means a person the major portion

underwriter in privity of contract with the issuer of the securities as 
to which he is underwriter, the term issuer having the meaning given in

    Promoter. (1) The term promoter includes:
    (i) Any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more 
other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and

    (ii) Any person who, in connection with the founding and organizing

receives in consideration of services or property, or both services and

securities. However, a person who receives such securities or proceeds 
either solely as underwriting commissions or solely in consideration of 
property shall not be deemed a promoter within the meaning of this 
paragraph if such person does not otherwise take part in founding and 
organizing the enterprise.
    (2) All persons coming within the definition of promoter in 
paragraph (1) of this definition may be referred to as founders or

descriptive of those persons' activities with respect to the issuer.
    Prospectus. Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise 
requires, the term prospectus means a prospectus meeting the 
requirements of section 10(a) of the Act.
    Registrant. The term registrant means the issuer of the securities 
for which the registration statement is filed.
    Share. The term share means a share of stock in a corporation or 
unit of interest in an unincorporated person.
    Shell company. The term shell company means a registrant, other than

    (i) No or nominal assets;
    (ii) Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or
    (iii) Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents

registrant's balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles on the date of that determination.

    Significant subsidiary. The term significant subsidiary means a 
subsidiary, including its subsidiaries, which meets any of the following 
conditions:
    (1) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and 
advances to the subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year (for a proposed business combination to 
be accounted for as a pooling of interests, this condition is also met 
when the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the 
registrant exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at 
the date the combination is initiated); or
    (2) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share 
of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the subsidiary 
exceeds 10 percent of the total assets of the registrants and its

fiscal year; or
    (3) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the 
income from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary 
items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of the 
subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of such income of the registrant and its 
subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.

    Computational note. For purposes of making the prescribed income 
test the following guidance should be applied:
    1. When a loss has been incurred by either the parent and its 
subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the 
equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded 
from the income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
purposes of the computation.
    2. If income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the 
average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average 
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss 
years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.

    Smaller reporting company: As used in this part, the term smaller 
reporting company means an issuer that is not an investment company, an 
asset-backed issuer (as defined in Sec. 229.1101 of this chapter), or a 
majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting 
company and that:
    (1) Had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last 
business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, 
computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its 
voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price 
at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and 
asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common 
equity; or
    (2) In the case of an initial registration statement under the 
Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a 
public float of less than $75 million as of a date within 30 days of the 
date of the filing of the registration statement, computed by 
multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-
affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act 
registration statement, the number of such shares included in the 
registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the 
shares; or
    (3) In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under 
paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of 
less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for 
which audited financial statements are available.
    (4) Determination: Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting 
company is determined on an annual basis.
    (i) For issuers that are required to file reports under section 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the determination is based on 
whether the issuer

[[Page 612]]

came within the definition of smaller reporting company using the 
amounts specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of Item 10 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.10(f)(1)(i) of this chapter), as of the last business day of 
the second fiscal quarter of the issuer's previous fiscal year. An 
issuer in this category must reflect this determination in the 
information it provides in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the 
first fiscal quarter of the next year, indicating on the cover page of 
that filing, and in subsequent filings for that fiscal year, whether or 
not it is a smaller reporting company, except that, if a determination 
based on public float indicates that the issuer is newly eligible to be 
a smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose to reflect this 
determination beginning with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q 
following the determination, rather than waiting until the first fiscal 
quarter of the next year.
    (ii) For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or 
Exchange Act registration statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of Item 
10 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.10(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter), the 
issuer must reflect the determination in the information it provides in 
the registration statement and must appropriately indicate on the cover 
page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal year in which 
the filing is made, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company. 
The issuer must redetermine its status at the end of its second fiscal 
quarter and then reflect any change in status as provided in paragraph 
(4)(i) of this definition. In the case of a determination based on an 
initial Securities Act registration statement, an issuer that was not 
determined to be a smaller reporting company has the option to 
redetermine its status at the conclusion of the offering covered by the 
registration statement based on the actual offering price and number of 
shares sold.
    (iii) Once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller reporting company 
status, it will remain unqualified unless it determines that its public 
float, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this 
definition, was less than $50 million as of the last business day of its 
second fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because 
the issuer had no public equity outstanding or no market price for its 
equity existed, if the issuer had annual revenues of less than $40 
million during its previous fiscal year.
    Subsidiary. A subsidiary of a specified person is an affiliate 
controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more 
intermediaries. (See also majority owned subsidiary, significant 
subsidiary, totally held subsidiary, and wholly owned subsidiary.)
    Succession. The term succession means the direct acquisition of the 
assets comprising a going business, whether by merger, consolidation, 
purchase, or other direct transfer. The term does not include the 
acquisition of control of a business unless followed by the direct 
acquisition of its assets. The terms succeed and successor have meanings 
correlative to the foregoing.
    Totally held subsidiary. The term totally held subsidiary means a 
subsidiary (1) substantially all of whose outstanding securities are 
owned by its parent and/or the parent's other totally held subsidiaries, 
and (2) which is not indebted to any person other than its parent and/or 
the parent's other totally held subsidiaries in an amount which is 
material in relation to the particular subsidiary, excepting 
indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business which is not 
overdue and which matures within one year from the date of its creation, 
whether evidenced by securities or not.
    Voting securities. The term voting securities means securities the 
holders of which are presently entitled to vote for the election of 
directors.
    Well-known seasoned issuer. A well-known seasoned issuer is an 
issuer that, as of the most recent determination date determined 
pursuant to paragraph (2) of this definition:
    (1)(i) Meets all the registrant requirements of General Instruction 
I.A. of Form S-3 or Form F-3 (Sec. 239.13 or Sec. 239.33 of this 
chapter) and either:
    (A) As of a date within 60 days of the determination date, has a 
worldwide market value of its outstanding voting and non-voting common 
equity held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more; or
    (B)(1) As of a date within 60 days of the determination date, has 
issued in

[[Page 613]]

the last three years at least $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 
non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in primary 
offerings for cash, not exchange, registered under the Act; and
    (2) Will register only non-convertible securities, other than common 
equity, and full and unconditional guarantees permitted pursuant to 
paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition unless, at the determination date, 
the issuer also is eligible to register a primary offering of its 
securities relying on General Instruction I.B.1. of Form S-3 or Form F-
3.
    (3) Provided that as to a parent issuer only, for purposes of 
calculating the aggregate principal amount of outstanding non-
convertible securities under paragraph (1)(i)(B)(1) of this definition, 
the parent issuer may include the aggregate principal amount of non-
convertible securities, other than common equity, of its majority-owned 
subsidiaries issued in registered primary offerings for cash, not 
exchange, that it has fully and unconditionally guaranteed, within the 
meaning of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.3-10 of this chapter) 
in the last three years; or
    (ii) Is a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is a well-known 
seasoned issuer pursuant to paragraph (1)(i) of this definition and, as 
to the subsidiaries' securities that are being or may be offered on that 
parent's registration statement:
    (A) The parent has provided a full and unconditional guarantee, as 
defined in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, of the payment obligations on 
the subsidiary's securities and the securities are non-convertible 
securities, other than common equity;
    (B) The securities are guarantees of:
    (1) Non-convertible securities, other than common equity, of its 
parent being registered; or
    (2) Non-convertible securities, other than common equity, of another 
majority-owned subsidiary being registered where there is a full and 
unconditional guarantee, as defined in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, of 
such non-convertible securities by the parent; or
    (C) The securities of the majority-owned subsidiary meet the 
conditions of General Instruction I.B.2 of Form S-3 or Form F-3.

1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48)).
    (2) For purposes of this definition, the determination date as to 
whether an issuer is a well-known seasoned issuer shall be the latest 
of:
    (i) The time of filing of its most recent shelf registration 
statement; or
    (ii) The time of its most recent amendment (by post-effective 
amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d) of this 
chapter), or form of prospectus) to a shelf registration statement for 
purposes of complying with section 10(a)(3) of the Act (or if such 
amendment has not been made within the time period required by section 
10(a)(3) of the Act, the date on which such amendment is required); or

months, the time of filing of the issuer's most recent annual report on 
Form 10-K (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) or Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f

    Preliminary Notes: (1) Confidential treatment of supplemental 
information or other information not required to be filed under the Act

disclosure by following the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section, 
which shall be the exclusive means of requesting confidential treatment 
of information included in any document (hereinafter referred to as the 
material filed) required to be filed under the Act, except that if the 
material filed is a registration statement on Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of 
this chapter) or on Form S-3, F-2, F-3 (Sec. 239.13, Sec. 239.32 or 
Sec. 239.33 of this chapter) relating to a dividend or interest 
reinvestment plan, or on Form S-4 (Sec. 239.25 of this chapter)

person shall comply with the procedure in paragraph (b) prior to the 
filing of a registration statement.
    (b) The person shall omit from the material filed the portion 
thereof which it desires to keep undisclosed (hereinafter called the 
confidential portion). In lieu thereof, the person shall indicate at the 
appropriate place in the material filed that the confidential portion 
has been so omitted and filed separately with the Commission. The person 
shall file with the material filed:
    (1) One copy of the confidential portion, marked ``Confidential 
Treatment,'' of the material filed with the Commission. The copy shall 
contain an appropriate identification of the item or other requirement 
involved and, notwithstanding that the confidential portion does not 
constitute the whole of the answer or required disclosure, the entire 
answer or required disclosure, except that in the case where the 
confidential portion is part of a financial statement or schedule, only 
the particular financial statement or schedule need be included. The 
copy of the confidential portion shall be in the same form as the 
remainder of the material filed;
    (2) An application making objection to the disclosure of the 
confidential portion. Such application shall be on a sheet or sheets 
separate from the confidential portion, and shall contain:

analyzing the applicable exemption(s) from disclosure under Sec. 200.80 
of this chapter, the Commission's rule adopted under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), and a justification of the period of 
time for which confidential treatment is sought;
    (iii) A detailed explanation of why, based on the facts and 
circumstances of the particular case, disclosure of the information is 
unnecessary for the protection of investors;
    (iv) A written consent to the furnishing of the confidential portion 
to other government agencies, offices, or bodies and to the Congress;

envelope marked ``Confidential Treatment'' and addressed to The 
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.
    (c) Pending a determination as to the objection, the material for 
which confidential treatment has been applied will not be made available 
to the public.

[[Page 615]]

    (d) If it is determined by the Division, acting pursuant to 
delegated authority, that the application should be granted, an order to 
that effect will be entered, and a notation to that effect will be made 
at the appropriate place in the material filed. Such a determination 
will not preclude reconsideration whenever appropriate, such as upon 
receipt of any subsequent request under the Freedom of Information Act 
and, if appropriate, revocation of the confidential status of all or a 
portion of the information in question.
    (e) If the Commission denies the application, or the Division, 
acting pursuant to delegated authority, denies the application and 
Commission review is not sought pursuant to Sec. 201.431 of this 
chapter, confirmed telegraphic notice of the order of denial will be 
sent to the person named in the application pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section. In such case, if the material filed may be 
withdrawn pursuant to an applicable statute, rule, or regulation, the 
registrant shall have the right to withdraw the material filed in 
accordance with the terms of the applicable statute, rule, or 
regulation, but without the necessity of stating any grounds for the 
withdrawal or of obtaining the further assent of the Commission. In the 
event of such withdrawal, the confidential portion will be returned to 
the registrant. If the material filed may not be so withdrawn, the 
confidential portion will be made available for public inspection in the 
same manner as if confidential treatment had been revoked under 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (f) If a right of withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section is not exercised, the confidential portion will be made 
available for public inspection as part of the material filed, and the 
registrant shall amend the material filed to include all information 
required to be set forth in regard to such confidential portion.
    (g) In any case where a prior grant of confidential treatment has 
been revoked, the person named in the application pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section will be so informed by registered or certified 
mail. Pursuant to Sec. 201.431 of this chapter, persons making 
objection to disclosure may petition the Commission for review of a 
determination by the Division revoking confidential treatment.
    (h) Upon revocation of confidential treatment, the confidential 
portion shall be made available to the public at the time and according 
to the conditions specified in paragraphs (h) (1)-(2):
    (1) Upon the lapse of five days after the dispatch of notice by 
registered or certified mail of a determination disallowing an 
objection, if prior to the lapse of such five days the person shall not 
have communicated to the Secretary of the Commission his intention to 
seek review by the Commission under Sec. 201.431 of this chapter of the 
determination made by the Division; or
    (2) If such a petition for review shall have been filed under Sec.

Sec. 230.408  Additional information.

    (a) In addition to the information expressly required to be included 
in a registration statement, there shall be added such further material 
information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required 
statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, 
not misleading.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, unless otherwise 
required to be included in the registration statement, the failure to 
include in a registration statement information included in a free 
writing prospectus will not, solely by virtue of inclusion of the 
information in a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 (Sec. 
230.405)), be considered an omission of material information required to 
be included in the registration statement.

Sec. 230.409  Information unknown or not reasonably available.

    Information required need be given only insofar as it is known or 
reasonably available to the registrant. If any required information is 
unknown and not reasonably available to the registrant, either because 
the obtaining thereof could involve unreasonable effort or expense, or 
because it rests peculiarly within the knowledge of another person not 
affiliated with the registrant, the information may be omitted, subject 
to the following conditions:
    (a) The registrant shall give such information on the subject as it 
possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense, 
together with the sources thereof.
    (b) The registrant shall include a statement either showing that 
unreasonable effort or expense would be involved or indicating the 
absence of any affiliation with the person within whose knowledge the 
information rests and stating the result of a request made to such 
person for the information.

Sec. 230.410  Disclaimer of control.

instance, the registrant may disclaim the existence of control and any 
admission thereof; in such case, however, the registrant shall state the 
material facts pertinent to the possible existence of control.

    (a) Prospectus. Except as provided by this section, Item 1100(c) of 
Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1100(c) of this chapter) for registered 
offerings of asset-backed securities, or unless otherwise provided in 
the appropriate form, information shall not be incorporated by reference 
in a prospectus. Where a summary or outline of the provisions of any 
document is required in the prospectus, the summary or outline may 
incorporate by reference particular items, sections or paragraphs of any 
exhibit and may be qualified in its entirety by such reference.
    (b) Information not required in a prospectus. Except for exhibits 
covered by paragraph (c) of this section, information may be 
incorporated by reference in answer, or partial answer, to any item that 
calls for information not required to be included in a prospectus 
subject to the following provisions:
    (1) Non-financial information may be incorporated by reference to 
any document;
    (2) Financial information may be incorporated by reference to any 
document, provided any financial statement so incorporated meets the 
requirements of the forms on which the statement is filed. Financial 
statements or other financial data required to be given in comparative 
form for two or more fiscal years or periods shall not be incorporated 
by reference unless the information incorporated by reference includes 
the entire period for which the comparative data is given;
    (3) Information contained in any part of the registration statement, 
including the prospectus, may be incorporated by reference in answer, or 
partial answer, to any item that calls for information not required to 
be included in the prospectus; and
    (4) Unless the information is incorporated by reference to a 
document which complies with the time limitations of Sec. 228.10(f) and 
Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter, then the document, or part thereof, 
containing the incorporated information is required to be filed as an 
exhibit.
    (c) Exhibits. Any document or part thereof filed with the Commission 
pursuant to any Act administered by the Commission may, subject to the 
limitations of Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.11(d) of this chapter, be 
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to any registration statement. 
If any modification has occurred in the text of any document 
incorporated by reference since the filing thereof, the registrant shall 
file with the reference a statement containing the text of such 
modification and the date thereof.
    (d) General. Any incorporation by reference of information pursuant 
to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 24 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice restricting incorporation by reference of 
documents which

[[Page 617]]

incorporate by reference other information. Information incorporated by 
reference shall be clearly identified in the reference by page, 
paragraph, caption or otherwise. If the information is incorporated by 
reference to a previously filed document, the file number of such 
document shall be included. Where only certain pages of a document are 
incorporated by reference and filed with the statement, the document 
from which the information is taken shall be clearly identified in the 
reference. An express statement that the specified matter is 
incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the 
registration statement where the information is required. Information 
shall not be incorporated by reference in any case where such 
incorporation would render the statement incomplete, unclear or 
confusing.

Sec. 230.412  Modified or superseded documents.

    (a) Any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to 
be incorporated by reference or deemed to be part of a registration 
statement or the prospectus that is part of the registration statement 
shall be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of the 
registration statement or the prospectus that is part of the 
registration statement to the extent that a statement contained in the 
prospectus that is part of the registration statement or in any other 
subsequently filed document which also is or is deemed to be 
incorporated by reference or deemed to be part of the registration 
statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement 
modifies or replaces such statement. Any statement contained in a 
document that is deemed to be incorporated by reference or deemed to be 
part of a registration statement or the prospectus that is part of the 
registration statement after the most recent effective date or after the 
date of the most recent prospectus that is part of the registration 
statement may modify or replace existing statements contained in the 
registration statement or the prospectus that is part of the 
registration statement.
    (b) The modifying or superseding statement may, but need not, state 
that it has modified or superseded a prior statement or include any 
other information set forth in the document which is not so modified or 
superseded. The making of a modifying or superseding statement shall not 
be deemed an admission that the modified or superseded statement, when 
made, constituted an untrue statement of a material fact, an omission to 
state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading, or 
the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device, 
contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business or 
artifice to defraud, as those terms are used in the Act, the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the rules and regulations 
thereunder.
    (c) Any statement so modified shall not be deemed in its unmodified 
form to constitute part of the registration statement or prospectus for 
purpose of the Act. Any statement so superseded shall not be deemed to 
constitute a part of the registration statement or the prospectus for 
purposes of the Act.

CFR 240.3a12-3), incorporated under the laws of any State or foreign 
government and having securities registered under the Act has been 
succeeded by an issuer incorporated under the laws of another State or 
foreign government for the purpose of changing the State or country of 
incorporation of the enterprises, or if any issuer has been succeeded by 
an issuer for the purpose of changing its form of organization, the 
registration statement of the predecessor issuer shall be deemed the 
registration statement of the successor issuer for the purpose of 
continuing the offering provided:
    (a) Immediately prior to the succession the successor issuer had no 
assets or liabilities other than nominal assets or liabilities;
    (b) The succession was effected by a merger or similar succession 
pursuant to statutory provisions or the terms of the organic instruments 
under which the successor issuer acquired all of the assets and assumed

predecessor issuer at a meeting for which proxies were solicited

section 20(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or information was 
furnished to security holders pursuant to section 14(c) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and
    (d) The successor issuer has filed an amendment to the registration 
statement of the predecessor issuer expressly adopting such statements 
as its own registration statement for all purposes of the Act and the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and setting forth any additional 
information necessary to reflect any material changes made in connection 
with or resulting from the succession, or necessary to keep the

Sec. 230.415  Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities.

    (a) Securities may be registered for an offering to be made on a 
continuous or delayed basis in the future, Provided, That:
    (1) The registration statement pertains only to:
    (i) Securities which are to be offered or sold solely by or on 
behalf of a person or persons other than the registrant, a subsidiary of 
the registrant or a person of which the registrant is a subsidiary;
    (ii) Securities which are to be offered and sold pursuant to a 
dividend or interest reinvestment plan or an employee benefit plan of 
the registrant;
    (iii) Securities which are to be issued upon the exercise of 
outstanding options, warrants or rights;
    (iv) Securities which are to be issued upon conversion of other 
outstanding securities;
    (v) Securities which are pledged as collateral;
    (vi) Securities which are registered on Form F-6 (Sec. 239.36 of

[[Page 619]]

backed debt and mortgage participation or pass through certificates;
    (viii) Securities which are to be issued in connection with business 
combination transactions;
    (ix) Securities the offering of which will be commenced promptly, 
will be made on a continuous basis and may continue for a period in 
excess of 30 days from the date of initial effectiveness;
    (x) Securities registered (or qualified to be registered) on Form S-
3 or Form F-3 (Sec. 239.13 or Sec. 239.33 of this chapter) which are 
to be offered and sold on an immediate, continuous or delayed basis by 
or on behalf of the registrant, a majority-owned subsidiary of the 
registrant or a person of which the registrant is a majority-owned 
subsidiary; or
    (xi) Shares of common stock which are to be offered and sold on a 
delayed or continuous basis by or on behalf of a registered closed-end 
management investment company or business development company that makes 
periodic repurchase offers pursuant to Sec. 270.23c-3 of this chapter.
    (2) Securities in paragraph (a)(1)(viii) of this section and 
securities in paragraph (a)(1)(ix) of this section that are not 
registered on Form S-3 or Form F-3 (Sec. 239.13 or Sec. 239.33 of this 
chapter) may only be registered in an amount which, at the time the 
registration statement becomes effective, is reasonably expected to be 
offered and sold within two years from the initial effective date of the 
registration.
    (3) The registrant furnishes the undertakings required by Item 
512(a) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512(a) of this chapter), except that 
a registrant that is an investment company filing on Form N-2 must 
furnish the undertakings required by Item 34.4 of Form N-2 (Sec. 239.14 
and Sec. 274.11a-1 of this chapter).
    (4) In the case of a registration statement pertaining to an at the 
market offering of equity securities by or on behalf of the registrant, 
the offering must come within paragraph (a)(1)(x) of this section. As 
used in this paragraph, the term ``at the market offering'' means an 
offering of equity securities into an existing trading market for 
outstanding shares of the same class at other than a fixed price.
    (5) Securities registered on an automatic shelf registration 
statement and securities described in paragraphs (a)(1)(vii), (ix), and 
(x) of this section may be offered and sold only if not more than three 
years have elapsed since the initial effective date of the registration 
statement under which they are being offered and sold, provided, 
however, that if a new registration statement has been filed pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section:
    (i) If the new registration statement is an automatic shelf 
registration statement, it shall be immediately effective pursuant to 
Rule 462(e) (Sec. 230.462(e)); or
    (ii) If the new registration statement is not an automatic shelf 
registration statement:
    (A) Securities covered by the prior registration statement may 
continue to be offered and sold until the earlier of the effective date 
of the new registration statement or 180 days after the third 
anniversary of the initial effective date of the prior registration 
statement; and
    (B) A continuous offering of securities covered by the prior 
registration statement that commenced within three years of the initial 
effective date may continue until the effective date of the new 
registration statement if such offering is permitted under the new 
registration statement.
    (6) Prior to the end of the three-year period described in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section, an issuer may file a new registration statement 
covering securities described in such paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
which may, if permitted, be an automatic shelf registration statement. 
The new registration statement and prospectus included therein must 
include all the information that would be required at that time in a 
prospectus relating to all offering(s) that it covers. Prior to the 
effective date of the new registration statement (including at the time 
of filing in the case of an automatic shelf registration statement), the 
issuer may include on such new registration statement any unsold 
securities covered by the earlier registration statement by identifying 
on the bottom of the facing

[[Page 620]]

page of the new registration statement or latest amendment thereto the 
amount of such unsold securities being included and any filing fee paid 
in connection with such unsold securities, which will continue to be 
applied to such unsold securities. The offering of securities on the 
earlier registration statement will be deemed terminated as of the date 
of effectiveness of the new registration statement.
    (b) This section shall not apply to any registration statement 
pertaining to securities issued by a face-amount certificate company or 
redeemable securities issued by an open-end management company or unit 
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or any 
registration statement filed by any foreign government or political 
subdivision thereof.

Sec. 230.416  Securities to be issued as a result of stock splits, stock dividends and anti-dilution provisions and interests to be issued pursuant to certain 
          employee benefit plans.

    (a) If a registration statement purports to register securities to 
be offered pursuant to terms which provide for a change in the amount of 
securities being offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from 
stock splits, stock dividends, or similar transactions, such 
registration statement shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, be 
deemed to cover the additional securities to be offered or issued in 
connection with any such provision.
    (b) If prior to completion of the distribution of the securities 
covered by a registration statement, additional securities of the same 
class are issued or issuable as a result of a stock split or stock 
dividend, the registration statement shall, unless otherwise expressly 
provided therein, be deemed to cover such additional securities 
resulting from the split of, or the stock dividend on, the registered 
securities. If prior to completion of the distribution of the securities 
covered by a registration statement, all the securities of a class which 
includes the registered securities are combined by a reverse split into 
a lesser amount of securities of the same class, the amount of 
undistributed securities of such class deemed to be covered by the 
registration statement shall be proportionately reduced. If paragraph 
(a) of this section is not applicable, the registration statement shall 
be amended prior to the offering of such additional or lesser amount of 
securities to reflect the change in the amount of securities registered.
    (c) Where a registration statement on Form S-8 relates to securities 
to be offered pursuant to an employee benefit plan, including interests 
in such plan that constitute separate securities required to be 
registered under the Act, such registration statement shall be deemed to 
register an indeterminate amount of such plan interests.

(1) General. (i) Except as otherwise provided in this section or 
prohibited by other applicable law, all securities issued in connection 
with an offering by a blank check company and the gross proceeds from 
the offering shall be deposited promptly into:
    (A) An escrow account maintained by an ``insured depository 
institution,'' as that term is defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(C)(2)); or
    (B) A separate bank account established by a broker or dealer 
registered under the Exchange Act maintaining net capital equal to or 
exceeding $25,000 (as calculated pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 
(17 CFR 240.15c3-1), in which the broker or dealer acts as trustee for 
persons having the beneficial interests in the account.
    (ii) If funds and securities are deposited into an escrow account 
maintained by an insured depository institution, the deposit account 
records of the insured depository institution must provide that funds in 
the escrow account are held for the benefit of the purchasers named and 
identified in accordance with 12 CFR 330.1 of the regulations of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the records of the escrow 
agent, maintained in good faith and in the regular course of business, 
must show the name and interest of each party to the account. If funds 
and securities are deposited in a separate bank account established by a 
broker or dealer acting as a trustee, the books and records of the 
broker-dealer must indicate the name, address, and interest of each 
person for whom the account is held.
    (2) Deposit and investment of proceeds. (i) All offering proceeds, 
after deduction of cash paid for underwriting commissions, underwriting 
expenses and dealer allowances, and amounts permitted to be released to 
the registrant pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, shall

however, that no deduction may be made for underwriting commissions, 
underwriting expenses or dealer allowances payable to an affiliate of 
the registrant.

money orders payable to the order of the escrow agent or trustee.

    (iv) Deposited proceeds shall be invested in one of the following:

defined in section 3(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1813 (1));

[[Page 623]]

    (B) Securities of any open-end investment company registered under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) that holds 
itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of paragraphs 
(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of 17 CFR 270.2a-7 (Rule 2a-7) under the 
Investment Company Act; or
    (C) Securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations 
guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States.

    Note to Sec. 230.419(b)(2)(iv): Issuers are cautioned that 
investments in government securities are inappropriate unless such 
securities can be readily sold or otherwise disposed of for cash at the 
time required without any dissipation of offering proceeds invested.

    (v) Interest or dividends earned on the funds, if any, shall be held 
in the escrow or trust account until the funds are released in 
accordance with the provisions of this section. If funds held in the 
escrow or trust account are released to a purchaser of the securities, 
the purchasers shall receive interest or dividends earned, if any, on 
such funds up to the date of release. If funds held in the escrow or 
trust account are released to the registrant, interest or dividends 
earned on such funds up to the date of release may be released to the 
registrant.
    (vi) The registrant may receive up to 10 percent of the proceeds 
remaining after payment of underwriting commissions, underwriting 
expenses and dealer allowances permitted by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section, exclusive of interest or dividends, as those proceeds are 
deposited into the escrow or trust account.
    (3) Deposit of securities. (i) All securities issued in connection 
with the offering, whether or not for cash consideration, and any other 
securities issued with respect to such securities, including securities 
issued with respect to stock splits, stock dividends, or similar rights, 
shall be deposited directly into the escrow or trust account promptly 
upon issuance. The identity of the purchaser of the securities shall be 
included on the stock certificates or other documents evidencing such 
securities. See also 17 CFR 240.15g-8 regarding restrictions on sales 
of, or offers to sell, securities deposited in the escrow or trust 
account.
    (ii) Securities held in the escrow or trust account are to remain as 
issued and deposited and shall be held for the sole benefit of the 
purchasers, who shall have voting rights, if any, with respect to 
securities held in their names, as provided by applicable state law. No 
transfer or other disposition of securities held in the escrow or trust 
account or any interest related to such securities shall be permitted 
other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant 
to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), or Title 1 of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or the 
rules thereunder.
    (iii) Warrants, convertible securities or other derivative 
securities relating to securities held in the escrow or trust account 
may be exercised or converted in accordance with their terms; provided, 
however, that securities received upon exercise or conversion, together 
with any cash or other consideration paid in connection with the 
exercise or conversion, are promptly deposited into the escrow or trust 
account.
    (4) Escrow or trust agreement. A copy of the executed escrow or 
trust agreement shall be filed as an exhibit to the registration 
statement and shall contain the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), 
and (e)(3) of this section.
    (5) Request for supplemental information. Upon request by the 
Commission or the staff, the registrant shall furnish as supplemental 
information the names and addresses of persons for whom securities are 
held in the escrow or trust account.

    Note to Sec. 230.419(b): With respect to a blank check offering 
subject to both Rule 419 and Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 (17 CFR 240.15c2-
4, the requirements of Rule 15c2-4 are applicable only until the 
conditions of the offering governed by that Rule are met (e.g., reaching 
the minimum in a ``part-or-none'' offering). When those conditions are 
satisfied, Rule 419 continues to govern the use of offering proceeds.

    (c) Disclosure of offering terms. The initial registration statement 
shall disclose the specific terms of the offering, including, but not 
limited to:

[[Page 624]]

    (1) The terms and provisions of the escrow or trust agreement and 
the effect thereof upon the registrant's right to receive funds and the 
effect of the escrow or trust agreement upon the purchaser's funds and 
securities required to be deposited into the escrow or trust account, 
including, if applicable, any material risk of non-insurance of 
purchasers' funds resulting from deposits in excess of the insured 
amounts; and
    (2) The obligation of the registrant to provide, and the right of 
the purchaser to receive, information regarding an acquisition, 
including the requirement that pursuant to this section, purchasers 
confirm in writing their investment in the registrant's securities as 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Probable acquisition post-effective amendment requirement. If, 
during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a significant 
acquisition becomes probable, the registrant shall file promptly a post-
effective amendment disclosing the information specified by the 
applicable registration statement form and Industry Guides, including 
financial statements of the registrant and the company to be acquired as 
well as pro forma financial information required by the form and 
applicable rules and regulations. Where warrants, rights or other 
derivative securities issued in the initial offering are exercisable, 
there is a continuous offering of the underlying security.
    (e) Release of deposited and funds securities--(1) Post-effective 
amendment for acquisition agreement. Upon execution of an agreement(s) 
for the acquisition(s) of a business(es) or assets that will constitute 
the business (or a line of business) of the registrant and for which the 
fair value of the business(es) or net assets to be acquired represents 
at least 80 percent of the maximum offering proceeds, including proceeds 
received or to be received upon the exercise or conversion of any 
securities offered, but excluding amounts payable to non-affiliates for 
underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses, and dealer allowances, 
the registrant shall file a post-effective amendment that:
    (i) Discloses the information specified by the applicable 
registration statement form and Industry Guides, including financial 
statements of the registrant and the company acquired or to be acquired 
and pro forma financial information required by the form and applicable 
rules and regulations;
    (ii) Discloses the results of the initial offering, including but 
not limited to:
    (A) The gross offering proceeds received to date, specifying the 
amounts paid for underwriter commissions, underwriting expenses and 
dealer allowances, amounts disbursed to the registrant, and amounts 
remaining in the escrow or trust account; and
    (B) The specific amount, use and application of funds disbursed to 
the registrant to date, including, but not limited to, the amounts paid 
to officers, directors, promoters, controlling shareholders or 
affiliates, either directly or indirectly, specifying the amounts and 
purposes of such payments; and
    (iii) Discloses the terms of the offering as described pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) Terms of the offering. The terms of the offering must provide, 
and the registrant must satisfy, the following conditions.
    (i) Within five business days after the effective date of the post-
effective amendment(s), the registrant shall send by first class mail or 
other equally prompt means, to each purchaser of securities held in 
escrow or trust, a copy of the prospectus contained in the post-
effective amendment and any amendment or supplement thereto;
    (ii) Each purchaser shall have no fewer than 20 business days and no 
more than 45 business days from the effective date of the post-effective 
amendment to notify the registrant in writing that the purchaser elects 
to remain an investor. If the registrant has not received such written 
notification by the 45th business day following the effective date of 
the post-effective amendment, funds and interest or dividends, if any, 
held in the escrow or trust account shall be sent by first class mail or 
other equally prompt means to the purchaser within five business days;
    (iii) The acquisition(s) meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section will be consummated if a

[[Page 625]]

sufficient number of purchasers confirm their investments; and
    (iv) If a consummated acquisition(s) meeting the requirements of 
this section has not occurred by a date 18 months after the effective 
date of the initial registration statement, funds held in the escrow or 
trust account shall be returned by first class mail or equally prompt 
means to the purchaser within five business days following that date.
    (3) Conditions for release of deposited securities and funds. Funds 
held in the escrow or trust account may be released to the registrant 
and securities may be delivered to the purchaser or other registered 
holder identified on the deposited securities only at the same time as 
or after:
    (i) The escrow agent or trustee has received a signed representation 
from the registrant, together with other evidence acceptable to the 
escrow agent or trustee, that the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and 
(e)(2) of this section have been met; and
    (ii) Consummation of an acquisition(s) meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (4) Prospectus supplement. If funds and securities are released from 
the escrow or trust account to the registrant pursuant to this 
paragraph, the prospectus shall be supplemented to indicate the amount 
of funds and securities released and the date of release.

    Notes to Sec. 230.419(e): 1. With respect to a blank check offering 
subject to both Rule 419 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 (17 CFR 240.10b-9), 
the requirements of Rule 10b-9 are applicable only until the conditions 
of the offering governed by that Rule are met (e.g., reaching the 
minimum in a ``part-or-none'' offering). When those conditions are 
satisfied, Rule 419 continues to govern the use of offering proceeds.
    2. If the business(es) or assets are acquired for cash, the fair 
value shall be presumed to be equal to the cash paid. If all or part of 
the consideration paid consists of securities or other non-cash 
consideration, the fair value shall be determined by an accepted 
standard, such as bona fide sales of the assets or similar assets made 
within a reasonable time, forecasts of expected cash flows, independent 
appraisals, etc. Such valuation must be reasonable at the time made.

    (f) Financial statements. The registrant shall:
    (1) Furnish to security holders audited financial statements for the 
first full fiscal year of operations following consummation of an 
acquisition pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, together with the 
information required by Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 
229.303(a)), no later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal year; 
and
    (2) File the financial statements and additional information with 
the Commission under cover of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308); provided, 
however, that such financial statements and related information need not 
be filed separately if the registrant is filing reports pursuant to 
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Sec. 230.420  Legibility of prospectus.

    (a) The body of all printed prospectuses and all notes to financial 
statements and other tabular data included therein shall be in roman 
type at least as large and as legible as 10-point modern type. However, 
(a) to the extent necessary for convenient presentation, financial

point modern type. All such type shall be leaded at least 2 points.

issuers may satisfy legibility requirements applicable to printed 
documents, such as paper size, type size and font, bold-face type,

<R05>
Sec. 230.421  Presentation of information in prospectuses.

    (a) The information required in a prospectus need not follow the 
order of the items or other requirements in the form. Such information 
shall not, however, be set forth in such fashion as to

[[Page 626]]

obscure any of the required information or any information necessary to 
keep the required information from being incomplete or misleading. Where 
an item requires information to be given in a prospectus in tabular form 
it shall be given in substantially the tabular form specified in the 
item.
    (b) You must present the information in a prospectus in a clear, 
concise and understandable manner. You must prepare the prospectus using 
the following standards:
    (1) Present information in clear, concise sections, paragraphs, and 
sentences. Whenever possible, use short, explanatory sentences and 
bullet lists;
    (2) Use descriptive headings and subheadings;
    (3) Avoid frequent reliance on glossaries or defined terms as the 
primary means of explaining information in the prospectus. Define terms 
in a glossary or other section of the document only if the meaning is 
unclear from the context. Use a glossary only if it facilitates 
understanding of the disclosure; and
    (4) Avoid legal and highly technical business terminology.

    Note to Sec. 230.421(b): In drafting the disclosure to comply with 
this section, you should avoid the following:
    1. Legalistic or overly complex presentations that make the 
substance of the disclosure difficult to understand;
    2. Vague ``boilerplate'' explanations that are imprecise and readily 
subject to different interpretations;
    3. Complex information copied directly from legal documents without 
any clear and concise explanation of the provision(s); and
    4. Disclosure repeated in different sections of the document that 
increases the size of the document but does not enhance the quality of 
the information.

    (c) All information required to be included in a prospectus shall be 
clearly understandable without the necessity of referring to the 
particular form or to the general rules and regulations. Except as to 
financial statements and information required in a tabular form, the 
information set forth in a prospectus may be expressed in condensed or 
summarized form. In lieu of repeating information in the form of notes 
to financial statements, references may be made to other parts of the 
prospectus where such information is set forth.
    (d)(1) To enhance the readability of the prospectus, you must use 
plain English principles in the organization, language, and design of 
the front and back cover pages, the summary, and the risk factors 
section.
    (2) You must draft the language in these sections so that at a 
minimum it substantially complies with each of the following plain 
English writing principles:
    (i) Short sentences;
    (ii) Definite, concrete, everyday words;
    (iii) Active voice;
    (iv) Tabular presentation or bullet lists for complex material, 
whenever possible;
    (v) No legal jargon or highly technical business terms; and
    (vi) No multiple negatives.
    (3) In designing these sections or other sections of the prospectus, 
you may include pictures, logos, charts, graphs, or other design 
elements so long as the design is not misleading and the required 
information is clear. You are encouraged to use tables, schedules, 
charts and graphic illustrations of the results of operations, balance 
sheet, or other financial data that present the data in an 
understandable manner. Any presentation must be consistent with the 
financial statements and non-financial information in the prospectus. 
You must draw the graphs and charts to scale. Any information you 
provide must not be misleading.

Instruction to Sec. 230.421: You should read Securities Act Release No. 
33-7497 (January 28,

paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(4) of this Rule, consists of a prospectus 
supplement attached to a form of prospectus that (1) previously had been 
filed or (2) was not required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (b) 
because it did not contain substantive changes from a prospectus that 
previously was filed, only the prospectus supplement need be filed under 
paragraph (b) of this rule, provided that the first page of each 
prospectus supplement includes a cross reference to the date(s) of the 
related prospectus and any prospectus supplements thereto that together 
constitute the prospectus required to be delivered by Section 5(b) of

contain in the upper right corner of the cover page the paragraph of 
this rule, including the subparagraph if applicable, under which the 
filing is made, and the file number of the registration statement to 
which the prospectus relates. The information required by this paragraph

operates to reflect the payment of filing fees for an offering or 
offerings pursuant to Rule 456(b) (Sec. 230.456(b)) must include on its 
cover page the calculation of registration fee table reflecting the 
payment of such filing fees for the securities that are the subject of 
the payment.

prospective investor; and
    (ii) For any other prospective investor, all materials provided to 
such prospective investor after the final terms have been established 
for all classes of the offering.
    (2) Time frame to file the materials. The materials must be filed by

abandoned structures or that are furnished to a prospective investor 
prior to the time the final terms have been established for all classes 
of the offering where such prospective investor has not indicated to the 
issuer or an underwriter its intention to purchase the asset-backed 
securities.
    (2) Any ABS informational and computational material if a prospectus 
that meets the requirements of section 10(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C.

accompanies or precedes the use of such material.
    (3) Any ABS informational and computational material that does not

Instruction to Sec. 230.426. The issuer may aggregate data presented in 
ABS informational and computational material that are to be filed and 
file such data in consolidated form. Any such

aggregation, however, must not result in either the omission of any 
information contained in such material otherwise to be filed, or a 
presentation that makes the information misleading.

Sec. 230.428  Documents constituting a section 10(a) prospectus for Form S-8 registration statement; requirements relating to offerings of securities 
          registered on Form S-8.

    (a)(1) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to a registration 
statement on Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of this chapter), the following, 
taken together, shall constitute a prospectus that meets the 
requirements of section 10(a) of the Act:
    (i) The document(s), or portions thereof as permitted by paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, containing the employee benefit plan 
information required by Item 1 of the Form;
    (ii) The statement of availability of registrant information, 
employee benefit plan annual reports and other information required by 
Item 2; and
    (iii) The documents containing registrant information and employee 
benefit plan annual reports that are incorporated by reference in the 
registration statement pursuant to Item 3.
    (2) The registrant shall maintain a file of the documents that, 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, at any time are part of the 
section 10(a) prospectus, except for documents required to be 
incorporated by reference in the registration statement pursuant to Item 
3 of Form S-8. Each such document shall be included in the file until 
five years after it is last used as part of the Section 10(a) prospectus 
to offer or sell securities pursuant to the plan. With respect to 
documents containing specifically designated portions that constitute 
part of the section 10(a) prospectus pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the entire document shall be maintained in the file. Upon 
request, the registrant shall furnish to the Commission or its staff a 
copy of any or all of the documents included in the file.
    (b) Where securities are offered pursuant to a registration 
statement on Form S-8:
    (1)(i) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered, to 
each employee who is eligible to participate (or selected by the 
registrant to participate, in the case of a stock option or other plan

Form S-8. The information shall be in written form and shall be updated 
in writing in a timely manner to reflect any material changes during any 
period in which offers or sales are being made. When updating 
information is furnished, documents previously furnished need not be re-
delivered, but the registrant shall furnish promptly without charge to 
each employee, upon written or oral request, a copy of all documents 
containing the plan information required by Part I that then constitute 
part of the section 10(a) prospectus.
    (ii) The registrant may designate an entire document or only 
portions of a document as constituting part of the section 10(a) 
prospectus. If the registrant designates only portions of a document as 
constituting part of the

[[Page 632]]

prospectus, rather than the entire document, a statement clearly 
identifying such portions, for example, by reference to section 
headings, section numbers, paragraphs or page numbers within the 
document must be included in a conspicuous place in the forepart of the 
document, or such portions must be specifically designated throughout 
the text of the document. Registrants shall not designate only words or 
sentences within a paragraph as part of a prospectus. Unless the 
portions of a document constituting part of the section 10(a) prospectus 
are clearly identified, the entire document shall constitute part of the 
prospectus.
    (iii) The registrant shall date any document constituting part of 
the section 10(a) prospectus or containing portions constituting part of 
the prospectus and shall include the following printed, stamped or typed 
legend in a conspicuous place in the forepart of the document, 
substituting the bracketed language as appropriate: ``This document 
[Specifically designated portions of this document] constitutes 
[constitute] part of a prospectus covering securities that have been 
registered under the Securities Act of 1933.''
    (iv) The registrant shall revise the document(s) containing the plan 
information sent or given to newly eligible participants pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if documents containing updating 
information would obscure the readability of the plan information.
    (2) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered with the 
document(s) containing the information required by Part I of Form S-8, 
to each employee to whom such information is sent or given, a copy of 
any one of the following:
    (i) The registrant's annual report to security holders containing 
the information required by Rule 14a-3(b) (Sec. 240.14a-3(b) of this 
chapter) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) for 
its latest fiscal year;
    (ii) The registrant's annual report on Form 10-K (Sec. 249.310 of 
this chapter), 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) or, in the case of 
registrants described in General Instruction A.(2) of Form 40-F (Sec. 
249.240f of this chapter), for its latest fiscal year;
    (iii) The latest prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) (Sec. 
230.424(b)) under the Act that contains audited financial statements for

statements are not incorporated by reference from another filing, and 
Provided further that such prospectus contains substantially the 
information required by Rule 14a-3(b) (Sec. 240.14a-3(b) of this 
chapter) or the registration statement was on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of 
this chapter) or F-1 (Sec. 239.31 of this chapter); or
    (iv) The registrant's effective Exchange Act registration statement 
on Form 10 (Sec. 249.210 of this chapter), 20-F or, in the case of 
registrants described in General Instruction A.(2) of Form 40-F, 
containing audited financial statements for the registrant's latest 
fiscal year.

Instructions. 1. If a registrant has previously sent or given an 
employee a copy of any document specified in clauses (i)-(iv) of 
paragraph (b)(2) for the latest fiscal year, it need not be re-
delivered, but the registrant shall furnish promptly, without charge, a 
copy of such document upon written or oral request of the employee.
    2. If the latest fiscal year of the registrant has ended within 120 
days (or 190 days with respect to foreign private issuers) prior to the 
delivery of the documents containing the information specified by Part I 
of Form S-8, the registrant may deliver a document containing financial 
statements for the fiscal year preceding the last fiscal year, Provided 
that within the 120 or 190 day period a document containing financial 
statements for the latest fiscal year is furnished to each employee.

    (3) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered promptly, 
without charge, to each employee to whom information is required to be 
delivered, upon written or oral request, a copy of the information that 
has been incorporated by reference pursuant to Item 3 of Form S-8 (not 
including exhibits to the information that is incorporated by reference 
unless such exhibits are specifically incorporated by reference into the 
information that the registration statement incorporates).
    (4) Where interests in a plan are registered, the registrant shall 
deliver or cause to be delivered promptly, without charge, to each 
employee to whom information is required to be delivered,

[[Page 633]]

upon written or oral request, a copy of the then latest annual report of 
the plan filed pursuant to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, whether on 
Form 11-K (Sec. 249.311 of this chapter) or included as part of the 
registrant's annual report on Form 10-K.
    (5) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered to all 
employees participating in a stock option plan or plan fund that invests 
in registrant securities (and other plan participants who request such 
information orally or in writing) who do not otherwise receive such 
material, copies of all reports, proxy statements and other 
communications distributed to its security holders generally, provided 
that such material is sent or delivered no later than the time it is 
sent to security holders.
    (c) As used in this Rule, the term employee benefit plan is defined 
in Rule 405 of Regulation C (Sec. 230.405 of this chapter) and the term 
employee is defined in General Instruction A.1 of Form S-8.

statements, it may file a single prospectus in the latest registration 
statement in order to satisfy the requirements of the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder for that offering and any other offering(s) 
registered on the earlier registration statement(s). The combined

setting forth the Commission file number at the bottom of the facing 
page of the latest registration statement.

Sec. 230.430A  Prospectus in a registration statement at the time of effectiveness.

    (a) The form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement 
that is declared effective may omit information with respect to the 
public offering price, underwriting syndicate (including any material 
relationships between the registrant and underwriters not named 
therein), underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or 
commissions to dealers, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call 
prices and other items dependent upon the offering price, delivery 
dates, and terms of the securities dependent upon the offering date; and 
such form of prospectus need not contain such information in order for 
the registration statement to meet the requirements of Section 7 of the 
Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77g) for the purposes of Section 5 thereof (15 
U.S.C. 77e), Provided, That:
    (1) The securities to be registered are offered for cash;
    (2) The registrant furnishes the undertakings required by Item 
512(i) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512(i) of this chapter); and
    (3) The information ommitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) from the 
form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement that is 
declared effective is contained in a form of prospectus filed with the 
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 497(h) under the Securities 
Act (Sec. Sec. 230.424(b) or 230.497(h) of this chapter); except that 
if such form of prospectus is not so filed by the later of fifteen 
business days after the effective date of the registration statement or 
fifteen business days after the effectiveness of a post-effective 
amendment thereto that contains a form of prospectus, or transmitted by 
a means reasonably calculated to result in filing with the Commission by 
that date, the information omitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) must 
be contained in an effective post-effective amendment to the 
registration statement.

Instruction to paragraph (a): A decrease in the volume of securities 
offered or change in the bona fide estimate of the maximum offering 
price range from that indicated in the form of prospectus filed as part 
of a registration statement that is declared effective may be disclosed 
in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Sec. 
230.424(b) or Sec. 230.497(h) under the Securities Act so long as the 
decrease in the volume or change in the price range would not materially 
change the disclosure contained in the registration statement at 
effectiveness. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease 
in volume (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not 
exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high 
end of the range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with 
the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) (Sec. 230.424(b)(1)) or Rule 
497(h) (Sec. 230.497(h)) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume 
and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate 
offering price set forth in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' 
table in the effective registration statement.

    (b) The information omitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) from the 
form of prospectus filed as part of an effective registration statement, 
and contained in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 497(h) under the Securities Act 
(Sec. Sec. 230.424(b) or 230.497(h) of this chapter), shall be deemed 
to be a part of the registration statement as of the time it was 
declared effective.
    (c) When used prior to determination of the offering price of the 
securities, a form of prospectus relating to the securities offered 
pursuant to a registration

[[Page 635]]

statement that is declared effective with information omitted from the 
form of prospectus filed as part of such effective registration 
statement in reliance upon this Rule 430A need not contain information 
omitted pursuant to paragraph (a), in order to meet the requirements of 
Section 10 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77j) for the purpose of 
section 5(b)(1) (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1)) thereof. This provision shall not 
limit the information required to be contained in a form of prospectus 
meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the Act for the purposes of 
section 5(b)(2) thereof or exception (a) of Section 2(10) (15 U.S.C. 
77b(10)) thereof.
    (d) This rule shall not apply to registration statements for 
securities to be offered by competitive bidding.
    (e) In the case of a registration statement filed on Form N-1A 
(Sec. 239.15A and Sec. 274.11A of this chapter), Form N-2 (Sec. 
239.14 and Sec. 274.11a-1 of this chapter), Form N-3 (Sec. 239.17a and 
Sec. 274.11b of this chapter), Form N-4 (Sec. 239.17b and Sec. 
274.11c of this chapter), or Form N-6 (Sec. 239.17c and Sec. 274.11d 
of this chapter), the references to ``form of prospectus'' in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section and the accompanying Note shall be deemed 
also to refer to the form of Statement of Additional Information filed 
as part of such a registration statement.
    (f) This section may apply to registration statements that are 
immediately effective pursuant to Rule 462(e) and (f) (Sec. 230.462(e) 
and (f)).

    Note: If information is omitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) from 
the form of prospectus filed as part of an effective registration 
statement, or effective post-effective amendment thereto, the registrant 
must ascertain promptly whether a form of prospectus transmitted for 
filing under Rule 424(b) of Rule 497(h) under the Securities Act 
actually was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event 
that it was not, promptly file such prospectus.

    (d) Information omitted from a form of prospectus that is part of an

of a registration statement by:
    (1) A post-effective amendment to the registration statement;

paragraph (f) of this section, shall be deemed part of and included in 
the registration statement as of the date such form of filed prospectus 
is first used after effectiveness.
    (f)(1) Information omitted from a form of prospectus that is part of

a new effective date of the part of such registration statement relating 
to the securities to which such form of prospectus relates, such part of 
the registration statement consisting of all information included in the 
registration statement and any prospectus relating to the offering of 
such securities (including information relating to the offering in a 
prospectus already included in the registration statement) as of such

statement for which liability against such person is asserted shall be 
considered as having become effective with respect to such person as of

Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512(a)(1)(ii) of this chapter), the date a 
form of prospectus is deemed part of and included in the registration 
statement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be an effective date 
established pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section as to:
    (i) Any director (or person acting in such capacity) of the issuer;

reference into the registration statement, except for such a report or

being deemed not to be a person who signed the registration statement 
within the meaning of section 11(a) of the Act).
    (5) The date a form of prospectus is deemed part of and included in 
the registration statement pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
shall not be an effective date established pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section as to:

which a new consent is required pursuant to section 7 of the Act or Rule 
436; and
    (ii) Any other person whose report or opinion as an expert or 
counsel has, with their consent, previously been included in the 
registration statement as of a prior effective date, unless the form of 
prospectus contains a new report or opinion for which a new consent is 
required pursuant to section 7 of the Act or Rule 436.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (e) or (f) of this section or 
paragraph (a) of Rule 412, no statement made in a registration statement 
or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a 
document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the 
registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration 
statement after the effective date of such registration statement or 
portion thereof in respect of an offering determined pursuant to this 
section will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to 
such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in

    (h) Where a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) 
relating to an offering does not include disclosure of omitted 
information regarding the terms of the offering, the securities, or the 
plan of distribution, or selling security holders for the securities

information has been included in periodic or current reports filed 
pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the prospectus, 
the issuer shall file a form of prospectus identifying the periodic or 
current reports that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by 
reference into the prospectus that is part of the registration statement 
that contain such omitted information. Such form of prospectus shall be 
required to be filed, depending on the nature of the incorporated

Sec. 230.432  Additional information required to be included in prospectuses relating to tender offers.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of any form for the registration of 
securities under the Act, any prospectus relating to securities to be 
offered in connection with a tender offer for, or a request or 
invitation for tenders of, securities subject to either Sec. 240.13e-4 
or section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78n(d)) must include the information required by Sec. 240.13e-4(d)(1) 
or Sec. 240.14d-6(d)(1) of this chapter, as applicable, in all tender 
offers, requests or invitations that are published, sent or given to

[64 FR 61451, Nov. 10, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 230.433  Conditions to permissible post-filing free writing prospectuses.

    (a) Scope of section. This section applies to any free writing 
prospectus with respect to securities of any issuer (except as set forth 
in Rule 164 (Sec. 230.164)) that are the subject of a registration 
statement that has been filed under the Act. Such a free writing 
prospectus that satisfies the conditions of this section may include 
information the substance of which is not included in the registration 
statement. Such a free writing prospectus that satisfies the conditions 
of this section will be a prospectus permitted under section 10(b) of 
the Act for purposes of sections 2(a)(10), 5(b)(1), and 5(b)(2) of the 
Act and will, for purposes of considering it a prospectus, be deemed to 
be public, without regard to its method of use or distribution, because 
it is related to the public offering of securities that are the subject 
of a filed registration statement.
    (b) Permitted use of free writing prospectus. Subject to the 
conditions of this paragraph (b) and satisfaction of the conditions set 
forth in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, a free writing 
prospectus may be used under this section and Rule 164 in connection 
with a registered offering of securities:
    (1) Eligibility and prospectus conditions for seasoned issuers and 
well-known seasoned issuers. Subject to the provisions of Rule 164(e), 
(f), and (g), the issuer or any other offering participant may use a 
free writing prospectus in the following offerings after a registration 
statement relating to the offering has been filed that includes a 
prospectus that, other than by reason of this section or Rule 431, 
satisfies the requirements of section 10 of the Act:
    (i) Offerings of securities registered on Form S-3 (Sec. 239.33 of 
this chapter) pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1, I.B.2, I.B.5, I.C., 
or I.D. thereof;
    (ii) Offerings of securities registered on Form F-3 (Sec. 239.13 of 
this chapter) pursuant to General Instruction I.A.5, I.B.1, I.B.2, or 
I.C. thereof;
    (iii) Any other offering not excluded from reliance on this section 
and Rule 164 of securities of a well-known seasoned issuer; and

[[Page 641]]

    (iv) Any other offering not excluded from reliance on this section 
and Rule 164 of securities of an issuer eligible to use Form S-3 or Form 
F-3 for primary offerings pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1 of such 
Forms.
    (2) Eligibility and prospectus conditions for non-reporting and 
unseasoned issuers. If the issuer does not fall within the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then, subject to the provisions of 
Rule 164(e), (f), and (g), any person participating in the offer or sale 
of the securities may use a free writing prospectus as follows:
    (i) If the free writing prospectus is or was prepared by or on 
behalf of or used or referred to by an issuer or any other offering 
participant, if consideration has been or will be given by the issuer or 
other offering participant for the dissemination (in any format) of any 
free writing prospectus (including any published article, publication, 
or advertisement), or if section 17(b) of the Act requires disclosure 
that consideration has been or will be given by the issuer or other 
offering participant for any activity described therein in connection 
with the free writing prospectus, then a registration statement relating 
to the offering must have been filed that includes a prospectus that, 
other than by reason of this section or Rule 431, satisfies the 
requirements of section 10 of the Act, including a price range where 
required by rule, and the free writing prospectus shall be accompanied 
or preceded by the most recent such prospectus; provided, however, that 
use of the free writing prospectus is not conditioned on providing the 
most recent such prospectus if a prior such prospectus has been provided 
and there is no material change from the prior prospectus reflected in 
the most recent prospectus; provided further, that after effectiveness 
and availability of a final prospectus meeting the requirements of 
section 10(a) of the Act, no such earlier prospectus may be provided in 
satisfaction of this condition, and such final prospectus must precede 
or accompany any free writing prospectus provided after such 
availability, whether or not an earlier prospectus had been previously 
provided.

    Notes to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Rule 433.

    1. The condition that a free writing prospectus shall be accompanied 
or preceded by the most recent prospectus satisfying the requirements of 
section 10 of the Act would be satisfied if a free writing prospectus 
that is an electronic communication contained an active hyperlink to 
such most recent prospectus; and
    2. A communication for which disclosure would be required under 
section 17(b) of the Act as a result of consideration given or to be 
given, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of an issuer or other 
offering participant is an offer by the issuer or such other offering 
participant as the case may be and is, if written, a free writing 
prospectus of the issuer or other offering participant.

    (ii) Where paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section does not apply, a 
registration statement relating to the offering has been filed that 
includes a prospectus that, other than by reason of this section or Rule 
431 satisfies the requirements of section 10 of the Act, including a 
price range where required by rule. For purposes of paragraph (f) of 
this section, the prospectus included in the registration statement 
relating to the offering that has been filed does not have to include a 
price range otherwise required by rule.
    (3) Successors. A successor issuer will be considered to satisfy the 
applicable provisions of this paragraph (b) if:
    (i) Its predecessor and it, taken together, satisfy the conditions, 
provided that the succession was primarily for the purpose of changing 
the state or other jurisdiction of incorporation of the predecessor or 
forming a holding company and the assets and liabilities of the 
successor at the time of succession were substantially the same as those 
of the predecessor; or
    (ii) All predecessors met the conditions at the time of succession 
and the issuer has continued to do so since the succession.
    (c) Information in a free writing prospectus. (1) A free writing 
prospectus used in reliance on this section may include information the 
substance of which is not included in the registration statement but 
such information shall not conflict with:
    (i) Information contained in the filed registration statement, 
including any prospectus or prospectus supplement that is part of the 
registration statement (including pursuant to Rule 430B

[[Page 642]]

or Rule 430C) (Sec. 230.430B or Sec. 230.430C) and not superseded or 
modified; or
    (ii) Information contained in the issuer's periodic and current 
reports filed or furnished to the Commission pursuant to section 13 or 
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) 
that are incorporated by reference into the registration statement and 
not superseded or modified.
    (2)(i) A free writing prospectus used in reliance on this section 
shall contain substantially the following legend:

    The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a 
prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication 
relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that 
registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the 
SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. 
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web 
site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the issuer, any underwriter or any 
dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the 
prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-8[xx-xxx-xxxx].

    (ii) The legend also may provide an e-mail address at which the 
documents can be requested and may indicate that the documents also are 
available by accessing the issuer's Web site and provide the Internet 
address and the particular location of the documents on the Web site.
    (d) Filing conditions. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3), 
(d)(4), (d)(5), (d)(6), (d)(7), (d)(8), and (f) of this section, the 
following shall be filed with the Commission under this section by a 
means reasonably calculated to result in filing no later than the date 
of first use. The free writing prospectus filed for purposes of this 
section will not be filed as part of the registration statement:
    (i) The issuer shall file:
    (A) Any issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in paragraph (h) 
of this section;
    (B) Any issuer information that is contained in a free writing 
prospectus prepared by or on behalf of or used by any other offering 
participant (but not information prepared by or on behalf of a person 
other than the issuer on the basis of or derived from that issuer 
information); and
    (C) A description of the final terms of the issuer's securities in 
the offering or of the offering contained in a free writing prospectus 
or portion thereof prepared by or on behalf of the issuer or any 
offering participant, after such terms have been established for all 
classes in the offering; and
    (ii) Any offering participant, other than the issuer, shall file any 
free writing prospectus that is used or referred to by such offering 
participant and distributed by or on behalf of such person in a manner 
reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination.
    (2) Each free writing prospectus or issuer information contained in 
a free writing prospectus filed under this section shall identify in the 
filing the Commission file number for the related registration statement 
or, if that file number is unknown, a description sufficient to identify 
the related registration statement.
    (3) The condition to file a free writing prospectus under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section shall not apply if the free writing prospectus 
does not contain substantive changes from or additions to a free writing 
prospectus previously filed with the Commission.
    (4) The condition to file issuer information contained in a free 
writing prospectus of an offering participant other than the issuer 
shall not apply if such information is included (including through 
incorporation by reference) in a prospectus or free writing prospectus 
previously filed that relates to the offering.
    (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section:
    (i) To the extent a free writing prospectus or portion thereof 
otherwise required to be filed contains a description of terms of the 
issuer's securities in the offering or of the offering that does not 
reflect the final terms, such free writing prospectus or portion thereof 
is not required to be filed; and
    (ii) A free writing prospectus or portion thereof that contains only 
a description of the final terms of the issuer's securities in the 
offering or of the offerings shall be filed by the issuer within two 
days of the later of the date such final terms have been established

[[Page 643]]

for all classes of the offering and the date of first use.
    (6)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this 
section, in an offering of asset-backed securities, a free writing 
prospectus or portion thereof required to be filed that contains only 
ABS informational and computational materials as defined in Item 1101(a) 
of Regulation AB (Sec. 229.1101 of this chapter), may be filed under 
this section within the timeframe permitted by Rule 426(b) (Sec. 
230.426(b)) and such filing will satisfy the filing conditions under 
this section.
    (ii) In the event that a free writing prospectus is used in reliance 
on this section and Rule 164 and the conditions of this section and Rule 
164 (which may include the conditions of paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this 
section) are satisfied with respect thereto, then the use of that free 
writing prospectus shall not be conditioned on satisfaction of the 
provisions, including without limitation the filing conditions, of Rule 
167 and Rule 426 (Sec. 230.167 and Sec. 230.426). In the event that 
ABS informational and computational materials are used in reliance on 
Rule 167 and Rule 426 and the conditions of those rules are satisfied 
with respect thereto, then the use of those materials shall not be 
conditioned on the satisfaction of the conditions of Rule 164 and this 
section.
    (iii) If a free writing prospectus used in an offering of asset-
backed securities in reliance on this section and Rule 164 includes the 
specific address of or a hyperlink to an Internet Web site containing 
static pool information and is filed in accordance with this paragraph 
(d), the static pool information relating to the asset-backed securities 
offering at that specific address is included in the free writing 
prospectus, and the filing including such address or hyperlink satisfies 
the filing conditions under this section.
    (7) The condition to file a free writing prospectus or issuer 
information pursuant to this paragraph (d) for a free writing prospectus 
used at the same time as a communication in a business combination 
transaction subject to Rule 425 (Sec. 230.425) shall be satisfied if:
    (i) The free writing prospectus or issuer information is filed in 
accordance with the provisions of Rule 425, including the filing 
timeframe of Rule 425;
    (ii) The filed material pursuant to Rule 425 indicates on the cover 
page that it also is being filed pursuant to Rule 433; and
    (iii) The filed material pursuant to Rule 425 contains the 
information specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (d):
    (i) A road show for an offering that is a written communication is a 
free writing prospectus, provided that, except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(8)(ii) of this section, a written communication that is a road show 
shall not be required to be filed; and
    (ii) In the case of a road show that is a written communication for 
an offering of common equity or convertible equity securities by an 
issuer that is, at the time of the filing of the registration statement 
for the offering, not required to file reports with the Commission 
pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, such a road show is required to be filed pursuant to this 
section unless the issuer of the securities makes at least one version 
of a bona fide electronic road show available without restriction by 
means of graphic communication to any person, including any potential 
investor in the securities (and if there is more than one version of a 
road show for the offering that is a written communication, the version 
available without restriction is made available no later than the other 
versions).

    Note to paragraph (d)(8): A communication that is provided or 
transmitted simultaneously with a road show and is provided or 
transmitted in a manner designed to make the communication available 
only as part of the road show and not separately is deemed to be part of 
the road show. Therefore, if the road show is not a written 
communication, such a simultaneous communication (even if it would 
otherwise be a graphic communication or other written communication) is 
also deemed not to be written. If the road show is written and not 
required to be filed, such a simultaneous communication is also not 
required to be filed. Otherwise, a written communication that is an 
offer contained in a separate file from a road show, whether or not the 
road show is a written communication, or otherwise transmitted 
separately

[[Page 644]]

from a road show, will be a free writing prospectus subject to any 
applicable filing conditions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (e) Treatment of information on, or hyperlinked from, an issuer's 
Web site.
    (1) An offer of an issuer's securities that is contained on an 
issuer's Web site or hyperlinked by the issuer from the issuer's Web 
site to a third party's Web site is a written offer of such securities 
by the issuer and, unless otherwise exempt or excluded from the 
requirements of section 5(b)(1) of the Act, the filing conditions of 
paragraph (d) of this section apply to such offer.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, historical 
issuer information that is identified as such and located in a separate 
section of the issuer's Web site containing historical issuer 
information, that has not been incorporated by reference into or 
otherwise included in a prospectus of the issuer for the offering and 
that has not otherwise been used or referred to in connection with the 
offering, will not be considered a current offer of the issuer's 
securities and therefore will not be a free writing prospectus.
    (f) Free writing prospectuses published or distributed by media. Any 
written offer for which an issuer or any other offering participant or 
any person acting on its behalf provided, authorized, or approved 
information that is prepared and published or disseminated by a person 
unaffiliated with the issuer or any other offering participant that is 
in the business of publishing, radio or television broadcasting or 
otherwise disseminating written communications would be considered at 
the time of publication or dissemination to be a free writing prospectus 
prepared by or on behalf of the issuer or such other offering 
participant for purposes of this section subject to the following:
    (1) The conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will not 
apply and the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) of this section 
will be deemed to be satisfied if:
    (i) No payment is made or consideration given by or on behalf of the 
issuer or other offering participant for the written communication or 
its dissemination; and
    (ii) The issuer or other offering participant in question files the 
written communication with the Commission, and includes in the filing 
the legend required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, within four 
business days after the issuer or other offering participant becomes 
aware of the publication, radio or television broadcast, or other 
dissemination of the written communication.
    (2) The filing obligation under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section 
shall be subject to the following:
    (i) The issuer or other offering participant shall not be required 
to file a free writing prospectus if the substance of that free writing 
prospectus has previously been filed with the Commission;
    (ii) Any filing made pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this 
section may include information that the issuer or offering participant 
in question reasonably believes is necessary or appropriate to correct 
information included in the communication; and
    (iii) In lieu of filing the actual written communication as 
published or disseminated as required by paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this 
section, the issuer or offering participant in question may file a copy 
of the materials provided to the media, including transcripts of 
interviews or similar materials, provided the copy or transcripts 
contain all the information provided to the media.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph (f) of this section, an issuer 
that is in the business of publishing or radio or television 
broadcasting may rely on this paragraph (f) as to any publication or 
radio or television broadcast that is a free writing prospectus in 
respect of an offering of securities of the issuer if the issuer or an 
affiliate:
    (i) Is the publisher of a bona fide newspaper, magazine, or business 
or financial publication of general and regular circulation or bona fide 
broadcaster of news including business and financial news;
    (ii) Has established policies and procedures for the independence of 
the content of the publications or broadcasts from the offering 
activities of the issuer; and
    (iii) Publishes or broadcasts the communication in the ordinary 
course.
    (g) Record retention. Issuers and offering participants shall retain 
all free writing prospectuses they have used,

[[Page 645]]

and that have not been filed pursuant to paragraph (d) or (f) of this 
section, for 3 years following the initial bona fide offering of the 
securities in question.

    Note to paragraph (g) of Sec. 230.433.
    To the extent that the record retention requirements of Rule 17a-4 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sec. 240.17a-4 of this chapter) 
apply to free writing prospectuses required to be retained by a broker-
dealer under this section, such free writing prospectuses are required 
to be retained in accordance with such requirements.

    (h) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) An issuer free writing prospectus means a free writing 
prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the issuer or used or referred to 
by the issuer and, in the case of an asset-backed issuer, prepared by or 
on behalf of a depositor, sponsor, or servicer (as defined in Item 1101 
of Regulation AB) or affiliated depositor or used or referred to by any 
such person.
    (2) Issuer information means material information about the issuer 
or its securities that has been provided by or on behalf of the issuer.
    (3) A written communication or information is prepared or provided 
by or on behalf of a person if the person or an agent or representative 
of the person authorizes the communication or information or approves 
the communication or information before it is used. An offering 
participant other than the issuer shall not be an agent or 
representative of the issuer solely by virtue of its acting as an 
offering participant.
    (4) A road show means an offer (other than a statutory prospectus or 
a portion of a statutory prospectus filed as part of a registration 
statement) that contains a presentation regarding an offering by one or 
more members of the issuer's management (and in the case of an offering 
of asset-backed securities, management involved in the securitization or 
servicing function of one or more of the depositors, sponsors, or 
servicers (as such terms are defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB) or 
an affiliated depositor) and includes discussion of one or more of the 
issuer, such management, and the securities being offered; and
    (5) A bona fide electronic road show means a road show that is a 
written communication transmitted by graphic means that contains a 
presentation by one or more officers of an issuer or other persons in an 
issuer's management (and in the case of an offering of asset-backed 
securities, management involved in the securitization or servicing 
function of one or more of the depositors, sponsors, or servicers (as 
such terms are defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB) or an affiliated 
depositor) and, if more than one road show that is a written 
communication is being used, includes discussion of the same general 
areas of information regarding the issuer, such management, and the 
securities being offered as such other issuer road show or shows for the 
same offering that are written communications.

    Note to Sec. 230.433. This section does not affect the operation of 
the provisions of clause (a) of section 2(a)(10) of the Act providing an 
exception from the definition of ``prospectus.''

<R05>
Sec. 230.436  Consents required in special cases.

    (a) If any portion of the report or opinion of an expert or counsel 
is quoted or summarized as such in the registration statement or in a 
prospectus, the written consent of the expert or counsel shall be filed 
as an exhibit to the registration statement and shall expressly state 
that the expert or counsel consents to such quotation or summarization.
    (b) If it is stated that any information contained in the 
registration statement has been reviewed or passed upon by any persons 
and that such information is set forth in the registration statement 
upon the authority of or in reliance upon such persons as experts, the 
written consents of such persons shall be filed as exhibits to the 
registration statement.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
a report on unaudited interim financial information (as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section) by an independent accountant who has 
conducted a review of such interim financial information

[[Page 646]]

shall not be considered a part of a registration statement prepared or 
certified by an accountant or a report prepared or certified by an 
accountant within the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of the Act.
    (d) The term report on unaudited interim financial information shall 
mean a report which consists of the following:
    (1) A statement that the review of interim financial information was 
made in accordance with established professional standards for such 
reviews;
    (2) An identification of the interim financial information reviewed;
    (3) A description of the procedures for a review of interim 
financial information;
    (4) A statement that a review of interim financial information is 
substantially less in scope than an examination in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is an 
expression of opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a 
whole, and, accordingly, no such opinion is expressed; and
    (5) A statement about whether the accountant is aware of any 
material modifications that should be made to the accompanying financial 
information so that it conforms with generally accepted accounting

    (e) Where a counsel is named as having acted for the underwriters or 
selling security holders, no consent will be required by reason of his 
being named as having acted in such capacity.
    (f) Where the opinion of one counsel relies upon the opinion of 
another counsel, the consent of the counsel whose prepared opinion is 
relied upon need not be furnished.
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, the security rating assigned to a class of debt 
securities, a class of convertible debt securities, or a class of 
preferred stock by a nationally recognized statistical rating 
organization, or with respect to registration statements on Form F-9 
(Sec. 239.39 of this chapter) by any other rating organization 
specified in the Instruction to paragraph (a)(2) of General Instruction 
I of Form F-9, shall not be considered a part of the registration 
statement prepared or certified by a person within the meaning of 
sections 7 and 11 of the Act.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the term

(c)(2)(vi)(F)).

    An application to the Commission to dispense with any written 
consent of an expert pursuant to section 7 of the act shall be made by 
the registrant and shall be supported by an affidavit or affidavits 
establishing that the obtaining of such consent is impracticable or 
involves undue hardship on the registrant. Such application shall be

requirement for the registrant to file the written consent of Arthur 
Andersen LLP (or a foreign affiliate of Arthur Andersen LLP)

as required by Section 7 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77g) where:
    (1) The registrant has not already obtained the written consent that 
would be required if not for this section;

    If any person who has not signed the registration statement is named 
therein as about to become a director, the written consent of such 
person shall be filed with the registration statement. Any such consent, 
however, may be omitted if there is filed with the registration 
statement a statement by the registrant, supported by an affidavit or 
affidavits, setting forth the reasons for such omission and establishing 
that the obtaining of such consent is impracticable or involves undue 
hardship on the registrant.

    (a) If the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission 
require the filing of a written consent to the use of any material in 
connection with the registration statement, such consent shall be filed 
as an exhibit to the registration statement even though the material is 
incorporated therein by reference. Where the filing of a written consent 
is required with respect to material incorporated in the registration 
statement by reference, which is to be filed subsequent to the effective 
date of the registration statement, such consent shall be filed as an 
amendment to the registration statement no later than the date on which 
such material is filed with the Commission, unless express consent to 
incorporation by reference is contained in the material to be 
incorporated by reference.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, any required 
consent may be incorporated by reference into a registration statement 
filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) (Sec. 230.462(b)) or a post-effective 
amendment filed pursuant to Rule 462(e) (Sec. 230.462(e)) from a

provided that the consent contained in the previously filed registration 
statement expressly provides for such incorporation.

Sec. 230.456  Date of filing; timing of fee payment.

    (a) The date on which any papers are actually received by the 
Commission shall be the date of filing thereof, if all the requirements 
of the act and the rules with respect to such filing have been complied 
with and the required fee paid. The failure to pay an insignificant 
amount of the required fee at the time of filing, as the result of a 
bona fide error, shall not be deemed to affect the date of filing.
    (b)(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a well-known 
seasoned issuer that registers securities offerings on an automatic 
shelf registration statement, or registers additional securities or 
classes of securities thereon pursuant to Rule 413(b) (Sec. 
230.413(b)), may, but is not required to, defer payment of all or any 
part of the registration fee to the Commission required by section 
6(b)(2) of the Act on the following conditions:
    (i) If the issuer elects to defer payment of the registration fee, 
it shall pay the registration fees (pay-as-you-

[[Page 648]]

go registration fees) calculated in accordance with Rule 457(r) (Sec. 
230.457(r)) in advance of or in connection with an offering of 
securities from the registration statement within the time required to 
file the prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) (Sec. 
230.424(b)) for the offering, provided, however, that if the issuer 
fails, after a good faith effort to pay the filing fee within the time 
required by this section, the issuer may still be considered to have 
paid the fee in a timely manner if it is paid within four business days 
of its original due date; and
    (ii) The issuer reflects the amount of the pay-as-you-go 
registration fee paid or to be paid in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section by updating the ``Calculation of Registration 
Fee'' table to indicate the class and aggregate offering price of 
securities offered and the amount of registration fee paid or to be paid 
in connection with the offering or offerings either in a post-effective 
amendment filed at the time of the fee payment or on the cover page of a 
prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) (Sec. 230.424(b)).
    (2) A registration statement filed relying on the pay-as-you-go 
registration fee payment provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
will be considered filed as to the securities or classes of securities 
identified in the registration statement for purposes of this section 
and section 5 of the Act when it is received by the Commission, if it 
complies with all other requirements of the Act and the rules with 
respect to it.
    (3) The securities sold pursuant to a registration statement will be 
considered registered, for purposes of section 6(a) of the Act, if the 
pay-as-you-go registration fee has been paid and the post-effective 
amendment or prospectus including the amended ``Calculation of 
Registration Fee'' table is filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 230.457  Computation of fee.

    (a) If a filing fee based on a bona fide estimate of the maximum 
offering price, computed in accordance with this rule where applicable, 
has been paid, no additional filing fee shall be required as a result of 
changes in the proposed offering price. If the number of shares or other 
units of securities, or the principal amount of debt securities to be 
offered is increased by an amendment filed prior to the effective date 
of the registration statement, an additional filing fee, computed on the 
basis of the offering price of the additional securities, shall be paid. 
There will be no refund once the statement is filed.
    (b) A required fee shall be reduced in an amount equal to any fee 
paid with respect to such transaction pursuant to sections 13(e) and 
14(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any applicable provision 
of this section; the fee requirements under sections 13(e) and 14(g) 
shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fee paid the Commission with 
respect to a transaction under this section. No part of a filing fee is 
refundable.
    (c) Where securities are to be offered at prices computed upon the 
basis of fluctuating market prices, the registration fee is to be 
calculated upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, 
as follows: either the average of the high and low prices reported in 
the consolidated reporting system (for exchange traded securities and 
last sale reported over-the-counter securities) or the average of the 
bid and asked price (for other over-the-counter securities) as of a 
specified date within 5 business days prior to the date of filing the 
registration statement.
    (d) Where securities are to be offered at varying prices based upon 
fluctuating values of underlying assets, the registration fee is to be 
calculated upon the basis of the market value of such assets as of a 
specified date within fifteen days prior to the date of filing, in 
accordance with the method to be used in calculating the daily offering 
price.
    (e) Where securities are to be offered to existing security holders 
and the portion, if any, not taken by such security holders is to be 
reoffered to the general public, the registration fee is to be 
calculated upon the basis of the proposed offering price to such 
security holders or the proposed reoffering price to the general public, 
whichever is higher.

[[Page 649]]

    (f) Where securities are to be offered in exchange for other 
securities (except where such exchange results from the exercise of a 
conversion privilege) or in a reclassification or recapitalization which 
involves the substitution of a security for another security, a merger, 
a consolidation, or a similar plan of acquisition, the registration fee 
is to be calculated as follows:
    (1) Upon the basis of the market value of the securities to be 
received by the registrant or canceled in the exchange or transaction as 
established by the price of securities of the same class, as determined 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If there is no market for the securities to be received by the 
registrant or cancelled in the exchange or transaction, the book value 
of such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to 
the date of filing the registration statement shall be used, unless the 
issuer of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership, or has an 
accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal 
amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.
    (3) If any cash is to be received by the registrant in connection 
with the exchange or transaction, the amount thereof shall be added to 
the value of the securities to be received by the registrant or 
cancelled as computed in accordance with (e) (1) or (2) of this section. 
If any cash is to be paid by the registrant in connection with the 
exchange or transaction, the amount thereof shall be deducted from the 
value of the securities to be received by the registrant in exchange as 
computed in accordance with (e) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (4) Securities to be offered directly or indirectly for certificates 
of deposit shall be deemed to be offered for the securities represented 
by the certificates of deposit.
    (5) If a filing fee is paid under this paragraph for the 
registration of an offering and the registration statement also covers 
the resale of such securities, no additional filing fee is required to 
be paid for the resale transaction.
    (g) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to warrants or other 
rights to purchase such securities and the holders of such warrants or 
rights may be deemed to be underwriters, as defined in section 2(11) of 
the Act, with respect to the warrants or rights or the securities 
subject thereto, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis 
of the price at which the warrants or rights or securities subject 
thereto are to be offered to the public. If such offering price cannot 
be determined at the time of filing the registration statement, the 
registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the highest of 
the following: (1) the price at which the warrants or rights may be 
exercised, if known at the time of filing the registration statement; 
(2) the offering price of securities of the same class included in the 
registration statement; or (3) the price of securities of the same 
class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. 
If the fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the price at which the 
warrants or rights may be exercised and they are exercisable over a 
period of time at progressively higher prices, the fee shall be 
calculated on the basis of the highest price at which they may be 
exercised. If the warrants or rights are to be registered for 
distribution in the same registration statement as the securities to be 
offered pursuant thereto, no separate registration fee shall be 
required.
    (h)(1) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to an employee 
benefit plan, the aggregate offering price and the amount of the 
registration fee shall be computed with respect to the maximum number of 
the registrant's securities issuable under the plan that are covered by 
the registration statement. If the offering price is not known, the fee 
shall be computed upon the basis of the price of securities of the same 
class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. 
In the case of an employee stock option plan, the aggregate offering 
price and the fee shall be computed upon the basis of the price at which 
the options may be exercised, or, if such price is not known, upon the 
basis of the price of securities of the same class, as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If there is no market for 
the securities to be offered, the book value of

[[Page 650]]

such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to the 
date of filing the registration statement shall be used.
    (2) If the registration statement registers securities of the 
registrant and also registers interests in the plan constituting 
separate securities, no separate fee is required with respect to the 
plan interests.
    (3) Where a registration statement includes securities to be offered 
pursuant to an employee benefit plan and covers the resale of the same 
securities, no additional filing fee shall be paid with respect to the 
securities to be offered for resale. A filing fee determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall be paid with respect 
to any additional securities to be offered for resale.
    (i) Where convertible securities and the securities into which 
conversion is offered are registered at the same time, the registration 
fee is to be calculated on the basis of the proposed offering price of 
the convertible securities alone, except that if any additional 
consideration is to be received in connection with the exercise of the 
conversion privilege the maximum amount which may be received shall be 
added to the proposed offering price of the convertible securities.
    (j) Where securities are sold prior to the registration thereof and 
are subsequently registered for the purpose of making an offer of 
rescission of such sale or sales, the registration fee is to be 
calculated on the basis of the amount at which such securities were 
sold, except that where securities repurchased pursuant to such offer of 
rescission are to be reoffered to the general public at a price in 
excess of such amount the registration fee is to be calculated on the 
basis of the proposed reoffering price.
    (k) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, the proposed 
maximum aggregate offering price of Depositary Shares evidenced by 
American Depositary Receipts shall, only for the purpose of calculating 
the registration fee, be computed upon the basis of the maximum 
aggregate fees or charges to be imposed in connection with the issuance 
of such receipts.
    (l) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, the proposed 
maximum aggregate offering price of any put or call option which is 
traded on an exchange and registered by such exchange or a facility 
thereof or which is traded over the counter shall, for the purpose of 
calculating the registration fee, be computed upon the basis of the 
maximum aggregate fees or charges to be imposed by such registrant in 
connection with the issuance of such option.
    (m) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, where the 
securities to be registered include (1) any note, draft, bill of 
exchange, or bankers' acceptance which meets all the conditions of 
section 3(a)(3) hereof, and (2) any note, draft, bill of exchange or 
bankers' acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not 
exceeding nine months exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof 
the maturity date of which is likewise limited, but which otherwise does 
not meet the conditions of section 3(a)(3), the registration fee shall 
be calculated by taking one-fiftieth of 1 per centum of the maximum 
principal amount of only those securities not meeting the conditions of 
section 3(a)(3).
    (n) Where the securities to be offered are guarantees of other 
securities which are being registered concurrently, no separate fee for 
the guarantees shall be payable.
    (o) Where an issuer registers an offering of securities, the 
registration fee may be calculated on the basis of the maximum aggregate 
offering price of all the securities listed in the ``Calculation of 
Registration Fee'' table. The number of shares or units of securities 
need not be included in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' Table. 
If the maximum aggregate offering price increases prior to the effective 
date of the registration statement, a pre-effective amendment must be 
filed to increase the maximum dollar value being registered and the 
additional filing fee shall be paid.
    (p) Where all or a portion of the securities offered under a 
registration statement remain unsold after the offering's completion or 
termination, or withdrawal of the registration statement, the aggregate 
total dollar

[[Page 651]]

amount of the filing fee associated with those unsold securities 
(whether computed under Sec. 230.457(a) or (o)) may be offset against 
the total filing fee due for a subsequent registration statement or 
registration statements. The subsequent registration statement(s) must 
be filed within five years of the initial filing date of the earlier 
registration statement, and must be filed by the same registrant 
(including a successor within the meaning of Sec. 230.405), a majority-
owned subsidiary of that registrant, or a parent that owns more than 50 
percent of the registrant's outstanding voting securities. A note should 
be added to the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table in the 
subsequent registration statement(s) stating the dollar amount of the 
filing fee previously paid that is offset against the currently due 
filing fee, the file number of the earlier registration statement from 
which the filing fee is offset, and the name of the registrant and the 
initial filing date of that earlier registration statement.
    (q) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no filing 
fee is required for the registration of an indeterminate amount of 
securities to be offered solely for market-making purposes by an 
affiliate of the registrant.
    (r) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to an automatic 
shelf registration statement, the registration fee is to be calculated 
in accordance with this section. When the issuer elects to defer payment 
of the fees pursuant to Rule 456(b) (Sec. 230.456(b)), the 
``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table in the registration statement 
must indicate that the issuer is relying on Rule 456(b) but does not 
need to include the number of shares or units of securities or the 
maximum aggregate offering price of any securities until the issuer 
updates the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table to reflect payment 
of the registration fee, including a pay-as-you-go registration fee in 
accordance with Rule 456(b). The registration fee shall be calculated 
based on the fee payment rate in effect on the date of the fee payment.

Sec. 230.460  Distribution of preliminary prospectus.

    (a) Pursuant to the statutory requirement that the Commission in 
ruling upon requests for acceleration of the effective date of a 
registration statement shall have due regard to the adequacy of the 
information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, 
the Commission may consider whether the persons making the offering have 
taken reasonable steps to make the information contained in the 
registration statement conveniently available to underwriters and 
dealers who it is reasonably anticipated will be invited to participate 
in the distribution of the security to be offered or sold.
    (b)(1) As a minimum, reasonable steps to make the information 
conveniently available would involve the distribution, to each 
underwriter and dealer who it is reasonably anticipated will be invited 
to participate in the distribution of the security, a reasonable time in 
advance of the anticipated effective date of the registration statement, 
of as many copies of the proposed form of preliminary prospectus 
permitted by Rule 430 (Sec. 230.430) as appears to be reasonable to 
secure adequate distribution of the preliminary prospectus.

[[Page 652]]

    (2) In the case of a registration statement filed by a closed-end 
investment company on Form N-2 (Sec. 239.14 and Sec. 274.11a-1 of this 
chapter), reasonable steps to make information conveniently available 
would involve distribution of a sufficient number of copies of the 
Statement of Additional Information required by Sec. 230.430(b) as it 
appears to be reasonable to secure their adequate distribution either to 
each underwriter or dealer who it is reasonably anticipated will be 
invited to participate in the distribution of the security, or to the 
underwriter, dealer or other source named on the cover page of the 
preliminary prospectus as being the person investors should contact in 
order to obtain the Statement of Additional Information.
    (c) The granting of acceleration will not be conditioned upon
    (1) The distribution of a preliminary prospectus in any state where 
such distribution would be illegal; or
    (2) The distribution of a preliminary prospectus (i) in the case of 
a registration statement relating solely to securities to be offered at 
competitive bidding, provided the undertaking in Item 512(d)(1) of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512(d)(2) of this chapter) is included in the 
registration statement and distribution of prospectuses pursuant to such 
undertaking is made prior to the publication or distribution of the 
invitation for bids, or
    (ii) In the case of a registration statement relating to a security 
issued by a face-amount certificate company or a redeemable security 
issued by an open-end management company or unit investment trust if any 
other security of the same class is currently being offered or sold, 
pursuant to an effective registration statement by the issuer or by or 
through an underwriter, or
    (iii) In the case of an offering of subscription rights unless it is 
contemplated that the distribution will be made through dealers and the 
underwriters intend to make the offering during the stockholders' 
subscription period, in which case copies of the preliminary prospectus 
must be distributed to dealers prior to the effective date of the 
registration statement in the same fashion as is required in the case of 
other offerings through underwriters, or
    (iv) In the case of a registration statement pertaining to a 
security to be offered pursuant to an exchange offer or transaction 
described in Rule 145 (Sec. 230.145).

shall state the date upon which it is desired that the registration 
statement shall become effective. Such requests may be made in writing 
or orally, provided that, if an oral request is to be made, a letter 
indicating that fact and stating that the registrant and the managing or 
principal underwriters are aware of their obligations under the Act must 
accompany the registration statement for a pre-effective amendment 
thereto) at the time of filing with the Commission. Written requests may 
be sent to the Commission by facsimile transmission. If, by reason of 
the expected arrangement in connection with the offering, it is to be 
requested that the registration statement shall become effective at a 
particular hour of the day, the Commission must be advised to that 
effect not later than the second business day before the day which it is 
desired that the registration statement shall become effective. A 
person's request for acceleration will

[[Page 653]]

be considered confirmation of such person's awareness of the person's 
obligations under the Act. Not later than the time of filing the last 
amendment prior to the effective date of the registration statement, the 
registrant shall inform the Commission as to whether or not the amount 
of compensation to be allowed or paid to the underwriters and any other 
arrangements among the registrant, the underwriters and other broker 
dealers participating in the distribution, as described in the 
registration statement, have been reviewed to the extent required by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and such Association 
has issued a statement expressing no objections to the compensation and 
other arrangements.
    (b) Having due regard to the adequacy of information respecting the 
registrant theretofore available to the public, to the facility with 
which the nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship 
to the capital structure of the registrant issuer and the rights of 
holders thereof can be understood, and to the public interest and the 
protection of investors, as provided in section 8(a) of the Act, it is 
the general policy of the Commission, upon request, as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section, to permit acceleration of the effective 
date of the registration statement as soon as possible after the filing 
of appropriate amendments, if any. In determining the date on which a 
registration statement shall become effective, the following are 
included in the situations in which the Commission considers that the 
statutory standards of section 8(a) may not be met and may refuse to 
accelerate the effective date:
    (1) Where there has not been a bona fide effort to make the 
prospectus reasonably concise, readable, and in compliance with the 
plain English requirements of Rule 421(d) of Regulation C (17 CFR 
230.421(d)) in order to facilitate an understanding of the information 
in the prospectus.
    (2) Where the form of preliminary prospectus, which has been 
distributed by the issuer or underwriter, is found to be inaccurate or 
inadequate in any material respect, until the Commission has received 
satisfactory assurance that appropriate correcting material has been 
sent to all underwriters and dealers who received such preliminary 
prospectus or prospectuses in quantity sufficient for their information 
and the information of others to whom the inaccurate or inadequate 
material was sent.
    (3) Where the Commission is currently making an investigation of the 
issuer, a person controlling the issuer, or one of the underwriters, if 
any, of the securities to be offered, pursuant to any of the Acts 
administered by the Commission.
    (4) Where one or more of the underwriters, although firmly committed 
to purchase securities covered by the registration statement, is subject 
to and does not meet the financial responsibility requirements of Rule 
15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sec. 240.15c3-1 of 
this chapter). For the purposes of this paragraph underwriters will be 
deemed to be firmly committed even though the obligation to purchase is 
subject to the usual conditions as to receipt of opinions of counsel, 
accountants, etc., the accuracy of warranties or representations, the 
happening of calamities or the occurrence of other events the 
determination of which is not expressed to be in the sole or absolute 
discretion of the underwriters.
    (5) Where there have been transactions in securities of the 
registrant by persons connected with or proposed to be connected with 
the offering which may have artificially affected or may artificially 
affect the market price of the security being offered.
    (6) Where the amount of compensation to be allowed or paid to the 
underwriters and any other arrangements among the registrant, the 
underwriters and other broker dealers participating in the distribution, 
as described in the registration statement, if required to be reviewed 
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), have 
been reviewed by the NASD and the NASD has not issued a statement 
expressing no objections to the compensation and other arrangements.
    (7) Where, in the case of a significant secondary offering at the 
market, the registrant, selling security holders and underwriters have 
not taken sufficient

[[Page 654]]

measures to insure compliance with Regulation M (Sec. Sec. 242.100 
through 242.105 of this chapter.
    (c) Insurance against liabilities arising under the Act, whether the 
cost of insurance is borne by the registrant, the insured or some other 
person, will not be considered a bar to acceleration, unless the 
registrant is a registered investment company or a business development 
company and the cost of such insurance is borne by other than an insured 
officer or director of the registrant. In the case of such a registrant, 
the Commission may refuse to accelerate the effective date of the 
registration statement when the registrant is organized or administered 
pursuant to any instrument (including a contract for insurance against 
liabilities arising under the Act) that protects or purports to protect 
any director or officer of the company against any liability to the 
company or its security holders to which he or she would otherwise be 
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or 
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her 
office.

Sec. 230.466  Effective date of certain registration statements on Form F-6.

    (a) A depositary that previously has filed a registration statement 
on Form F-6 (Sec. 239.36 of this chapter) may designate a date and time 
for a registration statement (including post-effective amendments) on 
Form F-6 to become effective and such registration statement shall 
become effective in accordance with such designation if the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The depositary previously has filed a registration statement on 
Form F-6 (Sec. 239.36 of this chapter), which the Commission has 
declared effective, with identical terms of deposit, except for the 
number of foreign securities a Depositary Share represents, and the 
depositary so certifies; and
    (2) The designation of the effective date and time is set forth on 
the facing-page of the registration statement, or in any pre-effective 
amendment thereto. A pre-effective amendment containing such a 
designation properly made shall be deemed to have been filed with the 
consent of the Commission.
    (b)(1) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, suspend the ability of a 
depositary to designate the date and time of effectiveness of a 
registration statement, and such suspension shall remain in effect until 
the Commission furnishes written notice to the depositary that the 
suspension has been terminated. Any suspension, so long as it is in 
effect, shall apply to any registration statement that has been filed 
but has not, at the time of such suspension, become effective and to any 
registration statement the depositary files after such suspension. Any 
such suspension applies only to the ability to designate the date and 
time of effectiveness under paragraph (a) of this section and does not 
otherwise affect the registration statement.
    (2) Any suspension under paragraph (b)(1) of this section becomes 
effective when the Commission furnishes written notice thereof to the 
depositary. The Commission may issue a suspension if it appears to the 
Commission:
    (i) That any registration statement containing a designation under 
this section is incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, 
whether or not such registration has become effective, or
    (ii) That the depositary has not complied with any of the conditions 
of this section. The depositary may petition the Commission to review 
the suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a 
request for such a hearing is included in the petition.

files, as well as the related request for withdrawal.

Sec. 230.479  Procedure with respect to abandoned registration statements and post-effective amendments.

    When a registration statement, or a post-effective amendment to such 
a statement, has been on file with the Commission for a period of nine 
months and has not become effective

[[Page 661]]

the Commission may, in its discretion, proceed in the following manner 
to determine whether such registration statement or amendment has been 
abandoned by the registrant. If the registration statement has been 
amended, otherwise than for the purpose of delaying the effective date 
thereof, or if the post-effective amendment has been amended, the nine-
month period shall be computed from the date of the latest such 
amendment.
    (a) A notice will be sent to the registrant, and to the agent for 
service named in the registration statement, by registered or certified 
mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the most recent addresses 
for the registrant and the agent for service reflected in the 
registration statement. Such notice will inform the registrant and the 
agent for service that the registration statement or amendment is out of 
date and must be either amended to comply with the applicable 
requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or be 
withdrawn within 30 days after the date of such notice.
    (b) If the registrant or the agent for service fails to respond to 
such notice by filing a substantive amendment or withdrawing the 
registration statement and does not furnish a satisfactory explanation 
as to why it has not done so within such 30 days, the Commission may, 
where consistent with the public interest and the protection of 
investors, enter an order declaring the registration statement or 
amendment abandoned.
    (c) When such an order is entered by the Commission the papers 
comprising the registration statement or amendment will not be removed 
from the files of the Commission but an order shall be included in the 
file for the registration statement in the following manner: ``Declared 
abandoned by order dated ------.''

U.S.C. 80a-54--80a-64):
    (a) Facing page. Indicate the approximate date of the proposed sale 
of the securities to the public.
    (b) Outside front cover page. If applicable, include the following 
in plain English as required by Sec. 230.421(d):
    (1) Commission legend. Provide a legend that indicates that the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of 
the securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosure 
in the prospectus and that any contrary representation is a criminal 
offense. The legend may be in one of the following or other clear and 
concise language:

    Example A: The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved 
or disapproved these securities or passed upon the adequacy of this 
prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
    Example B: The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved 
or disapproved these securities or determined if this prospectus is 
truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal 
offense.

    (2) ``Subject to Completion'' legend. (i) If a prospectus or 
Statement of Additional Information will be used before the effective 
date of the registration statement, include on the outside front cover 
page of the prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, a 
prominent statement that:
    (A) The information in the prospectus or Statement of Additional 
Information will be amended or completed;
    (B) A registration statement relating to these securities has been 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
    (C) The securities may not be sold until the registration statement 
becomes effective; and
    (D) In a prospectus, that the prospectus is not an offer to sell the 
securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy the securities in 
any state where offers or sales are not permitted, or in a Statement of 
Additional Information, that the Statement of Additional Information is 
not a prospectus.
    (ii) The legend may be in the following language or other clear and 
understandable language:

    The information in this prospectus (or Statement of Additional 
Information) is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these 
securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission is effective. This prospectus (or Statement of 
Additional Information) is not an offer to sell these securities and is 
not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the 
offer or sale is not permitted.

    (iii) In the case of a prospectus that omits pricing information 
under Sec. 230.430A, provide the information and legend in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section if the prospectus or Statement of Additional 
Information is used before the initial public offering price is 
determined.

[[Page 663]]

    (c) Table of contents. Include on either the outside front, inside 
front, or outside back cover page of the prospectus, a reasonably 
detailed table of contents. It must show the page number of the various 
sections or subdivisions of the prospectus. Include this table of 
contents immediately following the cover page in any prospectus 
delivered electronically.
    (d) Stabilization and other transactions. (1) Indicate on the front 
cover page of the prospectus if the underwriter has any arrangement with 
the issuer, such as an over-allotment option, under which the 
underwriter may purchase additional shares in connection with the 
offering, and state the amount of additional shares the underwriter may 
purchase under the arrangement. Provide disclosure in the prospectus 
that briefly describes any transaction that the underwriter intends to 
conduct during the offering that stabilizes, maintains, or otherwise 
affects the market price of the offered securities. Include information 
on stabilizing transactions, syndicate short covering transactions, 
penalty bids, or any other transactions that affect the offered 
security's price. Describe the nature of the transactions clearly and 
explain how the transactions affect the offered security's price. 
Identify the exchange or other market on which these transactions may 
occur. If true, disclose that the underwriter may discontinue these 
transactions at any time;
    (2) If the stabilizing began before the effective date of the 
registration statement, disclose in the prospectus the amount of 
securities bought, the prices at which they were bought and the period 
within which they were bought. In the event that Sec. 230.430A of this 
chapter is used, the prospectus filed under Sec. 230.497(h) or included 
in a post-effective amendment must contain information on the 
stabilizing transactions that took place before the determination of the 
public offering price shown in the prospectus; and
    (3) If you are making a warrant or rights offering of securities to 
existing security holders and the securities not purchased by existing 
security holders are to be reoffered to the public, disclose in the 
prospectus used in connection with the reoffering:
    (i) The amount of securities bought in stabilization activities 
during the offering period and the price or range of prices at which the 
securities were bought;
    (ii) The amount of the offered securities subscribed for during the 
offering period;
    (iii) The amount of the offered securities subscribed for by the 
underwriters during the offering period;
    (iv) The amount of the offered securities sold during the offering 
period by the underwriters and the price or range of prices at which the 
securities were sold; and
    (v) The amount of the offered securities to be reoffered to the 
public and the public offering price.
    (e) Dealer prospectus delivery obligations. On the outside back 
cover page of the prospectus, advise dealers of their prospectus 
delivery obligation, including the expiration date specified by Section 
4(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(3)) and Sec. 230.174. If the expiration 
date is not known on the effective date of the registration statement, 
include the expiration date in the copy of the prospectus filed under 
Sec. 230.497. This information need not be included if dealers are not 
required to deliver a prospectus under Sec. 230.174 or Section 24(d) of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24). Use the following 
or other clear, plain language:

                  Dealer Prospectus Delivery Obligation

    Until (insert date), all dealers that effect transactions in these 
securities, whether or not participating in this offering, may be 
required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealers' 
obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriters and with 
respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.

    (f) Electronic distribution. Where a prospectus is distributed 
through an electronic medium, issuers may satisfy legibility 
requirements applicable to printed documents, such as paper size, type 
size and font, bold-face type, italics and red ink, by presenting all 
required information in a format readily communicated to investors, and

where indicated, in a manner reasonably calculated to draw investor 
attention to specific information.

(15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (1940 Act), or a business development company, 
that is selling or proposing to sell its securities pursuant to a 
registration statement that has been filed under the Act. This section 
does not apply to an advertisement that is excepted from the definition 
of prospectus by section 2(a)(10) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(10)) or 
Sec. 230.498(d) or to a summary prospectus under Sec. 230.498. An 
advertisement that complies with this section, which may include 
information the substance of which is not included in the prospectus 
specified in section 10(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C 77j(a)), will be deemed 
to be a prospectus under section 10(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(b)) for 
the purposes of section 5(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1)).

    Note to paragraph (a): The fact that an advertisement complies with 
this section does not relieve the investment company, underwriter, or 
dealer of any obligations with respect to the advertisement under the 
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. For guidance about 
factors to be weighed in determining whether statements, 
representations, illustrations, and descriptions contained in investment 
company advertisements are misleading, see Sec. 230.156. In addition, 
an advertisement that complies with this section is subject to the 
legibility requirements of Sec. 230.420.

    (b) Required disclosure. This paragraph describes information that 
is required to be included in an advertisement in order to comply with 
this section.
    (1) Availability of additional information. An advertisement must 
include a statement that advises an investor to consider the investment 
objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the investment company 
carefully before investing; explains that the prospectus and, if 
available, the summary prospectus contain this and other information 
about the investment company; identifies a source from which an investor 
may obtain a prospectus and, if available, a summary prospectus; and 
states that the prospectus and, if available, the summary prospectus 
should be read carefully before investing.
    (2) Advertisements used prior to effectiveness of registration 
statement. An advertisement that is used prior to effectiveness of the 
investment company's registration statement or the determination of the 
public offering price (in the case of a registration statement that 
becomes effective omitting information from the prospectus contained in 
the registration statement in reliance upon Sec. 230.430A) must include 
the ``Subject to Completion'' legend required by Sec. 230.481(b)(2).
    (3) Advertisements including performance data. An advertisement that 
includes performance data of an open-end management investment company 
or a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment 
trust offering variable annuity contracts (trust account) must include 
the following
    (i) A legend disclosing that the performance data quoted represents 
past performance; that past performance does not guarantee future 
results; that the investment return and principal value of an investment 
will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth 
more or less than their original cost; and that current performance may 
be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The legend should 
also identify either a toll-free (or collect) telephone number or a Web 
site where an investor may obtain performance data current to the most 
recent month-end unless the advertisement includes total return 
quotations current to the most recent month ended seven business days 
prior to the date of use. An advertisement for a money market fund may 
omit the disclosure about principal value fluctuation; and

    Note to paragraph (b)(3)(i): The date of use refers to the date or 
dates when an advertisement is used by investors, not the date on which 
an advertisement is published or submitted for publication. The date of 
use

[[Page 665]]

refers to the entire period of use by investors and not simply the first 
date on which an advertisement is used.

    (ii) If a sales load or any other nonrecurring fee is charged, the 
maximum amount of the load or fee, and if the sales load or fee is not 
reflected, a statement that the performance data does not reflect the 
deduction of the sales load or fee, and that, if reflected, the load or 
fee would reduce the performance quoted.
    (4) Money market funds. An advertisement for an investment company 
that holds itself out to be a money market fund must include the 
following statement:

    An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. 
Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at 
$1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund.


A money market fund that does not hold itself out as maintaining a 
stable net asset value may omit the second sentence of this statement.
    (5) Presentation. In a print advertisement, the statements required 
by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section must be presented in 
a type size at least as large as and of a style different from, but at 
least as prominent as, that used in the major portion of the 
advertisement, provided that when performance data is presented in a 
type size smaller than that of the major portion of the advertisement, 
the statements required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section may appear 
in a type size no smaller than that of the performance data. If an 
advertisement is delivered through an electronic medium, the legibility 
requirements for the statements required by paragraph (b)(1) through 
(b)(4) of this section relating to type size and style may be satisfied 
by presenting the statements in any manner reasonably calculated to draw 
investor attention to them. In a radio or television advertisement, the 
statements required by paragraph (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section 
must be given emphasis equal to that used in the major portion of the 
advertisement. The statements required by paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section must be presented in close proximity to the performance data, 
and, in a print advertisement, must be presented in the body of the 
advertisement and not in a footnote.
    (6) Commission legend. An advertisement that complies with this 
section need not contain the Commission legend required by Sec. 
230.481(b)(1).
    (c) Use of applications. An advertisement that complies with this 
section may not contain or be accompanied by any application by which a 
prospective investor may invest in the investment company, except that a 
prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 77j(a)) by which a unit investment trust offers variable annuity 
or variable life insurance contracts may contain a contract application 
although the prospectus includes, or is accompanied by, information 
about an investment company in which the unit investment trust invests 
that, pursuant to this section, is deemed a prospectus under section 
10(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(b)).
    (d) Performance data for non-money market funds. In the case of an 
open-end management investment company or a trust account (other than a 
money market fund referred to in paragraph (e) of this section), any 
quotation of the company's performance contained in an advertisement 
shall be limited to quotations of:
    (1) Current yield. A current yield that:
    (i) Is based on the methods of computation prescribed in Form N-
1A(Sec. Sec. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter), N-3 (Sec. Sec. 
239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), or N-4 (Sec. Sec. 239.17b and 
274.11c of this chapter);
    (ii) Is accompanied by quotations of total return as provided for in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
    (iii) Is set out in no greater prominence than the required 
quotations of total return; and
    (iv) Adjacent to the quotation and with no less prominence than the 
quotation, identifies the length of and the date of the last day in the 
base period used in computing the quotation.
    (2) Tax-equivalent yield. A tax-equivalent yield that:

(Sec. Sec. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter),

[[Page 666]]

N-3 (Sec. Sec. 239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), or N-4 (Sec. Sec. 
239.17b and 274.11c of this chapter);
    (ii) Is accompanied by quotations of yield as provided for in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section and total return as provided for in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
    (iii) Is set out in no greater prominence than the required 
quotations of yield and total return;
    (iv) Relates to the same base period as the required quotation of 
yield; and
    (v) Adjacent to the quotation and with no less prominence than the 
quotation, identifies the length of and the date of the last day in the 
base period used in computing the quotation.
    (3) Average annual total return. Average annual total return for 
one, five, and ten year periods, except that if the company's 
registration statement under the Act (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) has been in 
effect for less than one, five, or ten years, the time period during 
which the registration statement was in effect is substituted for the 
period(s) otherwise prescribed. The quotations must:
    (i) Be based on the methods of computation prescribed in Form N-1A 
(Sec. Sec. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter), N-3 (Sec. Sec. 
239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), or N-4 (Sec. Sec. 239.17b and 
274.11c of this chapter);
    (ii) Be current to the most recent calendar quarter ended prior to 
the submission of the advertisement for publication;
    (iii) Be set out with equal prominence; and
    (iv) Adjacent to the quotation and with no less prominence than the 
quotation, identify the length of and the last day of the one, five, and 
ten year periods.
    (4) After-tax return. For an open-end management investment company, 
average annual total return (after taxes on distributions) and average 
annual total return (after taxes on distributions and redemption) for 
one, five, and ten year periods, except that if the company's 
registration statement under the Act (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) has been in 
effect for less than one, five, or ten years, the time period during 
which the registration statement was in effect is substituted for the 
period(s) otherwise prescribed. The quotations must:
    (i) Be based on the methods of computation prescribed in Form N-1A 
(Sec. Sec. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter);
    (ii) Be current to the most recent calendar quarter ended prior to 
the submission of the advertisement for publication;
    (iii) Be accompanied by quotations of total return as provided for 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
    (iv) Include both average annual total return (after taxes on 
distributions) and average annual total return (after taxes on 
distributions and redemption);
    (v) Be set out with equal prominence and be set out in no greater 
prominence than the required quotations of total return; and
    (vi) Adjacent to the quotations and with no less prominence than the 
quotations, identify the length of and the last day of the one, five, 
and ten year periods.
    (5) Other performance measures. Any other historical measure of 
company performance (not subject to any prescribed method of 
computation) if such measurement:
    (i) Reflects all elements of return;
    (ii) Is accompanied by quotations of total return as provided for in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
    (iii) In the case of any measure of performance adjusted to reflect 
the effect of taxes, is accompanied by quotations of total return as 
provided for in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
    (iv) Is set out in no greater prominence than the required 
quotations of total return; and
    (v) Adjacent to the measurement and with no less prominence than the 
measurement, identifies the length of and the last day of the period for 
which performance is measured.
    (e) Performance data for money market funds. In the case of a money 
market fund:
    (1) Yield. Any quotation of the money market fund's yield in an 
advertisement shall be based on the methods of computation prescribed in 
Form N-1A (Sec. Sec. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter), N-3 
(Sec. Sec. 239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), or N-4 (Sec. Sec. 
239.17b and 274.11c of this chapter) and may include:

[[Page 667]]

    (i) A quotation of current yield that, adjacent to the quotation and 
with no less prominence than the quotation, identifies the length of and 
the date of the last day in the base period used in computing that 
quotation;
    (ii) A quotation of effective yield if it appears in the same 
advertisement as a quotation of current yield and each quotation relates 
to an identical base period and is presented with equal prominence; or
    (iii) A quotation or quotations of tax-equivalent yield or tax-
equivalent effective yield if it appears in the same advertisement as a 
quotation of current yield and each quotation relates to the same base 
period as the quotation of current yield, is presented with equal 
prominence, and states the income tax rate used in the calculation.
    (2) Total return. Accompany any quotation of the money market fund's 
total return in an advertisement with a quotation of the money market 
fund's current yield under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. Place 
the quotations of total return and current yield next to each other, in 
the same size print, and if there is a material difference between the 
quoted total return and the quoted current yield, include a statement 
that the yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of 
the money market fund than the total return quotation.
    (f) Advertisements that make tax representations. An advertisement 
for an open-end management investment company (other than a company that 
is permitted under Sec. 270.35d-1(a)(4) of this chapter to use a name 
suggesting that the company's distributions are exempt from federal 
income tax or from both federal and state income tax) that represents or 
implies that the company is managed to limit or control the effect of 
taxes on company performance must accompany any quotation of the 
company's performance permitted by paragraph (d) of this section with 
quotations of total return as provided for in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section.
    (g) Timeliness of performance data. All performance data contained 
in any advertisement must be as of the most recent practicable date 
considering the type of investment company and the media through which 
the data will be conveyed, except that any advertisement containing 
total return quotations will be considered to have complied with this 
paragraph provided that:
    (1)(i) The total return quotations are current to the most recent 
calendar quarter ended prior to the submission of the advertisement for 
publication; and
    (ii) Total return quotations current to the most recent month ended 
seven business days prior to the date of use are provided at the toll-
free (or collect) telephone number or Web site identified pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section; or
    (2) The total return quotations are current to the most recent month 
ended seven business days prior to the date of use of the advertisement.

    Note to paragraph (g): The date of use refers to the date or dates 
when an advertisement is used by investors, not the date on which an 
advertisement is published or submitted for publication. The date of use 
refers to the entire period of use by investors and not simply the first 
date on which an advertisement is used.

    (h) Filing. An advertisement that complies with this section need 
not be filed as part of the registration statement filed under the Act.

    Note to paragraph (h): These advertisements, unless filed with NASD 
Regulation, Inc., are required to be filed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 230.497.

Sec. 230.483  Exhibits for certain registration statements.

    If a registration statement is prepared on a form available solely 
to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, or a business development company which is selling or proposing to 
sell its securities pursuant to a registration statement which has been 
filed under the Act, the following provisions apply:
    (a) Such registration statement shall contain an exhibit index, 
which should immediately precede the exhibits filed with such 
registration statement. The exhibit index shall indicate by handwritten, 
typed, printed or other legible form of notation in the manually

[[Page 668]]

signed original registration statement the page number in the sequential 
numbering system where such exhibit can be found. Where exhibits are 
incorporated by reference, this fact shall be noted in the exhibit index 
referred to in the preceding sentence. Further, the first page of the 
manually signed registration statement shall list the page in the filing 
where the exhibit index is located.
    (b) If any name is signed to the registration statement pursuant to 
a power of attorney, copies of such powers of attorney shall be filed as 
an exhibit to the registration statement. In addition, if the name of 
any officer signing on behalf of the registrant, or attesting the 
registrant's seal, is signed pursuant to a power of attorney, certified 
copies of a resolution of the registrant's board of directors 
authorizing such signature shall also be filed as an exhibit to the 
registration statement. A power of attorney that is filed with the 
Commission shall relate to a specific filing, an amendment thereto, or a 
related registration statement that is to be effective upon filing 
pursuant to Rule 462(b) (Sec. 230.462(b)) under the Act.
    (c)(1) All written consents are required to be filed as an exhibit 
to the registration statement, together with a list thereof. Such 
consents shall be dated and manually signed. Where the consent of an 
expert or counsel is contained in his report or opinion, a reference 
shall be made in the list to the report or opinion containing the 
consent.
    (2) In a registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) (Sec. 
230.462(b)) by a closed-end company, any required consent may be 
incorporated by reference into the registration statement from a 
previously filed registration statement related to the offering, 
provided that the consent contained in the previously filed registration 
statement expressly provides for such incorporation. Any consent filed 
in a Rule 462(b) (Sec. 230.462(b)) registration statement may contain 
duplicated or facsimile versions of required signatures, and such 
signatures shall be considered manually filed for the purposes of the 
Act and the rules thereunder.
    (d) The registrant:
    (1) May file such exhibits as it may desire in addition to those 
required by the appropriate form. Such exhibits shall be so marked as to 
indicate clearly the subject matters to which they refer;
    (2) In any case where two or more indentures, contracts, frachises, 
or other documents required to be filed as exhibits are substantially 
identical in all material respects except as to the parties thereto, the 
dates of execution, or other details, need file a copy of only one of 
such documents, with a schedule identifying the other documents omitted 
and setting forth the material details in which such documents differ 
from the document of which a copy is filed. The Commission may at any 
time in its discretion require filing of copies of any documents so 
omitted; and
    (3) If an exhibit to a registration statement (other than an opinion 
or consent), filed in preliminary form, has been changed only (i) to 
insert information as to interest, dividend or conversion rates, 
redemption or conversion prices, purchase or offering prices, 
underwriters' or dealers' commission, names, addresses or participation 
of underwriters or similar matters, which information appears elsewhere 
in an amendment to the registration statement, or (ii) to correct 
typographical errors, insert signatures or make other similar immaterial 
changes, then, notwithstanding any contrary requirement of any rule or 
form, need not refile such exhibit as so amended; provided the 
registrant states in the amendment to the registration statement the 
basis provided by this rule for not refiling such exhibit. Any such 
incomplete exhibit may not, however, be incorporated by reference in any 
subsequent filing under any Act administered by the Commission.

Sec. 230.484  Undertaking required in certain registration statements.

    If a registration statement is prepared on a form available solely 
to investment companies registered under the investment Company Act of 
1940, or

[[Page 669]]

a business development company which is selling or proposing to sell its 
securities pursuant to a registration statement which has been filed 
under the Act, if
    (a) Any acceleration is requested of the effective date of the 
registration statement pursuant to Rule 461 (Sec. 230.461), and
    (b)(1) Any provision or arrangement exists whereby the registrant 
may indemnify a director, officer or controlling person of the 
registrant against liabilities arising under the Act, or
    (2) The underwriting agreement contains provisions by which 
indemnification against such liabilities is given by the registrant to 
the underwriter or controlling persons of the underwriter and the 
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant is such an 
underwriter or controlling person thereof or a member of any firm which 
is an underwriter, and
    (3) The benefits of such indemnification are not waived by such 
persons; the registration statement shall include a brief description of 
the indemnification provisions and an undertaking in substantially the 
following form:

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities 
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling 
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or 
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against 
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities 
(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the 
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by 
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the 
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion 
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such 
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act 
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


<R05>
Sec. 230.485  Effective date of post-effective amendments filed by certain registered investment companies.

    (a) Automatic effectiveness. (1) Except as otherwise provided in 
this section, a post-effective amendment to a registration statement

investment trust or separate account as defined in section 2(a)(37) of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 USC 80a-2(a)(37)] shall become

designated by the registrant on the facing sheet of the amendment, which

    (2) A post-effective amendment filed by a registered open-end 
management investment company for the purpose of adding a series shall 
become effective on the seventy-fifth day after the filing thereof or a 
later date designated by the registrant on the facing sheet of the 
amendment, which date shall be no later than ninety-five days after the 
date on which the amendment is filed.
    (3) The Commission, having due regard to the public interest and the 
protection of investors, may declare an amendment filed under this 
paragraph (a) effective on an earlier date.
    (b) Immediate effectiveness. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, a post-effective amendment to a registration statement filed by 
a registered open-end management investment company, unit investment 
trust or separate account as defined in section 2(a)(37) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 USC 80a-2(a)(37)] shall become 
effective on the date upon which it is filed with the Commission, or a 
later date designated by the registrant on the facing sheet of the 
amendment, which date shall be not later than thirty days after the date 
on which the amendment is filed, except that a post-effective amendment 
including a designation of a new effective date pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section shall become effective on the new effective 
date designated therein, Provided, that the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) It is filed for no purpose other than one or more of the 
following:
    (i) Bringing the financial statements up to date under section 
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C.

[[Page 670]]

77j(a)(3)] or Rules 3-12 or 3-18 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-12 and 
210.3-18];
    (ii) Complying with an undertaking to file an amendment containing 
financial statements, which may be unaudited, within four to six months 
after the effective date of the registrant's registration statement 
under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.];
    (iii) Designating a new effective date for a previously filed post-
effective amendment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, which has 
not yet become effective, Provided, that the new effective date shall be 
no earlier than the effective date designated in the previously filed 
amendment under paragraph (a) of this section and no later than thirty 
days after that date;
    (iv) Disclosing or updating the information required by Item 5(b) or 
10(a)(2) of Form N-1A [17 CFR 239.15A and 274.11A];
    (v) Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems 
appropriate;
    (vi) In the case of a separate account registered as a unit 
investment trust, to make changes in the disclosure in the unit 
investment trust's registration statement to reflect changes to 
disclosure in the registration statement of the investment company in 
which the unit investment trust invests all of its assets; and
    (vii) Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.
    (2) The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for 
one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the 
prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or 
one for which the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii) of this section, has occurred since the latest of the 
following three dates:
    (i) The effective date of the registrant's registration statement;
    (ii) The effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment 
to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or
    (iii) The filing date of a post-effective amendment filed under 
paragraph (a) of this section which has not become effective.
    (3) The amendment recites on its facing sheet that the registrant 
proposes that the amendment will become effective under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (4) The representations of the registrant referred to in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature 
page of the post-effective amendment that the amendment meets all the 
requirements for effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section. If 
counsel prepared or reviewed the post-effective amendment filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the Commission 
at the time the amendment is filed a written representation that the 
amendment does not contain disclosures that would render it ineligible 
to become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) Incomplete or inaccurate amendments; suspension of use of 
paragraph (b) of this section. (1) No amendment shall become effective 
under paragraph (a) of this section if, prior to the effective date of 
the amendment, it should appear to the Commission that the amendment may 
be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, and the Commission 
furnishes to the registrant written notice that the effective date of 
the amendment is to be suspended. Following such action by the 
Commission, the registrant may file with the Commission at any time a 
petition for review of the suspension. The Commission will order a 
hearing on the matter if a request for such a hearing is included in the 
petition. If the Commission has suspended the effective date of an 
amendment, the amendment shall become effective on such date as the 
Commission may determine, having due regard to the public interest and 
the protection of investors.
    (2) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in this paragraph (c)(2), suspend the ability of registrant to 
file a post-effective amendment under paragraph (b) of this section. The 
notice of such suspension shall be in writing and shall specify the 
period for which such suspension shall remain in effect. The Commission 
may issue a suspension if

[[Page 671]]

it appears to the Commission that a registrant which files a post-
effective amendment under paragraph (b) of this section has not complied 
with the conditions of that paragraph. Any suspension under this 
paragraph (c)(2) shall become effective at such time as the Commission 
furnishes written notice thereof to the registrant. Any such suspension, 
so long as it is in effect, shall apply to any post-effective amendment 
that has been filed but has not, at the time of such suspension, become 
effective, and to any post-effective amendment that may be filed after 
the suspension. Any suspension shall apply only to the ability to file a 
post-effective amendment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and 
shall not otherwise affect any post-effective amendment. Following this 
action by the Commission the registrant may file with the Commission at 
any time a petition for review of the suspension. The Commission will 
order a hearing on the matter if a request for a hearing is included in 
the petition.
    (d) Subsequent amendments. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, a post-effective amendment that includes a 
prospectus shall not become effective under paragraph (a) of this 
section if a subsequent post-effective amendment relating to the 
prospectus is filed before such amendment becomes effective.
    (2) A post-effective amendment that includes a prospectus shall 
become effective under paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding the 
filing of a subsequent post-effective amendment relating to the 
prospectus, Provided, that the following conditions are met:
    (i) the subsequent amendment is filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section; and
    (ii) the subsequent amendment designates as its effective date 
either:
    (A) the date on which the prior post-effective amendment was to 
become effective under paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (B) a new effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section.

In this case the prior post-effective amendment filed under paragraph 
(a) of this section and any prior post-effective amendment filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section shall also become effective on the new 
effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, if 
another post-effective amendment relating to the same prospectus is 
filed under paragraph (a) of this section before the prior amendments 
filed pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have become 
effective, none of such prior amendments shall become effective under 
this section.
    (e) Certain separate accounts. For purposes of this section, a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement for an offering of 
securities by a registered open-end management investment company or 
unit investment trust as those terms are used in paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (e) of this section and as such amendments are referred to in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, shall include a post-effective 
amendment to an offering of securities by an insurance company funded 
through a separate account, as defined in section 2(a)(37) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(37)], where the 
separate account need not register under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 under section 3(c)(11) thereof [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(11)].
    (f) Electronic filers. When ascertaining the date of filing, 
electronic filers should not presume a registration statement has been 
accepted until notice of acceptance has been received from the 
Commission.
    Note: To determine the date of automatic effectiveness, the day 
following the filing date is the first day of the time period. For 
example, a post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (a) of this 
section on November 1 would become effective on December 31.

Interactive Data File exhibit as required by General Instruction C.3.(g)

time as the registrant fails to submit or post an Interactive Data File 
as required by General Instruction C.3.(g) of Form N-1A. Any such 
suspension, so long as it is in effect, shall apply to any post-
effective amendment that is filed after the suspension becomes

filed before the suspension became effective. Any suspension shall apply 
only to the ability to file a post-effective amendment pursuant to

Sec. 230.486  Effective date of post-effective amendments and registration statements filed by certain closed-end management investment companies.

    (a) Automatic effectiveness. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, a post-effective amendment to a registration statement, or a 
registration statement filed for the purpose of registering additional 
shares of common stock for which a registration statement filed on Form 
N-2 (Sec. Sec. 239.14 and 274.11a-1 of this chapter) is effective, 
filed by a registered closed-end management investment company or 
business development company which makes periodic repurchase offers 
under Sec. 270.23c-3 of this chapter, shall become effective on the 
sixtieth day after the filing thereof, or a later date designated by the 
registrant on the facing sheet of the amendment or registration 
statement, which date shall not be later than eighty days after the date 
on which the amendment or registration statement is filed, Provided, 
that the Commission, having due regard to the public interest and the 
protection of investors, may declare an amendment or registration 
statement filed under this paragraph (a) effective on an earlier date.
    (b) Immediate effectiveness. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, a post-effective amendment to a registration statement, or a

270.23c-3 of this chapter, shall become effective on the date on which 
it is filed with the Commission, or a later date designated by the 
registrant on the facing sheet of the amendment or registration 
statement, which date shall be not later than thirty days after the date 
on which the amendment or registration statement is filed, except that a 
post-effective amendment including a designation of a new effective date 
under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section shall become effective on 
the new effective date designated therein, Provided, that the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) It is filed for no purpose other than one or more of the 
following:
    (i) Registering additional shares of common stock for which a 
registration statement filed on Form N-2 (Sec. Sec. 239.14 and 274.11a-
1 of this chapter) is effective;
    (ii) Bringing the financial statements up to date under section 
10(a)(3) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)] or rule 3-18 of Regulation S-X 
[17 CFR 210.3-18];
    (iii) Designating a new effective date for a previously filed post-
effective amendment or registration statement for additional shares 
under paragraph (a) of this section, which has not yet become effective, 
Provided, that the new effective date shall be no earlier than the 
effective date designated in the previously filed amendment or 
registration statement under paragraph (a) of this section and no later 
than thirty days after that date;
    (iv) Disclosing or updating the information required by Item 9c of 
Form N-2 [17 CFR 239.14 and 274.11a-1];
    (v) Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems 
appropriate; and
    (vi) Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.

[[Page 673]]

    (2) The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for 
one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the 
prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) or one for which 
the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this 
section, has occurred since the latest of the following three dates:
    (i) The effective date of the registrant's registration statement;
    (ii) The effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment 
to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or
    (iii) The filing date of a post-effective amendment or registration 
statement filed under paragraph (a) of this section which has not become 
effective; and
    (3) The amendment or registration statement recites on the facing 
sheet thereof that the registrant proposes that the amendment or 
registration statement will become effective under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (4) The representations of the registrant referred to in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature 
page of the post-effective amendment or registration statement that the 
amendment or registration statement meets all of the requirements for 
effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section. If counsel prepared 
or reviewed the post-effective amendment or registration statement filed 
under paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the 
Commission at the time the amendment or registration statement is filed 
a written representation that the amendment or registration statement 
does not contain disclosure which would render it ineligible to become 
effective under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) Incomplete or inaccurate amendments; suspension of use of 
paragraph (b) of this section. (1) No amendment or registration 
statement shall become effective under paragraph (a) of this section if, 
prior to the effective date of the amendment or registration statement, 
it should appear to the Commission that the amendment or registration 
statement may be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, and 
the Commission furnishes to the registrant written notice that the 
effective date of the amendment or registration statement is to be 
suspended. Following such action by the Commission, the registrant may 
file with the Commission at any time a petition for review of the 
suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a 
request for such a hearing is included in the petition. If the 
Commission has suspended the effective date of an amendment or 
registration statement, the amendment or registration statement shall 
become effective on such date as the Commission may determine, having 
due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.
    (2) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in this paragraph (c)(2), suspend the ability of a registrant 
to file a post-effective amendment or registration statement under 
paragraph (b) of this section. The notice of such suspension shall be in 
writing and shall specify the period for which such suspension shall 
remain in effect. The Commission may issue a suspension if it appears to 
the Commission that a registrant which files a post-effective amendment 
under paragraph (b) of this section has not complied with the conditions 
of that paragraph. Any suspension under this paragraph shall become 
effective at such time as the Commission furnishes written notice 
thereof to the company. Any such suspension, so long as it is in effect, 
shall apply to any post-effective amendment or registration statement 
that has been filed but has not, at the time of such suspension, become 
effective, and to any post-effective amendment or registration statement 
that may be filed after the suspension. Any suspension shall apply only 
to the ability to file a post-effective amendment or registration 
statement under paragraph (b) of this section and shall not otherwise 
affect any post-effective amendment or registration statement. Following 
this action by the Commission, the registrant may file with the 
Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The 
Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for a hearing 
is included in the petition.

[[Page 674]]

    (d) Subsequent amendments. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, a post-effective amendment or registration 
statement which includes a prospectus shall not become effective under 
paragraph (a) of this section if a subsequent post-effective amendment 
or registration statement relating to the prospectus is filed before 
such amendment or registration statement becomes effective.
    (2) A post-effective amendment or registration statement which 
includes a prospectus shall become effective under paragraph (a) of this 
section notwithstanding the filing of a subsequent post-effective 
amendment or registration statement relating to the prospectus, 
Provided, that the following conditions are met:
    (i) The subsequent amendment or registration statement is filed 
under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (ii) The subsequent amendment or registration statement designates 
as its effective date either:
    (A) The date on which the prior post-effective amendment or 
registration statement was to become effective under paragraph (a) of 
this section or
    (B) A new effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section.

In this case the prior post-effective amendment or registration 
statement filed under paragraph (a) of this section and any prior post-
effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (b) 
of this section shall also become effective on the new effective date 
designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, if 
another post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to 
the same prospectus is filed under paragraph (a) of this section before 
the prior amendments or registration statements filed under paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section have become effective, none of such prior 
amendments or registration statements shall become effective under this 
section.
    (e) Condition to Use of Paragraphs (a) or (b). A post-effective 
amendment or new registration statement shall not become effective under 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section unless within two years prior to 
the filing thereof a post-effective amendment or registration statement 
relating to the common stock of the registrant has become effective.
    (f) Electronic filers. When ascertaining the date of filing, 
electronic filers should not presume a registration statement has been 
accepted until notice of acceptance has been received from the 
Commission.
    Note: To determine the date of automatic effectiveness, the day 
following the filing date is the first day of the time period. For 
example, a post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (a) of this 
section on November 1 would become effective on December 31.

Act in connection with the offering of the securities of a series of the 
unit investment trust, except the first series of such trust, may 
designate a date and time for such registration statement to become 
effective. If the registrant complies with the conditions set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the registration statement shall become 
effective in accordance with such designation.
    (2) The registrant may designate the date and time of effectiveness 
in the registration statement or in any pre-effective amendment thereto. 
A pre-effective amendment to a registration statement with respect to 
which such a designation is properly made shall be deemed to have been 
filed with the consent of the Commission and shall accordingly be 
treated as part of the registration statement.
    (b) Availability of effectiveness of a registration statement in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section is conditioned upon 
compliance with the following:
    (1) The registrant is not engaged in the business of investing in 
securities issued by one or more open-end management investment 
companies;

[[Page 675]]

    (2) The designation provided for in paragraph (a) of this section is 
set forth on the facing sheet of such registration statement or a pre-
effective amendment thereto;
    (3) The registrant identifies one or more previous series of the 
trust for which the effective date of the registration statement was 
determined by the Commission or its staff, and makes the following 
representations:
    (i) That the portfolio securities deposited in the series with 
respect to which the registration statement or pre-effective amendment 
is being filed do not differ materially in type or quality from those 
deposited in such previous series identified by the registrant; and
    (ii) That, except to the extent necessary to identify the specific 
portfolio securities deposited in, and to provide essential financial 
information for, the series with respect to which the registration 
statement or pre-effective amendment thereto is being filed, the 
registration statement or pre-effective amendment thereto does not 
contain disclosures that differ in any material respect from those 
contained in the registration statement of such previous series 
identified by the registrant;
    (4) The registrant represents that it has complied with rule 460 
under the Act (17 CFR 230.460);
    (5) The identification and representations provided for in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section are made on the signature 
page of the registration statement or a pre-effective amendment thereto; 
and
    (6) If counsel prepared or reviewed such registration statement or a 
pre-effective amendment thereto, such counsel shall furnish to the 
Commission at the time the registration statement or pre-effective 
amendment thereto is filed a written representation that such 
registration statement or pre-effective amendment does not contain 
disclosures which would render such registration statement ineligible to 
become effective pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c)(1) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, suspend the ability of a 
unit investment trust to designate the date and time of effectiveness of 
a series of such trust. Any such suspension, so long as it is in effect, 
shall apply to any registration statement that has been filed but has 
not, at the time of such suspension, become effective, and to any 
registration statement with respect to any series of such trust that may 
be filed after such suspension. Any suspension shall apply only to the 
ability to designate the date and time of effectiveness pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section and shall not otherwise affect any 
registration statement.
    (2) Any suspension pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall become effective at such time as the Commission furnishes written 
notice thereof to the company or the sponsor of the unit investment 
trust. The notice of such suspension shall be in writing and shall 
specify the period for which such suspension shall remain in effect. The 
Commission may issue such suspension if it appears to the Commission 
that any registration statement containing a designation pursuant to 
this section is incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, 
whether or not such registration statement has become effective, or that 
the registrant has not complied with the conditions of this section. 
Following such action by the Commission, the registrant may file with 
the Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The 
Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for a hearing 
is included in the petition.
    (d) When ascertaining the date of filing, electronic filers should 
not presume a registration statement has been accepted until notice of 
acceptance has been received from the Commission.

[[Page 682]]

    (3) Fund means an open-end management investment company, or any 
Series of such a company, that has, or is included in, an effective 
registration statement on Form N-1A (Sec. Sec. 239.15A and 274.11A of 
this chapter) and that has a current prospectus that satisfies the 
requirements of section 10(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(a)).
    (4) Series means shares offered by a Fund that represent undivided

other series of shares for assets specifically allocated to that series 
in accordance with Sec. 270.18f-2(a) of this chapter.
    (5) Statement of Additional Information means the statement of 
additional information required by Part B of Form N-1A.
    (6) Statutory Prospectus means a prospectus that satisfies the 
requirements of section 10(a) of the Act.
    (7) Summary Prospectus means the summary prospectus described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) General requirements for Summary Prospectus. This paragraph 
describes the requirements for a Fund's Summary Prospectus. A Summary 
Prospectus that complies with this paragraph (b) will be deemed to be a 
prospectus that is authorized under section 10(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
77j(b)) and section 24(g) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-
24(g)) for the purposes of section 5(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
77e(b)(1)).
    (1) Cover page or beginning of Summary Prospectus. Include on the 
cover page of the Summary Prospectus or at the beginning of the Summary 
Prospectus:
    (i) The Fund's name and the Class or Classes, if any, to which the 
Summary Prospectus relates.
    (ii) The exchange ticker symbol of the Fund's shares or, if the 
Summary Prospectus relates to one or more Classes of the Fund's shares, 
adjacent to each such Class, the exchange ticker symbol of such Class of 
the Fund's shares. If the Fund is an Exchange-Traded Fund, also identify 
the principal U.S. market or markets on which the Fund shares are 
traded.
    (iii) A statement identifying the document as a ``Summary 
Prospectus.''
    (iv) The approximate date of the Summary Prospectus's first use.
    (v) The following legend:
    Before you invest, you may want to review the Fund's prospectus, 
which contains more information about the Fund and its risks. You can 
find the Fund's prospectus and other information about the Fund online 
at [--------]. You can also get this information at no cost by calling 
[--------] or by sending an e-mail request to [--------].
    (A) The legend must provide an Internet address, other than the 
address of the Commission's electronic filing system; toll free (or 
collect) telephone number; and e-mail address that investors can use to 
obtain the Statutory Prospectus and other information. The Internet Web 
site address must be specific enough to lead investors directly to the 
Statutory Prospectus and other materials that are required to be 
accessible under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, rather than to the 
home page or other section of the Web site on which the materials are 
posted. The Web site could be a central site with prominent links to 
each document. The legend may indicate, if applicable, that the 
Statutory Prospectus and other information are available from a 
financial intermediary (such as a broker-dealer or bank) through which 
shares of the Fund may be purchased or sold.
    (B) If a Fund incorporates any information by reference into the 
Summary Prospectus, the legend must identify the type of document (e.g., 
Statutory Prospectus) from which the information is incorporated and the 
date of the document. If a Fund incorporates by reference a part of a 
document, the legend must clearly identify the part by page, paragraph, 
caption, or otherwise. If information is incorporated from a source 
other than the Statutory Prospectus, the legend must explain that the 
incorporated information may be obtained, free of charge, in the same 
manner as the Statutory Prospectus. A Fund may modify the legend to 
include

[[Page 683]]

a statement to the effect that the Summary Prospectus is intended for 
use in connection with a defined contribution plan that meets the 
requirements for qualification under section 401(k) of the Internal 
Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(k)), a tax-deferred arrangement under 
section 403(b) or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 403(b) or 
457), or a variable contract as defined in section 817(d) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 817(d)), as applicable, and is not 
intended for use by other investors.
    (2) Contents of the Summary Prospectus. Except as otherwise provided 
in this paragraph (b), provide the information required or permitted by 
Items 2 through 8 of Form N-1A, and only that information, in the order 
required by the form. A Summary Prospectus may omit the explanation and 
information required by Instruction 2(c) to Item 4(b)(2) of Form N-1A.
    (3) Incorporation by reference. (i) Except as provided by paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section, information may not be incorporated by 
reference into a Summary Prospectus. Information that is incorporated by 
reference into a Summary Prospectus in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section need not be sent or given with the Summary 
Prospectus.
    (ii) A Fund may incorporate by reference into a Summary Prospectus 
any or all of the information contained in the Fund's Statutory 
Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, and any information 
from the Fund's reports to shareholders under Sec. 270.30e-1 that the 
Fund has incorporated by reference into the Fund's Statutory Prospectus, 
provided that:
    (A) The conditions of paragraphs (b)(1)(v)(B) and (e) of this 
section are met;
    (B) A Fund may not incorporate by reference into a Summary 
Prospectus information that paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
require to be included in the Summary Prospectus; and
    (C) Information that is permitted to be incorporated by reference 
into the Summary Prospectus may be incorporated by reference into the 
Summary Prospectus only by reference to the specific document that 
contains the information, not by reference to another document that 
incorporates such information by reference.
    (iii) For purposes of Sec. 230.159, information is conveyed to a 
person not later than the time that a Summary Prospectus is received by 
the person if the information is incorporated by reference into the 
Summary Prospectus in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) Multiple Funds and Classes. A Summary Prospectus may describe 
only one Fund, but may describe more than one Class of a Fund.
    (c) Transfer of the security. Any obligation under section 5(b)(2) 
of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(2)) to have a Statutory Prospectus precede 
or accompany the carrying or delivery of a Fund security in an offering 
registered on Form N-1A is satisfied if:
    (1) A Summary Prospectus is sent or given no later than the time of 
the carrying or delivery of the Fund security;
    (2) The Summary Prospectus is not bound together with any materials, 
except that a Summary Prospectus for a Fund that is available as an 
investment option in a variable annuity or variable life insurance 
contract may be bound together with the Statutory Prospectus for the 
contract and Summary Prospectuses and Statutory Prospectuses for other 
investment options available in the contract, provided that:
    (i) All of the Funds to which the Summary Prospectuses and Statutory 
Prospectuses that are bound together relate are available to the person 
to whom such documents are sent or given; and
    (ii) A table of contents identifying each Summary Prospectus and 
Statutory Prospectus that is bound together, and the page number on 
which it is found, is included at the beginning or immediately following 
a cover page of the bound materials;
    (3) The Summary Prospectus that is sent or given satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section at the time of the 
carrying or delivery of the Fund security; and
    (4) The conditions set forth in paragraph (e) of this section are

[[Page 685]]

available in the manner required by paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and 
(e)(3) of this section.
    (f) Other requirements--(1) Delivery upon request. If paragraph (c)

a financial intermediary through which shares of the Fund may be 
purchased or sold) must send, at no cost to the requestor and by U.S. 
first class mail or other reasonably prompt means, a paper copy of the 
Fund's Statutory Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, and 
most recent annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders to any person 
requesting such a copy within three business days after receiving a 
request for a paper copy. If paragraph (c) or (d) of this section is 
relied on with respect to a Fund, the Fund (or a financial intermediary 
through which shares of the Fund may be purchased or sold) must send, at 
no cost to the requestor and by e-mail, an electronic copy of the Fund's 
Statutory Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, and most 
recent annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders to any person 
requesting such a copy within three business days after receiving a 
request for an electronic copy. The requirement to send an electronic 
copy of a document by e-mail may be satisfied by sending a direct link 
to the document on the Internet; provided that a current version of the 
document is directly accessible through the link from the time that the 
e-mail is sent through the date that is six months after the date that 
the e-mail is sent and the e-mail explains both how long the link will 
remain useable and that, if the recipient desires to retain a copy of 
the document, he or she should access and save the document.
    (2) Greater prominence. If paragraph (c) or (d) of this section is 
relied on with respect to a Fund, the Fund's Summary Prospectus shall be 
given greater prominence than any materials, with the exception of other 
Summary Prospectuses or Statutory Prospectuses, that accompany the 
Fund's Summary Prospectus.
    (3) Convenient for reading and printing. If paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this section is relied on with respect to a Fund:
    (i) The materials that are accessible in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section must be presented on the Web site in a format, or 
formats, that are convenient for both reading online and printing on 
paper; and
    (ii) Persons accessing the materials that are accessible in

permanently retain, free of charge, an electronic version of such 
materials in a format, or formats, that are convenient for both reading 
online and printing on paper.
    (4) Information in Summary Prospectus must be the same as 
information in Statutory Prospectus. If paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section is relied on with respect to a Fund, the information provided in 
response to Items 2 through 8 of Form N-1A in the Fund's Summary 
Prospectus must be the same as the information provided in response to 
Items 2 through 8 of Form N-1A in the Fund's Statutory Prospectus except 
as expressly permitted by paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (5) Compliance with paragraph (f) not a condition to reliance on 
paragraphs (c) and (d). Compliance with this paragraph (f) is not a 
condition to the ability to rely on paragraph (c) or (d) of this section 
with respect to a Fund, and failure to comply with paragraph (f) does 
not negate the ability to rely on paragraph (c) or (d).

 Regulation D--Rules Governing the Limited Offer and Sale of Securities 
          Without Registration Under the Securities Act of 1933

    Authority: Sections 230.501 to 230.506 issued under secs. 3(b), 
4(2), 19(a), 19(c), 48 Stat. 75, 77, 85; sec. 209, 48 Stat. 908; c.122,

    Source: Sections 230.501 through 230.506 appear at 47 FR 11262, Mar. 
16, 1982, unless otherwise noted.

    Preliminary Notes: 1. The following rules relate to transactions 
exempted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq., as amended). 
Such transactions are

[[Page 686]]

not exempt from the antifraud, civil liability, or other provisions of 
the federal securities laws. Issuers are reminded of their obligation to 
provide such further material information, if any, as may be necessary 
to make the information required under this regulation, in light of the 
circumstances under which it is furnished, not misleading.
    2. Nothing in these rules obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of securities. 
Regulation D is intended to be a basic element in a uniform system of 
Federal-State limited offering exemptions consistent with the provisions 
of sections 18 and 19(c) of the Act. In those states that have adopted 
Regulation D, or any version of Regulation D, special attention should 
be directed to the applicable state laws and regulations, including 
those relating to registration of person who receive remuneration in 
connection with the offer and sale of securities, to disqualification of 
issuers and other persons associated with offerings based on state 
administrative orders or judgments, and to requirements for filings of 
notices of sales.
    3. Attempted compliance with any rule in Regulation D does not act 
as an exclusive election; the issuer can also claim the availability of 
any other applicable exemption. For instance, an issuer's failure to 
satisfy all the terms and conditions of Rule 506 shall not raise any 
presumption that the exemption provided by section 4(2) of the Act is 
not available.
    4. These rules are available only to the issuer of the securities 
and not to any affiliate of that issuer or to any other person for 
resales of the issuer's securities. The rules provide an exemption only 
for the transactions in which the securities are offered or sold by the 
issuer, not for the securities themselves.
    5. These rules may be used for business combinations that involve 
sales by virtue of rule 145(a) (17 CFR 230.145(a)) or otherwise.
    6. In view of the objectives of these rules and the policies 
underlying the Act, regulation D is not available to any issuer for any 
transaction or chain of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with these rules, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under 
the Act is required.
    7. Securities offered and sold outside the United States in 
accordance with Regulation S need not be registered under the Act. See 
Release No. 33-6863. Regulation S may be relied upon for such offers and 
sales even if coincident offers and sales are made in accordance with 
Regulation D inside the United States. Thus, for example, persons who 
are offered and sold securities in accordance with Regulation S would 
not be counted in the calculation of the number of purchasers under 
Regulation D. Similarly, proceeds from such sales would not be included 
in the aggregate offering price. The provisions of this note, however, 
do not apply if the issuer elects to rely solely on Regulation D for 
offers or sales to persons made outside the United States.

any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisions, 
for the benefit of its employees, if such plan has total assets in 
excess of $5,000,000; any employee benefit plan within the meaning of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 if the investment 
decision is made by a plan fiduciary, as defined in section 3(21) of

insurance company, or registered investment adviser, or if the employee 
benefit plan has total assets in excess of $5,000,000 or, if a self-
directed plan, with investment decisions made solely by persons that are

[[Page 687]]

    (2) Any private business development company as defined in section 
202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940;
    (3) Any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal

    (4) Any director, executive officer, or general partner of the 
issuer of the securities being offered or sold, or any director, 
executive officer, or general partner of a general partner of that 
issuer;
    (5) Any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net 
worth with that person's spouse, at the time of his purchase exceeds 
$1,000,000;
    (6) Any natural person who had an individual income in excess of 
$200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that 
person's spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a 
reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current 
year;
    (7) Any trust, with total assets in excess of $5,000,000, not formed

230.506(b)(2)(ii); and
    (8) Any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited 
investors.
    (b) Affiliate. An affiliate of, or person affiliated with, a 
specified person shall mean a person that directly, or indirectly 
through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is 
under common control with, the person specified.
    (c) Aggregate offering price. Aggregate offering price shall mean 
the sum of all cash, services, property, notes, cancellation of debt, or 
other consideration to be received by an issuer for issuance of its 
securities. Where securities are being offered for both cash and non-
cash consideration, the aggregate offering price shall be based on the 
price at which the securities are offered for cash. Any portion of the 
aggregate offering price attributable to cash received in a foreign 
currency shall be translated into United States currency at the currency 
exchange rate in effect at a reasonable time prior to or on the date of 
the sale of the securities. If securities are not offered for cash, the 
aggregate offering price shall be based on the value of the 
consideration as established by bona fide sales of that consideration 
made within a reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair 
value as determined by an accepted standard. Such valuations of non-cash 
consideration must be reasonable at the time made.
    (d) Business combination. Business combination shall mean any 
transaction of the type specified in paragraph (a) of Rule 145 under the 
Act (17 CFR 230.145) and any transaction involving the acquisition by 
one issuer, in exchange for all or a part of its own or its parent's 
stock, of stock of another issuer if, immediately after the acquisition, 
the acquiring issuer has control of the other issuer (whether or not it 
had control before the acquisition).
    (e) Calculation of number of purchasers. For purposes of calculating 
the number of purchasers under Sec. Sec. 230.505(b) and 230.506(b) 
only, the following shall apply:
    (1) The following purchasers shall be excluded:
    (i) Any relative, spouse or relative of the spouse of a purchaser 
who has the same principal residence as the purchaser;
    (ii) Any trust or estate in which a purchaser and any of the persons 
related to him as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (e)(1)(iii) of 
this section collectively have more than 50 percent of the beneficial 
interest (excluding contingent interests);
    (iii) Any corporation or other organization of which a purchaser and 
any of the persons related to him as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section collectively are beneficial owners of more 
than 50 percent of the equity securities (excluding directors' 
qualifying shares) or equity interests; and
    (iv) Any accredited investor.
    (2) A corporation, partnership or other entity shall be counted as 
one purchaser. If, however, that entity is organized for the specific 
purpose of acquiring the securities offered and is not an accredited 
investor under paragraph

[[Page 688]]

(a)(8) of this section, then each beneficial owner of equity securities 
or equity interests in the entity shall count as a separate purchaser 
for all provisions of Regulation D (Sec. Sec. 230.501-230.508), except 
to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) A non-contributory employee benefit plan within the meaning of 
Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be 
counted as one purchaser where the trustee makes all investment 
decisions for the plan.
    (f) Executive officer. Executive officer shall mean the president, 
any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division or 
function (such as sales, administration orfinance), any other officer 
who performs a policy making function, or any other person who performs 
similar policy making functions for the issuer. Executive officers of 
subsidiaries may be deemed executive officers of the issuer if they 
perform such policy making functions for the issuer.
    (g) Issuer. The definition of the term issuer in section 2(4) of the 
Act shall apply, except that in the case of a proceeding under the 
Federal Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 101 et seq.), the trustee or debtor 
in possession shall be considered the issuer in an offering under a plan 
or reorganization, if the securities are to be issued under the plan.
    (h) Purchaser representative. Purchaser representative shall mean 
any person who satisfies all of the following conditions or who the 
issuer reasonably believes satisfies all of the following conditions:
    (1) Is not an affiliate, director, officer or other employee of the 
issuer, or beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of any class of the 
equity securities or 10 percent or more of the equity interest in the 
issuer, except where the purchaser is:
    (i) A relative of the purchaser representative by blood, marriage or 
adoption and not more remote than a first cousin;
    (ii) A trust or estate in which the purchaser representative and any 
persons related to him as specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section collectively have more than 50 percent of 
the beneficial interest (excluding contingent interest) or of which the 
purchaser representative serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar 
capacity; or
    (iii) A corporation or other organization of which the purchaser 
representative and any persons related to him as specified in paragraph 
(h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this section collectively are the beneficial 
owners of more than 50 percent of the equity securities (excluding 
directors' qualifying shares) or equity interests;
    (2) Has such knowledge and experience in financial and business 
matters that he is capable of evaluating, alone, or together with other 
purchaser representatives of the purchaser, or together with the 
purchaser, the merits and risks of the prospective investment;
    (3) Is acknowledged by the purchaser in writing, during the course 
of the transaction, to be his purchaser representative in connection 
with evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment; and
    (4) Discloses to the purchaser in writing a reasonable time prior to 
the sale of securities to that purchaser any material relationship 
between himself or his affiliates and the issuer or its affiliates that 
then exists, that is mutually understood to be contemplated, or that has 
existed at any time during the previous two years, and any compensation 
received or to be received as a result of such relationship.

    Note 1: A person acting as a purchaser representative should 
consider the applicability of the registration and antifraud provisions 
relating to brokers and dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (Exchange Act) (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., as amended) and relating to 
investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
    Note 2: The acknowledgment required by paragraph (h)(3) and the 
disclosure required by paragraph (h)(4) of this section must be made 
with specific reference to each prospective investment. Advance blanket 
acknowledgment, such as for all securities transactions or all private 
placements, is not sufficient.
    Note 3: Disclosure of any material relationships between the 
purchaser representative or his affiliates and the issuer or its 
affiliates does not relieve the purchaser representative of his 
obligation to act in the interest of the purchaser.

<R05>
Sec. 230.502  General conditions to be met.

    The following conditions shall be applicable to offers and sales 
made under Regulation D (Sec. Sec. 230.501-230.508):
    (a) Integration. All sales that are part of the same Regulation D 
offering must meet all of the terms and conditions of Regulation D. 
Offers and sales that are made more than six months before the start of 
a Regulation D offering or are made more than six months after 
completion of a Regulation D offering will not be considered part of 
that Regulation D offering, so long as during those six month periods 
there are no offers or sales of securities by or for the issuer that are 
of the same or a similar class as those offered or sold under Regulation 
D, other than those offers or sales of securities under an employee 
benefit plan as defined in rule 405 under the Act (17 CFR 230.405).

    Note: The term offering is not defined in the Act or in Regulation 
D. If the issuer offers or sells securities for which the safe harbor 
rule in paragraph (a) of this Sec. 230.502 is unavailable, the 
determination as to whether separate sales of securities are part of the 
same offering (i.e., are considered integrated) depends on the 
particular facts and circumstances. Generally, transactions otherwise 
meeting the requirements of an exemption will not be integrated with 
simultaneous offerings being made outside the United States in 
compliance with Regulation S. See Release No. 33-6863.
    The following factors should be considered in determining whether 
offers and sales should be integrated for purposes of the exemptions 
under Regulation D:
    (a) Whether the sales are part of a single plan of financing;
    (b) Whether the sales involve issuance of the same class of 
securities;
    (c) Whether the sales have been made at or about the same time;
    (d) Whether the same type of consideration is being received; and
    (e) Whether the sales are made for the same general purpose.

See Release 33-4552 (November 6, 1962) [27 FR 11316].

    (b) Information requirements--(1) When information must be 
furnished. If the issuer sells securities under Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 
230.506 to any purchaser that is not an accredited investor, the issuer 
shall furnish the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section to such purchaser a reasonable time prior to sale. The issuer is 
not required to furnish the specified information to purchasers when it 
sells securities under Sec. 230.504, or to any accredited investor.

    Note: When an issuer provides information to investors pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1), it should consider providing such information to 
accredited investors as well, in view of the anti-fraud provisions of 
the federal securities laws.

    (2) Type of information to be furnished. (i) If the issuer is not 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities the 
issuer shall furnish to the purchaser, to the extent material to an 
understanding of the issuer, its business and the securities being 
offered:
    (A) Non-financial statement information. If the issuer is eligible 
to use Regulation A (Sec. 230.251-263), the same kind of information as 
would be required in Part II of Form 1-A (Sec. 239.90 of this chapter). 
If the issuer is not eligible to use Regulation A, the same kind of 
information as required in Part I of a registration statement filed 
under the Securities Act on the form that the issuer would be entitled 
to use.
    (B) Financial statement information--(1) Offerings up to $2,000,000. 
The information required in Article 8 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.8 of 
this chapter), except that only the issuer's balance sheet, which shall 
be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must be audited.
    (2) Offerings up to $7,500,000. The financial statement information 
required in Form S-1 (Sec. 239.10 of this chapter) for smaller 
reporting companies. If an issuer, other than a limited partnership, 
cannot obtain audited financial statements without unreasonable effort 
or expense, then only the issuer's balance sheet, which shall be dated 
within 120 days of the start of the offering, must be audited. If the 
issuer is a limited partnership and cannot obtain the required financial 
statements without unreasonable effort or expense, it may furnish 
financial statements that have been prepared on the basis of Federal 
income tax requirements and examined and reported on in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards by an independent public or 
certified accountant.

[[Page 690]]

    (3) Offerings over $7,500,000. The financial statement as would be 
required in a registration statement filed under the Act on the form 
that the issuer would be entitled to use. If an issuer, other than a 
limited partnership, cannot obtain audited financial statements without 
unreasonable effort or expense, then only the issuer's balance sheet, 
which shall be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must 
be audited. If the issuer is a limited partnership and cannot obtain the 
required financial statements without unreasonable effort or expense, it 
may furnish financial statements that have been prepared on the basis of 
Federal income tax requirements and examined and reported on in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent 
public or certified accountant.
    (C) If the issuer is a foreign private issuer eligible to use Form 
20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter), the issuer shall disclose the 
same kind of information required to be included in a registration 
statement filed under the Act on the form that the issuer would be 
entitled to use. The financial statements need be certified only to the 
extent required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) (B) (1), (2) or (3) of this 
section, as appropriate.
    (ii) If the issuer is subject to the reporting requirements of 
section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to 
the sale of securities the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser the 
information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, 
and in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) 
of this section:
    (A) The issuer's annual report to shareholders for the most recent 
fiscal year, if such annual report meets the requirements of Rules 14a-3 
or 14c-3 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.14a-3 or Sec. 240.14c-3 of 
this chapter), the definitive proxy statement filed in connection with 
that annual report, and if requested by the purchaser in writing, a copy 
of the issuer's most recent Form 10-K (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) 
under the Exchange Act.
    (B) The information contained in an annual report on Form 10-K 
(Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act or in a 
registration statement on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of this chapter) or S-
11 (Sec. 239.18 of this chapter) under the Act or on Form 10 (Sec. 
249.210 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act, whichever filing is the 
most recent required to be filed.
    (C) The information contained in any reports or documents required 
to be filed by the issuer under sections 13(a), 14(a), 14(c), and 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act since the distribution or filing of the report or 
registration statement specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) or (B), 
and a brief description of the securities being offered, the use of the 
proceeds from the offering, and any material changes in the issuer's 
affairs that are not disclosed in the documents furnished.
    (D) If the issuer is a foreign private issuer, the issuer may 
provide in lieu of the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (A) 
or (B) of this section, the information contained in its most recent 
filing on Form 20-F or Form F-1 (Sec. 239.31 of the chapter).
    (iii) Exhibits required to be filed with the Commission as part of a 
registration statement or report, other than an annual report to 
shareholders or parts of that report incorporated by reference in a Form 
10-K report, need not be furnished to each purchaser that is not an 
accredited investor if the contents of material exhibits are identified 
and such exhibits are made available to a purchaser, upon his or her 
written request, a reasonable time before his or her purchase.
    (iv) At a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities to any 
purchaser that is not an accredited investor in a transaction under 
Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506, the issuer shall furnish to the 
purchaser a brief description in writing of any material written 
information concerning the offering that has been provided by the issuer 
to any accredited investor but not previously delivered to such 
unaccredited purchaser. The issuer shall furnish any portion or all of 
this information to the purchaser, upon his written request a reasonable 
time prior to his purchase.
    (v) The issuer shall also make available to each purchaser at a 
reasonable time prior to his purchase of securities in a transaction 
under Sec. 230.505 or

[[Page 691]]

Sec. 230.506 the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers 
concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain any 
additional information which the issuer possesses or can acquire without 
unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy 
of information furnished under paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this 
section.
    (vi) For business combinations or exchange offers, in addition to 
information required by Form S-4 (17 CFR 239.25), the issuer shall 
provide to each purchaser at the time the plan is submitted to security 
holders, or, with an exchange, during the course of the transaction and 
prior to sale, written information about any terms or arrangements of 
the proposed transactions that are materially different from those for 
all other security holders. For purposes of this subsection, an issuer 
which is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act may satisfy the requirements of Part I.B. or 
C. of Form S-4 by compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this Sec. 
230.502.
    (vii) At a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities to any 
purchaser that is not an accredited investor in a transaction under 
Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506, the issuer shall advise the purchaser of 
the limitations on resale in the manner contained in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section. Such disclosure may be contained in other materials 
required to be provided by this paragraph.
    (c) Limitation on manner of offering. Except as provided in Sec. 
230.504(b)(1), neither the issuer nor any person acting on its behalf 
shall offer or sell the securities by any form of general solicitation 
or general advertising, including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) Any advertisement, article, notice or other communication 
published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over 
television or radio; and
    (2) Any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any 
general solicitation or general advertising; Provided, however, that 
publication by an issuer of a notice in accordance with Sec. 230.135c 
or filing with the Commission by an issuer of a notice of sales on Form 
D (17 CFR 239.500) in which the issuer has made a good faith and 
reasonable attempt to comply with the requirements of such form, shall 
not be deemed to constitute general solicitation or general advertising 
for purposes of this section; Provided further, that, if the 
requirements of Sec. 230.135e are satisfied, providing any journalist 
with access to press conferences held outside of the United States, to 
meetings with issuer or selling security holder representatives 
conducted outside of the United States, or to written press-related 
materials released outside the United States, at or in which a present 
or proposed offering of securities is discussed, will not be deemed to 
constitute general solicitation or general advertising for purposes of 
this section.
    (d) Limitations on resale. Except as provided in Sec. 
230.504(b)(1), securities acquired in a transaction under Regulation D 
shall have the status of securities acquired in a transaction under 
section 4(2) of the Act and cannot be resold without registration under 
the Act or an exemption therefrom. The issuer shall exercise reasonable 
care to assure that the purchasers of the securities are not 
underwriters within the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act, which 
reasonable care may be demonstrated by the following:
    (1) Reasonable inquiry to determine if the purchaser is acquiring 
the securities for himself or for other persons;
    (2) Written disclosure to each purchaser prior to sale that the 
securities have not been registered under the Act and, therefore, cannot 
be resold unless they are registered under the Act or unless an 
exemption from registration is available; and
    (3) Placement of a legend on the certificate or other document that 
evidences the securities stating that the securities have not been 
registered under the Act and setting forth or referring to the 
restrictions on transferability and sale of the securities.

While taking these actions will establish the requisite reasonable care, 
it is not the exclusive method to demonstrate such care. Other actions 
by the issuer may satisfy this provision. In addition, Sec. 
230.502(b)(2)(vii) requires the delivery of written disclosure of

[[Page 692]]

the limitations on resale to investors in certain instances.

identified in response to Item 3 of the notice of sales on Form D;
    (B) An issuer's revenues or aggregate net asset value;

Sec. 230.504  Exemption for limited offerings and sales of securities not exceeding $1,000,000.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
conditions in

[[Page 693]]

paragraph (b) of this Sec. 230.504 by an issuer that is not:
    (1) Subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act,;
    (2) An investment company; or
    (3) A development stage company that either has no specific business 
plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in 
a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or 
other entity or person, shall be exempt from the provision of section 5 
of the Act under section 3(b) of the Act.
    (b) Conditions to be met--(1) General conditions. To qualify for 
exemption under this Sec. 230.504, offers and sales must satisfy the 
terms and conditions of Sec. Sec. 230.501 and 230.502 (a), (c) and (d), 
except that the provisions of Sec. 230.502 (c) and (d) will not apply 
to offers and sales of securities under this Sec. 230.504 that are 
made:
    (i) Exclusively in one or more states that provide for the 
registration of the securities, and require the public filing and 
delivery to investors of a substantive disclosure document before sale, 
and are made in accordance with those state provisions;
    (ii) In one or more states that have no provision for the 
registration of the securities or the public filing or delivery of a 
disclosure document before sale, if the securities have been registered 
in at least one state that provides for such registration, public filing 
and delivery before sale, offers and sales are made in that state in 
accordance with such provisions, and the disclosure document is 
delivered before sale to all purchasers (including those in the states 
that have no such procedure); or
    (iii) Exclusively according to state law exemptions from 
registration that permit general solicitation and general advertising so 
long as sales are made only to ``accredited investors'' as defined in 
Sec. 230.501(a).
    (2) The aggregate offering price for an offering of securities under 
this Sec. 230.504, as defined in Sec. 230.501(c), shall not exceed 
$1,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all securities sold 
within the twelve months before the start of and during the offering of 
securities under this Sec. 230.504, in reliance on any exemption under 
section 3(b), or in violation of section 5(a) of the Securities Act.
    Note 1: The calculation of the aggregate offering price is 
illustrated as follows:
    If an issuer sold $900,000 on June 1, 1987 under this Sec. 230.504 
and an additional $4,100,000 on December 1, 1987 under Sec. 230.505, 
the issuer could not sell any of its securities under this Sec. 230.504 
until December 1, 1988. Until then the issuer must count the December 1, 
1987 sale towards the $1,000,000 limit within the preceding twelve 
months.
    Note 2: If a transaction under Sec. 230.504 fails to meet the 
limitation on the aggregate offering price, it does not affect the 
availability of this Sec. 230.504 for the other transactions considered 
in applying such limitation. For example, if an issuer sold $1,000,000 
worth of its securities on January 1, 1988 under this Sec. 230.504 and 
an additional $500,000 worth on July 1, 1988, this Sec. 230.504 would 
not be available for the later sale, but would still be applicable to 
the January 1, 1988 sale.

[57 FR 36473, Aug. 13, 1992, as amended at 61 FR 30402, June 14, 1996; 
64 FR 11094, Mar. 8, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 230.505  Exemption for limited offers and sales of securities not exceeding $5,000,000.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
conditions in paragraph (b) of this section by an issuer that is not an 
investment company shall be exempt from the provisions of section 5 of 
the Act under section 3(b) of the Act.
    (b) Conditions to be met--(1) General conditions. To qualify for 
exemption under this section, offers and sales must satisfy the terms 
and conditions of Sec. Sec. 230.501 and 230.502.
    (2) Specific conditions--(i) Limitation on aggregate offering price. 
The aggregate offering price for an offering of securities under this 
Sec. 230.505, as defined in Sec. 203.501(c), shall not exceed 
$5,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all securities sold 
within the twelve months before the start of and during the offering of 
securities under this section in reliance on any exemption under section 
3(b) of the Act or in violation of section 5(a) of the Act.

    Note: The calculation of the aggregate offering price is illustrated 
as follows:
    Example 1: If an issuer sold $2,000,000 of its securities on June 1, 
1982 under this Sec. 230.505 and an additional $1,000,000 on September 
1, 1982, the issuer would be permitted to sell only $2,000,000 more 
under this Sec. 230.505 until

[[Page 694]]

June 1, 1983. Until that date the issuer must count both prior sales 
towards the $5,000,000 limit. However, if the issuer made its third sale 
on June 1, 1983, the issuer could then sell $4,000,000 of its securities 
because the June 1, 1982 sale would not be within the preceding twelve 
months.
    Example 2: If an issuer sold $500,000 of its securities on June 1, 
1982 under Sec. 230.504 and an additional $4,500,000 on December 1, 
1982 under this section, then the issuer could not sell any of its 
securities under this section until June 1, 1983. At that time it could 
sell an additional $500,000 of its securities.

    (ii) Limitation on number of purchasers. There are no more than or 
the issuer reasonably believes that there are no more than 35 purchasers 
of securities from the issuer in any offering under this section.
    (iii) Disqualifications. No exemption under this section shall be 
available for the securities of any issuer described in Sec. 230.262 of 
Regulation A, except that for purposes of this section only:
    (A) The term ``filing of the offering statement required by Sec. 
230.252'' as used in Sec. 230.262(a), (b) and (c) shall mean the first 
sale of securities under this section;
    (B) The term ``underwriter'' as used in Sec. 230.262 (b) and (c) 
shall mean a person that has been or will be paid directly or indirectly 
remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in connection with sales of 
securities under this section; and
    (C) Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section shall not apply to any 
issuer if the Commission determines, upon a showing of good cause, that 
it is not necessary under the circumstances that the exemption be 
denied. Any such determination shall be without prejudice to any other 
action by the Commission in any other proceeding or matter with respect 
to the issuer or any other person.

57 FR 36473, Aug. 13, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 230.506  Exemption for limited offers and sales without regard to dollar amount of offering.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities by an issuer that 
satisfy the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed 
to be transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning 
of section 4(2) of the Act.
    (b) Conditions to be met--(1) General conditions. To qualify for an 
exemption under this section, offers and sales must satisfy all the 
terms and conditions of Sec. Sec. 230.501 and 230.502.
    (2) Specific conditions--(i) Limitation on number of purchasers. 
There are no more than or the issuer reasonably believes that there are 
no more than 35 purchasers of securities from the issuer in any offering 
under this section.

    Note: See Sec. 230.501(e) for the calculation of the number of 
purchasers and Sec. 230.502(a) for what may or may not constitute an 
offering under this section.

    (ii) Nature of purchasers. Each purchaser who is not an accredited 
investor either alone or with his purchaser representative(s) has such 
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is 
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective 
investment, or the issuer reasonably believes immediately prior to 
making any sale that such purchaser comes within this description.

    (a) No exemption under Sec. 230.505, Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506 
shall be available for an issuer if such issuer, any of its predecessors 
or affiliates have been subject to any order, judgment, or decree of any 
court of competent jurisdiction temporarily, preliminary or permanently 
enjoining such person for failure to comply with Sec. 230.503.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if the Commission 
determines, upon a showing of good cause, that it is not necessary under 
the circumstances that the exemption be denied.

[[Page 695]]

the loss of the exemption from the requirements of section 5 of the Act 
for any offer or sale to a particular individual or entity, if the 
person relying on the exemption shows:
    (1) The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or 
requirement directly intended to protect that particular individual or 
entity; and
    (2) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the 
offering as a whole, provided that any failure to comply with paragraph 
(c) of Sec. 230.502, paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 230.504, paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of Sec. 230.505 and paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Sec. 
230.506 shall be deemed to be significant to the offering as a whole; 
and
    (3) A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all 
applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Sec. 230.504, Sec. 
230.505 or Sec. 230.506.
    (b) A transaction made in reliance on Sec. 230.504, Sec. 230.505 
or Sec. 230.506 shall comply with all applicable terms, conditions and 
requirements of Regulation D. Where an exemption is established only 
through reliance upon paragraph (a) of this section, the failure to 
comply shall nonetheless be actionable by the Commission under section 
20 of the Act.

prior to the time of such written offer; and
    (2) No securities of such issuer shall be sold under Sec. Sec. 
230.601 to 230.610a unless such an offering circular is given to the 
person to whom the securities were sold, or is sent to such person under 
such circumstances that it would normally be received by him, with or 
prior to any confirmation of the sale, or prior to the payment by him of 
all or any part of the purchase price of the securities, whichever first 
occurs.
    (b) Any written advertisement or other written communication, or any 
radio or television broadcast, which states from whom an offering

readily communicated to investors.
    (d) If the offering is not completed within nine months from the

cooperate, or has obstructed or refused to permit the making of an 
investigation by the Commission in connection with any offering made or 
proposed to be made hereunder.
    (b) Upon the entry of an order under paragraph (a) of this section,

    (B) A brief discussion of how the issuer proposes to achieve its 
objectives, including:

the proportion of the assets which may be invested in each such type of 
security;
    (2) If the issuer proposes to have a policy of concentrating in a 
particular industry or group of industries, identification of such 
industry or industries. (Concentration, for purposes of this item, is 
deemed to be 25% or more of the value of the issuer's total assets 
invested or proposed to be invested in a particular industry or group of 
industries).
    (C) A concise description of any other policies of the issuer that 
may not be changed without the vote of the majority of the outstanding 
voting securities, including those policies which the issuer deems to be 
fundamental within the meaning of Section 8(b) of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940.
    (D) A concise description of those significant investment policies 
or techniques (such as investing for control or management or investing 
in other investment companies) that are not described pursuant to 
subparagraphs (B) or (C) above that issuer employs or has the current 
intention of employing in the foreseeable future.

    Note: If the effect of a policy is to prohibit a particular 
practice, or, if the policy permits a particular practice but the issuer 
has not employed that practice within the past year and has no current 
intention of doing so in the foreseeable future, do not include 
disclosure as to that policy.

    (b) Discuss briefly the principal risk factors associated with 
investment in the issuer, including factors peculiar to the issuer as 
well as those generally attendant to investment in a small business 
investment company with investment policies and objectives similar to 
the issuer.

                      Item 3. Plan of Distribution

    (a) If the securities are to be offered through underwriters, give

paid to dealers, including all cash, securities, contracts or other 
consideration to be received by any dealer in connection with the sale

of the services rendered and the nature of any relationship between the

directors, promoters, principal stockholders and underwriters (including 
any affiliates thereof). If a finder is not registered with the 
Commission as a broker or dealer, disclose that fact.
    (d) Outline briefly the plan of distribution of any securities being 
issued which are to be offered through the selling efforts of brokers or 
dealers or otherwise than through underwriters.
    (e)(1) Describe any arrangements for the return of funds to

there are no such arrangements, so state.
    (2) If there will be material delay in the payment of the proceeds 
of the offering by the underwriter to the issuer, the nature of the 
delay and the effects on the issuer should be briefly described.

      Item 4. Management and Certain Security Holders of the Issuer

    (a) Give the full names and complete addresses of all directors, 
officers, members of any advisory board of the issuer and any person who

investment company as defined in Sec. 230.602(a) of this chapter).
    (b) Identify each person who as of a specified date no more than 30 
days prior to the date of filing of this registration statement, 
controls the issuer as specified in section 2(a)(9) of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940.

person named in (a) above who is or is expected to be significantly

advisory services, direction or control of portfolio companies of the 
issuer.
    (d) State the aggregate annual remuneration of each of the three 
highest-paid persons who are officers or directors of the issuer and all 
officers and directors as a group during the issuer's last fiscal year.

    (e) Describe all direct and indirect interests (by security holdings 
or otherwise) of each person named in (a) above (i) in the issuer and 
(ii) in any material transactions within the past two years or in any 
material proposed transaction to which the issuer was or is to be a

which any payment by or for the account of the issuer has been or is to 
be made.
    (f) Provide, if applicable, for each investment adviser of the 
issuer as defined in section 2(a)(20) of the Investment Company Act of

    (i) The name and address of the investment adviser and a brief 
description of its experience as an investment adviser, and, if the 
investment adviser is controlled by another person, the name of that 
person and the general nature of its business. (If the investment 
adviser is subject to more than one level of control, it is sufficient 
to give the name of the ultimate control person.)
    (ii) A brief description of the services provided by the investment 
adviser. (If, in addition to providing investment advice, the investment 
adviser or persons employed by or associated with the investment adviser 
are, subject to the authority of the board of directors, responsible for 
overall management of issuer's business affairs, it is sufficient to 
state that fact in lieu of listing all services provided.)
    (iii) A brief description of the investment adviser's compensation. 
(If the issuer has been in operation for a full fiscal year, provide the 
compensation paid to the adviser for the most recent fiscal year as a 
percentage of average net assets. No further information is required in 
response to this Item if the adviser is paid on the basis of a 
percentage of net assets and if the issuer has neither changed 
investment advisers nor changed the basis on which the adviser was 
compensated during the most recent fiscal year. If the fee is paid in 
some manner other than on the basis of average net assets, briefly 
describe the basis of payment. If the registrant has not been in 
operation for a full fiscal year, state generally what the investment 
adviser's fee will be as a percentage of average net assets, including 
any breakpoints, but it is not necessary to include precise details as 
to how the fee is computed or paid.)

                       Item 5. Portfolio Companies

    Furnish the following information, in the tabular form indicated,

    (e) Describe briefly the tax consequences to investors of an 
investment in the securities being offered. Such description should not

qualify for treatment under Subchapter M, it is sufficient, in the 
absence of special circumstances, to state briefly that in that case: 
(1) the issuer will distribute all of its net income and gains to 
shareholders and that such distributions are taxable income or capital 
gains; (ii) shareholders may be proportionately liable for taxes on

the past three years, or which they have a right to acquire, there 
should be included a comparison of the public contribution under the 
proposed public offering and the effective cash contribution of such 
persons. In such cases, and in other instances where the extent of the 
dilution makes it appropriate, the following shall be given: (1) the net 
tangible book value per share before and after the distribution; (2) the 
amount of the increase in such net tangible book value per share 
attributable to the cash payment made by purchasers of the shares being

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 230.651-230.656  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 230.701  Exemption for offers and sales of securities pursuant to certain compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation.

    Preliminary Notes: 1. This section relates to transactions exempted 
from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
77e). These transactions are not exempt from the antifraud, civil 
liability, or other provisions of the federal securities laws. Issuers 
and persons acting on their behalf have an obligation to provide 
investors with disclosure adequate to satisfy the antifraud provisions 
of the federal securities laws.
    2. In addition to complying with this section, the issuer also must 
comply with any applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of 
securities.
    3. An issuer that attempts to comply with this section, but fails to 
do so, may claim any other exemption that is available.
    4. This section is available only to the issuer of the securities. 
Affiliates of the issuer may not use this section to offer or sell 
securities. This section also does not cover resales of securities by 
any person. This section provides an exemption only for the transactions 
in which the securities are offered or sold by the issuer, not for the 
securities themselves.
    5. The purpose of this section is to provide an exemption from the 
registration requirements of the Act for securities issued in 
compensatory circumstances. This section is not available for plans or 
schemes to circumvent this purpose, such as to raise capital. This 
section also is not available to exempt any transaction that is in 
technical compliance with this section but is part of a plan or scheme 
to evade the registration provisions of the Act. In any of these cases, 
registration under the Act is required unless another exemption is 
available.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales made in compliance with all of the 
conditions of this section are exempt from section 5 of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 77e).
    (b) Issuers eligible to use this section--(1) General. This section 
is available to any issuer that is not subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C.

[[Page 706]]

78m or 78o(d)) and is not an investment company registered or required 
to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80a-1 et seq.).
    (2) Issuers that become subject to reporting. If an issuer becomes 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) after it has made offers 
complying with this section, the issuer may nevertheless rely on this 
section to sell the securities previously offered to the persons to whom 
those offers were made.
    (3) Guarantees by reporting companies. An issuer subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 
U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d)) may rely on this section if it is merely 
guaranteeing the payment of a subsidiary's securities that are sold 
under this section.
    (c) Transactions exempted by this section. This section exempts 
offers and sales of securities (including plan interests and guarantees 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) under a written 
compensatory benefit plan (or written compensation contract) established 
by the issuer, its parents, its majority-owned subsidiaries or majority-
owned subsidiaries of the issuer's parent, for the participation of 
their employees, directors, general partners, trustees (where the issuer 
is a business trust), officers, or consultants and advisors, and their 
family members who acquire such securities from such persons through 
gifts or domestic relations orders. This section exempts offers and 
sales to former employees, directors, general partners, trustees, 
officers, consultants and advisors only if such persons were employed by 
or providing services to the issuer at the time the securities were 
offered. In addition, the term ``employee'' includes insurance agents 
who are exclusive agents of the issuer, its subsidiaries or parents, or 
derive more than 50% of their annual income from those entities.
    (1) Special requirements for consultants and advisors. This section 
is available to consultants and advisors only if:
    (i) They are natural persons;
    (ii) They provide bona fide services to the issuer, its parents, its 
majority-owned subsidiaries or majority-owned subsidiaries of the 
issuer's parent; and
    (iii) The services are not in connection with the offer or sale of 
securities in a capital-raising transaction, and do not directly or 
indirectly promote or maintain a market for the issuer's securities.
    (2) Definition of ``compensatory benefit plan.'' For purposes of 
this section, a compensatory benefit plan is any purchase, savings, 
option, bonus, stock appreciation, profit sharing, thrift, incentive, 
deferred compensation, pension or similar plan.
    (3) Definition of ``family member.'' For purposes of this section, 
family member includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, 
stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, 
mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-
law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person 
sharing the employee's household (other than a tenant or employee), a 
trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent of the 
beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the 
employee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in 
which these persons (or the employee) own more than fifty percent of the 
voting interests.
    (d) Amounts that may be sold--(1) Offers. Any amount of securities 
may be offered in reliance on this section. However, for purposes of 
this section, sales of securities underlying options must be counted as 
sales on the date of the option grant.
    (2) Sales. The aggregate sales price or amount of securities sold in 
reliance on this section during any consecutive 12-month period must not 
exceed the greatest of the following:
    (i) $1,000,000;
    (ii) 15% of the total assets of the issuer (or of the issuer's 
parent if the issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the securities 
represent obligations that the parent fully and unconditionally 
guarantees), measured at the issuer's most recent balance sheet date (if 
no older than its last fiscal year end); or
    (iii) 15% of the outstanding amount of the class of securities being 
offered and sold in reliance on this section,

[[Page 707]]

measured at the issuer's most recent balance sheet date (if no older 
than its last fiscal year end).
    (3) Rules for calculating prices and amounts--(i) Aggregate sales 
price. The term aggregate sales price means the sum of all cash, 
property, notes, cancellation of debt or other consideration received or 
to be received by the issuer for the sale of the securities. Non-cash 
consideration must be valued by reference to bona fide sales of that 
consideration made within a reasonable time or, in the absence of such 
sales, on the fair value as determined by an accepted standard. The 
value of services exchanged for securities issued must be measured by 
reference to the value of the securities issued. Options must be valued 
based on the exercise price of the option.
    (ii) Time of the calculation. With respect to options to purchase 
securities, the aggregate sales price is determined when an option grant 
is made (without regard to when the option becomes exercisable). With 
respect to other securities, the calculation is made on the date of 
sale. With respect to deferred compensation or similar plans, the 
calculation is made when the irrevocable election to defer is made.
    (iii) Derivative securities. In calculating outstanding securities 
for purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, treat the 
securities underlying all currently exercisable or convertible options, 
warrants, rights or other securities, other than those issued under this 
exemption, as outstanding. In calculating the amount of securities sold 
for other purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, count the amount 
of securities that would be acquired upon exercise or conversion in 
connection with sales of options, warrants, rights or other exercisable 
or convertible securities, including those to be issued under this 
exemption.
    (iv) Other exemptions. Amounts of securities sold in reliance on 
this section do not affect ``aggregate offering prices'' in other 
exemptions, and amounts of securities sold in reliance on other 
exemptions do not affect the amount that may be sold in reliance on this 
section.
    (e) Disclosure that must be provided. The issuer must deliver to 
investors a copy of the compensatory benefit plan or the contract, as 
applicable. In addition, if the aggregate sales price or amount of 
securities sold during any consecutive 12-month period exceeds $5 
million, the issuer must deliver the following disclosure to investors a 
reasonable period of time before the date of sale:
    (1) If the plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1104-1107), a copy of the 
summary plan description required by ERISA;
    (2) If the plan is not subject to ERISA, a summary of the material 
terms of the plan;
    (3) Information about the risks associated with investment in the 
securities sold pursuant to the compensatory benefit plan or 
compensation contract; and
    (4) Financial statements required to be furnished by Part F/S of 
Form 1-A (Regulation A Offering Statement) (Sec. 239.90 of this 
chapter) under Regulation A (Sec. Sec. 230.251 through 230.263). 
Foreign private issuers as defined in Rule 405 must provide a 
reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the United 
States (U.S. GAAP) if their financial statements are not prepared in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (Item 17 of 
Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter)). The financial statements 
required by this section must be as of a date no more than 180 days 
before the sale of securities in reliance on this exemption.
    (5) If the issuer is relying on paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section 
to use its parent's total assets to determine the amount of securities 
that may be sold, the parent's financial statements must be delivered. 
If the parent is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)), the financial 
statements of the parent required by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 
210.10-01 of this chapter) and Item 310 of Regulation D-B (Sec. 228.310 
of this chapter), as applicable, must be delivered.
    (6) If the sale involves a stock option or other derivative 
security, the issuer must deliver disclosure a reasonable

[[Page 708]]

period of time before the date of exercise or conversion. For deferred 
compensation or similar plans, the issuer must deliver disclosure to 
investors a reasonable period of time before the date the irrevocable 
election to defer is made.
    (f) No integration with other offerings. Offers and sales exempt 
under this section are deemed to be a part of a single, discrete 
offering and are not subject to integration with any other offers or 
sales, whether registered under the Act or otherwise exempt from the 
registration requirements of the Act.
    (g) Resale limitations. (1) Securities issued under this section are 
deemed to be ``restricted securities'' as defined in Sec. 230.144.
    (2) Resales of securities issued pursuant to this section must be in 
compliance with the registration requirements of the Act or an exemption 
from those requirements.
    (3) Ninety days after the issuer becomes subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m 
or 78o(d)), securities issued under this section may be resold by 
persons who are not affiliates (as defined in Sec. 230.144) in reliance 
on Sec. 230.144, without compliance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
Sec. 230.144, and by affiliates without compliance with paragraph (d) 
of Sec. 230.144.

the registration provisions of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e) and not to the 
applicability of the anti-fraud, civil liability or other provisions of 
the federal securities laws.
    2. The exemptions provided by Sec. 230.801 and Sec. 230.802 are 
not available for any securities transaction or series of transactions 
that technically complies with Sec. 230.801 and Sec. 230.802 but are 
part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration provisions of the 
Act.
    3. An issuer who relies on Sec. 230.801 or an offeror who relies on 
Sec. 230.802 must still comply with the securities registration or 
broker-dealer registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) and any other applicable provisions of 
the federal securities laws.
    4. An issuer who relies on Sec. 230.801 or an offeror who relies on 
Sec. 230.802 must still comply with any applicable state laws relating 
to the offer and sale of securities.
    5. Attempted compliance with Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802 does not 
act as an exclusive election; an issuer making an offer or sale of 
securities in reliance on Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802 may also rely 
on any other applicable exemption from the registration requirements of 
the Act.
    6. Section 230.801 and Sec. 230.802 provide exemptions only for the 
issuer of the securities and not for any affiliate of that issuer or for 
any other person for resales of the issuer's securities. These sections 
provide exemptions only for the transaction in which the issuer or other 
person offers or sells the securities, not for the securities 
themselves. Securities acquired in a Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802 
transaction may be resold in the United States only if they are 
registered under the Act or an exemption from registration is available.
    7. Unregistered offers and sales made outside the United States will 
not affect contemporaneous offers and sales made in compliance with 
Sec. 230.801 or Sec. 230.802. A transaction that complies with Sec. 
230.801 or Sec. 230.802 will not be integrated with offerings exempt 
under other provisions of the Act, even if both transactions occur at 
the same time.
    8. Securities acquired in a rights offering under Sec. 230.801 are 
``restricted securities'' within the meaning of Sec. 230.144(a)(3) to 
the same extent and proportion that the securities held by the security 
holder as of the record date for the rights offering were restricted 
securities. Likewise, securities acquired in an exchange offer or 
business combination subject to Sec. 230.802 are ``restricted 
securities'' within the meaning of Sec. 230.144(a)(3) to the same 
extent and proportion that the securities tendered or exchanged by the 
security holder in that transaction were restricted securities.
    9. Section 230.801 does not apply to a rights offering by an 
investment company registered or required to be registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), other than a 
registered closed-end investment company. Section 230.802 does not apply 
to exchange offers or business combinations by an investment company 
registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act 
of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), other than a registered closed-end 
investment company.

Sec. 230.800  Definitions for Sec. Sec. 230.800, 230.801 and 230.802.

    The following definitions apply in Sec. Sec. 230.800, 230.801 and 
230.802.
    (a) Business combination. Business combination means a statutory 
amalgamation, merger, arrangement or other reorganization requiring the 
vote of security holders of one or more of the participating companies. 
It also includes a statutory short form merger that does not require a 
vote of security holders.
    (b) Equity security. Equity security means the same as in Sec. 
240.3a11-1 of this chapter, but for purposes of this section only does 
not include:
    (1) Any debt security that is convertible into an equity security, 
with or without consideration;
    (2) Any debt security that includes a warrant or right to subscribe 
to or purchase an equity security;
    (3) Any such warrant or right; or
    (4) Any put, call, straddle, or other option or privilege that gives 
the holder the option of buying or selling a security but does not 
require the holder to do so.
    (c) Exchange offer. Exchange offer means a tender offer in which 
securities are issued as consideration.
    (d) Foreign private issuer. Foreign private issuer means the same as 
in Sec. 230.405 of Regulation C.
    (e) Foreign subject company. Foreign subject company means any 
foreign private issuer whose securities are the subject of the exchange 
offer or business combination.
    (f) Home jurisdiction. Home jurisdiction means both the jurisdiction 
of the foreign subject company's (or in the case of a rights offering, 
the foreign private issuer's) incorporation, organization or chartering 
and the principal foreign market where the foreign subject company's (or 
in the case of a rights offering, the issuer's) securities are listed or 
quoted.
    (g) Rights offering. Rights offering means offers and sales for cash 
of equity securities where:
    (1) The issuer grants the existing security holders of a particular 
class of equity securities (including holders of depositary receipts 
evidencing those securities) the right to purchase or subscribe for 
additional securities of that class; and
    (2) The number of additional shares an existing security holder may 
purchase initially is in proportion to the number of securities he or 
she holds of record on the record date for the rights offering. If an 
existing security holder holds depositary receipts, the proportion must 
be calculated as if the underlying securities were held directly.
    (h) U.S. holder. U.S. holder means any security holder resident in 
the United States. To determine the percentage of outstanding securities 
held by U.S. holders:
    (1) Calculate the percentage of outstanding securities held by U.S. 
holders as of a date no more than 60 days before or 30 days after the 
public announcement of a business combination conducted under Sec. 
230.802 under the Act or of the record date in a rights offering 
conducted under Sec. 230.801 under the Act. For a business combination 
conducted under Sec. 230.802, if you are unable to calculate as of a 
date within these time frames, the calculation may be made as of the 
most recent practicable date before public announcement, but in no event 
earlier than 120 days before public announcement.
    (2) Include securities underlying American Depositary Shares 
convertible or exchangeable into the securities that are the subject of 
the tender offer when calculating the number of subject securities 
outstanding, as well as the number held by U.S. holders. Exclude from 
the calculation other types of securities that are convertible or 
exchangeable into the securities that are the subject of the tender 
offer, such as warrants, options and convertible securities. Exclude 
from those calculations securities held by the acquiror in an exchange 
offer or business combination;
    (3) Use the method of calculating record ownership in Rule 12g3-2(a) 
under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12g3-2(a) of this chapter), except 
that your inquiry as to the amount of securities represented by accounts 
of customers resident in the United States may be limited to brokers, 
dealers, banks and other nominees located in the United States, the 
subject company's jurisdiction of incorporation or that of each 
participant in a business combination,

[[Page 710]]

and the jurisdiction that is the primary trading market for the subject 
securities, if different from the subject company's jurisdiction of 
incorporation;
    (4) If, after reasonable inquiry, you are unable to obtain 
information about the amount of securities represented by accounts of 
customers resident in the United States, you may assume, for purposes of 
this provision, that the customers are residents of the jurisdiction in 
which the nominee has its principal place of business.
    (5) Count securities as owned by U.S. holders when publicly filed 
reports of beneficial ownership or information that is otherwise 
provided to you indicates that the securities are held by U.S. 
residents.
    (6) For exchange offers conducted pursuant to Sec. 230.802 under 
the Act by persons other than the issuer of the subject securities or 
its affiliates that are not made pursuant to an agreement with the 
issuer of the subject securities, the issuer of the subject securities 
will be presumed to be a foreign private issuer and U.S. holders will be 
presumed to hold 10 percent or less of the outstanding subject 
securities, unless paragraphs (h)(7)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section 
indicate otherwise.
    (7) For rights offerings and business combinations, including 
exchange offers conducted pursuant to Sec. 230.802 under the Act, where 
the offeror is unable to conduct the analysis of U.S. ownership set 
forth in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the issuer of the subject 
securities will be presumed to be a foreign private issuer and U.S. 
holders will be presumed to hold 10 percent or less of the outstanding 
subject securities so long as there is a primary trading market for the 
subject securities outside the United States, as defined in Sec. 
240.12h-6(f)(5) of this chapter, unless:
    (i) Average daily trading volume of the subject securities in the 
United States for a recent twelve-month period ending on a date no more 
than 60 days before the public announcement of the business combination 
or of the record date for a rights offering exceeds 10 percent of the 
average daily trading volume of that class of securities on a worldwide 
basis for the same period; or
    (ii) The most recent annual report or annual information filed or 
submitted by the issuer with securities regulators of the home 
jurisdiction or with the Commission or any jurisdiction in which the 
subject securities trade before the public announcement of the offer 
indicates that U.S. holders hold more than 10 percent of the outstanding 
subject class of securities; or
    (iii) The acquiror or issuer knows or has reason to know, before the 
public announcement of the offer, that the level of U.S. ownership 
exceeds 10 percent of such securities. As an example, an acquiror or 
issuer is deemed to know information about U.S. ownership of the subject 
class of securities that is publicly available and that appears in any 
filing with the Commission or any regulatory body in the issuer's 
jurisdiction of incorporation or (if different) the non-U.S. 
jurisdiction in which the primary trading market for the subject 
securities is located. The acquiror in a business combination is deemed 
to know information about U.S. ownership available from the issuer. The 
acquiror or issuer is deemed to know information obtained or readily 
available from any other source that is reasonably reliable, including 
from persons it has retained to advise it about the transaction, as well 
as from third-party information providers. These examples are not 
intended to be exclusive.
    (i) United States. United States means the United States of America, 
its territories and possessions, any State of the United States, and the 
District of Columbia.

<R05>
Sec. 230.801  Exemption in connection with a rights offering.

    A rights offering is exempt from the provisions of Section 5 of the 
Act (15 U.S.C. 77e), so long as the following conditions are satisfied:
    (a) Conditions.--(1) Eligibility of issuer. The issuer is a foreign 
private issuer on the date the securities are first offered to U.S. 
holders.
    (2) Limitation on U.S. ownership. U.S. holders hold no more than 10 
percent of the outstanding class of securities that is the subject of 
the rights offering (as

[[Page 711]]

determined under the definition of ``U.S. holder'' in Sec. 230.800(h)).
    (3) Equal treatment. The issuer permits U.S. holders to participate 
in the rights offering on terms at least as favorable as those offered 
the other holders of the securities that are the subject of the offer. 
The issuer need not, however, extend the rights offering to security 
holders in those states or jurisdictions that require registration or 
qualification.
    (4) Informational documents. (i) If the issuer publishes or 
otherwise disseminates an informational document to the holders of the 
securities in connection with the rights offering, the issuer must 
furnish that informational document, including any amendments thereto, 
in English, to the Commission on Form CB (Sec. 239.800 of this chapter) 
by the first business day after publication or dissemination. If the 
issuer is a foreign company, it must also file a Form F-X (Sec. 239.42 
of this chapter) with the Commission at the same time as the submission 
of Form CB to appoint an agent for service in the United States.
    (ii) The issuer must disseminate any informational document to U.S. 
holders, including any amendments thereto, in English, on a comparable 
basis to that provided to security holders in the home jurisdiction.
    (iii) If the issuer disseminates by publication in its home 
jurisdiction, the issuer must publish the information in the United 
States in a manner reasonably calculated to inform U.S. holders of the 
offer.
    (5) Eligibility of securities. The securities offered in the rights 
offering are equity securities of the same class as the securities held 
by the offerees in the United States directly or through American 
Depositary Receipts.
    (6) Limitation on transferability of rights. The terms of the rights 
prohibit transfers of the rights by U.S. holders except in accordance 
with Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 through Sec. 230.905).
    (b) Legends. The following legend or an equivalent statement in 
clear, plain language, to the extent applicable, appears on the cover 
page or other prominent portion of any informational document the issuer 
disseminates to U.S. holders:

    This rights offering is made for the securities of a foreign 
company. The offer is subject to the disclosure requirements of a 
foreign country that are different from those of the United States. 
Financial statements included in the document, if any, have been 
prepared in accordance with foreign accounting standards that may not be 
comparable to the financial statements of United States companies.
    It may be difficult for you to enforce your rights and any claim you 
may have arising under the federal securities laws, since the issuer is 
located in a foreign country, and some or all of its officers and 
directors may be residents of a foreign country. You may not be able to 
sue the foreign company or its officers or directors in a foreign court 
for violations of the U.S. securities laws. It may be difficult to 
compel a foreign company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a 
U.S. court's judgment.


<R05>
Sec. 230.802  Exemption for offerings in connection with an exchange offer or business combination for the securities of foreign private issuers.

    Offers and sales in any exchange offer for a class of securities of 
a foreign private issuer, or in any exchange of securities for the 
securities of a foreign private issuer in any business combination, are 
exempt from the provisions of section 5 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e), if 
they satisfy the following conditions:
    (a) Conditions to be met--(1) Limitation on U.S. ownership. Except 
in the case of an exchange offer or business combination that is 
commenced during the pendency of a prior exchange offer or business 
combination made in reliance on this paragraph, U.S. holders of the 
foreign subject company must hold no more than 10 percent of the 
securities that are the subject of the exchange offer or business 
combination (as determined under the definition of ``U.S. holder'' in 
Sec. 230.800(h)). In the case of a business combination in which the 
securities are to be issued by a successor registrant, U.S. holders may 
hold no more than 10 percent of the class of securities of the successor 
registrant, as if measured immediately after completion of the business 
combination.
    (2) Equal treatment. The offeror must permit U.S. holders to 
participate in the exchange offer or business combination on terms at 
least as favorable as those offered any other holder of the

[[Page 712]]

subject securities. The offeror, however, need not extend the offer to 
security holders in those states or jurisdictions that require 
registration or qualification, except that the offeror must offer the 
same cash alternative to security holders in any such state that it has 
offered to security holders in any other state or jurisdiction.
    (3) Informational documents. (i) If the offeror publishes or 
otherwise disseminates an informational document to the holders of the 
subject securities in connection with the exchange offer or business 
combination, the offeror must furnish that informational document, 
including any amendments thereto, in English, to the Commission on Form 
CB (Sec. 239.800 of this chapter) by the first business day after 
publication or dissemination. If the offeror is a foreign company, it 
must also file a Form F-X (Sec. 239.42 of this chapter) with the 
Commission at the same time as the submission of the Form CB to appoint 
an agent for service of process in the United States.
    (ii) The offeror must disseminate any informational document to U.S. 
holders, including any amendments thereto, in English, on a comparable 
basis to that provided to security holders in the foreign subject 
company's home jurisdiction.
    (iii) If the offeror disseminates by publication in its home 
jurisdiction, the offeror must publish the information in the United 
States in a manner reasonably calculated to inform U.S. holders of the 
offer.
    (b) Legends. The following legend or an equivalent statement in 
clear, plain language, to the extent applicable, must be included on the 
cover page or other prominent portion of any informational document the 
offeror publishes or disseminates to U.S. holders:

    This exchange offer or business combination is made for the 
securities of a foreign company. The offer is subject to disclosure 
requirements of a foreign country that are different from those of the 
United States. Financial statements included in the document, if any, 
have been prepared in accordance with foreign accounting standards that 
may not be comparable to the financial statements of United States 
companies.
    It may be difficult for you to enforce your rights and any claim you 
may have arising under the federal securities laws, since the issuer is 
located in a foreign country, and some or all of its officers and 
directors may be residents of a foreign country. You may not be able to 
sue a foreign company or its officers or directors in a foreign court 
for violations of the U.S. securities laws. It may be difficult to 
compel a foreign company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a 
U.S. court's judgment.
    You should be aware that the issuer may purchase securities 
otherwise than under the exchange offer, such as in open market or 
privately negotiated purchases.

 Regulation S--Rules Governing Offers and Sales Made Outside the United 
      States Without Registration Under the Securities Act of 1933

    Source: Sections 230.901 through 230.904 appear at 55 FR 18322, May 
2, 1990, unless otherwise noted.
    Preliminary Notes: 1. The following rules relate solely to the 
application of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) [15 
U.S.C. 77e] and not to antifraud or other provisions of the federal 
securities laws.
    2. In view of the objective of these rules and the policies 
underlying the Act, Regulation S is not available with respect to any 
transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with these rules, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under 
the Act is required.
    3. Nothing in these rules obviates the need for any issuer or any 
other person to comply with the securities registration or broker-dealer 
registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act (the Exchange 
Act), whenever such requirements are applicable.
    4. Nothing in these rules obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of securities.
    5. Attempted compliance with any rule in Regulation S does not act 
as an exclusive election; a person making an offer or sale of securities 
may also claim the availability of any applicable exemption from the 
registration requirements of the Act. The availability of the Regulation 
S safe harbor to offers and sales that occur outside of the United 
States will not be affected by the subsequent offer and sale of these 
securities into the United States or to U.S. persons during the 
distribution compliance period, as long as the subsequent offer and sale 
are made pursuant to registration or an exemption therefrom under the 
Act.
    6. Regulation S is available only for offers and sales of securities 
outside the United

[[Page 713]]

States. Securities acquired overseas, whether or not pursuant to 
Regulation S, may be resold in the United States only if they are 
registered under the Act or an exemption from registration is available.
    7. Nothing in these rules precludes access by journalists for 
publications with a general circulation in the United States to offshore 
press conferences, press releases and meetings with company press 
spokespersons in which an offshore offering or tender offer is 
discussed, provided that the information is made available to the 
foreign and United States press generally and is not intended to induce 
purchases of securities by persons in the United States or tenders of 
securities by United States holders in the case of exchange offers. 
Where applicable, issuers and bidders may also look to Sec. 230.135e 
and Sec. 240.14d-1(c) of this chapter.
    8. The provisions of this Regulation S shall not apply to offers and 
sales of securities issued by open-end investment companies or unit 
investment trusts registered or required to be registered or closed-end 
investment companies required to be registered, but not registered, 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.] (the 
1940 Act).

to be ``restricted securities'' as defined in Sec. 230.144. Resales of 
any of such restricted securities by the offshore purchaser must be made 
in accordance with this Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 through Sec. 
230.905, and Preliminary Notes), the registration requirements of the 
Act or an exemption therefrom. Any ``restricted securities,'' as defined 
in Sec. 230.144, that are equity securities of a domestic issuer will 
continue to be deemed to be restricted securities, notwithstanding that 
they were acquired in a resale transaction made pursuant to Sec. 
230.901 or Sec. 230.904.

 Regulation CE--Coordinated Exemptions for Certain Issues of Securities 
                         Exempt Under State Law


<R05>
Sec. 230.1001  Exemption for transactions exempt from qualification under Sec. 25102(n) of the California Corporations Code.

    Preliminary Notes: (1) Nothing in this section is intended to be or 
should be construed as in any way relieving issuers or persons acting on 
behalf of issuers from providing disclosure to prospective investors 
necessary to satisfy the antifraud provisions of the federal securities 
laws. This section only provides an exemption from the registration 
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (``the Act'') [15 U.S.C. 77a 
et seq.].
    (2) Nothing in this section obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sales of securities.
    (3) Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an 
exclusive election; the issuer also can claim the availability of any 
other applicable exemption.
    (4) This exemption is not available to any issuer for any 
transaction which, while in technical compliance with the provision of 
this section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration 
provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under the Act is 
required.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
conditions of paragraph (n) of Sec. 25102 of the California 
Corporations Code, and paragraph (b) of this section, shall be exempt 
from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue 
of Section 3(b) of that Act.
    (b) Limitation on and computation of offering price. The sum of all 
cash and other consideration to be received for the securities shall not 
exceed $5,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all other 
securities sold in the same offering of securities, whether pursuant to 
this or another exemption.
    (c) Resale limitations. Securities issued pursuant to this Sec. 
230.1001 are deemed to be ``restricted securities'' as defined in 
Securities Act Rule 144 [Sec. 230.144]. Resales of such securities must 
be made in compliance with the registration requirements of the Act or 
an exemption therefrom.

    (i) All requirements of the Acts and rules applicable to such filing 
have been complied with;

regarding electronic format in the EDGAR Filer Manual; and
    (iii) With respect to Securities Act filings, including filings

the required fee payment has been confirmed, provided that the failure 
to pay an insignificant amount of the fee at the time of the filing, as 
a result of a bona fide error, shall not affect the date of filing.
    (2) If the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are 
otherwise satisfied, all filings submitted by direct transmission 
commencing on or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern 
Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect, shall be deemed

commences or before the filing becomes immediately effective, whichever 
applies.

    (b) Adjustment of the filing date. If an electronic filer in good 
faith attempts to file a document with the Commission in a timely manner 
but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the 
electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request an 
adjustment of the filing date of such document. The Commission, or the 
staff acting pursuant to delegated authority, may grant the request if 
it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the

submitted electronically shall be paid in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in Instructions for Filing Fees--Rule 3a of the Commission's

or distribution does not occur during the official business hours of the 
Commission, as soon as practicable on the next business day. Any 
associated time periods shall be calculated on the basis of the 
publication or distribution date (as applicable), and not on the basis

Sec. 232.102  Exhibits.

    (a) Exhibits to an electronic filing that have not previously been 
filed with the Commission shall be filed in electronic format, absent a 
hardship exemption. Previously filed exhibits, whether in paper or 
electronic format, may be incorporated by reference into an electronic 
filing to the extent permitted by Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.10(d) of 
this chapter, Rule 411 under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.411 of this 
chapter), Rule 12b-23 or 12b-32 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-23 
or Sec. 240.12b-32 of this chapter), Rule 22 under the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act (Sec. 250.22 of this chapter), Rules 0-4, 8b-23, 
and 8b-32 under the Investment Company Act (Sec. 270.0-4, Sec. 270.8b-
23 and Sec. 270.8b-32 of this chapter) and Rule 303 of Regulation S-T 
(Sec. 232.303). An electronic filer may, at its option, restate in 
electronic format an exhibit incorporated by reference that originally 
was filed in paper format.

    Note to paragraph (a): Exhibits to a Commission schedule filed 
pursuant to Section 13 or 14(d) of the Exchange Act may be filed in 
paper under cover of Form SE where such exhibits previously were filed 
in paper (prior to a registrant's becoming subject to mandated 
electronic filing or pursuant to a hardship exemption) and are required 
to be refiled pursuant to the schedule's general instructions. See Rule 
311(b) of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.311(b)).

    (b) Amendments to all exhibits shall be filed in electronic format, 
absent a hardship exemption.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an 
electronic filer shall, upon amendment, restate in electronic format its 
articles of incorporation, by-laws or investment advisory agreement (in 
the case of a registered investment company or a business development 
company).
    (d) Each electronic filing requiring exhibits must include an 
exhibit index which must immediately precede the exhibits filed with the 
document. The index must list each exhibit filed, whether filed 
electronically or in paper. Whenever a filer files an exhibit in paper 
pursuant to a temporary or continuing hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 
or Sec. 232.202) or pursuant to Sec. 232.311, the filer must place the 
letter ``P'' next to the listed exhibit in the exhibit index of the 
electronic filing to reflect the fact that the filer filed the exhibit 
in paper. In addition, if the exhibit is filed in paper pursuant to 
Sec. 232.311, the filer must place the designation ``Rule 311'' next to 
the letter ``P'' in the exhibit index. If the exhibit is filed in paper 
pursuant to a temporary or continuing hardship exemption, the filer must 
place the letters ``TH'' or ``CH,'' respectively, next to the letter 
``P'' in the exhibit index. Whenever an electronic confirming copy of an 
exhibit is filed pursuant to a hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 or 
Sec. 232.202(d)), the exhibit index should specify where the confirming 
electronic copy can be located; in addition, the designation ``CE'' 
(confirming electronic) should be placed next to the listed exhibit in 
the exhibit index.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, any incorporation by reference by a registered investment 
company or a business development company must

[[Page 738]]

relate only to documents that have been filed in electronic format on 
the EDGAR system, unless the document has been filed in paper under a 
hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 or Sec. 232.202) and any required 
confirming electronic copy has been submitted.
    (f) Persons submitting filings electronically under the Public 
Utility Act shall not be subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 232.103  Liability for transmission errors or omissions in documents filed via EDGAR.

    An electronic filer shall not be subject to the liability and anti-
fraud provisions of the federal securities laws with respect to an error 
or omission in an electronic filing resulting solely from electronic 
transmission errors beyond the control of the filer, where the filer 
corrects the error or omission by the filing of an amendment in 
electronic format as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic 
filer becomes aware of the error or omission.

<R05>
Sec. 232.104  Unofficial PDF copies included in an electronic submission.

    (a) An electronic submission, other than a Form 3 (Sec. 249.103 of 
this chapter), a Form 4 (Sec. 249.104 of this chapter), a Form 5 (Sec. 
249.105 of this chapter), a Form ID (Sec. Sec. 239.63, 249.446, 269.7 
and 274.402 of this chapter), a Form TA-1 (Sec. 249.100 of this 
chapter), a Form TA-2 (Sec. 249.102 of this chapter), a Form TA-W 
(Sec. 249.101 of this chapter) or a Form D (Sec. 239.500 of this 
chapter), may include one unofficial PDF copy of each electronic 
document contained within that submission, tagged in the format required 
by the EDGAR Filer Manual.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section, 
each unofficial PDF copy must be substantively equivalent to its 
associated electronic document contained in the electronic submission. 
An unofficial PDF copy may contain graphic and image material (but not 
animated graphics, or audio or video material), notwithstanding the fact 
that its HTML or ASCII document counterpart may not contain such 
material but instead may contain a fair and accurate narrative 
description or tabular representation of any omitted graphic or image 
material.
    (c) If a filer omits an unofficial PDF copy from, or submits one or 
more flawed unofficial PDF copies in, the electronic submission of an 
official filing, the filer may add or resubmit an unofficial PDF copy by 
electronically submitting an amendment to the filing to which it 
relates. The amendment must include an explanatory note that the purpose 
of the amendment is to add or to correct an unofficial PDF copy.
    (1) If such an amendment is filed, the official amendment may 
consist solely of the cover page (or first page of the document), the 
explanatory note, and the signature page and exhibit index (where 
appropriate). The corresponding unofficial copy must include the 
complete text of the official filing document for which the amendment is 
being submitted.
    (2) If the amendment is being filed to add or resubmit an unofficial 
PDF copy of one or more exhibits, the submission may consist of the 
following: the official filing--consisting of the cover page (or first 
page of the document), the explanatory note, the signature page (where 
appropriate), the exhibit index, and a separate electronic exhibit 
document for each exhibit for which an unofficial PDF copy is being 
submitted--and the corresponding unofficial PDF copy of each exhibit 
document. However, the text of the official exhibit document need not 
repeat the text of the exhibit; that document may contain only the 
following legend:

RESUBMITTED TO ADD/REPLACE UNOFFICIAL PDF COPY OF EXHIBIT.

    (d) An unofficial PDF copy is not filed for purposes of section 11 
of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), section 18 of the Exchange Act 
(15 U.S.C. 78r), section 16 of the Public Utility Act (15 U.S.C. 79p), 
section 323 of the Trust Indenture Act (15 U.S.C. 77www), or section 
34(b) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), or otherwise

[[Page 739]]

subject to the liabilities of such sections, and is not part of any 
registration statement to which it relates. An unofficial PDF copy is, 
however, subject to all other civil liability and anti-fraud provisions 
of the above Acts or other laws.
    (e) Unofficial PDF copies that are prospectuses are subject to 
liability under Section 12 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77l).
    (f) An unofficial PDF copy of a correspondence document contained in 
an electronic submission need not be substantively equivalent to that 
correspondence document.

<R05>
Sec. 232.105  Limitation on use of HTML documents and hypertext links.

    (a) Electronic filers must submit the following documents in ASCII: 
Form N-SAR (Sec. 274.101 of this chapter) and Form 13F (Sec. 249.325 
of this chapter). Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 
electronic filers may submit exhibits to Form N-SAR in HTML.
    (b) Electronic filers may not include in any HTML document hypertext 
links to sites, locations, or documents outside the HTML document, 
except to links to officially filed documents within the current 
submission and to documents previously filed electronically and located 
in the EDGAR database on the Commission's public web site (www.sec.gov). 
Electronic filers also may include within an HTML document hypertext 
links to different sections within that single HTML document.
    (c) If a filer includes an external hypertext link within a filed 
document, the information contained in the linked material will not be 
considered part of the document for determining compliance with 
reporting obligations, but the inclusion of the link will cause the 
filer to be subject to the civil liability and antifraud provisions of 
the federal securities laws with reference to the information contained 
in the linked material.

Sec. 232.106  Prohibition against electronic submissions containing executable code.

    (a) Electronic submissions must not contain executable code. 
Attempted submissions identified as containing executable code will be 
suspended, unless the executable code is contained only in one or more 
PDF documents, in which case the submission will be accepted but the PDF 
document(s) containing executable code will be deleted and not 
disseminated.
    (b) If an electronic submission has been accepted, and the 
Commission staff later determines that the accepted submission contains 
executable code, the staff may delete from the EDGAR system the entire 
accepted electronic submission or any document contained in the accepted 
electronic submission. The Commission staff may direct the electronic 
filer to resubmit electronically replacement document(s) or a 
replacement submission in its entirety, in compliance with this 
provision and the EDGAR Filer Manual.

    Note to Sec. 232.106: A violation of this section or the relevant 
EDGAR Filer Manual section also may be a violation of the Computer Fraud 
and Abuse Act of 1986, as amended, and other statutes and laws.

                           Hardship Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 232.201  Temporary hardship exemption.

    (a) If an electronic filer experiences unanticipated technical 
difficulties preventing the timely preparation and submission of an 
electronic filing other than a Form 3 (Sec. 249.103 of this chapter), a 
Form 4 (Sec. 249.104 of this chapter), a Form 5 (Sec. 249.105 of this 
chapter), a Form ID (Sec. Sec. 239.63, 249.446, 269.7 and 274.402 of 
this chapter), a Form TA-1 (Sec. 249.100 of this chapter), a Form TA-2 
(Sec. 249.102 of this chapter), a Form TA-W (Sec. 249.101 of this 
chapter), a Form D (Sec. 239.500 of this chapter), or an application 
for an order under any section of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 
80a-1 et seq.), the electronic filer may file the subject filing, under 
cover of Form TH (Sec. Sec. 239.65, 249.447, 269.10 and 274.404 of this 
chapter), in paper format no later than one business day after

[[Page 740]]

the date on which the filing was to be made.
    (1) An electronic imaged copy of the paper format document shall be 
the official filing for purposes of the federal securities laws.
    (2) The following legend shall be set forth in capital letters on 
the cover page of the paper format document:

IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 201 OF REGULATION S-T, THIS (specify document) 
IS BEING FILED IN PAPER PURSUANT TO A TEMPORARY HARDSHIP EXEMPTION

    (3) Signatures to the paper format document may be in typed form 
rather than manual format. See Rule 302 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 
232.302). All other requirements relating to paper format filings shall 
be satisfied.
    (4) If the exemption pertains to a document filed pursuant to 
section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m and 78o(d)) or 
section 30 of the Investment Company Act and the paper format document 
is filed in the manner specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
filing shall be deemed to have been filed by its required due date.

    Notes to paragraph (a): 1. Where a temporary hardship exemption 
relates to an exhibit only, the filer must file the paper format exhibit 
and a Form TH (Sec. Sec. 239.65, 249.447, 259.604, 269.10, and 274.404 
of this chapter) under cover of Form SE (Sec. Sec. 239.64, 249.444, 
259.601, 269.8, and 274.403 of this chapter).
    2. Filers unable to submit a report within a prescribed time period 
because of electronic difficulties shall comply with the provisions of 
this section and shall not use Form 12b-25 (Sec. 249.322 of this 
chapter) as a notification of late filing.

    (b) An electronic format copy of the filed paper format document 
shall be submitted to the Commission within six business days of filing 
the paper format document. The electronic format version shall contain 
the following statement in capital letters at the top of the first page 
of the document:

THIS DOCUMENT IS A COPY OF THE (specify document) FILED ON (date) 
PURSUANT TO A RULE 201 TEMPORARY HARDSHIP EXEMPTION

    Note 1: Failure to submit the confirming electronic copy of a paper 
filing made in reliance on the temporary hardship exemption, as required 
in paragraph (b) of this section, will result in ineligibility to use 
Forms S-2, S-3, S-8, F-2 and F-3 (see Sec. Sec. 239.12, 239.13, 
239.16b, 239.32 and 239.33 of this section, respectively), restrict 
incorporation by reference of the document submitted in paper (see Rule 
303 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.303)), and toll certain time periods 
associated with tender offers (see Rule 13e-4(f)(12) (Sec. 240.13e-
4(f)(12) of this chapter) and Rule 14e-1(e) (Sec. 240.14e-1(e) of this 
chapter).
    Note 2: If the exemption relates to an exhibit only, the requirement 
to submit a confirming electronic copy shall be satisfied by refiling 
the exhibit in electronic format in an amendment to the filing to which 
it relates. The confirming copy tag should not be used. The amendment 
should note that the purpose of the amendment is to add an electronic

                  Preparation of Electronic Submissions


<R05>

    Filers must prepare electronic filings in the manner prescribed by 
the EDGAR Filer Manual, promulgated by the Commission, which sets out 
the technical formatting requirements for electronic submissions. The 
requirements for becoming an EDGAR Filer and updating company data are 
set forth in the updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume I: ``General 
Information,'' Version 5 (September 2008). The requirements for filing 
on EDGAR are set forth in the updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: 
``EDGAR Filing,'' Version 9 (September 2008). Additional provisions 
applicable to Form N-SAR filers are set forth in the EDGAR Filer Manual, 
Volume III: ``N-SAR Supplement,'' Version 1 (September 2005). All of 
these provisions have been incorporated by reference into the Code of 
Federal Regulations, which action was approved by the Director of the 
Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. 
You must comply with these requirements in order for documents to be 
timely received and accepted. You can obtain paper copies of the EDGAR 
Filer Manual from the following address: Public Reference Room, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Room 1580,

required by Sec. Sec. 240.13a-14, 240.15d-14 and 270.30a-2 of this 
chapter) must be in typed form rather than manual format. Signatures in 
an HTML document that are not required may, but are not required to, be 
presented in an HTML graphic or image file within the electronic filing, 
in compliance with the formatting requirements of the EDGAR Filer 
Manual. When used in connection with an electronic filing, the term 
``signature'' means an electronic entry in the form of a magnetic 
impulse or other form of computer data compilation of any letters or 
series of letters or characters comprising a name, executed, adopted or 
authorized as a signature. Signatures are not required in unofficial PDF 
copies submitted in accordance with Sec. 232.104.
    (b) Each signatory to an electronic filing (including, without 
limitation, each signatory to the certifications required by Sec. Sec. 
240.13a-14, 240.15d-14 and 270.30a-2 of this chapter) shall manually 
sign a signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging or 
otherwise adopting his or her signature that appears in typed form 
within the electronic filing. Such document shall be executed before or 
at the time the electronic filing is made and shall be retained by the 
filer for a period of five years. Upon request, an electronic filer 
shall furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all 
documents retained pursuant to this section.
    (c) Where the Commission's rules require a registrant to furnish to 
a national securities exchange or national securities association paper 
copies of a document filed with the Commission in electronic format, 
signatures to such paper copies may be in typed form.

    (2) Any document filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption for 
which a required confirming electronic copy has not been submitted.
    (3) For a registered investment company or a business development 
company, documents that have not been filed in electronic format, unless 
the document has been filed in paper under a hardship exemption (Sec. 
232.201 or 232.202 of this chapter) and any required confirming copy has 
been submitted.
    (b) If a filer incorporates by reference into an electronic filing 
any portion of an annual or quarterly report to security holders, it 
must also file the portion of the annual or quarterly report to security 
holders in electronic format as an exhibit to the filing, as required by 
Regulation S-K Item 601(b)(13) (Sec. 229.601(b)(13) of this chapter) 
and Regulation D-B Item 601(b)(13) (Sec. 228.601(b)(13) of this 
chapter). If a foreign private issuer incorporates by reference into an 
electronic filing any portion of an annual or other report to security 
holders, or of a Form 6-K report (Sec. 249.306 of this chapter) filed 
or submitted in paper, it also must file the incorporated portion in 
electronic format as an exhibit to the filing. The requirements of this 
paragraph do not apply to incorporation by reference by an investment 
company from an annual or quarterly report to security holders.

image, audio or video material is presented in the delivered version, or 
they may be listed in an appendix to the electronic filing. Immaterial

not be described.

    Note to paragraph (a): If the omitted graphic, image, audio or video 
material includes data, filers must include a tabular representation or 
other appropriate representation of that data in the electronically 
filed version of the document.

    (b)(1) The graphic, image, audio and video material in the version 
of a document delivered to investors and others is deemed part of the 
electronic filing and subject to the civil liability and anti-fraud 
provisions of the federal securities laws.
    (2) Narrative descriptions, tabular representations or transcripts 
of graphic, image, audio and video material included in an electronic 
filing or appendix thereto also are deemed part of the filing. However, 
to the extent such descriptions, representations or transcripts 
represent a good faith effort to fairly and accurately describe omitted 
graphic, image, audio or video material, they are not subject to the 
civil liability and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities 
laws.
    (c) An electronic filer must retain for a period of five years a 
copy of each publicly distributed document, in the format used, that 
contains graphic, image, audio or video material where such material is 
not included in the version filed with the Commission. The five-year 
period shall commence as of the filing date, or the date that appears on 
the document, whichever is later. Upon request, an electronic filer 
shall furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all of the 
documents contained in the file.

section and the formatting requirements of the EDGAR Filer Manual.
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of 
this section, electronically filed HTML documents must present the 
following information in an HTML graphic or image file within the 
electronic submission in compliance with the formatting requirements of 
the EDGAR Filer Manual: The performance graph that is to appear in 
registrant annual reports to security holders required by Exchange Act 
Rule 14a-3 (Sec. 240.14a-3 of this chapter) or Exchange Act Rule 14c-3 
(Sec. 240.14c-3 of this chapter) to precede or accompany registrant 
proxy statements or information statements relating to annual meetings

required to, submit any other graphic material in a HTML document by 
presenting the data in an HTML graphic or image file within the 
electronic filing, in compliance with the formatting requirements of the 
EDGAR Filer Manual. However, filers may not present in a graphic or

and are not part of any registration statement to which they relate;
    (2) Are not deemed incorporated by reference;

these Acts; and
    (4) Are deemed filed for purposes of Item 103 of Regulation S-T

its XBRL-Related Documents that complies with the requirements of Rule 
401 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.401) to the extent that such 
information was not materially false or misleading in the corresponding 
official EDGAR filing. To the extent the information in an electronic 
filer's XBRL-Related Documents does not comply with the requirements of 
Rule 401, the information in the XBRL-Related Documents will be deemed 
to comply with Rule 401 for purposes of this paragraph if the electronic

becomes aware that the information in the XBRL-Related Documents does 
not comply with Rule 401, the electronic filer amends the XBRL-Related

Sec. 232.406T  Temporary rule related to Interactive Data Files.

    (a) Scope. Section 232.406T addresses the liability for the 
Interactive Data File. An Interactive Data File is subject to the same 
liability provisions as the Related Official Filing except as provided 
in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) In general. The Interactive Data File, regardless of whether it 
is an exhibit to a document incorporated by reference into filings:
    (1) Is subject to the anti-fraud provisions of section 17(a)(1) of 
the Securities Act, section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Sec. 240.10b-5 
of this chapter, and section 206(1) of the Investment Advisers Act 
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) Is deemed not filed or part of a registration statement or 
prospectus for purposes of sections 11 or 12 of the Securities Act, is 
deemed not filed for purposes of section 18 of the Exchange Act or 
section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act, and otherwise is not 
subject to liability under these sections; and
    (3) Is deemed filed for purposes of Sec. 232.103.
    (c) Good faith attempts and prompt correction. Subject to paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Interactive Data File shall be subject to 
liability for a failure to comply with Sec. 232.405, but shall be 
deemed to have complied with Sec. 232.405 and would not be subject to 
liability under the anti-fraud provisions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section or under any other liability provision if the electronic 
filer:
    (1) Makes a good faith attempt to comply with Sec. 232.405; and
    (2) After the electronic filer becomes aware that the Interactive 
Data File fails to comply with Sec. 232.405, promptly amends the 
Interactive Data File to comply with Sec. 232.405.
    (d) Temporary section. Section 232.406T is a temporary section that 
applies to an Interactive Data File submitted to the Commission less 
than 24 months after the electronic filer first was required to submit 
an Interactive Data File to the Commission pursuant to Sec. 232.405, 
not taking into account any grace period, but no later than October 31, 
2014. After these dates, an Interactive Data File is subject to the same 
liability provisions as the Related Official Filing. This temporary 
section will expire on October 31, 2014.

[74 FR 6814, Feb. 10, 2009]

    Effective Date Note: At 74 FR 6814, Feb. 10, 2009, Sec. 232.406T

<R05>
Sec. 232.501  Modular submissions and segmented filings.

    An electronic filer may use the following procedures to submit 
information to the EDGAR system for subsequent inclusion in an 
electronic filing:
    (a) Modular submissions. (1) One or more electronic format documents 
may be submitted for storage in the non-public EDGAR data storage area 
as a modular submission for subsequent inclusion in one or more 
electronic submissions.
    (2) An electronic filer shall be permitted a maximum of ten modular 
submissions in the non-public EDGAR data storage area at any time, not 
to exceed a total of one megabyte of digital information. If an 
electronic filer attempts to submit a modular filing which would cause 
either of these limits to be exceeded, EDGAR will suspend the modular 
submission and notify the electronic filer by electronic mail. After six 
business days, the modular submission held in suspense will be deleted 
from the system.

[[Page 758]]

    (3) A modular submission may be corrected or amended only by 
resubmitting the entire modular submission.
    (b) Segmented filings. (1) Segments of a document intended to become 
an electronic filing may be submitted to the non-public EDGAR data 
storage area for assembly as a segmented filing.
    (2) Segments shall be submitted no more than six business days in 
advance of the anticipated filing date and are not limited in number or 
size. They may be submitted from several geographic locations by more 
than one filing entity. Segments may be included in only one electronic 
filing. Once used, segments will be removed from the non-public EDGAR 
data storage area. The assembly of segments into a segmented filing 
shall be effected pursuant to the applicable provisions of the EDGAR 
Filer Manual. If segments are not prepared in accordance with the EDGAR 
Filer Manual, the filing will not be constructed. The filing date of a 
segmented filing shall be the date upon which the filing is assembled 
and satisfies the requirements of Rule 13(a) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 
232.13(a)).
    (3) Segments may be corrected or amended only by resubmitting the 
entire segment.
    (c) A modular submission or segment shall not:
    (1) be publicly available;
    (2) Be deemed filed with the Commission for purposes of Securities 
Act section 11 (15 U.S.C. 77k), Exchange Act section 18 (15 U.S.C. 78r), 
Public Utility Act section 16 (15 U.S.C. 79p), Trust Indenture Act 
section 323 (15 U.S.C. 77www), or Investment Company Act section 34(b) 
(15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)) prior to its inclusion in a filing; or
    (3) Be deemed to constitute an official filing prior to its 
inclusion in a filing under the federal securities laws. Once a modular 
submission or segment has been included in an electronic filing, the 
liability and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange 
Act, the Trust Indenture Act, the Public Utility Act and the Investment 
Company Act shall apply to the electronic filing.

<R05>
Sec. 239.13  Form S-3, for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of securities of certain issuers offered pursuant to certain types of transactions.

    This instruction sets forth registrant requirements and transaction 
requirements for the use of Form S-3. Any registrant which meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section (``Registrant 
Requirements'') may use this Form for the registration of securities 
under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') which are offered 
in any transaction specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
(``Transaction Requirement'') provided that the requirement applicable 
to the specified transaction are met. With respect to majority-owned 
subsidiaries, see paragraph (c) of this section. With respect to well-
known seasoned issuers and majority-owned subsidiaries of well-known 
seasoned issuers, see paragraph (d) of this section.
    (a) Registrant requirements. Registrants must meet the following 
conditions in order to use this Form for registration under the 
Securities Act of securities offered in the transactions specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) The registrant is organized under the laws of the United States 
or any State or Territory or the District of Columbia and has its 
principal business operations in the United States or its territories.
    (2) The registrant has a class of securities registered pursuant to 
section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) or a 
class of equity securities registered pursuant to section 12(g) of the 
Exchange Act or is required to file reports pursuant to section 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act;
    (3) The registrant: (i) Has been subject to the requirements of 
section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has filed all the material 
required to be filed pursuant to sections 13, 14 or 15(d) for a period 
of at least twelve calendar months immediately preceding the filing of 
the registration statement on this Form; and
    (ii) Has filed in a timely manner all reports required to be filed 
during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately 
preceding the filing of the registration statement, other than a report 
that is required solely pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 
2.06, 4.02(a), 6.01, 6.03 or 6.05 of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this 
chapter). If the registrant has used (during the twelve calendar months 
and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the 
registration statement) Sec. 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter with respect 
to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has 
actually been filed within the time period prescribed by that section; 
and
    (4) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this 
section do not apply to any registered offerings of securities described 
in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. However, for such offerings of 
asset-backed securities, to the extent the depositor or any issuing 
entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor 
or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Sec. 229.1101

[[Page 761]]

of this chapter) are or were at any time during the twelve calendar 
months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of 
the registration statement on this Form subject to the requirements of 
section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with 
respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving the same asset 
class, such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all 
material required to be filed regarding such asset-backed securities 
pursuant to section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 
78n or 78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such 
entity was required to file such materials). In addition, such material 
must have been filed in a timely manner, other than a report that is 
required solely pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 
4.02(a), 6.01, 6.03 or 6.05 of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter). 
If Sec. 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter was used during such period with 
respect to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion 
thereof has actually been filed within the time period prescribed by 
that section. Regarding an affiliated depositor that became an affiliate 
as a result of a business combination transaction during such period, 
the filing of any material prior to the business combination transaction 
relating to asset-backed securities of an issuing entity previously 
established, directly or indirectly, by such affiliated depositor is 
excluded from this section, provided such business combination 
transaction was not part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements 
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. See the definition of 
``affiliate'' in Sec. 230.405 of this chapter.
    (5) Neither the registrant nor any of its consolidated or 
unconsolidated subsidiaries have, since the end of the last fiscal year 
for which certified financial statements of the registrant and its 
consolidated subsidiaries were included in a report filed pursuant to 
section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act: (i) Failed to pay any 
dividend or sinking fund installment on preferred stock; or (ii) 
defaulted (A) on any installment or installments on indebtedness for 
borrowed money, or (B) on any rental on one or more long term leases, 
which defaults in the aggregate are material to the financial position 
of the registrant and its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, 
taken as a whole.
    (6) A foreign issuer, other than a foreign government, which 
satisfies all of the above provisions of these registrant eligibility 
requirements except the provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
relating to organization and principal business shall be deemed to have 
met these registrant eligibility requirements provided that such foreign 
issuer files the same reports with the Commission under section 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act as a domestic registrant pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (7) If the registrant is a successor registrant, it shall be deemed 
to have met conditions in paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), and (5) of this 
section if:
    (i) its predecessor and it, taken together, do so, provided that the 
succession was primarily for the purpose of changing the state of 
incorporation of the predecessor or forming a holding company and that 
the assets and liabilities of the successor at the time of succession 
were substantially the same as those of the predecessor; or
    (ii) If all predecessors met the conditions at the time of 
succession and the registrant has continued to do so since the 
succession.
    (8) Electronic filings. In addition to satisfying the foregoing 
conditions, a registrant subject to the electronic filing requirements 
of Rule 101 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.101 of this chapter) shall have 
filed with the Commission:
    (i) All required electronic filings, including confirming electronic 
copies of documents submitted in paper pursuant to a temporary hardship 
exemption as provided in Rule 201 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.201 of 
this chapter); and
    (ii) All Financial Data Schedules required to be submitted pursuant 
to Item 601(c) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.601(c) of this chapter) and 
Item 601(c) of Regulation D-B (Sec. 228.601(c) of this chapter).
    (b) Transaction requirements. Security offerings meeting any of the 
following conditions and made by registrants meeting the Registrant 
Requirements above may be registered on this Form:

[[Page 762]]

    (1) Primary and secondary offerings by certain registrants. 
Securities to be offered for cash by or on behalf of a registrant, or 
outstanding securities to be offered for cash for the account of any 
person other than the registrant, including securities acquired by 
standby underwriters in connection with the call or redemption by the 
registrant of warrants or a class of convertible securities; provided 
that the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common 
equity held by non-affiliates of the registrant is $75 million or more.

Instruction: The aggregate market value of the registrant's outstanding 
voting stock shall be computed by use of the price at which the stock 
was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of such stock, 
as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing. See the 
definition of affiliate in Securities Act Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405 of 
this chapter).

    (2) Primary offerings of non-convertible investment grade 
securities. Non-convertible securities to be offered for cash by or on 
behalf of a registrant, provided such securities at the time of sale are 
investment grade securities, as defined below. A non-convertible

or has a class of equity securities registered pursuant to section 12(g)

installments on indebtedness for borrowed money, or (B) on any rental on 
one or more long term leases, which defaults in the aggregate are 
material to the financial position of the registrant and its 
consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
    (4) If the registrant is a successor registrant, it shall be deemed 
to have met conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 above if: (i) Its predecessor and 
it, taken together, do so, provided that the succession was primarily 
for the purpose of changing the state or other jurisdiction of 
incorporation of the predecessor or forming a holding company and that 
the assets and liabilities of the successor at the time of succession 
were substantially the same as those of the predecessor; or (ii) all 
predecessors met the conditions at the time of succession and the 
registrant has continued to do so since the succession.
    (5) Majority-owned subsidiaries. If a registrant is a majority-owned 
subsidiary, security offerings may be registered on this form if:
    (i) The registrant-subsidiary itself meets the Registrant 
Requirements and the applicable Transaction Requirement;

Requirements and the conditions of the Transaction Requirement set forth

securities being registered, and the securities being registered are 
non-convertible securities, other than common equity;
    (iv) The parent of the registrant-subsidiary meets the Registrant 
Requirements and the applicable Transaction Requirement, and the 
securities of the registrant-subsidiary being registered are full and

the payment obligations on the parent's non-convertible securities, 
other than common equity, being registered; or
    (v) The parent of the registrant-subsidiary meets the Registrant 
Requirements and the applicable Transaction Requirement, and the 
securities of the registrant-subsidiary being registered are guarantees 
of the payment obligations on the non-convertible securities, other than 
common equity, being registered by another majority-owned subsidiary of 
the parent, where the parent provides a full and unconditional 
guarantee, as defined in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, of such non-
convertible securities.

    Note to paragraph (a)(5): In the situations described in paragraphs 
(a)(5)(iii), (a)(5)(iv); and (a)(5)(v) of this section, the parent or 
majority-owned subsidiary guarantor is the issuer of a separate security 
consisting of the guarantee, which must be concurrently registered, but 
may be registered on the same registration statement as are the 
guaranteed non-convertible securities. Both the parent and majority-
owned subsidiary shall each disclose the information required by this 
Form as if each were the only registrant except that if the majority-
owned subsidiary will not be eligible to file annual reports on Form 20-
F or Form 40-F (Sec. 249.220f or Sec. 249.240f of this chapter) after

asked prices of such stock, in the principal market for such stock as of 
a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing. See the definition of

security in one of its generic rating categories that signifies 
investment grade; typically, the four highest rating categories (within 
which there may be subcategories or gradations indicating relative 
standing) signify investment grade. In the case of securities registered 
pursuant to this paragraph, the financial statements included in this 
registration statement may comply with Item 17 or 18 of Form 20-F (Sec. 
249.220f of this chapter).

financial statements included in this registration statement may comply 
with Item 17 or 18 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter). In 
addition, Form F-3 (Sec. 239.33) may be used by affiliates to register

statement must comply with Item 18 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this 
chapter).
    (4) Rights offerings, dividend or interest reinvestment plans, and

Sec. 239.37  Form F-7, for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of securities of certain Canadian issuers offered for cash upon the exercise of rights 
          granted to existing securityholders.

    (a) Form F-7 may be used for the registration under the Securities 
Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') of the registrant's securities 
offered for cash upon the exercise of rights to purchase or subscribe 
for such securities that are granted to its existing securityholders in 
proportion to the number of securities held by them as of the record 
date for the rights offer.
    (b) Form F-7 is available to any registrant that:
    (1) Is incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any 
Canadian province or territory;
    (2) Is a foreign private issuer; and
    (3) Has had a class of its securities listed on The Montreal 
Exchange, The Toronto Stock Exchange or the Senior Board of the 
Vancouver Stock Exchange for the 12 calendar months immediately 
preceding the filing of this Form, has been subject to the continuous 
disclosure requirements of any securities commission or equivalent 
regulatory authority in Canada for a period of at least 36 calendar 
months immediately preceding the filing of this Form, and is currently 
in compliance with obligations arising from such listing and reporting.

Instruction: For purposes of this Form, ``foreign private issuer'' shall 
be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.

    (c) If the registrant is a successor registrant subsisting after a 
statutory amalgamation, merger, arrangement or other reorganization 
requiring the vote of shareholders of the participating companies (a 
``business combination''), the registrant shall be deemed to meet the 
36-month reporting requirement and the 12-month listing requirement of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section if:
    (1) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the 
continuous disclosure requirements of any securities commission or 
equivalent regulatory authority in Canada, when added separately to the 
time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at the time 
of the business combination, in each case equals at least 36 calendar 
months, provided, however, that any predecessor need not be considered 
for purposes of the reporting history calculation if the reporting

    (b) This Form shall not be used for registration of securities if no 
takeover bid circular or issuer bid circular (in the case of an exchange 
offer) or information circular (in the case of a business combination)

the underlying securities to which they relate are issued by the

affiliate of either.

Instruction: For purposes of this Form, an ``affiliate'' of a person is

which such shares were last sold, or the average of the bid and asked 
prices of such shares, in the principal market for such shares as of a 
date within 60 days prior to the date of filing. If there is no market 
for any of such securities, the book value of such securities computed 
as of the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this Form shall 
be used for purposes of calculating the market value, unless the issuer 
of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an 
accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal 
amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.

    (e) In the case of an exchange offer, the securities to be 
registered on this Form shall be offered to U. S. holders upon terms and 
conditions not less favorable than those offered to any other holder of 
the same class of the securities to be exchanged (the ``subject

considered for purposes of the listing history calculation if the 
listing histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues,

to a prior offer, over the 12 calendar month period prior to 
commencement of the initial offer (based on volume figures published by 
such exchanges and NASDAQ and CDN) ; (b) the most recent annual report 
or annual information form filed or submitted by the issuer with 
securities regulators of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta

from continuing operations of the successor registrant, as measured 
based on pro forma combination of the participating companies' most 
recently completed fiscal years, each meet such public float

Sec. 239.41  Form F-80, for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of securities of certain Canadian issuers to be issued in exchange offers or a 
          business combination.

    (a) Form F-80 may be used for registration under the Securities Act 
of 1933 (``Securities Act'') of securities to be issued in an exchange 
offer or in connection with a statutory amalgamation, merger, 
arrangement or other reorganization requiring the vote of shareholders 
of the participating companies (a ``business combination''). Securities 
may be registered on this Form whether they constitute the sole 
consideration for such exchange offer or business combination, or are 
offered in conjunction with cash.
    (b) This Form shall not be used for registration of securities if no 
takeover bid circular or issuer bid circular (in the case of an exchange 
offer) or information circular (in the case of a business combination) 
is prepared pursuant to the requirements of any Canadian jurisdiction 
due to the availability of an exemption from such requirements.
    (c) This Form may not be used for registration of derivative 
securities except:
    (1) Warrants, options and rights, provided that such securities and 
the underlying securities to which they relate are issued by the 
registrant, its parent or an affiliate of either; and
    (2) Convertible securities, provided that such securities are 
convertible only into securities of the registrant, its parent or an 
affiliate of either.

Instruction: For purposes of this Form, an ``affiliate'' of a person is 
anyone who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises 
control or direction over, more than 10 percent of the outstanding 
equity shares of such person. The determination of a person's affiliates 
shall be made as of the end of such person's most recently completed 
fiscal year.

    (d) In the case of an exchange offer, Form F-80 is available to any 
registrant that:
    (1) Is incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any 
Canadian province or territory;
    (2) Is a foreign private issuer;
    (3) Has had a class of its securities listed on The Montreal 
Exchange, The Toronto Stock Exchange or the Senior

[[Page 783]]

Board of the Vancouver Stock Exchange for the 12 calendar months 
immediately preceding the filing of this Form, has been subject to the 
continuous disclosure requirements of any securities commission or 
equivalent regulatory authority in Canada for a period of at least 36 
calendar months immediately preceding the filing of this Form, and is 
currently in compliance with obligations arising from such listing and 
reporting; and
    (4) Has an aggregate market value of the public float of its 
outstanding equity shares of (CN) $75 million or more; provided, 
however, that such public float requirement need not be satisfied if the 
issuer of the securities to be exchanged is also the registrant on this 
Form.

Instructions: 1. For purposes of this Form, ``foreign private issuer'' 
shall be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
    2. For purposes of this Form, ``equity shares'' shall mean common 
shares, non-voting equity shares and subordinate or restricted voting 
equity shares, but shall not include preferred shares.
    3. For purposes of this Form, the ``public float'' of specified 
securities shall mean only such securities held by persons other than 
affiliates of the issuer.
    4. For purposes of this Form, the market value of the public float 
of outstanding equity shares shall be computed by use of the price at 
which such shares were last sold, or the average of the bid and asked 
prices of such shares, in the principal market for such shares as of a 
date within 60 days prior to the date of filing. If there is no market 
for any of such securities, the book value of such securities computed 
as of the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this Form shall 
be used for purposes of calculating the market value, unless the issuer 
of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an 
accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal 
amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.

    (e) In the case of an exchange offer, the securities to be 
registered on this Form shall be offered to U. S. holders upon terms and 
conditions not less favorable than those offered to any other holder of 
the same class of the securities to be exchanged (the ``subject 
securities'') for the securities of the registrant.
    (f) In the case of an exchange offer, if the registrant is a 
successor registrant subsisting after a business combination, the 
registrant shall be deemed to meet the 36-month reporting requirement 
and the 12-month listing requirement of paragraph (d) (3) of this 
section if:
    (1) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the 
continuous disclosure requirements of any securities commission or 
equivalent regulatory authority in Canada, when added separately to the 
time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at the time 
of the business combination, in each case equals at least 36 calendar 
months, provided, however, that any predecessor need not be considered 
for purposes of the reporting history calculation if the reporting 
histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues, respectively, 
would contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets and gross 
revenues from continuing operations of the successor registrant, as 
measured based on pro forma combination of such participating companies' 
most recently completed fiscal years immediately prior to the business 
combination, when combined with the reporting history of the successor 
registrant in each case satisfy such 36-month reporting requirement;
    (2) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the 
listing requirements of the specified exchanges, when added separately 
to the time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at 
the time of the business combination, in each case equals at least 12 
calendar months, provided, however, that any predecessor need not be 
considered for purposes of the listing history calculation if the 
listing histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues, 
respectively, would contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets 
and gross revenues from continuing operations of the successor 
registrant, as measured based on pro forma combination of such 
participating companies' most recently completed fiscal years 
immediately prior to the business combination, when combined with the 
listing history of the successor registrant in each case satisfy such 
12-month listing requirement; and

[[Page 784]]

    (3) The successor registrant has been subject to such continuous 
disclosure requirements and listing requirements since the business

thereunder.
    (g) In the case of an exchange offer, the issuer of the subject 
securities shall be incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada 
or any Canadian province or territory and be a foreign private issuer, 
and less than 40 percent of the class of subject securities outstanding 
shall be held by U.S. holders.

Instructions: 1. For purposes of exchange offers, the term ``U.S. 
holder'' shall mean any person whose address appears on the records of 
the issuer of the subject securities, any voting trustee, any 
depositary, any share transfer agent or any person acting in a similar 
capacity on behalf of the issuer of the subject securities as being 
located in the United States.
    2. With respect to any tender offer, including any exchange offer, 
otherwise eligible to proceed in accordance with Rule 14d-1(b) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), the issuer of 
the subject securities will be presumed to be a foreign private issuer 
and U.S. holders will be presumed to hold less than 40 percent of such 
outstanding securities, unless (a) the aggregate trading volume of that 
class on national securities exchanges in the United States and on 
NASDAQ exceeded its aggregate trading volume on securities exchanges in 
Canada and on the Canadian Dealing Network, Inc. (``CDN'') over the 12 
calendar month period prior to commencement of this offer, or if 
commenced in response to a prior offer, over the 12 calendar month 
period prior to commencement of the initial offer (based on volume 
figures published by such exchanges and NASDAQ and CDN); (b) the most 
recent annual report or annual information form filed or submitted by 
the issuer with securities regulators of Ontario, Quebec, British 
Columbia or Alberta (or, if the issuer of the subject securities is not 
a reporting issuer in any of such provinces, with any other Canadian 
securities regulator) or with the Commission indicates that U.S. holders 
hold 40 percent or more of the outstanding subject class of securities; 
or (c) the offeror has actual knowledge that the level of U.S. ownership 
equals or exceeds 40 percent of such securities.
    3. For purposes of this Form, if this Form is filed during the 
pendency of one or more ongoing cash tender or exchange offers for 
securities of the class subject to the offer that was commenced or was 
eligible to be commenced on Schedule 13E-4F, Schedule 14D-1F, and/or 
Form F-8 or Form F-80, the date for calculation of U.S. ownership shall 
be the same as that date used by the initial bidder or issuer.
    4. For purposes of this Form, the class of subject securities shall 
not include any securities that may be converted into or are 
exchangeable for the subject securities.
    5. For purposes of exchange offers, the calculation of U.S. holders 
shall be made as of the end of the subject issuer's last quarter or, if 
such quarter terminated within 60 days of the filing date, as of the end 
of such issuer's preceding quarter.

    (h) In the case of a business combination, Form F-80 is available 
if:

disclosure requirements of any securities commission or equivalent 
regulatory authority in Canada for a period of at least 36 calendar 
months immediately preceding the filing of this Form, and is currently

requirement if other participating companies whose assets and gross 
revenues, respectively, would contribute at least 80 percent of the 
total assets and gross revenues from continuing operations of the 
successor registrant, as measured based on pro forma combination of the 
participating companies' most recently completed fiscal years, each meet 
such reporting and listing requirements; and
    (3) The aggregate market value of the public float of the 
outstanding equity shares of each company participating in the business 
combination other than the successor registrant is (CN) $75 million or 
more; provided, however, that

[[Page 785]]

any such participating company shall not be required to meet such public 
float requirement if other participating companies whose assets and 
gross revenues, respectively, would contribute at least 80 percent of 
the total assets and gross revenues from continuing operations of the 
successor registrant, as measured based on pro forma combination of the 
participating companies' most recently completed fiscal years, each meet 
such public float requirement; and, provided further, that such public 
float requirement shall be deemed satisfied in the case of a 
participating company whose equity shares were the subject of an 
exchange offer that was registered or would have been eligible for 
registration on Form F-8, Form F-9, Form F-10 or Form F-80, or a tender 
offer in connection with which Schedule 13E-4F or 14D-1F was filed or 
could have been filed, that terminated within the last twelve months, if 
the participating company would have satisfied such public float 
requirement immediately prior to commencement of such exchange or tender 
offer.
    (i) In the case of a business combination, less than 40 percent of 
the class of securities to be offered by the successor registrant shall 
be held by U.S. holders, as if measured immediately after completion of 
the business combination.

Instructions: 1. For purposes of business combinations, the term ``U.S.

holders shall be made by a participant as of the end of such

    (a) Except as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, this form 
shall be filed in triplicate with the Commission at its principal office 
in Washington, DC, by each person who intends to sell securities in 
reliance upon Sec. 230.144 of this chapter and shall be transmitted for

    (b) This form need not be filed if the amount of securities to be 
sold during any period of three months does not exceed 5,000 shares or 
other units and the aggregate sale price does not exceed $50,000.

Securities Act of 1933 (17 CFR 230) and Rule 144 thereunder, the 
Commission is authorized to solicit the information required to be 
supplied by this form by persons desiring to sell unregistered 
securities. Disclosure of the information specified in this form is 
mandatory before processing notices of proposed sale of securities under 
Sec. 230.144 of this chapter. The information will be used for the 
primary purpose of disclosing the proposed sale of unregistered 
securities by persons deemed not to be engaged in the distribution of 
securities. This notice will be made a matter of public record. 
Therefore, any information given will be available for inspection by any 
member of the public. Because of the public nature of the information, 
the Commission can utilize it for a variety of purposes, including 
referral to other governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory 
organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection with 
litigation involving the Federal securities laws or other civil, 
criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Failure to disclose the 
information requested by Form 144 would make an exception under Sec. 
230.144 of this chapter unavailable and may result in civil or criminal 
action for violations of the Federal securities laws.
