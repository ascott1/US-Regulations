                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 200.1  General statement and statutory authority.

    The Securities and Exchange Commission was created in 1934 under the 
Securities Exchange Act. That Act transferred to the Commission the 
administration of the Securities Act of 1933, formerly administered by 
the Federal Trade Commission. Subsequent laws assigned to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission for administration are: Public Utility Holding 
Company Act of 1935, Trust Indenture Act of 1939, Investment Company Act 
of 1940, and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, under the 
Bankruptcy Code, the Commission is a statutory party in cases arising 
under chapters 9 and 11. Considered together, the laws administered by 
the Commission provided for the following.
    (a) Public disclosure of pertinent facts concerning public offerings 
of securities and securities listed on national securities exchanges and 
certain securities traded in the over-the-counter markets.
    (b) Enforcement of disclosure requirements in the soliciting of 
proxies for meetings of security holders by companies whose securities 
are registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, public utility holding companies, and their subsidiaries and 
investment companies.

[[Page 8]]

    (c) Regulation of the trading in securities on national securities 
exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.
    (d) Investigation of securities frauds, manipulations, and other 
violations, and the imposition and enforcement of legal sanctions 
therefor.
    (e) Registration, and the regulation of certain activities, of 
brokers, dealers and investment advisers.
    (f) Supervision of the activities of mutual funds and other 
investment companies.
    (g) Administration of statutory standards governing protective and 
other provisions of trust indentures under which debt securities are 
sold to the public.
    (h) Regulation of the purchase and sale of securities, utility 
properties, and other assets by registered public utility holding 
companies and their electric and gas utility subsidiaries; enforcement 
of statutory standards for public utility holding company system 
simplification and integration; and approval of their reorganization, 
mergers and consolidations.
    (i) Protection of the interests of public investors involved in 
bankruptcy reorganization cases and in bankruptcy cases involving the 
adjustment of debts of a municipality.
    (j) Administrative sanctions, injunctive remedies, civil money 
penalties and criminal prosecution. There are also private rights of 
action for investors injured by violations of the Acts.

<R05>
Sec. 200.2  Statutory functions.

    Following are brief descriptions of the Commission's functions under 
each of the statutes it administers:
    (a) Securities Act of 1933. (1) Issuers of securities making public 
offerings for sale in interstate commerce or through the mails, directly 
or by others on their behalf, are required to file with the Commission 
registration statements containing financial and other pertinent data 
about the issuer and the offering. A similar requirement is provided 
with respect to such public offerings on behalf of a controlling person 
of the issuer. Unless a registration statement is in effect with respect 
to such securities, it is unlawful to sell the securities in interstate 
commerce or through the mails. (There are certain limited exemptions, 
such as government securities, non-public offerings, and intrastate 
offerings.) The effectiveness of a registration statement may be refused 
or suspended after a hearing if the statement contains material 
misstatements or omissions, thus barring sale of the securities until it 
is appropriately amended. Registration is not a finding by the 
Commission as to the accuracy of the facts disclosed; and it is unlawful 
so to represent. Moreover, registration of securities does not imply 
approval of the issue by the Commission or insure investors against loss 
in their purchase, but serves rather to provide information upon which 
investors may make an informed and realistic evaluation of the worth of 
the securities.
    (2) Persons responsible for filing false information with the 
Commission subject themselves to the risk of fine or imprisonment or 
both; and the issuing company, its directors, officers, and the 
underwriters and dealers and others may be liable in damages to 
purchasers of registered securities if the disclosures in the 
registration statements and prospectus are materially defective. Also 
the statute contains antifraud provisions which apply generally to the 
sale of securities, whether or not registered.
    (b) Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This Act requires the filing of 
registration applications and annual and other reports with national 
securities exchanges and the Commission, by companies whose securities 
are listed on the exchanges. Annual and other reports must be filed also 
by certain companies whose securities are traded on the over-the-counter 
markets. These must contain financial and other data prescribed by the 
Commission for the information of investors. Material misstatements or 
omissions are grounds for suspension or withdrawal of the security from 
exchange trading. This Act makes unlawful any solicitation of proxies, 
authorizations, or consents in contravention of Commission

[[Page 9]]

rules. These rules require disclosure of information about the subject 
of the solicitation to security holders. The Act requires disclosure of 
the holdings and the transactions by an officer, director, or beneficial 
owner of over 10 percent of any class of equity security of certain 
companies. It also requires disclosure of the beneficial owners of more 
than five percent of any class of equity securities of a registered 
company. It provides substantive and procedural protection to security 
holders in third-party and issuer tender offers. The Act also provides 
for the registration with, and regulation by, the Commission of national 
securities exchanges, brokers or dealers engaged in an over-the-counter 
securities business, and national associations of such brokers or 
dealers. It gives the Commission rulemaking power with respect to short 
sales, stabilizing, floor trading activities of specialists and odd-lot 
dealers, and such matters as excessive trading by exchange members. The 
Act authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to 
prescribe minimum margin requirements for listed securities.
    (c) Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This Act authorizes 
the Commission to regulate gas and electric public-utility holding 
companies under standards prescribed for the protection of the public 
interest and the interest of investors and consumers. The Act generally 
limits a public-utility holding company to a single integrated public-
utility system, and requires simple corporate and capital structures. If 
not exempt, a public-utility holding company must register with the 
Commission. Generally, a registered holding company must obtain 
Commission approval before it can issue and sell securities, acquire 
utility securities or assets or any other interest in any business, or 
enter into transactions with its affiliates. It must also comply with 
extensive reporting and record-keeping requirements. Although largely 
free of these requirements, an exempt holding company remains subject to 
the geographic limitations of the Act. The Act permits the acquisition 
of interests in ``exempt wholesale generators'' and ``foreign utility 
companies'' unrelated to a system's utility operations.
    (d) Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This Act safeguards the interests 
of purchasers of publicly-offered debt securities issued under trust 
indentures by requiring the inclusion of certain protective provisions 
in, and the exclusion of certain types of exculpatory clauses from, 
trust indentures. The Act also requires that an independent indenture 
trustee represent the debtors by proscribing certain relationships that 
could conflict with proper exercise of duties.
    (e) Investment Company Act of 1940. This Act establishes a 
comprehensive regulatory framework for investment companies and subjects 
their activities to regulation under standards prescribed for the 
protection of investors. Among other things, the Act provides for the 
registration of investment companies with the Commission; requires them 
to disclose their financial condition and investment policies to their 
shareholders; prohibits them from substantially changing investment 
policies without shareholder approval; bars persons guilty of securities 
fraud from serving as officers or directors; prevents underwriters, 
investment bankers, or brokers from constituting more than a minority of 
the directors of an investment company; requires that management 
contracts be submitted to shareholders for their approval; prohibits 
transactions between investment companies and their directors, officers, 
or affiliated companies or persons, except when approved by the 
Commission; and prohibits investment companies from issuing senior 
securities except under specified terms and conditions. The Act also 
regulates advisory fees, sales and repurchases of securities, exchange 
offers, and other activities of investment companies. The Act authorizes 
the Commission to exempt any person or class of persons or securities 
from any provisions of, or rules under, the Act and to conduct any 
investigation it deems necessary to determine existing or potential 
violations of the Act. It also authorizes the Commission to prepare 
reports to security holders on the fairness of plans of reorganization, 
merger, or consolidation. The Commission may institute a

[[Page 10]]

court action to enjoin acts or practices of management involving, among 
other things, a breach of fiduciary duty and the consummation of plans 
of reorganization, merger, or consolidation that are grossly unfair to 
security holders.
    (f) Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Persons who, for compensation, 
engage in the business of advising others with respect to their security 
transactions must register with the Commission. Their activities in the 
conduct of such business are subject to standards of the act which make 
unlawful those practices which constitute fraud or deceit and which 
require, among other things, disclosure of any interests they may have 
in transactions executed for clients. The Act grants to the Commission 
rule-making power with respect to fraudulent and other activities of 
investment advisers.
    (g) Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy 
Code (11 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) provides for Commission participation as a 
statutory party in reorganization cases. Under section 1109(a) of the 
Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 1109(a)), which also applies to Chapter 9 
cases regarding municipalities, the Commission ``may raise and may 
appear and be heard on any issue in the case.''

Sec. 200.16  Executive Assistant to the Chairman.

    The Executive Assistant to the Chairman assists the Chairman in 
consideration of legal, financial, and economic problems encountered in 
the administration of the Commission's statutes. He or she arranges for 
and conducts conferences with officials of the Commission, members of 
the staff, and/or representatives of the public on matters arising with 
regard to general programs or specific matters. Acting for the Chairman, 
he or she furnishes the initiative, executive direction, and authority 
for staff studies and reports bearing on the Commission's administration 
of the laws and its relations with the public, industry, and the 
Congress. The Executive Assistant is also responsible for assisting 
members of the Commission in the preparation of the opinions of the 
Commission, and to the Commission for the preparation of opinions and 
decisions on motions and certifications of questions and rulings by 
administrative law judges in the course of administrative proceedings 
under Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice (Sec. 201.102(e) 
of this chapter), and in other cases in which the Chairman or the 
General Counsel has determined that separation of functions requirements 
or other circumstances would make inappropriate the exercise of such 
functions by the General Counsel. In cases where, pursuant to a waiver 
by the parties of separation of function requirements, another Division 
or Office of the Commission's staff undertakes to prepare an opinion or 
decision, such Division or Office rather than the Executive Assistant 
will prepare such opinion or decision, although the Executive Assistant 
may assist in such preparation. The Executive Assistant is further 
responsible for the exercise of such review functions with respect to 
adjudicatory matters as are delegated to him or her by the Commission 
pursuant to 101 Stat. 1254 (15 U.S.C. 78d-1, 78d-2) or as may be 
otherwise delegated or assigned to him or her.

    Pursuant to the provisions of Pub. L. 87-592, 76 Stat. 394 (15

    (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to issue notices, 
under Sec. 270.0-5 of this chapter, with respect to applications for 
orders under the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and, with 
respect to section 8(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(f)), in cases where 
no application has been filed, where, upon examination, the matter does 
not appear to the Director to present significant issues that have not 
been previously settled by the Commission or to raise questions of fact 
or policy indicating that the public interest or the interest of 
investors warrants that the Commission consider the matter.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to authorize the 
issuance of orders where a notice, under Sec. 270.0-5 of this chapter, 
has been issued and no request for a hearing has been received from any 
interested person within the period specified in the notice and the 
Director believes that the matter presents no significant issues that 
have not been previously settled by the Commission and it does not 
appear to the Director to be necessary in the public interest or the 
interest of investors that the Commission consider the matter.
    (3) To permit the withdrawal of applications pursuant to the Act (15 
U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.)
    (4) In connection with the mailing of reports to stockholders and 
the filing with the Commission of registration statements and of 
reports:
    (i) To grant reasonable extensions of time, upon a showing of good 
cause and that it would not be contrary to the public interest or 
inconsistent with the protection of investors; and
    (ii) To deny requests for extensions of time, provided the applicant 
is advised that he can request Commission review of any such denial.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) To authorize the issuance of orders granting confidential 
treatment pursuant to section 45(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-44(a))

the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8), or in reports filed pursuant to section 30 of 
the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-29), but only when the Commission has previously 
by order granted confidential treatment to the same information.
    (7) To issue notices, pursuant to Rule 0-5(a) (Sec. 270.0-5(a) of 
this chapter) with respect to applications for temporary and permanent 
orders under section 9(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15

persons, for a temporary period not exceeding 60 days, from section 9(a) 
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-9(a)), if, on the 
basis of the facts then set forth in the application, it appears that:
    (i)(A) The prohibitions of section 9(a), as applied to the 
applicant, may be unduly or disproportionately severe, or (B) the 
applicant's conduct has been such as not to make it against the public 
interest or the protection of investors to grant the temporary 
exemption; and
    (ii) Granting the temporary exemption would protect the interests of 
the investment companies being served by

[[Page 34]]

the applicant by allowing time for the orderly consideration of the 
application for permanent relief or the orderly transition of the 
applicant's responsibilities to a successor, or both.
    (8) To issue--
    (i) Notices, pursuant to Rule 0-5(a) (Sec. 270.0-5(a) of this

unconditionally persons from section 9(a) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-

applicant, may be unduly or disproportionately severe, or the 
applicant's conduct has been such as not to make it against the public 
interest or the protection of investors to grant the exemption;
    (B) The prohibitions arise under section 9(a)(3) of the Act solely 
because the applicant employs, or will employ, a person who is 
disqualified under section 9(a) (1) or (2) of the Act; and,
    (C) The employee does not and will not serve in any capacity 
directly related to providing investment advice to, or acting as

application, it appears that:
    (A) The prohibitions arise under section 9(a)(3) of the Act solely 
because the applicant employs a person who is disqualified under section 
9(a) (1) or (2) of the Act; and
    (B) Applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(8)(i) (A) and 
(C) of this section.

connection with stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plans

of section 401(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 where, upon

policy indicating that the public interest or the interest of investors 
requires that a hearing be held.
    (2) To authorize the issuance of orders where a notice has been 
issued and no request for a hearing has been received from any 
interested person within the period specified in the notice and the

    (a) Whenever the Commission's Chairman, or the Commission member 
designated as duty officer pursuant to Sec. 200.43, is of the opinion 
that joint deliberation among the members of the Commission upon any 
matter is unnecessary in light of the nature of the matter, 
impracticable, or contrary to the requirements of agency business, but 
is of the view that such matter should be the subject of a vote of the 
Commission, such matter may be disposed of by circulation of any 
relevant materials concerning the matter among all Commission members. 
Each participating Commission member shall report his or her vote to the 
Secretary, who shall record it in the Minute Record of the Commission. 
Any matter circulated for disposition pursuant to this subsection shall 
not be considered final until each Commission member has reported his or 
her vote to the Secretary or has reported to the

[[Page 49]]

Secretary that the Commissioner does not intend to participate in the 
matter.
    (b) Whenever any member of the Commission so requests, any matter 
circulated for disposition pursuant to Sec. 200.42(a) shall be withdrawn 
from circulation and scheduled instead for joint Commission 
deliberation.

<R05>
Sec. 200.43  Disposition of business by exercise of authority delegated to individual Commissioner.

    (a) Delegation to duty officer. (1) Pursuant to the provisions of 
Pub. L. No. 87-592, 76 Stat. 394, as amended by section 25 of Pub. L. 
94-29, 89 Stat. 163, the Commission hereby delegates to an individual 
Commissioner, to be designated as the Commission's ``duty officer'' by 
the Chairman of the Commission (or by the Chairman's designee) from time 
to time, all of the functions of the Commission; Provided, however, That 
no such delegation shall authorize the duty officer (i) to exercise the 
function of rulemaking, as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act 
of 1946, as codified, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., with reference to general 
rules as distinguished from rules of particular applicability; (ii) to 
make any rule, pursuant to section 19(c) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934; or (iii) to preside at the taking of evidence as described in 
section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556(b), 
except that the duty officer may preside at the taking of evidence with 
respect to the issuance of a temporary cease-and-desist order as 
provided by Rule 511(c) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 
Sec. 201.511(c) of this chapter.
    (2) To the extent feasible, the designation of a duty officer shall 
rotate, under the administration of the Secretary, on a regular weekly 
basis among the members of the Commission other than the Chairman.
    (b) Exercise of duty officer authority. (1) The authority delegated 
by this rule shall be exercised when, in the opinion of the duty 
officer, action is required to be taken which, by reason of its urgency, 
cannot practicably be scheduled for consideration at a Commission 
meeting. After consideration of a staff recommendation involving such a 
matter, the duty officer shall forthwith report his or her action 
thereon to the Secretary.
    (2) The duty officer may, when in his or her opinion it would be 
proper and timely, exercise the authority delegated in this section to 
initiate by order a nonpublic formal investigative proceeding pursuant 
to section 19(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77s(b)), 
section 21(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u(b)), 
section 18(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 
U.S.C. 79r(c)), section 42(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 
U.S.C. 80a-41(b)), section 209(b) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 
(15 U.S.C. 80b-9(b)), and part 203 (Rules Relating to Investigations) of 
this title (17 CFR part 203). After consideration of a staff 
recommendation for initiation by order of a nonpublic formal 
investigative proceeding, the duty officer shall forthwith report his or 
her action thereon to the Secretary.
    (3) In any consideration of Commission business by a duty officer, 
the provisions of subpart I herein, Sec. 200.400 et seq., shall not 
apply, whether or not the duty officer, in exercising his or her 
authority, consults with, or seeks the advice of, other members of the 
Commission individually.
    (c) Commission affirmation of duty officer action. (1) Any action 
authorized by a duty officer pursuant to Sec. 200.43(a) shall be either 
(i) circulated to the members of the Commission for affirmation pursuant 
to Sec. 200.42; or (ii) scheduled for affirmation at a Commission 
meeting at the earliest practicable date consistent with the procedures 
in subpart I.
    (2)(i) The Commission may, in its discretion, at any time review any 
unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer, either upon its own 
initiative or upon the petition of any person affected thereby. The vote 
of any one member of the Commission, including the duty officer, shall 
be sufficient to bring any such unaffirmed action taken by a duty 
officer before the Commission for review.
    (ii) A person or party adversely affected by any unaffirmed action 
taken by a duty officer shall be entitled to

[[Page 50]]

seek review by the Commission of the duty officer's unaffirmed actions, 
but only in the event that the unaffirmed action by the duty officer (A) 
denies any request for action pursuant to sections 8(a) or 8(c) of the 
Securities Act of 1933, or the first sentence of section 12(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (B) suspends trading in a security 
pursuant to section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (C) 
is pursuant to any provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in a 
case of adjudication, as defined in section 551 of Title 5, U.S. Code, 
not required by that Act to be determined on the record after notice and 
opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter 
described in section 554(a) (1) through (6) of Title 5, United States 
Code).
    (3) Affirmed or unaffirmed action taken by the duty officer shall be 
deemed to be, for all purposes, the action of the Commission unless and 
until the Commission directs otherwise. Rule 26 of the Commission's 
rules of practice, 17 CFR 201.26, shall not apply to duty officer 
action.

    Source: 25 FR 6725, July 15, 1960, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 200.50  Authority.

    The Canons of Ethics for Members of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission were approved by the Commission on July 22, 1958.


<R05>
Sec. 200.51  Policy.

    It is characteristic of the administrative process that the Members 
of the Commission and their place in public opinion are affected by the 
advice and conduct of the staff, particularly the professional and 
executive employees. It shall be the policy of the Commission to require 
that employees bear in mind the principles specified in the Canons.


<R05>
Sec. 200.52  Copies of the Canons.

    The Canons have been distributed to employees of the Commission. In 
addition, executive and professional employees are issued copies of the 
Canons upon entrance on duty.


<R05>
Sec. 200.53  Preamble.

    (a) Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission are entrusted 
by various enactments of the Congress with powers and duties of great 
social and economic significance to the American people. It is their 
task to regulate varied aspects of the American economy, within the 
limits prescribed by Congress, to insure that our private enterprise 
system serves the welfare of all citizens. Their success in this 
endeavor is a bulwark against possible abuses and injustice which, if 
left unchecked, might jeopardize the strength of our economic 
institutions.
    (b) It is imperative that the members of this Commission continue to 
conduct themselves in their official and personal relationships in a 
manner which commands the respect and confidence of their fellow 
citizens. Members of this Commission shall continue to be mindful of, 
and strictly abide by, the standards of personal conduct set forth in 
its regulation regarding Conduct of Members and Employees and Former 
Members and Employees of the Commission, which is set forth in subpart M 
of this part 200, most of which has been in effect for many years, and 
which was originally codified in 1953.
    (c) However, in addition to the continued observance of those 
principles of personal conduct, it is fitting and proper for the members 
of the Commission to restate and resubscribe to the standards of conduct 
applicable to its executive, legislative and judicial responsibilities.

[25 FR 6725, July 15, 1960, as amended at 31 FR 13533, Oct. 20, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 200.54  Constitutional obligations.

    The members of this Commission have undertaken in their oaths of 
office to support the Federal Constitution. Insofar as the enactments of 
the Congress impose executive duties upon

[[Page 51]]

the members, they must faithfully execute the laws which they are 
charged with administering. Members shall also carefully guard against 
any infringement of the constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities 
of those who are subject to regulation by this Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.55  Statutory obligations.

    In administering the law, members of this Commission should 
vigorously enforce compliance with the law by all persons affected 
thereby. In the exercise of the rulemaking powers delegated this 
Commission by the Congress, members should always be concerned that the 
rulemaking power be confined to the proper limits of the law and be 
consistent with the statutory purposes expressed by the Congress. In the 
exercise of their judicial functions, members shall honestly, fairly and 
impartially determine the rights of all persons under the law.


<R05>
Sec. 200.56  Personal conduct.

    Appointment to the office of member of this Commission is a high 
honor and requires that the conduct of a member, not only in the 
performance of the duties of his office but also in his everyday life, 
should be beyond reproach.


<R05>
Sec. 200.57  Relationships with other members.

    Each member should recognize that his conscience and those of other 
members are distinct entities and that differing shades of opinion 
should be anticipated. The free expression of opinion is a safeguard 
against the domination of this Commission by less than a majority, and 
is a keystone of the commission type of administration. However, a 
member should never permit his personal opinion so to conflict with the 
opinion of another member as to develop animosity or unfriendliness in 
the Commission, and every effort should be made to promote solidarity of 
conclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 200.58  Maintenance of independence.

    This Commission has been established to administer laws enacted by 
the Congress. Its members are appointed by the President by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate to serve terms as provided by law. 
However, under the law, this is an independent Agency, and in performing 
their duties, members should exhibit a spirit of firm independence and 
reject any effort by representatives of the executive or legislative 
branches of the government to affect their independent determination of 
any matter being considered by this Commission. A member should not be 
swayed by partisan demands, public clamor or considerations of personal 
popularity or notoriety; so also he should be above fear of unjust 
criticism by anyone.


<R05>
Sec. 200.59  Relationship with persons subject to regulation.

    In all matters before him, a member should administer the law 
without regard to any personality involved, and with regard only to the 
issues. Members should not become indebted in any way to persons who are 
or may become subject to their jurisdiction. No member should accept 
loans, presents or favors of undue value from persons who are regulated 
or who represent those who are regulated. In performing their judicial 
functions, members should avoid discussion of a matter with any person 
outside this Commission and its staff while that matter is pending. In 
the performance of his rule-making and administrative functions, a 
member has a duty to solicit the views of interested persons. Care must 
be taken by a member in his relationship with persons within or outside 
of the Commission to separate the judicial and the rule-making functions 
and to observe the liberties of discussion respectively appropriate. 
Insofar as it is consistent with the dignity of his official position, 
he should maintain contact with the persons outside the agency who may 
be affected by his rule-making functions, but he should not accept 
unreasonable or lavish hospitality in so doing.


<R05>
Sec. 200.60  Qualification to participate in particular matters.

    The question in a particular matter rests with that individual 
member. Each member should weigh carefully the question of his 
qualification with respect to any matter wherein he or

[[Page 52]]

any relatives or former business associates or clients are involved. He 
should disqualify himself in the event he obtained knowledge prior to 
becoming a member of the facts at issue before him in a quasi-judicial 
proceeding, or in other types of proceeding in any matter involving 
parties in whom he has any interest or relationship directly or 
indirectly. If an interested person suggests that a member should 
disqualify himself in a particular matter because of bias or prejudice, 
the member shall be the judge of his own qualification.


<R05>
Sec. 200.61  Impressions of influence.

    A member should not, by his conduct, permit the impression to 
prevail that any person can improperly influence him, that any person 
unduly enjoys his favor or that he is affected in any way by the rank, 
position, prestige, or affluence of any person.


<R05>
Sec. 200.62  Ex parte communications.

    All proceedings required to be determined by the Commission on the 
record shall be determined by the members solely upon the record and the 
arguments of the parties or their counsel properly made in the regular 
course of such proceeding. A member shall at all times comply with the 
Commission's Code of Behavior governing ex parte communications between 
persons outside the Commission and decisional employees, Sec. 200.110 et 
seq.

[28 FR 4446, May 3, 1963]


<R05>
Sec. 200.63  Commission opinions.

    The opinions of the Commission should state the reasons for the 
action taken and contain a clear showing that no serious argument of 
counsel has been disregarded or overlooked. In such manner, a member 
shows a full understanding of the matter before him, avoids the 
suspicion of arbitrary conclusion, promotes confidence in his 
intellectual integrity and may contribute some useful precedent to the 
growth of the law. A member should be guided in his decisions by a deep 
regard for the integrity of the system of law which he administers. He 
should recall that he is not a repository of arbitrary power, but is 
acting on behalf of the public under the sanction of the law.


<R05>
Sec. 200.64  Judicial review.

    The Congress has provided for review by the courts of the decisions 
and orders by this Commission. Members should recognize that their 
obligation to preserve the sanctity of the laws administered by them 
requires that they pursue and prosecute, vigorously and diligently but 
at the same time fairly and impartially and with dignity, all matters 
which they or others take to the courts for judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 200.65  Legislative proposals.

    Members must recognize that the changing conditions in a volatile 
economy may require that they bring to the attention of the Congress 
proposals to amend, modify or repeal the laws administered by them. They 
should urge the Congress, whenever necessary, to effect such amendment, 
modification or repeal of particular parts of the statutes which they 
administer. In any action a member's motivation should be the common 
weal and not the particular interests of any particular group.


<R05>
Sec. 200.66  Investigations.

    The power to investigate carries with it the power to defame and 
destroy. In determining to exercise their investigatory power, members 
should concern themselves only with the facts known to them and the 
reasonable inferences from those facts. A member should never suggest, 
vote for, or participate in an investigation aimed at a particular 
individual for reasons of animus, prejudice or vindictiveness. The 
requirements of the particular case alone should induce the exercise of 
the investigatory power, and no public pronouncement of the pendency of 
such an investigation should be made in the absence of reasonable 
evidence that the law has been violated and that the public welfare 
demand it.


<R05>
Sec. 200.67  Power to adopt rules.

    In exercising its rule-making power, this Commission performs a 
legislative function. The delegation of this power by the Congress 
imposes the obligation

[[Page 53]]

upon the members to adopt rules necessary to effectuate the stated 
policies of the statute in the interest of all of the people. Care 
should be taken to avoid the adoption of rules which seek to extend the 
power of the Commission beyond proper statutory limits. Its rules should 
never tend to stifle or discourage legitimate business enterprises or 
activities, nor should they be interpreted so as unduly and 
unnecessarily to burden those regulated with onerous obligations. On the 
other hand, the very statutory enactments evidence the need for 
regulation, and the necessary rules should be adopted or modifications 
made or rules should be repealed as changing requirements demand without 
fear or favor.


<R05>
Sec. 200.68  Promptness.

    Each member should promptly perform the duties with which he is 
charged by the statutes. The Commission should evaluate continuously its 
practices and procedures to assure that it promptly disposes of all 
matters affecting the rights of those regulated. This is particularly 
desirable in quasi-judicial proceedings. While avoiding arbitrary action 
in unreasonably or unjustly forcing matters to trial, members should 
endeavor to hold counsel to a proper appreciation of their duties to the 
public, their clients and others who are interested. Requests for 
continuances of matters should be determined in a manner consistent with 
this policy.


<R05>
Sec. 200.69  Conduct toward parties and their counsel.

    Members should be temperate, attentive, patient and impartial when 
hearing the arguments of parties or their counsel. Members should not 
condone unprofessional conduct by attorneys in their representation of 
parties. The Commission should continuously assure that its staff 
follows the same principles in their relationships with parties and 
counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 200.70  Business promotions.

    A member must not engage in any other business, employment or 
vocation while in office, nor may he ever use the power of his office or 
the influence of his name to promote the business interests of others.


<R05>
Sec. 200.71  Fiduciary relationships.

    A member should avoid service as a fiduciary if it would interfere 
or seem to interfere with the proper performance of his duties, or if 
the interests of those represented require investments in enterprises 
which are involved in questions to be determined by him. Such 
relationships would include trustees, executors, corporate directors, 
and the like.


<R05>
Sec. 200.72  Supervision of internal organization.

    Members and particularly the Chairman of the Commission should 
scrutinize continuously its internal organization in order to assure 
that such organization handles all matters before it efficiently and 
expeditiously, while recognizing that changing times bring changing 
emphasis in the administration of the laws.

regulation administered by the Commission, by any other Federal, state, 
local, or foreign governmental authority or foreign securities 
authority, by any professional association, or by any securities 
industry self-regulatory organization. The term ``investigatory

condition report prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, the

a specially staffed and equipped public reference room located at 450 
Fifth Street NW., Room 1024, Washington, DC (202-272-3100) and public 
reference facilities in its New York and Chicago regional offices. 
Copying machines, which are available to requesters on a self-service or 
contractor-operated basis, can be used to make immediate copies up to 
8\1/2\ by 14 inches in size of materials that are available for 
inspection in the Washington, DC, New York and Chicago offices. Fees and 
levels of service

[[Page 57]]

are set out in the Commission's schedule of fees in appendix E to this 
section and in information available from the public reference room. The 
Commission accepts only written requests for copies of documents.
    (i) The public reference room in Washington has available for public 
inspection all of the publicly available records of the Commission as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, upon request, 
such records will be sent to the Commission's regional offices in New 
York or Chicago for inspection in the public reference facilities at 
those offices, if the records are not needed by the Commission or the 
staff in connection with the performance of official duties. Also upon 
request, and only when suitable arrangements can be made with respect to 
the transportation, storage, and inspection of records, records may be 
sent to any other Commission office for inspection at that office, if 
the records are not needed by the Commission or the staff in connection 
with the performance of official duties. When records are sent to 
another office at the request of a member of the public, the requestor 
shall be charged all costs incurred by the Commission in transporting 
the records.
    (ii) All regional and district offices of the Commission have 
available for public examination the materials set forth in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section and the SEC Docket, SEC News Digest and other SEC 
publications. Blank forms as well as other general information about the 
operations of the Commission described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may also be available at particular regional and district 
offices.

all recent registration statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act 
of 1933, registration statements and periodic reports filed pursuant to 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and periodic reports filed pursuant 
to the Investment Company Act from 1969 to date are available for

place of requests for access to Commission records. Requests for access 
to records available through the Commission's public reference 
facilities may be made in person during normal business hours at those 
facilities or by mail directed to Public Reference Branch, Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC

[[Page 58]]

20549. In addition, access to agency records not available in public 
reference facilities may be requested pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act. Such requests must be in writing, should be clearly and 
prominently identified by a legend on the first page, such as ``Freedom 
of Information Act Request'', and should be addressed to the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, 
DC 20549.
    (2) Requests for copies of records. Requests for copies of 
Commission records available through the Commission's public reference 
facilities, including those listed in appendix A to this section, may be 
made directly to the appropriate facility either in person or by mail 
addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Reference 
Branch, Washington, DC 20549. Levels of service and charges for copies 
are set out in the Commission's schedule of fees in appendix E to this 
section. Requests for copies of materials to which access has been 
granted pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request will be 
processed pursuant to regulations found in this section in paragraphs 
(e)(9) and (e)(10) and at charges set out in appendix E to this section.
    (3) Description of requested records. Each request for Commission 
records or copies thereof shall reasonably describe the records sought 
with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates and subject 
matter to permit the records to be located among the records maintained 
by or for the Commission. A person who has requested Commission records 
or copies thereof will be promptly advised if the records cannot be 
located on the basis of the description given and that further 
identifying information must be provided before his request can be 
satisfied.
    (4) Normal availability. Records maintained in the Commission's 
public reference facilities or copies thereof will normally be made 
available in keeping with levels of service and fees set out in appendix 
E to this section. Records requested pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act will be made available as described in paragraphs (e)(9) 
and (e)(10) of this section.
    (5) Initial determinations, denials. With respect to any record 
requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer of the Commission will determine within ten days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the 
receipt of a request for inspection of the record or for a copy (or 
within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(7) of this section) whether to comply with such request, 
and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such 
determination and, where it is determined not to comply, the reasons 
therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the General 
Counsel any adverse determination: Provided, That a Director of a staff 
Division of the Commission or Office head whose zone of responsibility 
relates to the record requested (See 17 CFR 200.13, et seq.) may make a 
determination that the record or copy is not lawfully required to be 
made available and should not be made available, in which case he, and 
not the Freedom of Information Act Officer, shall make the required 
notification. The notification of denial of any request for records 
shall set forth the name and title or position of each person 
responsible for the denial.
    (6) Administrative review. Any person who has been notified pursuant 
to paragraph (d)(5) of this section that his request for inspection of a 
record or for a copy has been denied, or who has received no response to 
a request for a record or copy within ten days (or within such extended 
period as may be permitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section) after his request was received by the Commission's staff, may 
appeal to the General Counsel the adverse determination or the failure 
to respond.
    (i) The appeal shall be in writing, shall be clearly and prominently 
identified on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first 
page by a legend such as ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal,'' and 
shall identify the record in the form in which it was originally 
requested.
    (ii) The appeal shall be delivered in person to the Public Reference 
Branch, Room 1024, 450 Fifth Street, NW.,

[[Page 59]]

Washington, DC, or sent by mail addressed to the Freedom of Information 
Act Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549. A 
copy should be sent to the General Counsel, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Washington, DC 20549.
    (iii) The appeal may include such facts and cite such legal or other 
authorities as the person submitting the appeal may consider 
appropriate.
    (iv) The General Counsel shall have the authority to grant or deny 
all appeals, in whole or in part, and to release as an exercise of 
discretion records exempt from mandatory disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552(b). In appropriate cases he or she may, in his or her sole and 
unfettered discretion, refer appeals to the Commission for 
determination.
    (v) A determination with respect to any appeal shall be made within 
twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) 
after the receipt of such appeal or within such extended period as may 
be permitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (vi) A denial of an appeal in whole or in part shall set forth the 
basis for the denial, and shall advise the requester that judicial 
review of the decision is available in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4).
    (7) Extension of time to consider requests and to consider 
administrative appeals. In unusual circumstances, as specified in this 
paragraph, the time limits prescribed in either paragraphs (d) (5) or 
(6) of this section may be extended by written notice to the person 
making a request for a record or a copy, setting forth the reasons for 
such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be 
dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an 
extension for more than ten working days. As used in this paragraph, 
``unusual circumstances'' means, but only to the extent reasonably 
necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:
    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request. (Many records of the Commission are 
stored in Federal Records Centers in accordance with law--including many 
of the documents which have been on file with the Commission for more 
than 2 years--and cannot be made available for several days after a 
request has been made. Other records may temporarily be located at a 
regional or district office of the Commission. Any person who has 
requested for personal examination a record stored at the Federal 
Records Center or temporarily located in a regional or district office 
of the Commission will be notified when and where the record will be 
made available to him. Any person who has ordered a copy of such record 
will be provided with a copy as soon as practicable). Some records have 
been disposed of in accordance with the Commission's Records Control 
Schedule (17 CFR 200.80(f)).
    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request. (While every reasonable effort will be made fully to 
comply with each request as promptly as possible on a first-come, first-
served basis, work done to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
records in response to a request for a large number of records will be 
contingent upon the availability of processing personnel in accordance 
with an equitable allocation of time to all members of the public who 
have requested or wish to request records.)
    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components within 
the Commission having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
    (8) Inability to comply with time requirements. If the Commission 
should be unable to comply with the applicable time limits contained in 
this paragraph (d) of this section in responding to a request for 
records, it shall send written notice of the reason for delay to the 
person who made the request and shall be prepared to demonstrate the 
existence of exceptional circumstances and that the Commission is 
exercising due

[[Page 60]]

diligence in responding to the request for records.
    (i) Records in use for another member of the public. Any record 
being inspected by or copied for another member of the public will be 
made available as soon as practicable.
    (ii) Records in use by a member of the Commission or its staff. 
Although every effort will be made to make a record in use by a member 
of the Commission or its staff available when requested, it may 
occasionally be necessary to delay making such a record available when 
doing so at the time the request is made would seriously interfere with 
the work of the Commission or its staff.
    (iii) Missing or lost records. Any person who has requested a record 
or copy will be notified if the record sought cannot be found. If he so 
requests, he will be notified if it should subsequently be located.
    (9) Oral requests; misdirected written requests--(i) Telephone and 
other oral requests. While the Commission's staff will attempt in good 
faith to comply with requests for copies of records made orally, by 
telephone, or otherwise, the Commission cannot assure a timely or 
satisfactory response to such requests due to the risk of 
misunderstanding inherent in the use of oral communication. The 
Commission will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or 
failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has orally 
requested a copy of a record that he believes to have been improperly 
denied to him should resubmit his request in appropriate written form in 
order to obtain proper consideration and, if need be, administrative 
review.
    (ii) Misdirected written requests. The Commission cannot assure that 
a timely or satisfactory response will be given to written requests for 
inspection or copies of records that are directed to the Commission 
other than in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of 
this section. Any staff member who receives a written request for 
records should promptly forward the request to the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer. Misdirected requests for records will be 
considered to have been received for purposes of paragraph (d) of this 
section only when they have been actually received by the Freedom of 
Information Act Officer. The Commission will not entertain any appeal 
from an alleged denial or failure to comply with a misdirected request, 
unless it is clearly shown that the request was in fact received by the 
Freedom of Information Act Officer.
    (e) Fees for records services. A current schedule of fees for record 
services, including locating and making records available, attestations 
and copying, appears in appendix E to this subpart D, 17 CFR 200.80e. 
Copies of the current schedule of fees may also be obtained upon request 
made in person, by telephone or by mail from the public reference room 
or at any regional or district office of the Commission.
    (1) Services provided without charge. Generally, up to one-half hour 
of staff time devoted to searching for Commission records will be 
provided without charge. Where a request for records pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act is determined not to serve a commercial 
purpose as defined in paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section, a total of 
two staff hours of search and review and one hundred pages of 
duplication as defined in paragraphs (e)(9)(i), (e)(9)(ii) and 
(e)(9)(iii) of this section, respectively, shall be made available 
without charge in the form most economical for the government.
    (2) Services for which fees are charged. For records available 
through the Commission's public reference facilities, requestors may 
make arrangements for duplication in accordance with provisions of the 
Commission's dissemination contract. Copies of that contract, which 
contain tables of charges, may be inspected in the public reference 
room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Room 1024, Washington, DC. A complete 
schedule of services offered by the contractor and fees charged for 
those services is available through the Commission's public reference 
facilities. Fees for services provided in connection with requests made 
pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall be assessed as set out 
in appendix E to this section and in keeping with guidelines and 
procedures described in paragraphs (e)(9) and (e)(10) of this section.
    (3) Requests requiring large expenditures. A request for Commission 
records

[[Page 61]]

may state that the requesting person is willing to pay fees up to a 
stated limit for services to be provided in locating and making 
available requested records. In such circumstances, no work will be done 
that will result in fees beyond the stated limit without further written 
authorization. If no limit is initially stated by the person requesting 
records or copies, services in locating and making available the 
requested records will not be done so as to exceed fees of $25 
(exclusive of applicable copying charges) without the express written 
authorization by the requesting person, and he will be so advised.
    (4) Waiver or reduction of fees. Requested records shall be 
furnished without charge or at reduced charge whenever it shall be 
determined by the Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs and 
Information Services that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the 
public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as 
primarily benefiting the general public; provided the information will 
significantly assist citizens in understanding the working of their 
government; and the purpose of the request is not primarily commercial 
as defined in paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section. Requests for waiver 
or reduction of fees for searching and/or copying may be submitted with 
the original request for records and should state such facts as the 
requester considers appropriate. Denials of requests for a waiver or 
reduction of fees may be appealed to the General Counsel in accordance 
with the procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
    (5) Records obtained from Federal Records Centers. When, to fill a 
request for inspection or copying, records are required to be obtained 
from a Federal Records Center, fees, in addition to those provided on 
the Commission's current schedule of fees, will be charged to the extent 
authorized or required by rules or regulations promulgated by the 
National Archives and Records Administration.
    (6) Attestations. In addition to any other fees or charges which may 
apply, a fee will be charged for records attestations as provided in the 
Commission's current schedule of fees. The seal of the Commission will 
be affixed to all attestations without additional charge.
    (7) Copying services. Copies of records filed with or retained by 
the Commission, or portions thereof, will be provided subject to fees 
established by agreement between the Commission and a private contractor 
as set forth in the Commission's current schedule of fees and, where 
applicable, procedures and guidelines for Freedom of Information Act 
requests as set out in paragraphs (e)(9) and (e)(10) of this section.
    (i) Facsimile copies. Requests for facsimile copies may be made 
either in person at the Commission's Washington, DC, New York, or 
Chicago public reference rooms, or by mail addressed to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Public Reference Room Branch, 450 Fifth Street, 
NW., room 1024, Washington, DC 20549. The contractor will send copies 
directly to the purchaser unless attestation is requested. Persons who 
request copies of documents through the public reference room will be 
billed by the contractor at regulated prices, and will be billed 
separately by the Commission for search, review and attestation charges, 
if any. Copies of documents requested directly from the contractor or 
from any other information service or vendor are not subject to 
regulated prices. Special classes of copying services, such as 
telecopies, not listed herein or in the current schedule of fees posted 
in the public reference room, are not provided or regulated by the 
Commission, but may be obtained from private vendors at market prices.
    (ii) Microfiche copies. A contractor also makes available to the 
public microfiche copies of certain public documents on file with the 
Commission, at prices and on terms governed by its contract with the 
Commission. Microfiche services include subscription microfiche service 
on an annual basis. Microfiche subscription prices are regulated by the 
Commission whether requested through the public reference room or 
directly from the contractor. Certain other microfiche services are 
provided at prices that are regulated by the Commission only if ordered 
through the Commission's public reference room. The Commission will 
accept only subscription requests made

[[Page 62]]

in writing, although the contractor may elect to accept subscription 
requests by telephone. All microfiche subscription charges are payable 
directly to the contractor, whether placed through the Commission or 
not. Information concerning the types and cost of regulated microfiche 
services may be obtained by writing to the Commission at its public 
reference room located at 450 Fifth Street, NW., room 1024, Washington, 
DC 20549 or calling this facility at 202-272-3100.
    (iii) Transcripts of public hearings. Copies of the transcripts of 
recent public hearings may be obtained from the reporter subject to the 
fees established annually by contract between the Commission and the 
reporter. Copies of that contract, which contains tables of charges, may 
be inspected in the public reference room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Room 
1024, Washington, D.C. and in each regional and district office. Copies 
of other public transcripts may be obtained, in the manner of other 
Commission records, subject to the charges referred to in paragraph 
(e)(7)(i) of this section.
    (8) Releases and publications. (i) The Commission's decisions, 
reports, orders, rules and regulations are published initially in the 
form of releases and distributed.
    (ii) The Commission publishes daily the SEC News Digest, which 
summarizes the releases published by the Commission each day, contains 
Commission announcements, and lists certain filings with the Commission. 
The Commission publishes weekly the SEC Docket, which prints the full 
text of every Commission release.
    (iii) The Commission publishes an annual report to the Congress 
which sets forth the results of the Commission's operations during the 
past fiscal year under the various statutes committed to its charge. 
Copies may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (iv) The Commission also makes other information in the fields of 
securities and finance, including economic studies, available to the 
public through the issuance of releases on specific subject matters.
    (v) A classification of the releases available from the Commission 
appears below as appendix B to this section. Other publications 
available from the Commission are set forth in appendix C to this 
section. Copies of rules, regulations, and miscellaneous publications 
set forth in appendix D to this section may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20402.
    (9) Fees for services required for processing Freedom of Information 
Act Requests. In cases where records are requested pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act and according to procedures set forth in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, fees shall be charged as set out in 
the Commission's current schedule of fees, appendix E to this section, 
for services as described in the following:
    (i) Search. The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for 
material manually or by using electronic data processing equipment that 
is responsive to a request, as distinguished from ``review'' as defined 
at paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section. Searching for requested and 
specifically identified information, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, includes the cost of staff time devoted to the search as 
indicated in appendix E to this section and direct costs for use of 
Commission electronic data processing equipment.
    (ii) Review. The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining 
documents located in response to a request to determine whether any 
portion of any document is permitted to be withheld pursuant to 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. It also includes 
processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is 
necessary to excise material from and otherwise prepare them for 
release.
    (iii) Duplication. The term ``duplication'' refers to producing 
paper or microform copies of records. The Commission shall charge for 
duplication as established by agreement between the Commission and a 
private contractor. These charges are currently set out in appendix E to 
this section. Such charges shall be set so as not to exceed the direct 
cost that would be incurred

[[Page 63]]

by the Commission if it were to perform such services itself, as 
calculated to include the salary of operators, the cost of reproduction 
machinery, the cost of material and any other direct costs incurred by 
the Commission in copying materials responsive to a Freedom of 
Information Act request.
    (iv) Partial exemption from fee provisions. No fees shall be charged 
for the first two hours of search time and the first one hundred pages 
of materials for requesters described in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) and 
(e)(10)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Minimum fee. Fees will not be charged if the normal cost of 
collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.
    (10) Classification of Freedom of Information Act requesters for 
purposes of assessing fees. Parties requesting records pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act will be classified and charged fees described 
in appendix E to this section as follows:
    (i) The following types of requesters shall be charged for 
duplication of records as described in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this 
section as qualified in paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section: 
Educational institutions requesting information for purposes of 
scholarly research; non-commercial scientific institutions requesting 
information for purposes of scientific research; and representatives of 
the news media requesting information concerning current events or 
matters of current interest to the general public.
    (ii) Commercial requesters, defined as parties other than those 
mentioned in paragraph (e)(10)(i) of this section who are requesting 
information to be used in any way which could reasonably be expected to 
result in corporate or personal financial gain or profit, shall be 
charged for search, review and duplication of records as described in 
paragraphs (e)(9)(i), (e)(9)(ii) and (e)(9)(iii), respectively, of this 
section.
    (iii) All parties other than those described in paragraphs 
(e)(10)(i) and (e)(10)(ii) of this section requesting access to such 
records shall be charged for search and duplication of records as 
described in paragraphs (e)(9)(i) and (e)(9)(iii) of this section, 
respectively, as qualified in paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section.
    (11) Appeal of classification. Classification under the provisions 
of paragraph (e)(10) of this section may be appealed to the General 
Counsel in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section.
    (12) Aggregation of requests. If the Freedom of Information Act 
Officer reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters 
acting in concert is attempting to divide one request into a series of 
requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, those 
requests may be aggregated and charges assessed accordingly.
    (13) Advance payment. The Freedom of Information Act Officer may 
require advance payment of fees expected to be incurred in connection 
with a request, but only when the subject requester has failed to make 
timely payment in the past, or when the estimated processing costs 
exceed $250.00 and the requester has no previous payment records or has 
failed to make timely payment in the past. Processing in such cases 
shall be delayed until advance payment is received and statutory time 
limits will be appropriately extended.
    (14) Interest on unpaid bills. On the 31st day following the date of 
a bill to a requester, the Commission may begin assessing interest on 
the unpaid amount at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of 
the U.S. Code. Interest will accrue from the date of the bill.

[60 FR 50091, Sept. 28, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 200.81  Publication of interpretative, no-action and certain exemption letters and other written communications.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
every letter or other written communication requesting the staff of the 
Commission to provide interpretative legal advice with respect to any 
statute administered by the Commission or any rule or regulation adopted 
thereunder; or requesting a statement that, on the basis of the facts 
stated in such letter or other communication, the staff would not 
recommend that the Commission

[[Page 74]]

take any enforcement action; or requesting an exemption, on the basis of 
the facts stated in such letter, from the provisions of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) or any rule or regulation 
thereunder, where the issuance of an order granting such exemption does 
not require public notice and an opportunity for hearing; together with 
any written response thereto, shall be made available for inspection and 
copying by any person as soon as practicable after the response has been 
sent or given to the person requesting it.
    (b) Any person submitting such letter or other written communication 
may also submit therewith a request that it be accorded confidential 
treatment for a specified period of time, not exceeding 120 days from 
the date the response, together with a statement setting forth the 
considerations upon which the request for such treatment is based. If 
the staff determines that the request is reasonable and appropriate it 
will be granted and the letter or other communication will not be made 
available for public inspection or copying until the expiration of the 
specified period. If it appears to the staff that the request for 
confidential treatment should be denied, the staff shall so advise the 
person making the request and such person may withdraw the letter or 
other communication within 30 days thereafter. In such case, no response 
will be sent or given and the letter or other communication shall remain 
in the Commission's files but will not be made public. If such letter or 
other communication is not so withdrawn, it shall be deemed to be 
available for public inspection and copying together with any written 
response thereto.

    Note: All letters or other written communications requesting 
interpretative advice, a no-action position, or an exemption shall 
indicate prominently, in a separate caption at the beginning of the 
request, each section of the Act and each rule to which the request 
relates. If more than one section or rule is involved, a separate copy 
of the request shall be submitted for each section or rule involved and 
an additional copy for the use of the staff of the Commission.

    (c) This section shall not apply, however, to letters of comment or 
other communications relating to the accuracy or adequacy of any 
registration statement, report, proxy, or information statement or other 
document filed with the Commission, or relating to the extent to which 
such statement, report, or document complies with any applicable 
requirement. Further, this section shall not apply to applications or 
other written communications filed pursuant to Sec. 240.24b-2 that 
relate to objections to public disclosure of information filed with the 
Commission or any exchange.

[35 FR 17779, Nov. 19, 1970, as amended at 53 FR 12413, Apr. 14, 1988;

<R05>
Sec. 200.82  Public availability of materials filed pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-8(d) and related materials.

    Materials filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 14a-8(d) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-8(d)), written 
communications related thereto received from any person, and each 
related no-action letter or other written communication issued by the 
staff of the Commission, shall be made available to any person upon 
request for inspection or copying.

[37 FR 20558, Sept. 30, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 200.83  Confidential treatment procedures under the Freedom of Information Act.

    (a) Purpose. This section provides a procedure by which persons 
submitting information in any form to the Commission can request that 
the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom 
of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the 
Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in 
any other context. This section is procedural only and does not provide 
rights to any person or alter the rights of any person under the Freedom 
of Information Act or any other applicable statute or regulation.
    (b) Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply only where no 
other statute or Commission rule provides procedures for requesting 
confidential treatment respecting particular categories of information 
(see, e.g., 17 CFR 240.24b-2) or where the Commission has not specified 
that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a

[[Page 75]]

particular study, report, investigation, or other matter. The provisions 
of this section shall not apply to any record which is contained in or 
is part of a personnel, medical or similar file relating to a Commission 
member or employee which would normally be exempt from disclosure 
pursuant to section 552(b)(6) of title 5, U.S. Code.
    (c) Written request for confidential treatment to be submitted with 
information. (1) Any person who, either voluntarily or pursuant to any 
requirement of law, submits any information or causes or permits any 
information to be submitted to the Commission, which information is 
entitled to confidential treatment and for which no other specific 
procedure exists for according confidential treatment, may request that 
the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of 
Information Act to such information for reasons of personal privacy or 
business confidentiality, or for any other reason permitted by Federal 
law, and should take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure, as nearly 
as practicable, that at the time the information is first received by 
the Commission (i) it is supplied segregated from information for which 
confidential treatment is not being requested, (ii) it is appropriately 
marked as confidential, and (iii) it is accompanied by a written request 
for confidential treatment which specifies the information as to which 
confidential treatment is requested.
    (2) Except in the circumstances covered by paragraph (c)(4), all 
records which contain information for which a request for confidential 
treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions thereof should 
be marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, 
typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or 
segregable portion of each page, stating ``Confidential Treatment 
Requested by [name].'' If such marking is impractical under the 
circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked ``Confidential Treatment 
Requested by [name]'' should be securely attached to each group of 
records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested. Each of 
the records transmitted in this manner should be individually marked 
with an identifying number and code so that they are separately 
identifiable.
    (3) In addition to providing a copy of any written request for 
confidential treatment required by this section to the Commission 
personnel receiving the information in question, the person requesting 
confidential treatment shall also deliver or send by mail a copy of the 
request (but not the records to which the request applies) to the 
Freedom of Information Act Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Washington, DC 20549. The written request shall be clearly and 
prominently identified on the envelope or other cover and on the top of 
the first page by the legend ``FOIA Confidential Treatment Request'' and 
shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the requestor. 
The requestor is responsible for informing the Commission promptly of 
any changes in address or telephone number. In case records submitted 
are not individually marked ``Confidential Treatment Requested by 
[name],'' the written request for confidential treatment should refer to 
the identifying numbers and codes placed on the records.
    (4) In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in 
the course of a Commission investigation or providing documents 
requested in the course of a Commission inspection, it may be 
impracticable to submit a written request for confidential treatment at 
the time the information is first provided to the Commission. In no 
circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this 
section justify or excuse any delay in submitting information to the 
Commission. Rather, in such circumstances, the person testifying or 
otherwise submitting information should inform the Commission employee 
receiving the information, at the time the information is submitted or 
as soon thereafter as possible, that the person is requesting 
confidential treatment for the information. The person shall then submit 
a written request for confidential treatment within 30 days of the 
submission of the information. Any request for confidential treatment 
submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be clearly and prominently 
identified as provided

[[Page 76]]

in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and shall be delivered or sent by 
mail both to the Commission personnel who received or is known to have 
custody of the information and to the Freedom of Information Act 
Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.
    (5) Where confidential treatment is requested by the submitter on 
behalf of other persons, the request should identify those persons and 
provide the telephone number and address of such person or the 
responsible representative thereof if the submitter would be unable to 
provide prompt substantiation of the request at the appropriate time.
    (6) No determination as to the validity of any request for 
confidential treatment will be made until a request for disclosure of 
the information under the Freedom of Information Act is received.
    (d) Substantiation of request for confidential treatment. (1) If it 
is determined that records which are the subject of a request for access 
under the Freedom of Information Act are also the subject of a request 
for confidential treatment under this rule and no other grounds appear 
to exist which would justify the withholding of the records [e.g., 
Freedom of Information Act Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A)], the 
Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer promptly shall so inform 
the person requesting confidential treatment or, in the case of a 
request made on behalf of a person other than the submitter, the person 
identified as able to provide substantiation, by telephone, telegram or 
express mail and require that substantiation of the request for 
confidential treatment be submitted in ten calendar days.
    (2) Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall 
consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or 
necessary for the determination of the request for confidential 
treatment, the following information regarding the request:
    (i) The reasons, concisely stated and referring to specific 
exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the 
information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of 
Information Act;
    (ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory 
provisions which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;
    (iii) The existence and applicability of any prior determinations by 
the Commission, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning 
confidential treatment of the information;
    (iv) The adverse consequences to a business enterprise, financial or 
otherwise, that would result from disclosure of confidential commercial 
or financial information, including any adverse effect on the business' 
competitive position;
    (v) The measures taken by the business to protect the 
confidentiality of the commercial or financial information in question 
and of similar information, prior to, and after, its submission to the 
Commission;
    (vi) The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling 
the commercial or financial information;
    (vii) Whether the commercial or financial information was 
voluntarily submitted to the Commission and, if so, whether and how 
disclosure of the information would tend to impede the availability of 
similar information to the Commission;
    (viii) The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation 
of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded 
confidential treatment; and
    (ix) Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as 
the requesting person may consider appropriate.
    (e) Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is 
not warranted. (1) If it is determined by the Commission's Freedom of 
Information Act Officer that confidential treatment is not warranted 
with respect to all or part of the information in question, the person 
requesting access to the information under the Freedom of Information 
Act and the person requesting confidential treatment will be so notified 
by telephone, telegram or express mail. The person requesting 
confidential treatment will also be informed that any appeal of such 
decision must be taken to the Commission's General Counsel within ten 
calendar days of the date of the notice. Information which

is determined not to be entitled to confidential treatment may be 
released under the Freedom of Information Act ten calendar days after 
notice to the person requesting confidential treatment. If within that 
ten calendar day period the General Counsel has actually received an 
appeal from the person requesting confidential treatment, the person 
requesting access to the information under the Freedom of Information 
Act will be informed of the pending appeal and that no disclosure of the 
information will be made until the appeal is resolved.
    (2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment 
shall be in writing, and shall be clearly and prominently identified on 
the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page by the 
legend ``FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.'' The appeal should be 
delivered or sent by mail to the General Counsel, with a copy to the 
Freedom of Information Act Officer. The person requesting confidential 
treatment may supply additional substantiation of the request for 
confidential treatment in connection with the appeal to the General 
Counsel.
    (3) The General Counsel shall have the authority to consider all 
appeals from decisions of the Freedom of Information Act Officer with 
respect to confidential treatment. All appeals taken under this section 
will be considered by the General Counsel as expeditiously as 
circumstances permit. Although other procedures may be employed, to the 
extent possible, the General Counsel will decide the matter on the basis 
of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the 
interested persons and such other information as is brought to the 
attention of the General Counsel in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 201.28 of this chapter. The General Counsel shall also have the 
authority to enter and vacate stays under the circumstances set forth in 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section. In appropriate cases the General 
Counsel may, in his or her sole and unfettered discretion, refer appeals 
and questions concerning stays under paragraph (e)(5) of this section to 
the Commission for decision.
    (4) If it is determined that confidential treatment is not warranted 
with respect to all or any part of the information in question, the 
person requesting confidential treatment will be so informed by 
telephone, if possible, with a telegram or express mail letter directed 
to the person's last known address. Disclosure of the information under 
the Freedom of Information Act will occur ten calendar days after notice 
to the person requesting confidential treatment, subject to any stay 
entered pursuant to paragraph (e) (5) of this section.
    (5) If within that ten calendar day period the General Counsel has 
been notified that the person requesting confidential treatment has 
commenced an action in a Federal court concerning the determination to 
make such information publicly available, the General Counsel will stay 
making the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial 
resolution of the matter. The General Counsel may vacate a stay under 
this section either on his or her own motion or at the request of a 
person seeking access to the information under the Freedom of 
Information Act. If the stay is vacated, the information will be 
released under the Freedom of Information Act ten calendar days after 
the person requesting confidential treatment is notified of this action 
by telephone, if possible, with a telegram or express mail letter sent 
to the person's last known address, unless the court orders otherwise.
    (f) Initial determination that confidential treatment is warranted. 
If it is determined by the Commission's Freedom of Information Act 
Officer that confidential treatment is warranted, the person submitting 
the information and the person requesting access to the information 
under the Freedom of Information Act will be so informed by mail. The 
person requesting access, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 
will also be informed of the right to appeal the determination to the 
General Counsel. Any such appeal must be taken in accordance with the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and Commission rules 
thereunder. See 17 CFR 200.80(d)(6).
    (g) Effect of no prior request for confidentiality. (1) If access is 
requested under the Freedom of Information Act to information which is 
submitted to

[[Page 78]]

the Commission on or after October 20, 1980 with respect to which no 
request for confidential treatment has been made pursuant to either 
paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(4) of this section, it will be presumed that the 
submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting an 
exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act for 
reasons of personal privacy or business confidentiality, or for other 
reasons.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, in appropriate 
circumstances, any person who would be affected by the public disclosure 
of information under the Freedom of Information Act may be contacted by 
Commission personnel to determine whether the person desires to make a 
request for confidential treatment. Any request for confidential 
treatment that is asserted in response to such inquiry shall be made in 
accordance with provisions of this section.
    (h) Extensions of time limits. Any time limit under this section may 
be extended, in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's 
General Counsel, or the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer, 
for good cause shown.
    (i) Electronic filings. Confidential treatment requests shall be 
submitted in paper format only, whether or not the person making the 
request is an electronic filer.

    (iii) In no case shall the prohibitions in Sec. 200.111(a) begin to 
apply later than the time at which a proceeding is noticed for hearing 
unless the person responsible for the communication has knowledge that 
it will be noticed, in which case the prohibitions shall apply beginning 
at the time of his or her acquisition of such knowledge.
    (2) The prohibitions in Sec. 200.111(a) shall continue until the 
time to file a petition for rehearing from the final order of the 
Commission has expired. In the event a petition for rehearing is filed, 
these prohibitions shall cease if and when the petition for rehearing is 
denied.
    (3) The Commission may, by specific order entered in a particular 
proceeding, determine that these prohibitions shall commence from some 
date earlier than the time specified in this paragraph (c) or shall 
continue until a date subsequent to the time specified herein.
    (d) Definitions. As used in this subpart:
    (1) Ex parte communication means an oral or written communication 
not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice 
to all participants to the proceeding is not given, but it shall not 
include requests for status reports on any matter or proceeding. In 
addition, an ex parte communication shall not include:

Practice, Sec. 201.150 of this chapter, upon all participants to the

<R05>
Sec. 200.112  Duties of recipient; notice to participants.

    (a) Duties of recipient. A member of the Commission or decisional 
employee who receives, or who make or knowingly causes to be made, a 
communication prohibited by this section, or who receives or makes a 
communication which he or she concludes should, in fairness, be brought 
to the attention of all participants to the proceeding, shall transmit 
to the Commission's Secretary, who shall place on the public record of 
the proceeding:
    (1) All such written communications; and
    (2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; 
and
    (3) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (a) (1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (b) Notice to participants. The Secretary shall send copies of the 
communication to all participants to the proceeding with respect to 
which it was made, and shall notify the communicator of the provisions 
of this code prohibiting ex parte communications. If the communications 
are from persons other than participants to the proceedings or their 
agents, and the Secretary determines that it would be too

[[Page 80]]

burdensome to send copies of the communications to all participants 
because: (1) The communications are so voluminous, or (2) the 
communications are of such borderline relevance to the issues of the 
proceedings, or (3) the participants to the proceeding are so numerous, 
the Secretary may, instead, notify the participants that the 
communications have been received, placed in the file, and are available 
for examination.
    (c) Post decisional communications. Any Commission member or 
decisional employee who receives a communication which would be 
prohibited by this Code, but for the fact that it was received 
subsequent to the date when the prohibitions imposed hereby have ceased 
to apply, shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 200.112(a) with 
respect to such communication in the event that he or she is to act in a 
decisional capacity in the same proceeding pursuant to remand where he 
or she concludes, in fairness, that such communication should be brought 
to the attention of all participants to the proceeding.

[42 FR 14691 Mar. 16, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 200.113  Opportunity to respond; interception.

    (a) Opportunity to respond. All participants to a proceeding may 
respond to any allegations or contentions contained in a prohibited ex 
parte communication placed in the public record in accordance with 
Sec. 200.112. Such responses shall be included in the public record.
    (b) Interception of communications. All written communications 
addressed to the Commission respecting a proceeding will be deemed to be 
communications to the staff of the interested division and will be 
directed to that division by the Commission's mail room. A Commission 
member or decisional employee may instruct any of his assistants who are 
nondecisional employees to intercept any communication directed to him 
which might appear to violate this Code and authorize them either to 
transmit any such written communication to the staff of the interested 
division of the Commission, if it appears from the contents of the 
communication that the intent of the sender is consistent with such 
action, or to return the communication to the sender.

Sec. 200.114  Sanctions.

    (a) Discipline of persons practicing before the Commission. The 
Commission may, to the extent not prohibited by law, censure, suspend, 
or revoke the privilege to practice before it of any person who makes, 
or solicits the making of, an unauthorized ex parte communication.
    (b) Adverse action on claim. Upon receipt of a communication 
knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party in violation of 
this subpart, the Commission, administrative law judge, or other 
employee presiding at the hearing may, to the extent consistent with the 
interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes, require 
the party to show cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding 
should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely 
affected on account of such violation.
    (c) Discipline of Commission employees. The Commission may censure, 
suspend, or dismiss any Commission employee who violates the 
prohibitions or requirements of this Code.

<R05>
Sec. 200.301  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896, is 
based, in part, on the finding by Congress that ``in order to protect 
the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained 
by Federal agencies, it is necessary and proper for the Congress to 
regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of 
information by such agencies.'' To achieve this objective the Act, among 
other things, provides, with some exceptions, that Federal agencies 
shall advise an individual upon request whether records maintained by 
the agency in a

[[Page 83]]

system of records pertain to the individual and shall grant the 
individual access to such records. The Act further provides that 
individuals may request amendments or corrections to records pertaining 
to them that are maintained by the agency, and that the agency shall 
either grant the requested amendments or set forth fully its reasons for 
refusing to do so.
    (b) The Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to subsection 
(f) of the Privacy Act, adopts the following rules and procedures to 
implement the provisions of the Act summarized above, and other 
provisions of the Act. These rules and procedures are applicable to all 
requests for information, access or amendment to records pertaining to 
an individual that are contained in any system of records that is 
maintained by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.302  Definitions.

    The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this subpart:
    (a) The terms individual, maintain, record, system of records, and 
routine use are defined for purposes of these rules as they are defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6).
    (b) Commission means the Securities and Exchange Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.303  Times, places and requirements for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system and for the identification of individuals making 
          requests for access to the records pertaining to them.

    (a) Place to make request. Any request by an individual to be 
advised whether any system of records maintained by the Commission and 
named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him or her, or 
any request by an individual for access to a record pertaining to him or 
her that is contained in a system of records maintained by the 
Commission, shall be submitted by the individual in person during normal 
business hours at the Commission's Public Reference Room which is 
located at 450 Fifth Street, NW., Room 1024, Washington, DC, or by mail 
addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Washington, DC 20549. All requests will be required to be 
put in writing and signed by the individual making the request. In the 
case of requests for access that are made by mail, the envelope should 
be clearly marked ``Privacy Act Request.''
    (1) Information to be included in requests. Each request by an 
individual concerning whether the Commission maintains in a system of 
records a record that pertains to him, or for access to any record 
pertaining to the individual that is maintained by the Commission in a 
system of records, shall include such information as will assist the 
Commission in identifying those records as to which the individual is 
seeking information or access. Where practicable, the individual should 
identify the system of records that is the subject of his request by 
reference to the Commission's notices of systems of records, which are 
published in the Federal Register, as required by section (e)(4) of the 
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). Where a system of records is compiled 
on the basis of a specific identification scheme, the individual should 
include in his request the identification number or other identifier 
assigned to him. In the event the individual does not know the specific 
identifier assigned to him, he shall provide other information, 
including his full name, address, date of birth and subject matter of 
the record, to aid in processing his request. If additional information 
is required before a request can be processed, the individual shall be 
so advised.
    (2) Verification of identity. When the fact of the existence of a 
record is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or when a record as to which access has 
been requested is not required to be disclosed under that Act, the 
individual seeking the information or requesting access to the record

    (3) Methods for verifying identity--appearance in person. For the 
purpose of verifying his identity, an individual seeking information as 
to records pertaining to him or access to those records shall furnish 
documentation that may reasonably be relied on to establish the 
individual's identity. Such documentation might include a valid birth 
certificate, driver's license, employee or military identification card, 
or medicare card.
    (4) Method for verifying identity by mail. Where an individual 
cannot appear at one of the Commission's Offices for the purpose of 
verifying his identity, he shall submit, along with the request for 
information or access, a signed and notarized statement attesting to his 
identity. Where access is being sought, the sworn statement shall 
include a representation that the records being sought pertain to the 
individual and a stipulation that the individual is aware that knowingly 
and willfully requesting or obtaining records pertaining to an 
individual from the Commission under false pretenses is a criminal 
offense.
    (5) Additional procedures for verifying identity. When it appears 
appropriate, there may be made such other arrangements for the 
verification of identity as are reasonable under the circumstances and 
appear to be effective to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access 
to, individual records.
    (b) Acknowledgement of requests for information pertaining to 
individual records in a record system or for access to individual 
records. (1) Except where an immediate acknowledgement is given for 
requests made in person, the receipt of a request for information 
pertaining to individual records in a record system will be acknowledged 
within 10 days after the receipt of such request. Requests will be 
processed as promptly as possible and a response to such requests will 
be given within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) unless, within the 30 day period and for cause shown, the 
individual making the request is notified in writing that a longer 
period is necessary.
    (2) When an individual appears in person at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room in Washington, DC, or at one of its Regional or District 
Offices to request access to records pertaining to him, and such 
individual provides the required information and verification of 
identity, the Commission's staff, if practicable, will indicate at that 
time whether it is likely that the individual will be given access to 
the records and, if so, when and under what circumstances such access 
will be given. In the case of requests received by mail, whenever 
practicable, acknowledgement of the receipt of the request will be given 
within 10 days after receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays). The acknowledgement will indicate, if practicable, whether or 
not access likely will be

[[Page 85]]

granted and, if so, when and under what circumstances.

Sec. 200.304  Disclosure of requested records.

    (a) Initial review. Requests by individuals for access to records 
pertaining to them will be referred to the Commission's Privacy Act 
Officer who initially will determine whether access will be granted, 
Provided, however, That a Director of a staff Division of the Commission 
or Office head, other than the General Counsel, whose zone of 
responsibility relates to the record requested (see 17 CFR 200.13 et 
seq.), may make a determination that access is not lawfully required to 
be granted and should not be granted, in which case he, and not the 
Privacy Act Officer, shall make the required notification to the 
individual making the request.
    (b) Grant of request for access. (1) If it is determined that a 
request for access to records pertaining to an individual will be 
granted, the individual will be advised by mail that access will be 
given at the designated Office of the Commission or a copy of the 
requested record will be provided by mail if the individual shall so 
indicate. Where the individual requests that copies of the record be 
mailed to him or requests copies of a record upon reviewing it at a 
Commission Office, the individual shall pay the cost of making the 
requested copies, as set forth in Sec. 200.310 of this subpart.
    (2) In granting access to an individual to a record pertaining to 
him, such steps shall be taken by the Commission's staff as are 
necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure at the same time of 
information pertaining to individuals other than the person making the 
request or of other information that does not pertain to the individual.
    (c) Denial of request for access. If it is determined that access 
will not be granted, the individual making the request will be notified 
of that fact and given the reasons why access is being denied. The 
individual also will be advised (1) of his right to seek review by the 
General Counsel of the intital decision to deny access, in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in Sec. 200.308 of this subpart; and (2) 
of his right ultimately to obtain judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1)(A) of a final denial of access by the General Counsel.
    (d) Time for acting on requests for access. Access to a record 
pertaining to an individual normally will be granted or denied within 30 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the receipt 
of the request for access unless the individual making the request is 
notified in writing within the 30 day period that, for good cause shown, 
a longer time is required. In such cases, the individual making the 
request shall be informed in writing of the difficulties encountered and 
an indication shall be given as to when it is anticipated that access 
may be granted or denied.
    (e) Authorization to allow designated person to review and discuss 
records pertaining to another individual. An individual who is granted 
access to records pertaining to him, and who appears at a Commission 
Office to review the records, may be accompanied by another person of 
his choosing. Where the records as to which access has been granted are 
not required to be disclosed under provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, the individual requesting the 
records, before being granted access, shall execute a written statement, 
signed by him and the person accompanying him, which specifically 
authorizes the latter individual to review and discuss the records. If 
such authorization has not been given as described, the person who has 
accompanied the individual making the request will be excluded from any 
review or discussion of the records.
    (f) Exclusion for certain records. Nothing contained in these rules 
shall allow

[[Page 86]]

an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable 
anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 200.305  Special procedure: Medical records.

    (a) Statement of physician or mental health professional. When an 
individual requests access to records pertaining to him that include 
medical and/or psychological information, the Commission, if it deems it 
necessary under the particular circumstances, may require the individual 
to submit with the request a signed statement by his physician or a 
mental health professional indicating that, in their opinion, disclosure 
of the requested records or information directly to the individual will 
not have an adverse effect on the individual.
    (b) Designation of physician or mental health professional to 
receive records. If the Commission believes, in good faith, that 
disclosure of medical and/or psychological information directly to an 
individual could have an adverse effect on that individual, the 
individual may be asked to designate in writing a physician or mental 
health professional to whom he would like the records to be disclosed, 
and disclosure that otherwise would be made to the individual will 
instead be made to the designated physician or mental health 
professional.


<R05>
Sec. 200.306  Requests for amendment or correction of records.

    (a) Place to make requests. A request by an individual to amend or 
correct records pertaining to him or her may be made in person during 
normal business hours at the Commission's Public Reference Room located 
at 450 Fifth Street, NW., Room 1024, Washington, DC, or by mail 
addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Washington, DC 20549.
    (1) Information to be included in requests. Each request to amend or 
correct a Commission record shall reasonably describe the record sought 
to be amended or corrected. Such description should include, for 
example, relevant names, dates and subject matter to permit the record 
to be located among the records maintained by the Commission. An 
individual who has requested that a record pertaining to him be amended 
or corrected will be advised promptly if the record cannot be located on 
the basis of the description given and that further identifying 
information is necessary before his request can be processed. An initial 
evaluation of a request presented in person will be made immediately to 
ensure that the request is complete and to indicate what, if any, 
additional information will be required. Verification of the 
individual's identity as set forth in Sec. 200.303(a) (2), (3), (4) and 
(5) may also be required.
    (2) Basis for amendment or correction. An individual requesting an 
amendment or correction to a record pertaining to him shall specify the 
substance of the amendment or correction and set forth facts and provide 
such materials that would support his contention that the record 
pertaining to him as maintained by the Commission is not accurate, 
timely or complete, or that the record is not necessary and relevant to 
accomplish a statutory purpose of the Commission as authorized by law or 
by Executive Order of the President.
    (b) Acknowledgement of requests for amendment or correction. Receipt 
of a request to amend or correct a record pertaining to an individual 
normally will be acknowledged in writing within 10 days after such 
request has been received. When a request to amend or correct is made in 
person, the individual making the request will be given a written 
acknowledgement when the request is presented. The acknowledgement will 
describe the request received and indicate when it is anticipated that 
action will be taken on the request. No acknowledgement will be sent 
when the request for amendment

[[Page 87]]

or correction will be reviewed, and an initial decision made, within 10 
days from the date the request is received.

[40 FR 44068, Sept. 24, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 26819, June 22, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 200.307  Review of requests for amendment or correction.

    (a) Initial review. As in the case of requests for access, requests 
by individuals for amendment or correction to records pertaining to them 
will be referred to the Commission's Privacy Act Officer for an initial 
determination, except that such requests may be considered by a Division 
Director or Office Head (other than the General Counsel) as set forth in 
Sec. 200.304(a) of this subpart.
    (b) Standards to be applied in reviewing requests. In reviewing 
requests to amend or correct records, the Privacy Act Officer, or 
Division or Office head, will be guided by the criteria set forth in 5 
U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), i.e., that records maintained by the Commission shall 
contain only such information as is necessary and relevant to accomplish 
a statutory purpose of the Commission as required by statute or 
Executive Order of the President and that such information also be 
accurate, timely, and complete. These criteria will be applied whether 
the request is to add material to a record or to delete information from 
a record.
    (c) Time for acting on requests. Initial review of a request by an 
individual to amend or correct a record pertaining to him shall be 
completed as promptly as is reasonably possible and normally within 30 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) from the date the 
request was received, unless unusual circumstances preclude completion 
of review within that time. If the anticipated completion date indicated 
in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the individual requesting the 
amendment will be advised in writing of the delay and the reasons 
therefor, and also advised when action is expected to be completed.
    (d) Grant of requests to amend or correct records. If a request to 
amend or correct a record is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy 
Act Officer will: (1) Advise the individual making the request in 
writing of the extent to which it has been granted; (2) amend or correct 
the record accordingly; and (3) where an accounting of disclosures of 
the record has been kept pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c), advise all 
previous recipients of the record of the fact that the record has been 
amended or corrected and the substance of the amendment or correction.
    (e) Denial of requests to amend or correct records. If an 
individual's request to amend or correct a record pertaining to him is 
denied in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer will:
    (1) Promptly advise the individual making the request in writing of 
the extent to which the request has been denied;
    (2) State the reasons for the denial of the request;
    (3) Describe the procedures established by the Commission to obtain 
further review within the Commission of the request to amend or correct, 
including the name and address of the person to whom the appeal is to be 
addressed; and
    (4) Inform the individual that the Privacy Act Officer will provide 
information and assistance to the individual in perfecting an appeal of 
the initial decision.

Sec. 200.308  Appeal of initial adverse agency determination as to access or as to amendment or correction.

    (a) Administrative review. Any person who has been notified pursuant 
to Sec. 200.304(c) that his request for access to records pertaining to 
him has been denied, or pursuant to Section 307(e) of this subpart that 
his request for amendment or correction has been denied in whole or in 
part, or who has received no response to a request for access or to 
amend within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal

[[Page 88]]

holidays) after his request was received by the Commission's staff (or 
within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with 
Secs. 200.304(d) and 200.307(c) of this subpart), may appeal the adverse 
determination or failure to respond by applying for an order of the 
General Counsel determining and directing that access to the record be 
granted or that the record be amended or corrected in accordance with 
his request.
    (1) The application shall be in writing and shall describe the 
record in issue and set forth the proposed amendment or correction and 
the reasons therefor.
    (2) The application shall be delivered to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Public Reference Branch, Room 1024, 450 Fifth 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, or by mail addressed to the Privacy 
Act Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.
    (3) The applicant, if he wishes, may state such facts and cite such 
legal or other authorities as he may consider appropriate in support of 
his application.
    (4) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to 
any appeal within 30 days after the receipt of such appeal (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays), unless for good cause shown, the 
General Counsel shall extend that period. If such an extension is made, 
the individual who is appealing shall be advised in writing of the 
extension, the reasons therefor, and the anticipated date when the 
appeal will be decided.
    (5) In considering an appeal from a denial of a request to amend or 
correct a record, the General Counsel shall apply the same standards as 
set forth in Sec. 200.307(b).
    (6) If the General Counsel shall conclude that access should be 
granted, he or she shall issue an order granting access and instructing 
the Privacy Act Officer to comply with Sec. 200.304(b).
    (7) If the General Counsel shall conclude that the request to amend 
or correct the record should be granted in whole or in part, he or she 
shall issue an order granting the requested amendment or correction in 
whole or in part and instructing the Privacy Act Officer to comply with 
the requirements of Sec. 200.307(d) of this subpart, to the extent 
applicable.
    (8) If the General Counsel affirms the initial decision denying 
access, he or she shall issue an order denying access and advising the 
individual seeking access of (i) The order; (ii) the reasons for denying 
access; and (iii) the individual's right to obtain judicial review of 
the decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(B).
    (9) If the General Counsel determines that the decision of the 
Privacy Act Officer denying a request to amend or correct a record 
should be upheld, he or she shall issue an order denying the request and 
the individual shall be advised of
    (i) The order refusing to amend or correct the record and the 
reasons therefor;
    (ii) His right to file a concise statement setting forth his 
disagreement with the General Counsel's decision not to amend or correct 
the record;
    (iii) The procedures for filing such a statement of disagreement 
with the General Counsel;
    (iv) The fact that any such statement of disagreement will be made 
available to anyone to whom the record is disclosed, together with, if 
the General Counsel deems it appropriate, a brief statement setting 
forth the General Counsel's reasons for refusing to amend or correct;
    (v) The fact that prior recipients of the record in issue will be 
provided with the statement of disagreement and the General Counsel's 
statement, if any, to the extent that an accounting of such disclosures 
has been maintained pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c); and
    (vi) The individual's right to seek judicial review of the General 
Counsel's refusal to amend or correct, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1)(A).
    (10) In appropriate cases the General Counsel may, in his or her 
sole and unfettered discretion, refer matters requiring administrative 
review of initial decisions to the Commission for determination and the 
issuance, where indicated, of orders.
    (b) Statement of disagreement. As noted in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of 
this section, an individual may file with the General Counsel a 
statement setting forth his

[[Page 89]]

disagreement with the General Counsel's denial of his request to amend 
or correct a record.
    (1) Such statement of disagreement shall be delivered to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth 
Street NW., Room 1024, Washington, DC 20549, or mailed to the Privacy 
Act Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549, 
within 30 days after receipt by the individual of the General Counsel's 
order denying the amendment or correction. For good cause shown this 
period can be extended for a reasonable time.
    (2) Such statement of disagreement shall concisely state the basis 
for the individual's agreement. Generally a statement should be no more 
than two pages in length, except an individual may submit a slightly 
longer statement if it is necessary to set forth his disagreement 
effectively. Unduly lengthy or irrelevant materials will be returned to 
the individual by the General Counsel for appropriate revisions before 
they become a permanent part of the individual's record.
    (3) The record about which a statement of disagreement has been 
filed will clearly note which part of the record is disputed and the 
General Counsel will provide copies of the statement of disagreement 
and, if the General Counsel deems it appropriate, provide a concise 
statement of his or her reasons for refusing to amend or correct the 
record, to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been or will 
be disclosed.
    (4) In appropriate cases, the General Counsel may, in his or her 
sole and unfettered discretion, refer matters concerning statements of 
disagreement to the Commission for disposition.

<R05>
Sec. 200.309  General provisions.

    (a) Extensions of time. Pursuant to Secs. 200.303(b), 200.304(d), 
200.307(c) and 200.308(a)(4) of this subpart, the time within which a 
request for information, access or amendment by an individual with 
respect to records maintained by the Commission that pertain to him 
normally would be processed may be extended for good cause shown or 
because of unusual circumstances. As used in these rules, good cause and 
unusual circumstances shall include, but only to the extent reasonably 
necessary to the proper processing of a particular request:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
Office processing the request. Many records of the Commission are stored 
in Federal Records Centers in accordance with law--including many of the 
documents which have been on file with the Commission for more than 2 
years--and cannot be made available promptly. Other records may 
temporarily be located at a Regional or District Office of the 
Commission. Any person who has requested for personal examination a 
record stored at the Federal Records Center or temporarily located in a 
Regional or District Office of the Commission will be notified when the 
record will be made available to him.
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which may be demanded 
in a single request. While every reasonable effort will be made fully to 
comply with each request as promptly as possible on a first-come, first-
served basis, work done to search for, collect and appropriately examine 
records in response to a request for a large number of records will be 
contingent upon the availability of processing personnel in accordance 
with an equitable allocation of time to all members of the public who 
have requested or wish to request records.
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request, or among two or

[[Page 90]]

more components within the Commission having substantial subject-matter 
interest therein.
    (b) Effective date of action. Whenever it is provided in this 
Subpart that an acknowledgement or response to a request will be given 
by specific times, deposit in the mails of such acknowledgement or 
response by that time, addressed to the person making the request, will 
be deemed full compliance.
    (c) Records in use by a member of the Commission or its staff. 
Although every effort will be made to make a record in use by a member 
of the Commission or its staff available when requested, it may 
occasionally be necessary to delay making such a record available when 
doing so at the time the request is made would seriously interfere with 
the work of the Commission or its staff.
    (d) Missing or lost records. Any person who has requested a record 
or a copy of a record pertaining to him will be notified if the record 
sought cannot be found. If he so requests, he will be notified if the 
record subsequently is found.
    (e) Oral requests; misdirected written requests--(1) Telephone and 
other oral requests. Before responding to any request by an individual 
for information concerning whether records maintained by the Commission 
in a system of records pertain to him or to any request for access to 
records by an individual, such request must be in writing and signed by 
the individual making the request. The General Counsel will not 
entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with an 
oral request. Any person who has orally requested information or access 
to records pertaining to him that he believes to have been improperly 
denied to him should resubmit his request in appropriate written form in 
order to obtain proper consideration and, if need be, administrative 
review.
    (2) Misdirected written requests. The Commission cannot assure that 
a timely or satisfactory response will be given to written requests for 
information, access or amendment by an individual with respect to 
records pertaining to him that are directed to the Commission other than 
in a manner prescribed in Secs. 200.303(a), 200.306(a), 200.308(a)(2), 
and 200.310 of this subpart. Any staff member who receives a written 
request for information, access or amendment should promptly forward the 
request to the Privacy Act Officer. Misdirected requests for records 
will be considered to have been received by the Commission only when 
they have been actually received by the Privacy Act Officer in cases 
under Sec. 200.308(a)(2). The General Counsel will not entertain any 
appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with a misdirected 
request, unless it is clearly shown that the request was in fact 
received by the Privacy Act Officer.

Provided, however, That this paragraph (a)(9)(ii) shall not apply in any

precise content or nature of its proposed action, or where the 
Commission is expressly required by law to make such disclosure on its 
own initiative prior to taking final agency action on such proposal.
    (10) Specifically concern the Commission's consideration of, or its 
actual: Issuance of a subpoena (whether by the Commission directly or by 
any Commission employee or member); participation in a civil action or

otherwise; or
    (vi) The disposition of any application for a Commission order of 
any nature where the issuance of such an order would involve a 
determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Interpretation of exemptions. The examples set forth 
Sec. 200.402(a)(1) through (10) of particular matters which may be the 
subject of closed Commission deliberations are to be construed as 
illustrative, but not as exhaustive, of the scope of those exemptions.
    (c) Public interest determination. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 200.402(a) (concerning the closing of Commission meetings), but 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 200.409(a) (respecting the right of 
certain persons to petition for the closing of a Commission meeting), 
the Commission may conduct any meeting or portion of a meeting in public 
where the Commission determines, in its discretion, that the public

from the notice of Commission meetings described in Sec. 200.403, from 
the announcements concerning closed meetings described in 
Secs. 200.404(b) and 200.405(c),

the following schedule in organizing its weekly agenda: Closed meetings 
to consider matters concerning the enforcement of the federal securities 
laws and the conduct of related investigations will generally be held on 
Tuesdays and on Thursday afternoons. An open meeting will generally be 
held each Thursday morning to consider matters of any appropriate 
nature. On Wednesdays, either open or closed meetings, or both, will 
generally be held according to the requirements of the

[[Page 97]]

Commission's agenda for the week in question. Normally, no meetings will 
be scheduled on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    The foregoing tentative general schedule is set forth for the 
guidance of the public, but is not, in any event, binding upon the 
Commission. In every case, the scheduling of Commission meetings shall 
be determined by the demands of Commission business, consistent with the 
requirements of this subpart I. When feasible, the Commission will 
endeavor to announce the subject matter of all then-contemplated open 
meetings during a particular month at least one week prior to the 
commencement of that month.
    When and if convenient after the conclusion of a closed Commission 
meeting, the Commission will endeavor to make publicly available a 
notice describing (subject to the provision in Sec. 200.402(d) regarding 
nonpublic matter in announcements) the items considered at that meeting 
and any action taken thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 200.404  General procedure for determination to close meeting.

    (a) Action to close meeting. Action to close a meeting pursuant to 
Sec. 200.402(a) or (c) shall be taken only upon a vote of a majority of 
the entire membership of the Commission. A separate vote of the 
Commission members shall be taken with respect to each Commission 
meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the 
public pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a), or with respect to any information 
which is proposed to be withheld under Sec. 200.402(d); Provided, 
however, That a single vote may be taken with respect to a series of 
meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed, or 
with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so 
long as each meeting in such series relates to the same matters and is 
scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting 
in such series. The vote of each Commission member participating in such 
vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.
    (b) Announcement of action to close meeting. Within one day of any 
vote pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 200.409(a) 
(relating to review of Commission determinations to open a meeting), the 
Commission shall make publicly available:
    (1) A written record reflecting the vote of each participating 
member of the Commission on the question; and
    (2) In the case of a meeting or portion thereof to be closed to the 
public, a written explanation of the Commission's action closing the 
meeting or a portion thereof, together with a list describing 
generically or specifically the persons expected to attend the meeting 
and their affiliation; and
    (3) For every closed meeting, the certification executed by the 
Commission's General Counsel as described in Sec. 200.406.


<R05>
Sec. 200.405  Special procedure for determination to close meeting.

    (a) Finding. Based, in part, on a review of several months of its 
meetings, as well as the legislative history of the Sunshine Act, the 
Commission finds that a majority of its meetings may properly be closed 
to the public pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (4), (8), (9)(i), or (10), or 
any combination thereof.
    (b) Action to close meeting. The Commission may, by recorded vote of 
a majority of its members at the commencement of any meeting or portion 
thereof, determine to close any meeting or a portion thereof properly 
subject to being closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (4), (8), (9)(i), or 
(10), or any combination thereof. The procedure described in this rule 
may be utilized notwithstanding the fact that a meeting or portion 
thereof properly subject to being closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) 
(4), (8), (9)(i), or (10), or any combination thereof, could also be 
closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), or 
(9)(ii), or any combination thereof.
    (c) Announcement of action to close meeting. In the case of a 
meeting or a portion of a meeting closed pursuant to this rule, as soon 
as practicable the Commission shall make publicly available:
    (1) A written record reflecting the vote of each participating 
member of the Commission to close the meeting; and
    (2) The certification described in Sec. 200.406, executed by the 
Commission's General Counsel.

[[Page 98]]


<R05>
Sec. 200.406  Certification by the General Counsel.

    For every Commission meeting closed pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (1) 
through (10), the General Counsel of the Commission (or, in his or her 
absence, the attorney designated by General Counsel pursuant to 
Sec. 200.21) shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the 
meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant 
exemptive provision.


<R05>
Sec. 200.407  Transcripts, minutes, and other documents concerning closed Commission meetings.

    (a) Record of closed meetings. Except as provided in 
Sec. 200.407(b), the Commission's Secretary shall prepare a complete 
transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the 
proceedings of each closed meeting, or closed portion of a meeting.
    (b) Minutes of closed meetings. In the case of a meeting, or portion 
of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (8), 
(9)(i), or (10), the Secretary may, in his or her discretion or at the 
direction of the Commission, prepare either the transcript or recording 
described in Sec. 200.407(a), or a set of minutes. Such minutes shall 
fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a 
full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons 
therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any 
item and the record of any rollcall vote (reflecting the vote of each 
participating Commission member on the question). All documents 
specifically considered by the Commission in connection with any action 
shall be identified in such minutes are maintained.
    (c) Retention of certificate and statement. The Secretary shall 
retain a copy of every certification executed by the General Counsel 
pursuant to Sec. 200.406, together with a statement from the presiding 
officer of the meeting, or portion of a meeting to which the 
certification applies, setting forth the time and place of the meeting, 
and the persons present.
    (d) Minute Record. Nothing herein shall affect the provisions of 
Secs. 200.13a and 200.40 requiring the Secretary to prepare and maintain 
a Minute Record reflecting the official actions of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.408  Public access to transcripts and minutes of closed Commission meetings; record retention.

    (a) Public access to record. Within twenty days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of the receipt by the 
Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer of a written request, or 
within such extended period as may be agreeable to the person making the 
request, the Secretary shall make available for inspection by any person 
in the Commission's Public Reference Room, the transcript, electronic 
recording, or minutes (as required by Sec. 200.407 (a) or (b)) of the 
discussion of any item on the agenda, except for such item or items as 
the Freedom of Information Act Officer determines to involve matters 
which may be withheld under Sec. 200.402 or otherwise. Copies of such 
transcript, or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing 
the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the 
actual cost of duplication, as set forth in Sec. 200.80e, and, if a 
transcript is prepared, the actual cost of such transcription.
    (b) Review of deletion from record. Any person who has been notified 
that the Freedom of Information Act Officer has determined to withhold 
any transcript, recording, or minute, or portion thereof, which was the 
subject of a request for access pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a), or any 
person who has not received a response to his or her own request within 
the 20 days specified in Sec. 200.408(a), may appeal the adverse 
determination or failure to respond by applying for an order of the 
Commission determining and directing that the transcript, recording or 
minute, or deleted portion thereof, be made available. Such application 
shall be in writing and should be directed to the Secretary, Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549. The applicant shall state 
such facts and cite such legal or other authorities as the applicant may 
consider appropriate. The Commission shall make a determination with 
respect to any appeal pursuant to this subsection within 20 days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays

[[Page 99]]

and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, or within 
such extended period as may be agreeable to the person making the 
request. The Commission may determine to withhold any record that is 
exempt from disclosure pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a), although it may 
disclose a record, even if exempt, if, in its discretion, it determines 
it to be appropriate to do so.
    (c) Retention of record. The Commission, by its Secretary, shall 
retain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, or a complete copy of 
the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or 
portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two 
years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any 
Commission proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was 
held, whichever occurs later.


<R05>
Sec. 200.409  Administrative appeals.

    (a) Review of determination to open meeting. Following any 
announcement stating that the Commission intends to open a meeting or a 
portion thereof, any person whose interests may be directly and 
substantially affected by the disposition of the matter to be discussed 
at such meeting may make a request, directed to the Commission's 
Secretary, that the meeting, or relevant portion thereof, be closed 
pursuant to Sec. 200.402(a) (5), (6), or (7). The Secretary shall 
circulate such a request to the members of the Commission, along with a 
supporting statement provided by the requestor setting forth the 
requestor's interest in the matter and the reasons why the requestor 
believes that the meeting (or portion thereof) should be closed, and the 
Commission, upon the request of any one of its members, shall vote by 
recorded vote on whether to close such meeting or portion.
    (b) Review of determination to close meeting. Following any 
announcement that the Commission intends to close a meeting or a portion 
thereof, any person may make written or telegraphic request, directed to 
the Commission's Secretary, that the meeting or a portion thereof be 
open. Such a request shall set forth the requestor's interest in the 
matter and the reasons why the requestor believes that the meeting (or a 
portion thereof) should be open to the public. The Secretary shall 
circulate such a request and supporting statement to the members of the 
Commission, and the Commission, upon the request of any one of its 
members, shall vote whether to open such a meeting or a portion thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 200.410  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Unauthorized activities; maintenance of decorum. Nothing in this 
subpart shall authorize any member of the public to be heard at, or 
otherwise participate in, any Commission meeting, or to photograph or 
record by videotape or similar device any Commission meeting or portion 
thereof. The Commission may exclude any person from attendance at any 
meeting whenever necessary to preserve decorum, or where appropriate or 
necessary for health or safety reasons, or where necessary to terminate 
behavior unauthorized by this paragraph (a). Any person desiring to 
sound-record an open Commission meeting shall notify the Commission's 
Secretary of his intention to do so at least 48 hours in advance of the 
meeting in question. Any person desiring to photograph or videotape the 
Commission's proceedings may apply to the Secretary for permission to do 
so at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting in question. The 
Commission's determination to permit photography or videotaping at any 
meeting is confined to its exclusive discretion, and will be granted 
only if such activities will not result in undue disruption of 
Commission proceedings.
    (b) Suspension of open meeting. Subject to the satisfaction of any 
procedural requirements which may be required by this subpart, nothing 
in this subpart shall preclude the Commission from directing that the 
room be cleared of spectators, temporarily or permanently, whenever it 
appears that the discussion during an open Commission meeting is likely 
to involve any matter described in Sec. 200.402(a) (respecting closed 
meetings).
    (c) Access to Commission documents. Except as expressly provided, 
nothing in this subpart shall authorize any person to obtain access to 
any document not otherwise available to the public or

[[Page 100]]

not required to be disclosed pursuant to subpart D. Access to documents 
considered or mentioned at Commission meetings may only be obtained 
subject to the procedures set forth in, and the provisions of, subpart 
D.
    (d) Access to public meetings. Any member of the public who plans to 
attend a public meeting of the Commission, and who requires an auxiliary 
aid such as a sign language interpreter, should contact the Commission's 
Selective Placement Coordinator, Office of Personnel at (202) 272-7065 
or TDD number (202) 272-2552, prior to the meeting to make the necessary 
arrangements. The Selective Placement Coordinator will take all 
reasonable steps to accommodate requests made in advance of the 
scheduled meeting date.

circumstances in which a Commission action not specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section may involve major Federal action significantly 
affecting the quality of the human environment, the Commission shall

doing so would be inconsistent with its statutory authority under the 
Federal securities laws.


<R05>
Sec. 200.552  NEPA planning.

    Where it is reasonably foreseeable by the Commission that it may be

prepare such statement generally in accordance with the procedures 
specified in 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, particularly part 1502 concerning 
impact statement preparation and content, Sec. 1505.1 concerning 
decision-making procedures, and Sec. 1501.6 concerning the function of

29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 200.641--200.648  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 200.649  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 200.650, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 200.650  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 200.650(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance

[[Page 108]]

with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing 
buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled 
by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-
4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available 
methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall 
give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to 
qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting 
appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 200.650(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 200.650(a) (2) or (3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 200.651  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 200.660  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by

[[Page 109]]

telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally 
effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with 
persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 200.660 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the

Sec. 200.735-1  Purpose.

    This subpart sets forth the standards of ethical conduct required of 
members, employees and special Government employees, and former members 
and employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is a further 
revision of a comprehensive conduct regulation first adopted by the 
Commission in 1953 ``to restate the ethical principles which it believes 
should govern and have governed the conduct of members and employees and 
former members and employees of the Commission.'' <SUP>1</SUP> This 
revision is necessary to provide members, employees, special Government 
employees and former Commission members and employees with a 
comprehensive statement of standards of conduct which are dictated by 
applicable Federal law, Executive orders, and the Commission's own 
requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1</SUP> The last major revision of the Conduct Regulation was 
done in 1966 to implement Executive Order 11222, May 8, 1965, and part 
735 of the Civil Service Commission regulations (5 CFR part 735) adopted 
pursuant thereto. It also contains references to the several applicable 
statutes governing employee conduct, particularly Pub. L. 87-849 (76 
Stat. 1119, 18 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and the ``Code of Ethics for 
Government Service,'' House Concurrent Resolution 175, 85th Congress, 2d 
session (72 Stat. B 12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-2  Policy.

    (a) The Securities and Exchange Commission has been entrusted by 
Congress with the protection of the public interest in a highly 
significant area of our national economy. In view of the effect which 
Commission action frequently has on the general public, it is important 
that members, employees and special Government employees maintain 
unusually high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality and 
conduct. They must be constantly aware of the need to avoid situations 
which might result either in actual or apparent misconduct or conflicts 
of interest and to conduct themselves in their official relationships in 
a manner which commands the respect and confidence of their fellow 
citizens.
    (b) For these reasons, members, employees and special Government 
employees should at all times abide by the standards of conduct set 
forth in this subpart, the canons of ethics for members of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (subpart C of this part 200) and, in 
the case of a professional person, the ethical standards applicable to 
the profession of such person.


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-3  General provisions.

    (a)(1) In considering the prohibitions of this section, members and 
employees must constantly be aware that the provisions here enumerated 
set forth standards of conduct which are broader than the specific 
applications stated in the rules which follow. Therefore, members and 
employees should look to these general prohibitions when assessing the 
advisability of a particular course of conduct. The broadly stated 
provisions of this rule are aimed at

[[Page 111]]

eliminating the appearance of impropriety as well as any actual 
wrongdoing.
    (2) Accordingly, a member or employee should avoid any action, 
whether or not specifically prohibited by law or regulation (including 
the provisions of this subpart), which would result in or might create 
appearance of, among other things:
    (i) Using public office for private gain;
    (ii) Giving preferential treatment to any organization or person;
    (iii) Losing complete independence or impartiality;
    (iv) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (v) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.
    (3) While provisions applicable to all employees of the Commission 
are outlined in this regulation, certain Offices or Divisions for 
management reasons may require more stringent regulations in certain 
areas. These may be imposed by Division Directors, Office Heads or 
Regional Administrators with the consent of the Chairman and the 
approval of the Office of Government Ethics. Should such additional 
regulations be imposed, all employees affected must be notified ten days 
before the effective date of the restriction or at the time of their 
employment.
    (b) A member or employee of the Commission shall not:
    (1) Engage, directly or indirectly, in any personal business 
transaction or private arrangement for personal profit the opportunity 
for which arises because of his or her official position or authority, 
or that is based upon confidential or nonpublic information which he or 
she gains by reason of such position or authority.<SUP>2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    </SUP>\2\ Detailed provisions regarding outside or private 
employment and transactions in securities and commodities are set forth 
in Secs. 200.735-4 and 200.735-5, respectively. Further provisions 
regarding use and disclosure of confidential information are set forth 
in paragraph (b) of this section and in the note appended thereto.
    Members of the Commission are subject also to the following 
prohibition in section 4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78d(a)): ``* * * No Commissioner shall engage in any other 
business, vocation, or employment than that of serving as Commissioner, 
nor shall any Commissioner participate, directly or indirectly, in any 
stock market operations or transactions of a character subject to 
regulation by the Commission pursuant to this title * * *.'' This does 
not preclude Commissioners from engaging in securities transactions. See 
Opinion letter dated February 11, 1975, sent by the Office of the 
General Counsel to David Reich, Ethics Counselor at the Civil Service 
Commission. In addition, members of the Commission are subject to the 
requirements of Executive Order 11222 of May 8, 1965.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan, service, or any other thing of monetary 
value from any person with whom he or she transacts business on behalf 
of the United States:
    (i) Who has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business 
or financial relations with the Commission;
    (ii) Who conducts operations or activities regulated by the 
Commission; or
    (iii) Who has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or non-performance of his or her official duty.
    (3) The restrictions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section do not 
prohibit members and employees from the following:
    (i) The acceptance of food and refreshments, not lavish in kind, 
offered free in the course of a meeting or other group function, not 
connected with an inspection or investigation, at which attendance is 
desirable because it will assist the member or employee in performing 
his or her official duties. Members shall determine for themselves and 
their staffs the propriety of accepting such invitations. Division 
Directors, Office Heads, and Regional Administrators are authorized to 
make such determinations for themselves and their subordinates. Staff 
members are required to advise their Division Director, Office Head, or 
Regional Administrator of invitations received from entities described 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (ii) The acceptance of items of value when the circumstances make it 
clear that it is family or personal relationships rather than the 
business of the persons concerned which govern and are the motivating 
factors.

[[Page 112]]

    (iii) The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional 
material, such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars and other items of 
modest value.
    (iv) The acceptance of meals and refreshments as provided to all 
panelists, when participating as a panelist in an educational program.
    (v) The acceptance of gifts given for participation in an 
educational program when they are (A) of modest value; or (B) provided 
to all participants in the program; or (C) in the nature of a 
remembrance traditional to the particular sponsor institution.
    (vi) For purposes of this subpart, person means an individual, a 
corporation, a company, an association, a firm, a partnership, a 
society, a joint stock company; or any other organization or institution 
or anyone who acts for such a person in a representative capacity.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Members and employees of the Commission are subject also to 
provisions of the Federal criminal code which prohibit, (1) any officer 
or employee of the United States from asking, accepting or receiving any 
money or other thing of value in connection with any matter before him 
or her in his or her official capacity, (18 U.S.C. 203); and (2) the 
compensation of government employees for services to the government by 
entities other than the United States (18 U.S.C. 209). In addition, 
members are prohibited by 5 CFR 735.203(c) from receiving compensation 
or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, 
writing, or appearance, the subject matter of which is devoted 
substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of the 
Commission or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which 
have not become part of the body of public information. See also 17 CFR 
200.735-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Solicit contributions from another employee for a gift to an 
employee in a superior official position. An employee in a superior 
official position shall not accept a gift presented as a contribution 
from employees receiving less salary than himself or herself. An 
employee shall not make a donation as a gift to an employee in a 
superior official position (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does 
not prohibit the occasional giving of gifts of modest value to an 
employee in a superior position or the receipt of such gifts by a 
superior or the use of completely voluntary contributions of nominal 
amounts by employees within the Commission to establish funds for the 
limited purpose of providing token remembrances or gifts of modest value 
to an employee in a superior position on special occasions.
    (5) Accept from a foreign government a gift, decoration or other 
thing of more than minimal value except in accordance with the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7342.
    (6) Discuss or entertain a proposal for future employment by any 
person outside the Government with whom he or she is personally and 
substantially involved in transacting business on behalf of the United 
States.<SUP>4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    </SUP>\4\ Detailed provisions regarding negotiations for future 
employment are set forth in Sec. 200.735-7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) If an employee wishes to discuss future employment with another 
Government agency, this fact should be disclosed to the employee's 
Division Director, Office Head or Regional Administrator prior to any 
discussion regarding employment, if at that time the employee is 
representing the Commission in a particular matter in which the other 
agency is taking a position adverse to the Commission.
    (7)(i) Divulge to any unauthorized person or release in advance of 
authorization for its release \5\ any nonpublic Commission document, or 
any information contained in any such document or any confidential 
information: (A) In contravention of the rules and regulations of the 
Commission promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552, 552a and 552b; or (B) in 
circumstances where the Commission has determined to accord such 
information confidential treatment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>5</SUP> In Section 171 of the Commission's Manual of 
Administrative Regulations the Commission's policy on making available 
nonpublic information to Federal, State and foreign government 
authorities, national securities exchanges and national securities 
associations is outlined.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Except where the Commission or the General Counsel, pursuant to 
delegated authority, has previously granted approval or in relation to a 
Commission administrative proceeding or a judicial proceeding in which 
the Commission, or a present or former Commissioner, or present or 
former member of

[[Page 113]]

the staff, represented by Commission counsel, is a party, any officer, 
employee or former officer or employee who is served with a subpoena 
requiring the disclosure of confidential or non-public information or 
documents shall, unless the Commission or the General Counsel, pursuant 
to delegated authority, authorizes the disclosure of such information or 
documents, respectfully decline to disclose the information or produce 
the documents called for, basing his or her refusal on this paragraph.
    (iii) Any member, employee or former member or employee who is 
served with such a subpoena not covered by the exceptions in paragraph 
(b)(7)(ii) of this section shall promptly advise the General Counsel of 
the service of such subpoena, the nature of the information or documents 
sought, and any circumstances which may bear upon the desirability in 
the public interest of making available such information or 
documents.<SUP>6</SUP> The Commission or the General Counsel, pursuant 
to delegated authority, shall authorize the disclosure of non-expert, 
non-privileged, factual staff testimony and the production of non-
privileged documents when validly subpoenaed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>6</SUP> Detailed prohibitions regarding disclosure or use of 
confidential or nonpublic information are set forth in Rule 122 (17 CFR 
230.122) under the Securities Act of 1933; section 24(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78x) and Rule 0-4 (17 CFR 
240.0-4); and Rule 24(b)(2) (17 CFR 240.24b-2), thereunder; section 
22(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79y) 
and Rule 104 thereunder (17 CFR 250.104); section 45(a)(1) of the 
Investment Company Act, and section 210(b) of the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-10). But see, section 171 of the 
Administrative Manual which authorizes the staff to divulge certain 
nonpublic information without Commission approval (n. 5, supra).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (8) Act in any official matter with respect to which there exists a 
personal interest incompatible with an unbiased exercise of official 
judgment.<SUP>7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7</SUP> Section 200.735-6 of this subpart provides a procedure for 
relieving employees from assignments in certain cases, including those 
covered by paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (9) Have direct or indirect personal, business or financial affairs 
which conflict or appear to conflict with his or her official duties and 
responsibilities.
    (10)(i) Use, or allow the use of, directly or indirectly, Government 
property of any kind, including property leased to the Government, for 
other than officially approved activities. Officially approved 
activities for the purpose of this section are those activities which 
are part of an employee's official duties or are approved by the 
employee's Division Director, Office Head or Regional Administrator as 
being sufficiently related to the employee's official duties, or 
important to the interests of the Commission to warrant the use of 
Commission facilities for their accomplishment. Division Directors, 
Office Heads and Regional Administrators may, for their own activities 
meeting the same criteria, obtain the concurrence of the Executive 
Director.
    (ii) An employee has a positive duty to protect and conserve 
Government property, including equipment, supplies, and other property 
entrusted or issued to him or her.
    (11) Participate, while on Government-owned or leased property or 
while on duty for the Government, in any gambling activity, including 
the operation of a gambling device, in conducting a lottery or pool, in 
a game for money or property, or in selling or purchasing a numbers slip 
or ticket.
    (12) Engage in unlawful or unethical conduct, or other conduct 
prejudicial to the Government.

Sec. 200.735-4  Outside employment and activities.

    (a) No member or employee shall permit his or her name to be 
associated in any way with any legal, accounting or other professional 
firm or office. \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ With respect to members, this paragraph supplements the 
statutory prohibition against outside employment contained in section 
4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, quoted in footnote 2. 
Except as otherwise indicated, the remaining provisions of this section 
are not made applicable to members in view of the provisions of section 
4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 114]]

    (b)(1) No employee shall have any outside or private employment, 
activity, or affiliation incompatible with concurrent employment by the 
Commission. Incompatible activities include but are not limited to
    (i) Employment or association with any securities exchange, 
association of securities dealers, or other self-regulatory organization 
either registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise 
involved with the securities industry, any registered broker, dealer, 
registered municipal securities dealer, public utility holding company, 
investment company, investment adviser, securities information 
processor, transfer agent, clearing agency or other persons who are 
subject to regulation by the Commission, or where the facts relating to 
a particular employment would create an appearance of impropriety, 
because the employment is directly or indirectly related to the 
issuance, sale, purchase or investment of securities;
    (ii) Legal, accounting, or engineering work for compensation 
involving matters in which the Federal government may be significantly 
interested;
    (iii) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, 
or any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which 
acceptance may result in or create the appearance of conflicts of 
interest;
    (iv) Outside employment or activity which impairs the employee's 
mental or physical capacity to perform his or her Commission duties and 
responsibilities in an acceptable manner;
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph (b), the private employment 
of an employee's spouse, or other member of his or her immediate 
household with any securities exchange, association of securities 
dealers, or other self-regulatory organization either registered under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise involved in the 
securities industry, any registered broker, dealer, registered municipal 
securities dealer, public utility holding company, investment company, 
investment adviser, securities information processor, transfer agent, 
clearing agency or other persons who are subject to regulation by the 
Commission, or where the particular employment is directly related to 
the issuance, sale, purchase or investment of securities is deemed to be 
incompatible with the employee's concurrent employment by the Commission 
if the duties and activities incident to such employment relate directly 
to the official activities of the Commission employee, except as 
determined otherwise by the Commission in a specific case.
    (i) Member of his or her immediate household is defined for the 
purposes of this paragraph as a resident of the employee's household who 
is related to the employee by blood or marriage.
    (3) No employee shall accept or perform outside employment 
prohibited by law, regulations of the Office of Personnel Management or 
the rules in this subpart.
    (4) No employee shall receive any salary or anything of monetary 
value from a private source as compensation for his or her services to 
the Government (18 U.S.C. 209), except as otherwise provided by law.
    (5) The Commission encourages employees to engage in teaching, 
lecturing, and writing activities with or without compensation. \9\ In 
participating in such activities, employees should be guided by the 
following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ As to employees, while the receipt of honoraria is discouraged 
(See 17 CFR 200.735-4(b)(7)), that rule is not applicable to the receipt 
of compensation for teaching.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) No teaching, lecturing, or writing should be engaged in if 
prohibited by law, Executive order, Office of Personnel Management 
regulations, or the rules in this subpart.
    (ii) No teaching, lecturing, or writing should be engaged in 
(including for the purpose of the special preparation of a person or 
class of persons for an examination of the Office of Personnel 
Management or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service) that depends 
on information filed with the Commission, or obtained by the Commission 
in an investigation or otherwise, or generated within the Commission 
which is nonpublic, unless the Commission gives formal approval for the 
use of such nonpublic information on the basis that the use thereof is 
in the public interest.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Since members of the Commission are covered by section 401(a) 
of Executive Order 11222, they are prohibited by Civil Service 
Regulations (5 CFR 735.203(c)) from receiving compensation or anything 
of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or 
appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the 
responsibilities, programs, or operations of their agencies, or which 
draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part 
of the body of public information.

    (6)(i) Subject to the specific prohibition and requirements set 
forth below, the Commission may accept payment or reimbursement in cash 
or in kind, for travel and subsistence expenses actually incurred by 
Commission members and employees, while on official duty status, in 
connection with the participation of such members and employees in 
conferences, proceedings, meetings, seminars, and educational programs 
concerning the functions and responsibilities of the Commission and 
related topics.
    (ii)(A) The Commission shall accept no payment or reimbursement for 
expenses described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section from or in 
connection with a conference sponsored by:
    (1) A person directly required to file reports or registration 
statements with the Commission, or
    (2) A person directly or indirectly regulated by the Commission, or
    (3) Any association or other group composed predominantly of persons 
regulated by the Commission, Provided, however, That the Chairman may 
authorize the Commission to accept payment or reimbursement from such a 
group. In determining whether to authorize such payment or 
reimbursement, the Chairman shall consider the benefits to the 
Commission and the public of participation in the particular program and 
the possibility of any appearance of impropriety.
    (B) For purposes of this section, the phrase person regulated by the 
Commission means all persons whose activities are directly regulated by, 
or who are required to register with, the Commission, including but not 
limited to, such persons as brokers or dealers in securities, national 
securities exchanges, national securities associations, investment 
companies, investment advisers, public utility holding companies, and 
any self-regulatory organization, as that term is defined in section 3 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78(c).
    (iii)(A) Subordinate members of the staff who are invited to 
participate in programs which offer payment or reimbursement meeting the 
criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section must, prior to 
participation, obtain the written approval of their Division Director, 
Office Head, or Regional Administrator to participate in the program and 
the written approval of the Chairman, if paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of 
this section applies. If paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section does 
not apply, the Executive Director shall determine in writing whether the 
Commission will accept the payment or reimbursement.
    (1) In acting on requests to participate, Division Directors, Office 
Heads, and Regional Administrators shall consider: (i) The benefit to 
the Commission and the public of participation; (ii) the expertise of 
the proposed participant; and (iii) the appropriate allocation of 
resources.
    (2) In determining whether the Commission shall accept payment or 
reimbursement, the Executive Director shall consider the possibility of 
any appearance of impropriety.
    (B) Division Directors, Office Heads, and Regional Administrators 
must, prior to participation, obtain the written approval of the 
Chairman, if paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section applies. If 
paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section does not apply, the Executive 
Director shall determine, in writing, considering the possibility of any 
appearance of impropriety, whether the Commission will accept the 
payment or reimbursement. Division Directors, Office Heads, and Regional 
Administrators shall make the determinations specified in paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(A)(1) of this section as to their own participation.
    (C) Except if paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)(3) of this section applies, 
each Commissioner shall determine for himself or herself whether payment 
or reimbursement for his or her expenses incident to participation in 
programs meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section 
should be accepted by the

[[Page 116]]

Commission. Notice of each decision shall be sent to the Executive 
Director.
    (D) Whenever it is determined, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) 
(A), (B), or (C) of this section that the Commission will accept a 
particular payment or reimbursement, the Executive Director shall 
forward notice of that decision to the Public Reference Room, 
Washington, DC, for insertion in a public file.
    (iv) Payment or reimbursement shall not be accepted for expenses 
which are unreasonable or lavish.
    (v) On a quarterly basis, the Commission shall publish in the SEC 
Docket a compilation of payments and reimbursements accepted.
    (vi) The Commission's acceptance from any person of payment or 
reimbursement for the expenses of a spouse or traveling companion 
accompanying a member or employee is prohibited. If a staff member 
wishes to participate in a program which offers payment or reimbursement 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section and 
acceptance would not be prohibited by paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this 
section, but is denied approval in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(6)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, or wishes to accept reimbursement 
for the travel expenses of his or her spouse or traveling companion, the 
staff member may participate in the program and accept such 
reimbursement personally, Provided, That:
    (A) No reimbursement for travel expenses may be accepted from a 
person who does, or is seeking to do, business with the Commission, is 
regulated directly or indirectly by the Commission, is registered with 
the Commission, or has interests which may be substantially affected by 
the official's performance or non-performance of his or her official 
duties.
    (B) No reimbursement may be accepted for the travel expenses of an 
employee's spouse or traveling companion unless the prior written 
approval of the General Counsel is obtained. Under appropriate 
circumstances, such as programs where participants are expected to 
engage in social activities, the General Counsel may approve acceptance 
upon written application.
    (C) A copy of the General Counsel's approval and notice of the 
amount of payment or reimbursement accepted from the sponsor must be 
sent to the Executive Director for inclusion in the public file in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(D) of this section.
    (D) Such staff member's participation and travel occur only while on 
annual leave, approved in accord with regular leave procedures. Note 7 
CFR 200.735-4(e)(2)(ii).
    (vii) Members or employees who are participating in a program 
meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, which is 
sponsored by a person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be 
a tax-exempt organization pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), and for which 
reimbursement for the member's or employee's participation will be 
accepted by the Commission, may, while on official duty, accept from the 
sponsoring entity bona fide reimbursement for actual expenses for travel 
and necessary subsistence for a spouse or traveling companion Provided 
that the procedures detailed in paragraphs (d)(6)(vi) (A)-(C) of this 
section are followed.
    (7) The provisions of this paragraph (b) and Sec. 200.735-3(b)(2) do 
not preclude a member or employee from:
    (i) Participation in the activities of national or State political 
parties not proscribed by law;
    (ii) Participation in the affairs of, or acceptance of an award for 
a meritorious public contribution or achievement given by, a charitable, 
religious, professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational, 
recreational, public service, or civic organization.
    (8)(i) As a matter of general policy, the Commission discourages the 
acceptance of honoraria or similar fees and payments which are given for 
publications, speeches or lectures based on the official duties of the 
employee. In accord with this policy, no member or employee may accept 
such an honorarium unless written approval is obtained in advance from 
the Commission's General Counsel, subject to the general review of the 
Commission. Requests for such approval should be submitted to the 
General Counsel in writing and should include a statement in support of 
the request.
    (ii) Honoraria which are most likely to be deemed acceptable are 
those

[[Page 117]]

which appear to be remuneration for teaching. An employee may not, under 
any circumstances, accept an honorarium from any person from whom 
reimbursement for travel expenses is prohibited by paragraph (b)(6)(ii) 
of this section. In any event an employee may not accept an excessive 
honorarium as described in 2 U.S.C. 441(i). This section does not 
preclude the acceptance of a modest gift for participation as a speaker, 
as provided in Rule 3.
    (c) No employee shall appear in court or on a brief in a 
representative capacity (with or without compensation) or otherwise 
accept or perform legal, accounting, engineering, or similar 
professional work, unless specifically authorized to do so by the 
Commission. Acceptance of a forwarding fee shall be deemed to be within 
the foregoing prohibition. As a matter of general policy, outside or 
private professional work or practice by the staff is discouraged and 
only in unusual cases or circumstances will it be authorized. However, 
the Commission encourages its employees, in off-duty hours and 
consistent with official responsibilities, to participate, without 
compensation, in programs to provide legal or other appropriate 
assistance and representation to indigents.<SUP>12</SUP> Such 
participation may include limited appearances in court and on briefs 
when required in connection with such programs. However, such 
participation may not involve any activities which are prohibited by 
law, Executive orders, Office of Personnel Management regulations, or 
this subpart M.<SUP>13</SUP> For example, 18 U.S.C. 205 prohibits a 
Federal employee from appearing in court in a matter in which the United 
States has an interest (other than on behalf of the United States), 
without regard to compensation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>12</SUP> As a matter of policy, the Commission encourages 
members of its staff to participate in matters involving improvement to 
their communities and service to indigent persons, provided that the 
necessary approval is obtained in advance. However, in no case will 
approval be given to participate in matters involving securities.
    <SUP>13</SUP> Attention is called to Title 18, United States Code, 
sections 201 through 209 which provide, among other things, that Federal 
employees are prohibited from acting as agent or attorney in prosecuting 
any claim against the United States or from aiding and assisting in any 
way, except as otherwise permitted in the discharge of official duties, 
in the prosecution or support of any such claim, or from receiving any 
gratuity, or any share of an interest in any claim from any claimant 
against the United States; and from directly or indirectly receiving or 
agreeing to receive any compensation whatever for services rendered or 
to be rendered to any persons in relation to any matter in which the 
United States is a party or directly or indirectly interested. 18 U.S.C. 
205 contains an exception from the foregoing restrictions for acting as 
agent or attorney, without compensation, for government employees who 
are the subject of disciplinary, loyalty or other personnel-type 
proceedings, in connection with these proceedings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The provisions of this paragraph (c) and Sec. 200.735-3(b)(2) do 
not preclude an employee from:
    (i) Acting without compensation as agent or attorney (A) for a 
Commission employee who is sued or is under investigation in connection 
with his or her official duties; (B) for any Commission employee who is 
the subject of disciplinary, loyalty or other personnel administrative 
proceedings in connection with those proceedings; or (C) for any 
Commission employee who raises claims or against whom allegations of 
wrongdoing are made pursuant to the Commission's Equal Opportunity 
regulations, if such representation is not inconsistent with the 
faithful performance of the employee's duties.<SUP>14
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    14</SUP> This is adapted from the provision in 18 U.S.C. 205 and 
expresses the Commission's general policy which favors the 
representation of fellow employees without compensation. However, it may 
be necessary to look to other regulations for specific provisions 
regarding such representation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) No member or employee shall hold office in or be a director of 
any company which has public security holders, except not for profit 
corporations, savings and loan associations, and similar institutions, 
whose securities are exempted under section 3(a)(4) or 3(a)(5) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(4), 77c(a)(5)).
    (e)(1) As paragraph (b)(5) of this section indicates, the Commission 
encourages employees to engage in teaching,

[[Page 118]]

lecturing and writing activities.<SUP>15</SUP> It is understood, 
however, that Commission employees in their teaching, writing and 
lecturing shall not
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>15</SUP> This paragraph (e), requiring review of prepared 
speeches or writings relating to the Commission, does not apply to 
teaching activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Use confidential or nonpublic information;
    (ii) Make comments on pending litigation in which the Commission is 
participating as a party or amicus curiae; or
    (iii) Make comments on rulemaking proceedings pending before the 
Commission which would adversely affect the operations of the 
Commission.
    (2) To assist employees in conforming to these requirements the 
following procedure for reviewing writings prior to publication, or 
prepared speeches prior to delivery, has been established:
    (i) Employees must submit proposed publications or prepared speeches 
relating to the Commission, or the statutes or rules it administers, to 
the General Counsel for review. Employees will be notified as promptly 
as possible, with due regard to publication deadlines, but in any event 
within 30 days of receipt of the written document, whether such document 
conforms to the requirements of this Rule.
    (ii) A determination by the General Counsel that a proposed 
publication conforms to the requirements of the rule will not involve 
adoption of, or concurrence in, the views expressed. Therefore, such 
publication or speech shall include at an appropriate place or by way of 
footnote, or otherwise, the following disclaimer of responsibility:

    The Securities and Exchange Commission, as a matter of policy, 
disclaims responsibility for any private publication or statement by any 
of its employees. The views expressed herein are those of the author and 
do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or of the 
author's colleagues upon the staff of the Commission.


In appropriate cases, the above disclaimer may be modified by the 
General Counsel or the Commission to reflect the circumstances of an 
individual case. In addition, any publication or speech which reflects 
positions taken by the Commission shall set forth those positions 
accurately and, if it contains differences with Commission positions, it 
shall clearly state that such positions are those of the employee.
    (f) An employee who intends to accept or perform any outside or 
private employment or professional work shall obtain necessary 
authorization in advance of such acceptance or performance. A request 
for such authorization shall be submitted to the Division Director, 
Office Head or Regional Administrator concerned, together with all 
pertinent facts regarding the proposed employment, such as the name of 
the employer, the nature of the work to be performed, its estimated 
duration, and the fee or compensation to be received. Division 
Directors, Office Heads and Regional Administrators have been delegated 
the authority to approve routine requests for outside employment. The 
approving official shall forward to the Director of Personnel a copy of 
each request showing the date of approval. Requests of a non-routine 
nature should be forwarded to the Director of Personnel.
    (g) The Director of Personnel, or his designee, is authorized to 
approve or disapprove requests for outside or private employment under 
this rule, except as to those cases which, in his judgment, should be 
considered and decided by the Commission. An employee may appeal a 
disapproved request to the Commission. The written appeal, submitted 
through the Director of Personnel, shall give reasons why the proposed 
outside or private employment is consistent with this rule. The Director 
of Personnel may not approve proposed outside or private employment 
which is absolutely prohibited by these rules. The Commission may, in a 
particular case, approve such employment.<SUP>16

the provision of this subsection.

<R05>
Sec. 200.735-5  Securities transactions.

    (a)(1) This section applies to all transactions effected by or on 
behalf of a member or employee. This includes transactions for the 
accounts of other persons effected by the member or employee, directly 
or indirectly, under a power of attorney or otherwise. In addition, a 
member or employee is considered to have sufficient interest in the 
securities transactions of his or her spouse or unemancipated minor 
child or other member of his or her immediate household so that 
transactions effected by or on behalf of such persons must be reported 
and are subject to all the terms of this section.
    (i) Except, this section shall not apply to securities transactions 
of a legally separated spouse living apart from the member or employee, 
including transactions for the benefit of a minor child, if the member 
or employee has no power to control and does not, in fact, advise or 
control with regard to such transactions. If the member or employee has 
knowledge of securities held by a separated spouse or for the benefit of 
a minor child, the disqualification provisions of Rule 6, 17 CFR 
200.735-6, and 18 U.S.C. 208 are applicable.
    (ii) For purposes of this section member of his or her immediate 
household means a resident of the member's or employee's household who 
is related to the employee by blood or marriage or who is in the legal 
care and/or custody of the employee by reason of adoption, prospective 
adoption or guardianship.
    (2) Members and employees are prohibited from recommending or 
suggesting the purchase or sale of securities:
    (i) Based on non-public information gained in the course of 
employment; or
    (ii) Which a member or employee could not purchase because of the 
restrictions of this rule, in any circumstance in which the member or 
employee could reasonably expect to benefit from the recommendation, or 
to anyone over whom the member or employee has or may have control or 
substantial influence.
    (b)(1) No member or employee shall effect or cause to be effected 
any transaction in a security except for bona fide investment purposes. 
Therefore, all securities purchased by a member or employee must be held 
for a minimum of six months. Except, this holding period is not 
applicable to
    (i) Securities sold for less than the purchase price pursuant to a 
stop-loss order entered at the time of purchase and submitted to the 
Office of Personnel with the report of purchase;
    (ii) Money market fund shares; \17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ For purposes of this rule a money market fund is defined as an 
open end investment company whose investment policy calls for investment 
of at least 80% of its assets in debt securities maturing in 13 months 
or less.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Securities purchased by a member or employee prior to entrance 
on duty with the Commission;
    (iv) Debt securities with an initial term of less than six months 
which are held to term;
    (v) Shares of a unit investment trust having a term of less than six 
months; or
    (vi) The transferring of funds within a family of registered 
investment companies.
    (2) For purposes of this provision a family means any two or more 
registered investment companies which share the same investment adviser 
or principal underwriter and hold themselves out to investors as related 
companies for purposes of investment and investor services.
    (c) No member or employee shall effect any purchase or sale of an 
option, future contract, or option on a future contract involving a 
security or group of securities.
    (d) No member or employee shall
    (1) Carry securities on margin;
    (2) Borrow funds or securities, with or without collateral, for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying securities with the proceeds, unless 
the prior approval of the Commission has been secured; or
    (3) Sell a security which he or she does not own, or consummate a 
sale by the delivery of a security borrowed by or for such member's or 
employee's account.
    (e)(1) Except as provided in this paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) 
below, members and employees are prohibited from purchasing or selling 
any security which is the subject of a registration

[[Page 120]]

statement filed under the Security Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.), the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), or a 
letter of notification filed under Regulation A, or any security of the 
same issuer while such a registration statement or letter of 
notification is pending or during the first 60 days after its effective 
date. This prohibition shall not apply to:
    (i) A security which is the subject of a pending registration 
statement filed on Forms S-2, S-3, S-8, F-2, F-3, 8-A, or 8-B; or
    (ii) Offerings, except initial public offerings, of shares by an 
investment company, other than a closed-end investment company, or to 
offerings by a registered separate account (as defined in section 
1(a)(37) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(37)) 
which become effective pursuant to 17 CFR 230.485(b).
    (2) Securities of a unit investment trust whose registration 
statements become effective pursuant to 17 CFR 230.487 may be purchased 
immediately upon effectiveness of the registration statement.
    (3) Securities which are registered for delayed distribution 
pursuant to 17 CFR 230.415 may be purchased 60 days after the 
registration becomes effective. The subsequent filing of a pricing 
amendment or sticker does not revive the prohibition on purchase.
    (f) A member or employee may sell a security which is referred to in 
paragraph (e) of this section only if:
    (1) The member or employee certifies that he or she has no 
information which is not publicly available concerning or relating to 
the issuer; and
    (2) The employee's Division Director, Office Head or Regional 
Administrator certifies that the employee has not participated in the 
registration processing. Members, Division Directors, Office Heads, and 
Regional Administrators are required to submit such certification on 
their own behalf to the Director of the Office of Personnel.
    (g) No member or employee shall purchase any security which to his 
or her knowledge is involved in any pending investigation by the 
Commission, or in any proceeding before the Commission, or to which the 
Commission is a party.
    (h) No member or employee shall purchase any security of any company 
which is in a receivership or bankruptcy proceeding in which the 
Commission has filed a notice of appearance.
    (i) No member or employee shall purchase securities of:
    (1) Any holding company registered under section 5 of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79e), or any subsidiary 
thereof, or
    (2) Any company, if its status under such Act, or the applicability 
of any provision of the Act to it, is known by the employee to be under 
consideration.
    (j) The restrictions imposed in paragraphs (e), (g), (h), and (i) of 
this section do not apply;
    (1) To the exercise of a privilege to convert or exchange 
securities;
    (2) To the exercise of rights accruing unconditionally by virtue of 
ownership of other securities (as distinguished from a contingent right 
to acquire securities not subscribed for by others);
    (3) To the acquisition and exercise of rights in order to round out 
fractional shares;
    (4) To the acceptance of stock dividends on securities already 
owned; to the reinvestment, under a reinvestment program, of cash 
dividends on a security already owned; or the participation in a 
periodic investment plan for the purchase of a security when the 
original purchase was consistent with the provisions of this rule; or
    (5) Investments in funds established pursuant to the Federal 
Employees Retirement System.
    (k) Members and employees holding a Senior Executive Service 
position in the Division of Investment Management or the Office of 
Compliance Inspections and Examinations may make discretionary 
investments in any investment company registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a et seq., provided that the registered 
investment company is diversified pursuant to section 5(b)(1) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1). The Directors of 
the Division of Investment Management and the Office of Compliance 
Inspections and Examinations, in consultation with the Office of the 
General

[[Page 121]]

Counsel, shall determine in writing whether Senior Executive Service 
positions in their respective Division or Office whose duties do not 
include fund matters also may invest in nondiversified registered 
investment companies.
    (l) No member or employee shall have a beneficial interest in any 
broker, dealer or investment adviser through ownership of securities or 
otherwise. However, if a corporation acquires or establishes a 
subsidiary or affiliate subject to regulation by the Commission 
(regulated entity),
    (1) A member or employee may retain his or her existing holdings in 
the corporation, provided the security was originally acquired in 
compliance with the provisions of this rule or prior to entry on duty 
with the Commission.
    (2) Purchases of the corporation's shares will be permitted so long 
as the regulated entity subsidiary or affiliate provides less than 10% 
of the corporation's gross revenue. Except for reinvestment of cash 
dividends, additional purchases are prohibited when the regulated entity 
provides 10% or more of the corporation's gross revenues.
    (3) A member or employee who owns shares in a corporation with a 
regulated entity subsidiary or affiliate is disqualified from 
participating in any matter including rulemaking which affects the 
regulated entity unless the disqualification is waived in accordance 
with the provisions of Rule 6, of this section, 17 CFR 200.735-6, and 18 
U.S.C. 208(b).
    (m)(1) Annually, in accordance with the procedures adopted by the 
Director of Personnel, every member and employee shall furnish the 
Director of Personnel with a complete list of all securities in which he 
or she has an interest. Employees having no interests in securities and 
required to so state.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this 
section, members and employees shall report every acquisition or sale of 
any security within five business days of the transaction date or date 
confirmation is received. (Reports submitted by employees in field 
offices must be placed in the mails within five business days of the 
transaction date or date the confirmation is received for each 
transaction.)
    (3) After the initial purchase of shares in a mutual fund, employees 
shall report holdings in that mutual fund only on the annual statement.
    (4) Changes in holdings, other than by purchase, which do not affect 
disqualification, such as those resulting from the automatic 
reinvestment of dividends, stock splits, stock dividends or 
reclassifications, may be reported on the annual statement rather than 
when notification of the transaction is received. But, the acquisition 
of holdings by, for example, gifts, inheritance or spin-offs, which may 
result in additional disqualifications pursuant to Rule 6 of this 
section, 17 CFR 200.735-6, and 18 U.S.C. 208 shall be reported within 
five days of the receipt of the notice of the change in holdings.
    (n) At the time of taking the oath of office, or prior thereto if 
requested by the Director of Personnel, a new member or employee shall 
provide to the Office of Personnel, as requested, information relating 
to--
    (1) Securities owned by or held for the benefit of him or her, or 
his or her spouse or unemancipated minor child, or a member of his or 
her immediate household, or by any trust or estate of which he or she is 
a trustee or other fiduciary or beneficiary, or by any person for whom 
he or she effects transactions under a power of attorney or otherwise;
    (2) Accounts with securities firms;
    (3) Close relatives (i.e. children, parents, grandparents, siblings, 
aunts, uncles, or like relations of a spouse), who are partners or 
officers of securities firms, investment advisers, or registered public 
utility holding companies or their affiliates;
    (4) The holding of office in or being a director of any company 
which has public security holders; and
    (5) Such other information as may be required by the Director of 
Personnel.

Employees are required to advise the Office of Personnel of changes in 
the foregoing information within ten business days of the time the new 
information is learned.
    (o) Paragraphs (b), (m), and (n) of this section do not apply to 
personal

[[Page 122]]

notes, individual real estate mortgages, securities issued by the U.S. 
Government or its agencies, and securities issued by building and loan 
associations or cooperatives.
    (p) Any member or employee who is a trustee or other fiduciary or a 
beneficiary of a trust or estate holding securities not exempted by 
paragraph (o) of this section, shall report the existence and nature of 
such trust or estate to the Director of Personnel. The transactions of 
such trust or estate, which is not a qualified blind trust, shall be 
subject to all the provisions of this section except if the member or 
employee did not create the trust, is solely a beneficiary, has no power 
to control, and does not in fact control or advise with respect to the 
investments of the trust or estate, unless the Commission shall 
otherwise direct in view of the circumstances of the particular case.
    (q) The Director of Personnel, or his designee, is authorized to 
require the disposition of securities acquired as a result of a 
violation of the provisions of this section, whether unintentional or 
not. Repeated violations shall be reported to the Commission for 
appropriate action.
    (r) Any member or employee who believes that the application of any 
of the provisions of this rule will result in undue hardship in a 
particular case may make a written application to the Commission 
(through the Director of Personnel) setting out, in detail, the reasons 
for that belief and requesting a waiver. However, as a matter of policy 
the Commission favors a strict interpretation of the provisions of this 
rule.

FR 52626, Oct. 10, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-6  Action in case of personal interest.

    Any employee assigned to work on any application, filing or matter 
of a company (a) in which he or she or his or her spouse or his or her 
minor unemancipated child then owns any securities or has a personal 
interest, including a continuing financial interest in a pension or 
retirement plan, shared income, or other arrangement, as a result of any 
current or prior employment or business or professional association; or 
(b) with which he or she has been employed or associated in the past 5 
years; or (c) which was a client of a firm with which he or she had been 
associated, shall immediately advise his or her Division Director or 
other Office Head or Regional Administrator of the fact. Division 
Directors, Office Heads and Regional Administrators are authorized to 
direct the reporting employee to continue with the assignment in 
question where this appears in the interest of the Government, taking 
into account (1) the prohibitions stated in Sec. 200.735-3(b) (7) and 
(8); (2) the general desirability of avoiding situations that require a 
question of conflict of interest to be resolved; (3) the extent to which 
the employee's activities will be supervised; and (4) the difficulty of 
assigning the matter to some other employee. Where the employee in 
question is not relieved of the assignment, his or her written report 
concerning the nature of his or her interest shall be forwarded to the 
Director of Personnel with a notation that he or she has been directed 
to continue the assignment, together with such explanation, if any, as 
may seem appropriate. In the event that a Division Director, Office Head 
or Regional Administrator deems that he or she has, himself or herself, 
such a personal interest in an application, filing or matter of a 
company as may raise a question as to his or her disinterestedness, he 
or she may delegate his or her responsibility with regard thereto to a 
subordinate, but in that event shall submit a brief memorandum of the 
circumstances to the Director of Personnel.<SUP>18
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    18</SUP> 18 U.S.C. 208, provides among other things, that a member 
or employee is prohibited from participating personally and 
substantially in any matter in which to his knowledge, he, his spouse, 
minor child, partner, organization in which he is serving as an officer, 
director, trustee, partner or employee, or any person or organization 
with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning 
prospective employment, has a financial interest. This section (of the 
Criminal Code) does not apply if the employee has received a written 
determination made by an authorized official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
employee's service. Note: Members of the Commission may follow the 
procedural provision contained in Part V, Section 503 of the Executive 
Order 11222.

<R05>
Sec. 200.735-7  Negotiation for employment.

    (a) An employee may not negotiate employment with anyone outside the 
Commission with whom he or she is personally transacting business in any 
matter on behalf of the Commission or the United States, or while he or 
she is immediately or personally engaged in representing the Commission 
in any matter in which the prospective employer is a participant or 
witness or counsel for such a person, whether or not such a person takes 
a substantive position in an adversary proceeding in opposition to the 
Commission's position.
    (b) An employee who wishes to negotiate employment with another 
Government agency at a time when he or she is representing the 
Commission in a particular matter in which the other Government agency 
is taking a position adverse to the Commission should disclose this 
intention to his or her Division Director, Office Head or Regional 
Administrator prior to taking any action.
    (c) No employee shall undertake to act personally on behalf of the 
Commission in any capacity in a matter <SUP>19</SUP> that, to his or her 
knowledge, affects even indirectly any person or organization outside 
the Commission with whom he or she is discussing or entertaining any 
proposal for future employment, except pursuant to the direction of the 
Commission, his or her Division Director, Office Head, or Regional 
Administrator, as provided in Sec. 200.735-6. See footnote 18.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>19</SUP> Employees should bear in mind that in this connection 
the word matter is construed very broadly. See 200.735-8 and footnote 
20, thereto, infra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-8  Practice by former members and employees of the Commission.

    (a)(1) No person shall appear in a representative capacity before 
the Commission in a particular matter if such person, or one 
participating with him or her in the particular matter, participated 
personally and substantially in that matter while he or she was a member 
or employee of the Commission. \20\ As used in this rule, a matter means 
a discrete and isolatable transaction or set of transactions between 
identifiable parties. \21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ As used in this paragraph, a single investigation or formal 
proceeding, or both if they are related, shall be presumed to constitute 
a particular matter for at least 2 years irrespective of changes in the 
issues. However, in cases of proceedings in which the issues change from 
time to time, such as proceedings involving compliance with section 11 
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (15 U.S.C. 79k), this 
paragraph shall not be construed as prohibiting appearance in such a 
proceeding, more than two years after ceasing to be a member or employee 
of the Commission, unless it appears to the Commission that there is 
such an identity of particular issues or pertinent facts as to make it 
likely that confidential information, derived while a member or employee 
of the Commission, would have continuing relevance to the proceeding, so 
as to make participation therein by the former member or employee of the 
Commission unethical or prejudicial to the interests of the Commission.
    \21\ This definition is taken from Formal Opinion 342 of the ABA 
Ethics Committee. The opinion states that ``work as a government 
employee in drafting, enforcing or interpreting government or agency 
procedures, regulations or laws, or in briefing abstract principles of 
law, does not disqualify the lawyer under DR9-101B (which states `a 
lawyer shall not accept private employment in a matter in which he had 
substantial responsibility while he was a public employee') from 
subsequent private employment involving the same regulation procedures, 
or points of law * * *.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) No person who has been a member or employee shall, within 2 
years after his or her employment has ceased, assist, by personal 
presence, a person appearing in a representative capacity before the 
Commission in any matter in which he or she participated personally and 
substantially while a member or employee of the Commission at any time 
within a period of 1 year prior to the termination of such 
responsibility.
    (3) No person who has been a member or an employee shall, within 2 
years after his or her employment has

[[Page 124]]

ceased, appear in a representative capacity before the Commission in any 
matter which was under his or her official responsibility as a member or 
employee of the Commission at any time within a period of 1 year prior 
to the termination of such responsibility. The term official 
responsibility as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202 means the ``direct 
administrative or operating authority, whether intermediate or final, 
and either exercisable alone or with others, and either personally or 
through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct 
Government action.''
    (4) No employee in a position which is designated by the Director of 
the Office of Government Ethics shall, within one year after his or her 
employment has ceased, appear in a representative capacity before the 
Commission or communicate with the Commission or its employees with the 
intent to influence. \22\ This restriction does not apply to members who 
ceased employment before July 1, 1979, or to employees who ceased 
employment prior to February 28, 1980.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ This prohibition appears in the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978. Pub. L. 95-521.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b)(1) Any former member or employee of the Commission who, within 2 
years after ceasing to be such, is employed or retained as the 
representative of any person outside the Government in any matter in 
which it is contemplated that he or she will appear before the 
Commission, or communicate with the Commission or its employees, shall, 
within ten days of such retainer or employment, or of the time when 
appearance before, or communication with the Commission or its employees 
is first contemplated, file with the Secretary of the Commission a 
statement which includes:
    (i) A description of the contemplated representation;
    (ii) An affirmative representation that the former employee while on 
the Commission's staff had neither personal and substantial 
responsibility nor official responsibility for the matter which is the 
subject of the representation; and
    (iii) The name of the Commission Division or Office in which the 
person had been employed.
    (2) Employment of a recurrent character may be covered by a single 
comprehensive statement. Each such statement should include an 
appropriate caption indicating that it is filed pursuant to this 
section. The reporting requirements of this paragraph do not apply to
    (i) Communications incidental to court appearances in litigation 
involving the Commission; and
    (ii) Oral communications concerning ministerial or informational 
matters or requests for oral advice not otherwise prohibited by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) As used in this section, the term appear before the commission 
means physical presence before the Commission or its employees in either 
a formal or informal setting or the conveyance of material in connection 
with a formal appearance or application to the Commission. As used in 
this section the term communication with intent to influence does not 
encompass communications which are not for the purpose of influencing 
the Commission or any of its employees or which, at the time of the 
filings, are reasonably believed not to involve any potential 
controversy. As used in this section, the term representative or 
representative capacity shall include not only the usual type of 
representation by an attorney, etc., but also representation of a 
corporation in the capacity of an officer, director or controlling 
stockholder thereof.
    (d)(1) Partners or associates of any person disqualified from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission in a particular matter by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section are also disqualified. Such partners or 
associates (the firm) may request a waiver of this prohibition from the 
Commission by writing a letter to the General Counsel of the commission 
setting forth the facts of the proposed representation and the 
individual's disqualification. In appropriate situations, a firm may 
request a generic waiver with respect to a number of different matters. 
Upon the advice of the Office of the General Counsel, the Commission, or 
the General Counsel exercising delegated authority, will advise the 
requestor of the Commission's response.

[[Page 125]]

    (2) Waivers ordinarily will be granted where the firm makes a 
satisfactory representation that it has adopted screening measures which 
will effectively isolate the individual lawyer disqualified under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section from participating in the particular 
matter or matters and from sharing in any fees attributable to it. It 
will be considered significant for purposes of this determination that:
    (i) The firm had a pre-existing securities law practice prior to the 
arrival of the disqualified attorney;
    (ii) The matter was previously the subject of consideration by the 
firm or the client was already advised by the firm;
    (iii) In cases where the matter or client became the subject of 
consideration by the firm subsequent to the firm's employment of the 
lawyer individually disqualified, that the matter was not brought to the 
firm because of the disqualified attorney.
    (3) Notwithstanding the existence or non-existence of any of these 
factors, no waiver will be issued if the proposed representation would 
create a significant appearance of impropriety or would otherwise 
adversely affect the interests of the government.<SUP>23</SUP>All 
proceedings with respect to waivers shall be a matter of public record 
except to the extent that such public disclosure might violate attorney-
client privilege or breach the attorney's obligation to preserve the 
confidences and secrets of this or her clients, reveal the existence of 
ongoing private investigations, interfere with law enforcement 
proceedings, or otherwise be inconsistent with the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>23</SUP> For example, no waiver will be granted if, during the 
course of representing a client who has an interest with respect to a 
matter before the Commission, a firm employs, or accepts as a partner, a 
member of the staff or of the Commission who at any time during the 
course of that representation had direct and substantial responsibility 
for the same matter, and whose departure would result in a significant 
adverse impact upon that matter at the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Persons in doubt as to the applicability of any portion of this 
section may apply for an advisory ruling of the Commission.<SUP>24

Sec. 200.735-9  Indebtedness.

    (a) The Securities and Exchange Commission considers the 
indebtedness of its members and employees to be essentially a matter of 
their own concern and will not be placed in the position of acting as a 
collection agency or of determining the validity or amount of contested 
debts. Nevertheless, failure on the part of an employee without good 
reason and in a proper and timely manner to honor debts acknowledged by 
him or her to be valid, or reduced to judgment by a court, or to make or 
to adhere to satisfactory arrangements for the settlement thereof, may 
be a cause for disciplinary action. In this connection each member and 
employee is expected to meet his or her responsibilities for payment of 
Federal, State and local taxes. For purposes of this section, in a 
proper and timely manner means in a manner which the agency determines 
does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government 
as his or her employer.
    (b) Compensation due members and employees is subject to garnishment 
for child support and alimony obligations. (42 U.S.C. 659).

shall examine the statements of employment and financial interests filed 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to determine whether conflicts 
of interest or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of employees 
exist. An employee shall be afforded the opportunity to explain any 
conflict or appearance of conflict. When the Director or Assistant 
Director of Personnel, in consultation with appropriate superiors of the 
employee involved, is unable to resolve a conflict or appearance of 
conflict, he or she shall report the matter to the Commission through 
the Counselor for the Commission designated under Sec. 200.735-15(a).

the statement of employment and financial interests and supplementary 
statements required of employees are in addition to, and not in 
substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement imposed 
by law, order or regulation. The submission of a statement by an 
employee does not permit him or her or any other person to participate 
in a matter in which his or her or the other person's participation is 
prohibited by law, order or regulation.
    (l) An employee has the right to ask for a review through the 
Commission's grievance procedure outlined in section 771, Part II, 
Manual of Administrative Regulations, of a complaint that his or her 
position has been improperly included under the provisions of this 
section as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment and 
financial interests.

Sec. 200.735-12  Special Government employees.

    (a) Special Government employee means a person defined in section 18 
U.S.C. 202 as a special Government employee. All of the provisions of 
this Conduct Regulation are applicable to special Government employees, 
except that in specific appropriate cases the Commission may exempt such 
employees from, or modify the applicability of, any portion of any 
provision of the Conduct Regulation.
    (b) In no event will the Commission waive a provision of the Conduct 
Regulation which would permit a special Government employee to:
    (1) Use his or her Government employment for a purpose that is, or 
gives the appearance of being, motivated by the desire for private gain 
for himself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has 
family, business, or financial ties.
    (2) Use inside information obtained as a result of his or her 
Government employment for private gain for himself or herself or another 
person either by direct action on his or her part or by counsel, 
recommendation, or suggestion to another person, particularly one with 
whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties. For purposes of 
this paragraph, inside information means information obtained under 
Government authority which has not become part of the body of public 
information.
    (3) Use his or her Government employment to coerce, or give the 
appearance of coercing, a person to provide financial benefit to himself 
or herself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has 
family, business, or financial ties.
    (4) Receive or solicit from a person having business with the 
Commission anything of value as a gift, gratuity, loan, entertainment, 
or favor for himself or herself or another person, particularly one with 
whom he or she has family, business or financial ties.
    (c) Prior to entrance on duty, each special Government employee 
shall submit to the Director of Personnel a statement of employment and 
financial interests which contains such information as the Director of 
Personnel determines is relevant in the light of the duties the special 
Government employee is to perform and, if appropriate, the financial 
disclosure report as provided by title II of the Ethics in Government 
Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-521. It shall be kept current throughout the 
period of

[[Page 129]]

employment by the filing of supplementary statements in accordance with 
the requirements of Sec. 200.735-11(d). Statements shall be on the 
official form made available for this purpose through the Office of 
Personnel.
    (d) The Commission may waive the requirement of paragraph (c) of 
this section in the case of a special Government employee who is not a 
consultant or an expert, as those terms are defined in chapter 304 of 
the Federal Personnel Manual (5 CFR 735.304), if the duties of the 
position are determined to be at a level of responsibility which does 
not require the submission of such statement to protect the integrity of 
the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 200.735-13  Disciplinary and other remedial action.

    (a) Knowing participation in a violation of this subpart by persons 
not within the scope of the foregoing rules in this subpart shall 
likewise be deemed improper conduct and in contravention of Commission 
rules. Departure from any of the rules in this subpart by employees or 
special Government employees without specific approval may be cause for 
appropriate remedial and/or disciplinary action or, in the case of 
former members, employees, and special Government employees, for 
disqualification from appearing and practicing before the Commission, 
which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.
    (b) When there has been a departure from any of the rules of this 
subpart without specific approval or when a conflict of interest or an 
apparent conflict of interest on the part of an employee or special 
Government employee arises, the Director of Personnel may order 
immediate action to end such conflict or appearance of conflict of 
interest. Remedial action may include, but is not limited to (1) changes 
in assigned duties; (2) divestment by the employee or special Government 
employee of his conflicting interest; (3) disciplinary action; or (4) 
disqualification for a particular assignment. Remedial action, whether 
disciplinary or otherwise, shall be effected in accordance with any 
applicable laws, Executive Orders, and regulations. The Director of 
Personnel may refer any recommended action to the Commission. The 
employee may obtain review by the Commission of any action ordered to be 
taken by the Director of Personnel. During the period of review, unless 
otherwise directed by the Commission, the action ordered by the Director 
of Personnel is stayed.
    (c) Former members or employees who violate the post-employment 
restriction provisions of 18 U.S.C. 207(a), (b) or (c), which parallel 
the provisions of Rule 8(a), supra, will be subject to an administrative 
enforcement proceeding as set forth in Rule 102(e) of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice, Sec. 201.102(e) of this chapter, except that, when 
proceedings are brought to determine if violations of post-employment 
restrictions have occurred, denial of the privilege of appearing and 
practicing before the Commission will be based on a finding of violation 
of the provisions of Rule 8(a) and 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) and (c). 
Procedures applicable to such administrative proceedings are to be found 
in the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.100 et seq.

of the law will be brought to the attention of appropriate persons.
    (e) The Director of Personnel shall furnish a copy of this Conduct 
Regulation (subpart M) to each member, employee and special Government

Sec. 200.800  OMB control numbers assigned pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

    (a) Purpose. This subpart collects and displays the control numbers 
and expiration dates assigned to information collection requirements of 
the Commission by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511. The Commission intends 
that this subpart comply with the requirements of section 3507(f) of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires that agencies display a current 
control number assigned by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each agency information collection requirement. In 
particular, this subpart displays current OMB control numbers and 
expiration dates of those information collection requirements of the 
Commission which are rules and regulations and codified in 17 CFR either 
in full text or incorporated by reference with the approval of the 
Director of the Office of the Federal Register. Where the information 
collection requirement also exists as a separate document, as, for 
example, an information collection requirement which the Commission 
incorporates by reference in 17 CFR, the Commission, of course, will 
display on the separate document as well the current OMB control number 
and the expiration date as required by section 3507(f). Henceforth, the 
Commission will publish in the Federal Register only additions, 
deletions and corrections to particular control numbers and expiration 
dates contained in this subpart.
    (b) Display.

  Subpart B--Regulations Pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act

    Authority: 15 U.S.C. 77s, 78w, 78x, 79t, 77sss, 80a-37 and 80b-11; 5 
U.S.C. 504(c)(1).

    Source: 47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 201.31  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the Act in 
this subpart B), provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the 
Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over 
the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially 
justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in 
this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the 
proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, 
and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use in ruling 
on those applications.

[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]

[[Page 137]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.32  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to adversary adjudications described in Sec. 201.33 
pending or commenced before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985. 
It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after 
October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided 
that an application for fees and expenses, as described in these rules, 
has been filed with the Commission within 30 days after August 5, 1985. 
Proceedings which have been substantially concluded are not deemed 
pending under these rules although officially pending for purposes such 
as concluding remedial actions found in Commission orders or private 
undertakings.

[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.33  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Commission. These are on the record adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in 
which the position of an Office or Division of the Commission as a 
party, not including amicus participation, is presented by an attorney 
or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceeding. See appendix, 17 CFR 201.60.
    (b) The fact that the Commission has not identified a type of 
proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of 
an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the 
Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for 
resolution in proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.34  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks it seeks an award. The term party is 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all 
conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local 
government, or public or private organization with a new worth of not 
more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an individual rather than a sole owner of an 
unincorporated business if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
subpart, unless the administrative law judge determines

[[Page 138]]

that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the 
Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. 
In addition, the administrative law judge may determine that financial 
relationships of the applicant other than those described in this 
paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award 
unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.35  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or in a significant 
and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position 
of the Office or Division over which the applicant has prevailed was 
substantially justified. The position of the Office or Division 
includes, in addition to the position taken by the Office or Division in 
the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Office 
or Division upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden 
of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing 
applicant is on counsel for an Office or Division of the Commission, 
which must show that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.36  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Subject to the limitation of paragraph (b), awards will be based 
on rates customarily charged, in the locale of the hearing, by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award of the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the reasonable rate at which the Commission pays witnesses with 
similar expertise. However, an award may also include the reasonable 
expenses of the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the 
attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for 
such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.37  Delegations of authority.

    (a) The Commission may by order delegate authority to take final 
action on matters pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act in 
particular cases.
    (b) Unless the Commission shall order otherwise, applications for 
awards of fees and expenses made pursuant to this subject shall be 
assigned by the Chief Administrative Law Judge to an administrative law 
judge for determination.

[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]

[[Page 139]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.41  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant, the proceeding for which an award is 
sought and contain the information required in this subpart. The 
application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and specify the 
position(s) of the opposing Office or Division in the proceeding that 
the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the 
applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number 
of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose 
of its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and 
in what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.42  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 201.34(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The 
administrative law judge or the Commission may require an applicant to 
file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that exhibit in accordance with 17 CFR 201.190.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 60 FR 32795, June 23, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 201.43  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The applicant may be required to provide 
vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses 
claimed.

[[Page 140]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.44  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the 
Commission's final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on 
which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or 
any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or 
voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the 
Commission and to the courts.
    (c) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.

[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53052, Dec. 27, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 201.51  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other document related to an 
application shall be filed and served in the same manner as other papers 
in proceedings under the Commission's Rules of Practice. In addition, a 
copy of each application for fees and expenses shall be served on the 
General Counsel of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.52  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the Office or Division of the Commission may file an answer 
to the application. Unless the Office or Division of the Commission 
counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of 
intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file 
an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the 
award requested.
    (b) If counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission and the 
applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, 
they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a 
settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for 
filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may 
be granted upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain any objections to the award requested 
and identify the facts relied on in support of that position. If the 
answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the 
proceeding, it shall include supporting affidavits or a request for 
further proceedings under Sec. 201.55.


<R05>
Sec. 201.53  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 201.55.


<R05>
Sec. 201.54  Settlement.

    The applicant and counsel for the Office or Division of the 
Commission may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final 
action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the 
underlying proceeding or after the underlying proceeding has been 
concluded, in accordance with the Commission's standard settlement 
procedure. See 17 CFR 201.240. If a prevailing party and counsel for the 
Office or Division of the Commission agree on a proposed settlement of 
an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be 
filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement provides 
that each side shall bear its own expenses, and the settlement is 
accepted, no application may be filed.

[54 FR 53052, Dec. 27, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 32795, June 23, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 201.55  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission, or on his or 
her own initiative, the administrative law judge may order further 
proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional 
written submissions or, as

to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's 
eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses) an evidentiary 
hearing. The administrative law judge may order all proceedings that are 
otherwise available under Rule 8(d) of the Commission's Rules of 
Practice. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for 
full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and 
shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the 
Commission's position was substantially justified shall be determined on 
the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the 
adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.
    (b) A request for further proceedings under this section shall 
specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and 
shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve 
the issues.

Sec. 201.56  Decision.

    The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the 
application promptly after completion of proceedings on the application. 
The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the 
applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at 
issue, findings on whether the Commission's position was substantially 
justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or 
whether special circumstances make an award unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 201.57  Commission review.

    In accordance with the procedures set forth in 17 CFR 201.410 and 
201.411, either the applicant or counsel for the Office or Division of 
the Commission may seek review of the initial decision on the fee 
application, or the Commission may decide to review the decision on its 
own initiative. If neither the applicant nor counsel for the Division or 
Office of the Commission seeks review and the Commission does not take 
review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application 
shall become a final decision of the Commission 30 days after it is 
issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion 
of the Commission. If review is taken, the Commission will issue a final 
decision on the application or remand the application to the 
administrative law judge for further proceedings.

will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. The 
Commission will pay the amount awarded to the applicant as authorized by 
law, unless judicial review of the award has been sought by the

first makes any filing or otherwise appears on his or her own behalf 
before the Commission or a hearing officer in a proceeding as defined in

Commission or the hearing officer. A motion seeking leave to withdraw

    (e) Suspension and disbarment. (1) Generally. The Commission may 
censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found 
by the Commission after notice and opportunity for hearing in the 
matter:
    (i) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; 
or
    (ii) To be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in 
unethical or improper professional conduct; or
    (iii) To have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the 
violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules 
and regulations thereunder.
    (iv) With respect to persons licensed to practice as accountants, 
``improper professional conduct'' under Sec. 201.102(e)(1)(ii) means:
    (A) Intentional or knowing conduct, including reckless conduct, that 
results in a violation of applicable professional standards; or (B) 
Either of the following two types of negligent conduct:
    (1) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in 
a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in 
which an accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is 
warranted.
    (2) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a 
violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of 
competence to practice before the Commission.
    (2) Certain professionals and convicted persons. Any attorney who 
has been suspended or disbarred by a court of the United States or of 
any State; or any person whose license to practice as an accountant, 
engineer, or other professional or expert has been revoked or suspended 
in any State; or any person who has been convicted of a felony or a 
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission. A disbarment, suspension, 
revocation or conviction within the meaning of this section shall be 
deemed to have occurred when the disbarring, suspending, revoking or 
convicting agency or tribunal enters its

[[Page 145]]

judgment or order, including a judgment or order on a plea of nolo 
contendere, regardless of whether an appeal of such judgment or order is 
pending or could be taken.
    (3) Temporary suspensions. An order of temporary suspension shall 
become effective upon service on the respondent. No order of temporary 
suspension shall be entered by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this section more than 90 days after the date on which the 
final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative 
proceeding described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (e)(3)(i)(B) of this 
section has become effective, whether upon completion of review or 
appeal procedures or because further review or appeal procedures are no 
longer available.
    (i) The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and 
without preliminary hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend from 
appearing or practicing before it any attorney, accountant, engineer, or 
other professional or expert who has been by name:
    (A) Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by 
reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, 
from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of 
the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder; 
or
    (B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action 
brought by the Commission to which he or she is a party or found by the 
Commission in any administrative proceeding to which he or she is a 
party to have violated (unless the violation was found not to have been 
willful) or aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the 
Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing 
before the Commission in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this 
section may, within 30 days after service upon him or her of the order 
of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary 
suspension. If no petition has been received by the Commission within 30 
days after service of the order, the suspension shall become permanent.
    (iii) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the Commission shall either 
lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing at a 
time and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after 
opportunity for hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the 
petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a 
period of time or permanently. In every case in which the temporary 
suspension has not been lifted, every hearing held and other action 
taken pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) shall be expedited in accordance 
with Sec. 201.500. If the hearing is held before a hearing officer, the 
time limits set forth in Sec. 201.531 will govern review of the hearing 
officer's initial decision.
    (iv) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the staff of the Commission shall 
show either that the petitioner has been enjoined as described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section or that the petitioner has been 
found to have committed or aided and abetted violations as described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section and that showing, without more, 
may be the basis for censure or disqualification. Once that showing has 
been made, the burden shall be upon the petitioner to show cause why he 
or she should not be censured or temporarily or permanently disqualified 
from appearing and practicing before the Commission. In any such 
hearing, the petitioner may not contest any finding made against him or 
her or fact admitted by him or her in the judicial or administrative 
proceeding upon which the proceeding under this paragraph (e)(3) is 
predicated. A person who has consented to the entry of a permanent 
injunction as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section 
without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint shall be presumed 
for all purposes under this paragraph (e)(3) to have been enjoined by 
reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.
    (4) Filing of prior orders. Any person appearing or practicing 
before the Commission who has been the subject of an order, judgment, 
decree, or finding as set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of

[[Page 146]]

this section shall promptly file with the Secretary a copy thereof 
(together with any related opinion or statement of the agency or 
tribunal involved). Failure to file any such paper, order, judgment, 
decree or finding shall not impair the operation of any other provision 
of this section.
    (5) Reinstatement. (i) An application for reinstatement of a person 
permanently suspended or disqualified under paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(3) 
of this section may be made at any time, and the applicant may, in the 
Commission's discretion, be afforded a hearing; however, the suspension 
or disqualification shall continue unless and until the applicant has 
been reinstated by the Commission for good cause shown.
    (ii) Any person suspended under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall be reinstated by the Commission, upon appropriate application, if 
all the grounds for application of the provisions of that paragraph are 
subsequently removed by a reversal of the conviction or termination of 
the suspension, disbarment, or revocation. An application for 
reinstatement on any other grounds by any person suspended under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section may be filed at any time and the 
applicant shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing in the matter; 
however, such suspension shall continue unless and until the applicant 
has been reinstated by order of the Commission for good cause shown.
    (6) Other proceedings not precluded. A proceeding brought under 
paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section shall not preclude 
another proceeding brought under these same paragraphs.
    (7) Public hearings. All hearings held under this paragraph (e) 
shall be public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission on its own 
motion or after considering the motion of a party.
    (f) Practice defined. For the purposes of these Rules of Practice, 
practicing before the Commission shall include, but shall not be limited 
to:
    (1) Transacting any business with the Commission; and
    (2) The preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by any 
attorney, accountant, engineer or other professional or expert, filed 
with the Commission in any registration statement, notification, 
application, report or other document with the consent of such attorney, 
accountant, engineer or other professional or expert.

    (a) Service of an order instituting proceedings. (1) By whom made. 
The Secretary, or another duly authorized officer of the Commission,

instituting proceedings by first class mail or other reliable means if a 
waiver of service is obtained from the party and placed in the record.

Sec. 201.151  Filing of papers with the Commission: Procedure.

    (a) When to file. All papers required to be served by a party upon 
any person shall be filed with the Commission at the time of service or 
promptly thereafter. Papers required to be filed with

[[Page 150]]

the Commission must be received within the time limit, if any, for such 
filing.
    (b) Where to file. Filing of papers with the Commission shall be 
made by filing them with the Secretary. When a proceeding is assigned to 
a hearing officer, a person making a filing with the Secretary shall 
promptly provide to the hearing officer a copy of any such filing, 
provided, however, that the hearing officer may direct or permit filings 
to be made with him or her, in which event the hearing officer shall 
note thereon the filing date and promptly provide the Secretary with 
either the original or a copy of any such filings.
    (c) To whom to direct the filing. Unless otherwise provided, where 
the Commission has assigned a case to a hearing officer, all motions, 
objections, applications or other filings made during a proceeding prior 
to the filing of an initial decision therein, or, if no initial decision 
is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the filing of briefs with 
the Commission, shall be directed to and decided by the hearing officer.
    (d) Certificate of service. Papers filed with the Commission or a 
hearing officer shall be accompanied by a certificate stating the name 
of the person or persons served, the date of service, the method of 
service and the mailing address or facsimile telephone number to which 
service was made, if not made in person. If the method of service to any 
party is different from the method of service to any other party or the 
method for filing with the Commission, the certificate shall state why a 
different means of service was used.

otherwise reproduced by a process that produces permanent and plainly 
legible copies;
    (3) Include at the head of the paper, or on a title page, the name

Sec. 201.153  Filing of papers: Signature requirement and effect.

    (a) General requirements. Following the issuance of an order 
instituting proceedings, every filing of a party represented by counsel 
shall be signed by at least one counsel of record in his or her name and

party who acts as his or her own counsel shall sign his or her 
individual name and state his or her address and telephone number on 
every filing.
    (b) Effect of signature. (1) The signature of a counsel or party 
shall constitute a certification that:
    (i) the person signing the filing has read the filing;

[[Page 151]]

    (ii) to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief, 
formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing is well grounded in fact and 
is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, 
modification, or reversal of existing law; and
    (iii) the filing is not made for any improper purpose, such as to 
harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of 
adjudication.
    (2) If a filing is not signed, the hearing officer or the Commission 
shall strike the filing, unless it is signed promptly after the omission 
is called to the attention of the person making the filing.


<R05>
Sec. 201.154  Motions.

    (a) Generally. Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion 
shall be in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds 
therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be 
accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied 
upon. All written motions shall be served in accordance with 
Sec. 201.150, be filed in accordance with Sec. 201.151, meet the 
requirements of Sec. 201.152, and be signed in accordance with 
Sec. 201.153. The Commission or the hearing officer may order that an 
oral motion be submitted in writing. Unless otherwise ordered by the 
Commission or the hearing officer, if a motion is properly made to the 
Commission concerning a proceeding to which a hearing officer is 
assigned, the proceeding before the hearing officer shall continue 
pending the determination of the motion by the Commission. No oral 
argument shall be heard on any motion unless the Commission or the 
hearing officer otherwise directs.
    (b) Opposing and reply briefs. Except as provided in Sec. 201.401, 
briefs in opposition to a motion shall be filed within five days after 
service of the motion. Reply briefs shall be filed within three days 
after service of the opposition.

motion shall not exceed 10 pages, exclusive of pages containing any 
table of contents, table of authorities, and/or addendum. Requests for 
leave to file briefs in excess of 10 pages are disfavored.


<R05>
Sec. 201.155  Default; motion to set aside default.

    (a) A party to a proceeding may be deemed to be in default and the 
Commission or the hearing officer may determine the proceeding against 
that party upon consideration of the record, including the order 
instituting proceedings, the allegations of which may be deemed to be 
true, if that party fails:
    (1) To appear, in person or through a representative, at a hearing 
or conference of which that party has been notified;
    (2) To answer, to respond to a dispositive motion within the time 
provided, or otherwise to defend the proceeding; or
    (3) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
commission or the hearing officer pursuant to Sec. 201.180(b).
    (b) A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a 
reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, 
and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In 
order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, 
the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of the initial 
decision, or the Commission, at any time, may for good cause shown set 
aside a default.


<R05>
Sec. 201.160  Time computation.

    (a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed in or 
allowed by these Rules of Practice or by order of the Commission, the 
day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of 
time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so 
computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal 
legal holiday (as defined in Sec. 201.104), in which event the period 
runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or 
Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal 
legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation when the period of 
time prescribed or allowed is seven days or less, not including any 
additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this 
section. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather or other 
conditions have

[[Page 152]]

caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing location to 
close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of the next day 
that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.
    (b) Additional time for service by mail. If service is made by mail, 
three days shall be added to the prescribed period for response.


<R05>
Sec. 201.161  Extensions of time, postponements and adjournments.

    (a) Availability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
Commission, at any time, or the hearing officer, at any time prior to 
the filing of his or her initial decision or, if no initial decision is 
to be filed, at any time prior to the closing of the record, may, for 
good cause shown, extend or shorten any time limits prescribed by these 
Rules of Practice for the filing of any papers and may, consistent with 
paragraph (b) of this section, postpone or adjourn any hearing.
    (b) Limitations on postponements, adjournments and extensions. A 
hearing shall begin at the time and place ordered, provided that, within 
the limits provided by statute, the Commission or the hearing officer 
may for good cause shown postpone the commencement of the hearing or 
adjourn a convened hearing for a reasonable period of time or change the 
place of hearing.
    (1) Additional considerations. In considering a motion for 
postponement of the start of a hearing, adjournment once a hearing has 
begun, or extensions of time for filing papers, the hearing officer or 
the Commission shall consider, in addition to any other factors:
    (i) The length of the proceeding to date;
    (ii) The number of postponements, adjournments or extensions already 
granted;
    (iii) The stage of the proceedings at the time of the request; and
    (iv) Any other such matters as justice may require.
    (2) Time limit. Postponements, adjournments or extensions of time 
for filing papers shall not exceed 21 days unless the Commission or the 
hearing officer states on the record or sets forth in a written order 
the reasons why a longer period of time is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 201.180  Sanctions.

    (a) Contemptuous conduct--(1) Subject to exclusion or suspension. 
Contemptuous conduct by any person before the Commission or a hearing 
officer during any proceeding, including any conference, shall be 
grounds for the Commission or the hearing officer to:
    (i) Exclude that person from such hearing or conference, or any 
portion thereof; and/or
    (ii) Summarily suspend that person from representing others in the 
proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the duration, or any 
portion, of the proceeding.
    (2) Review procedure. A person excluded from a hearing or 
conference, or a counsel summarily suspended from practice for the 
duration or any portion of a proceeding, may seek review of the 
exclusion or suspension by filing with the Commission, within three days 
of the exclusion or suspension order, a motion to vacate the order. The 
Commission shall consider such motion on an expedited basis as provided 
in Sec. 201.500.
    (3) Adjournment. Upon motion by a party represented by counsel 
subject to an order of exclusion or suspension, an adjournment shall be 
granted to allow the retention of new counsel. In determining the length 
of an adjournment, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider, in 
addition to the factors set forth in Sec. 201.161, the availability of 
co-counsel for the party or of other members of a suspended counsel's 
firm.
    (b) Deficient filings; leave to cure deficiencies. The Commission or 
the hearing officer may reject, in whole or in part, any filing that 
fails to comply with any requirements of these Rules of Practice or of 
any order issued in the proceeding in which the filing was made. Any 
such filings shall not be part of the record. The Commission or the 
hearing officer may direct a party to cure any deficiencies and to 
resubmit the filing within a fixed time period.
    (c) Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing. The 
Commission or the hearing officer may enter a default pursuant to 
Sec. 201.155, dismiss the case,

[[Page 153]]

decide the particular matter at issue against that person, or prohibit 
the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that matter 
if a person fails:
    (1) To make a filing required under these Rules of Practice; or
    (2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the 
Commission or the hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 201.190  Confidential treatment of information in certain filings.

    (a) Application. An application for confidential treatment pursuant 
to the provisions of Clause 30 of Schedule A of the Securities Act of

shall be accompanied by a sealed copy of the materials as to which 
confidential treatment is sought.
    (b) Procedure for supplying additional information. The applicant 
may be required to furnish in writing additional information with 
respect to the grounds for objection to public disclosure. Failure to 
supply the information so requested within 14 days from the date of 
receipt by the applicant of a notice of the information required shall 
be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion 
of the information to which the additional information relates, unless 
the Commission or the hearing officer shall otherwise order for good 
cause shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.
    (c) Confidentiality of materials pending final decision. Pending the 
determination of the application for confidential treatment, 
transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and 
other materials in connection with the application shall be placed under 
seal; shall be for the confidential use only of the hearing officer, the 
Commission, the applicant, and any other parties and counsel; and shall 
be made available to the public only in accordance with orders of the 
Commission.
    (d) Public availability of orders. Any final order of the Commission 
denying or sustaining an application for confidential treatment shall be

<R05>
Sec. 201.191  Adjudications not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.

    (a) Scope of the rule. This rule applies to every case of 
adjudication, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, pursuant to any statute which 
the Commission administers, where adjudication is not required to be 
determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing and 
which the Commission has not chosen to determine on the record after 
notice and opportunity for hearing.
    (b) Procedure. In every case of adjudication under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Commission shall give prompt notice of any adverse 
action or final disposition to any person who has requested the 
Commission to make (or not to make) any such adjudication, and furnish 
to any such person a written statement of reasons therefor. Additional 
procedures may be specified in rules relating to specific types of such 
adjudications. Where any such rule provides for the publication of a 
Commission order, notice of the action or disposition shall be deemed to 
be given by such publication.
    (c) Contents of the record. If the Commission provides notice and 
opportunity for the submission of written comments by parties to the 
adjudication or, as the case may be, by other interested persons, 
written comments received on or before the closing date for comments, 
unless accorded confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of 
the Commission, become a part of the record of the adjudication. The 
Commission, in its discretion, may

[[Page 154]]

accept and include in the record written comments filed with the 
Commission after the closing date.


<R05>
Sec. 201.192  Rulemaking: Issuance, amendment and repeal of rules of general application.

    (a) By petition. Any person desiring the issuance, amendment or 
repeal of a rule of general application may file a petition therefor 
with the Secretary. Such petition shall include a statement setting 
forth the text or the substance of any proposed rule or amendment 
desired or specifying the rule the repeal of which is desired, and 
stating the nature of his or her interest and his or her reasons for 
seeking the issuance, amendment or repeal of the rule. The Secretary 
shall acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the petition and refer it to 
the appropriate division or office for consideration and recommendation. 
Such recommendations shall be transmitted with the petition to the 
Commission for such action as the Commission deems appropriate. The 
Secretary shall notify the petitioner of the action taken by the 
Commission.
    (b) Notice of proposed issuance, amendment or repeal of rules. 
Except where the Commission finds that notice and public procedure are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, whenever 
the Commission proposes to issue, amend, or repeal any rule or 
regulation of general application other than an interpretive rule; 
general statement of policy; or rule of agency organization, procedure, 
or practice; or any matter relating to agency management or personnel or 
to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts, there shall 
first be published in the Federal Register a notice of the proposed 
action. Such notice shall include:
    (1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the rulemaking 
proceeding, with particular reference to the manner in which interested 
persons shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in such 
proceeding;
    (2) Reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and
    (3) The terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of 
the subjects and issues involved.


<R05>
Sec. 201.193  Applications by barred individuals for consent to associate.

                            Preliminary note

    This rule governs applications to the Commission by certain persons, 
barred by Commission order from association with brokers, dealers, 
municipal securities dealers, government securities brokers, government 
securities dealers, investment advisers, investment companies or 
transfer agents, for consent to become so associated. Applications made 
pursuant to this section must show that the proposed association would 
be consistent with the public interest. In addition to the information 
specifically required by the rule, applications should be supplemented, 
where appropriate, by written statements of individuals (other than the 
applicant) who are competent to attest to the applicant's character, 
employment performance, and other relevant information. Intentional 
misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 
18 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. and other provisions of law.
    The nature of the supervision that an applicant will receive or 
exercise as an associated person with a registered entity is an 
important matter bearing upon the public interest. In meeting the burden 
of showing that the proposed association is consistent with the public 
interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate 
that the proposed supervision, procedures, or terms and conditions of 
employment are reasonably designed to prevent a recurrence of the 
conduct that led to imposition of the bar. As an associated person, the 
applicant will be limited to association in a specified capacity with a 
particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms 
and conditions.
    Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that the proposed 
association is consistent with the public interest will be difficult to 
meet where the applicant is to be supervised by, or is to supervise, 
another barred individual. In addition, where an applicant wishes to 
become the sole proprietor of a registered entity and thus is seeking 
Commission consent notwithstanding an absence of supervision, the 
applicant's burden will be difficult to meet.
    In addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the Commission will consider the nature of the findings that 
resulted in the bar when making its determination as to whether the 
proposed association is consistent with the public interest. In this 
regard, attention is directed to Rule 5(e) of the Commission's Rules on 
Informal and Other Procedures, 17 CFR 202.5(e). Among other things, Rule 
5(e) sets forth the Commission's policy ``not to permit a * * * 
respondent [in an administrative proceeding] to consent to * * * [an] 
order that imposes a

[[Page 155]]

sanction while denying the allegations in the * * * order for 
proceedings.'' Consistent with the rationale underlying that policy, and 
in order to avoid the appearance that an application made pursuant to 
this section was granted on the basis of such denial, the Commission 
will not consider any application that attempts to reargue or 
collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the Commission's bar 
order.

    (a) Scope of rule. Applications for Commission consent to associate, 
or to change the terms and conditions of association, with a registered 
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities 
broker, government securities dealer, investment adviser, investment 
company or transfer agent may be made pursuant to this section where a 
Commission order bars the individual from association with a registered 
entity and:
    (1) Such barred individual seeks to become associated with an entity

             Initiation of Proceedings and Prehearing Rules


<R05>
Sec. 201.200  Initiation of proceedings.

    (a) Order instituting proceedings: Notice and opportunity for 
hearing. (1) Generally. Whenever an order instituting proceedings is 
issued by the Commission, appropriate notice thereof shall be given to 
each party to the proceeding by the Secretary or another duly designated 
officer of the Commission. Each party shall be given notice of any 
hearing within a time reasonable in light of the circumstances, in 
advance of the hearing; provided, however, no prior notice need be given 
to a respondent if the Commission has authorized the Division of 
Enforcement to seek a temporary sanction ex parte.
    (2) Stop order proceedings: Additional persons entitled to notice. 
Any notice of a proceeding relating to the issuance of a stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement pursuant to 
Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(d), shall be 
sent to or served on the issuer; or, in the case of a foreign government 
or political subdivision thereof, sent to or served on the underwriter; 
or, in the case of a foreign or territorial person, sent to or served on 
its duly authorized representative in the United States named in the 
registration statement, properly directed in the case of telegraphic 
notice to the address given in such statement. In addition, if such 
proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the registration statement 
has become effective, notice of the proceeding shall be given to the 
agent for service named on the facing sheet of the registration 
statement and to each other person designated on the facing sheet of the 
registration statement as a person to whom copies of communications to 
such agent are to be sent.
    (b) Content of order. The order instituting proceedings shall:
    (1) State the nature of any hearing;
    (2) State the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the 
hearing is to be held;
    (3) Contain a short and plain statement of the matters of fact and 
law to be considered and determined, unless the order directs an answer 
pursuant to Sec. 201.220 in which case the order shall set forth the 
factual and legal basis alleged therefor in such detail as will permit a 
specific response thereto; and
    (4) State the nature of any relief or action sought or taken.
    (c) Time and place of hearing. The time and place for any hearing 
shall be fixed with due regard for the public interest and the 
convenience and necessity of the parties, other participants, or their 
representatives.
    (d) Amendment to order instituting proceedings. (1) By the 
Commission. Upon motion by a party, the Commission may, at any time, 
amend an order instituting proceedings to include new matters of fact or 
law.
    (2) By the hearing officer. Upon motion by a party, the hearing 
officer may, at any time prior to the filing of an initial decision or, 
if no initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the 
filing of final briefs with the Commission, amend an order instituting 
proceedings to include new matters of fact or law that are within the 
scope of the original order instituting proceedings.
    (e) Publication of notice of public hearings. Unless otherwise 
ordered by the Commission, notice of any public hearing shall be given 
general circulation by release to the public, by publication in the SEC 
News Digest and, where directed, by publication in the Federal Register.

[[Page 157]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.201  Consolidation of proceedings.

    By order of the Commission or a hearing officer, proceedings 
involving a common question of law or fact may be consolidated for 
hearing of any or all the matters at issue in such proceedings. The 
Commission or the hearing officer may make such orders concerning the 
conduct of such proceedings as it deems appropriate to avoid unnecessary 
cost or delay. Consolidation shall not prejudice any rights under these 
Rules of Practice and shall not affect the right of any party to raise 
issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not occurred. 
For purposes of this section, no distinction is made between joinder and 
consolidation of proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 201.202  Specification of procedures by parties in certain proceedings.

    (a) Motion to specify procedures. In any proceeding other than an 
enforcement or disciplinary proceeding or a proceeding to review a 
determination by a self-regulatory organization pursuant to 
Secs. 201.420 and 201.421, a party may, at any time up to 20 days prior 
to the start of a hearing, make a motion to specify the procedures 
necessary or appropriate for the proceeding, with particular reference 
to:
    (1) Whether there should be an initial decision by a hearing 
officer;
    (2) Whether any interested division of the Commission may assist in 
the preparation of the Commission's decision; and
    (3) Whether there should be a 30-day waiting period between the 
issuance of the Commission's order and the date it is to become 
effective.
    (b) Objections; effect of failure to object. Any other party may 
object to the procedures so specified, and such party may specify such 
additional procedures as it considers necessary or appropriate. In the 
absence of such objection or such specification of additional 
procedures, such other party may be deemed to have waived objection to 
the specified procedures.
    (c) Approval required. Any proposal pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, even if not objected to by any party, shall be subject to 
the written approval of the hearing officer.
    (d) Procedure upon agreement to waive an initial decision. If an 
initial decision is waived pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
the hearing officer shall notify the Secretary and, unless the 
Commission directs otherwise within 14 days, no initial decision shall 
be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 201.210  Parties, limited participants and amici curiae.

    (a) Parties in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding or a 
proceeding to review a self-regulatory organization determination-- (1) 
Generally. No person shall be granted leave to become a party or non-
party participant on a limited basis in an enforcement or disciplinary 
proceeding or a proceeding to review a determination by a self-
regulatory organization pursuant to Secs. 201.420 and 201.421, except as 
authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Disgorgement proceedings. In an enforcement proceeding, a person 
may state his or her views with respect to a proposed plan of 
disgorgement or file a proof of claim pursuant to Sec. 201.612.
    (b) Intervention as a party. (1) Generally. In any proceeding, other 
than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding or a 
proceeding to review a self-regulatory organization determination, any 
person may seek leave to intervene as a party by filing a motion setting 
forth the person's interest in the proceeding. No person, however, shall 
be admitted as a party to a proceeding by intervention unless it is 
determined that leave to participate pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section would be inadequate for the protection of his or her interests.
    (i) In a proceeding under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 
1935, any representative of interested consumers or security holders, or 
any other person whose participation in the proceeding may be in the 
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, may be 
admitted as a party upon the filing of a written motion setting forth 
the person's interest in the proceeding.
    (ii) In a proceeding under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any 
representative of interested security holders, or any other person whose 
participation in the proceeding may be in the public interest or for the 
protection of

[[Page 158]]

investors, may be admitted as a party upon the filing of a written 
motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding.
    (2) Intervention as of right. (i) In proceedings under the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, any interested representative, 
agency, authority or instrumentality of the United States or any 
interested State, State commission, municipality or other political 
subdivision of a state shall be admitted as a party to any proceeding 
upon the filing of a written motion requesting leave to be admitted.
    (ii) In proceedings under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any 
interested State or State agency shall be admitted as a party to any 
proceeding upon the filing of a written motion requesting leave to be 
admitted.
    (c) Leave to participate on a limited basis. In any proceeding, 
other than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding or a 
proceeding to review a self-regulatory organization determination, any 
person may seek leave to participate on a limited basis as a non-party 
participant as to any matter affecting the person's interests. In any 
enforcement proceeding or disciplinary proceeding, an authorized 
representative of the United States Department of Justice, an authorized 
representative of a United States Attorney, or an authorized 
representative of any criminal prosecutorial authority of any State or 
any other political subdivision of a State may seek leave to participate 
on a limited basis as a non-party participant as provided in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (1) Procedure. Motions for leave to participate shall be in writing, 
shall set forth the nature and extent of the movant's interest in the 
proceeding, and, except where good cause for late filing is shown, shall 
be filed not later than 20 days prior to the date fixed for the 
commencement of the hearing. Leave to participate pursuant to this 
paragraph (c) may include such rights of a party as the hearing officer 
may deem appropriate. Persons granted leave to participate shall be 
served in accordance with Sec. 201.150; provided, however, that a party 
to the proceeding may move that the extent of notice of filings or other 
papers to be provided to persons granted leave to participate be 
limited, or may move that the persons granted leave to participate bear 
the cost of being provided copies of any or all filings or other papers. 
Persons granted leave to participate shall be bound, except as may be 
otherwise determined by the hearing officer, by any stipulation between 
the parties to the proceeding with respect to procedure, including 
submission of evidence, substitution of exhibits, corrections of the 
record, the time within which briefs or exceptions may be filed or 
proposed findings and conclusions may be submitted, the filing of 
initial decisions, the procedure to be followed in the preparation of 
decisions and the effective date of the Commission's order in the case. 
Where the filing of briefs or exceptions or the submission of proposed 
findings and conclusions are waived by the parties to the proceedings, a 
person granted leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall 
not be permitted to file a brief or exceptions or submit proposed 
findings and conclusions except by leave of the Commission or of the 
hearing officer.
    (2) Certain persons entitled to leave to participate. The hearing 
officer is directed to grant leave to participate under this paragraph 
(c) to any person to whom it is proposed to issue any security in 
exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or 
property interests, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash, 
where the Commission is authorized to approve the terms and conditions 
of such issuance and exchange after a hearing upon the fairness of such 
terms and conditions.
    (3) Leave to participate in certain Commission proceedings by a 
representative of the United States Department of Justice, a United 
States Attorney's Office, or a criminal prosecutorial authority of any 
State or any other political subdivision of a State. The Commission or 
the hearing officer may grant leave to participate on a limited basis to 
an authorized representative of the United States Department of Justice, 
an authorized representative of a United States Attorney, or an 
authorized representative of any criminal prosecutorial authority of any 
State or any other political subdivision of a State for the purpose of

[[Page 159]]

requesting a stay during the pendency of a criminal investigation or 
prosecution arising out of the same or similar facts that are at issue 
in the pending Commission enforcement or disciplinary proceeding. Upon a 
showing that such a stay is in the public interest or for the protection 
of investors, the motion for stay shall be favored. A stay granted under 
this paragraph (c)(3) may be granted for such a period and upon such 
conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deems appropriate.
    (d) Amicus participation--(1) Availability. An amicus brief may be 
filed only if:
    (i) A motion for leave to file the brief has been granted;
    (ii) The brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties;
    (iii) The brief is filed at the request of the Commission or the 
hearing officer; or
    (iv) The brief is presented by the United States or an officer or 
agency thereof, or by a State, Territory or Commonwealth.
    (2) Procedure. An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the 
motion for leave. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of 
the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae 
is desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae 
shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position 
the amicus will support, unless the Commission or hearing officer, for 
cause shown, grants leave for a later filing. In the event that a later 
filing is allowed, the order granting leave to file shall specify when 
an opposing party may reply to the brief. A motion of an amicus curiae 
to participate in oral argument will be granted only for extraordinary 
reasons.
    (e) Permission to state views. Any person may make a motion seeking 
leave to file a memorandum or make an oral statement of his or her 
views. Any such communication may be included in the record; provided, 
however, that unless offered and admitted as evidence of the truth of 
the statements therein made, any assertions of fact submitted pursuant 
to the provisions of this paragraph (e) will be considered only to the 
extent that the statements therein made are otherwise supported by the 
record.
    (f) Modification of participation provisions. The Commission or the 
hearing officer may, by order, modify the provisions of this section 
which would otherwise be applicable, and may impose such terms and 
conditions on the participation of any person in any proceeding as it 
may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest.

<R05>
 201.220  Answer to allegations.

    (a) When required. In its order instituting proceedings, the 
Commission may require any party to file an answer to each of the 
allegations contained therein. Even if not so ordered, any party in any 
proceeding may elect to file an answer. Any other person granted leave 
by the Commission or the hearing officer to participate on a limited 
basis in such proceedings pursuant to Sec. 201.210(c) may be required to 
file an answer.
    (b) When to file. Except where a different period is provided by 
rule or by order, a party required to file an answer as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall do so within 20 days after service 
upon the party of the order instituting proceedings. Persons granted 
leave to participate on a limited basis in the proceeding pursuant to 
Sec. 201.210(c) may file an answer within a reasonable time, as 
determined by the Commission or the hearing officer. If the order 
instituting proceedings is amended, the Commission or the hearing 
officer may require that an amended answer be filed and, if such an 
answer is required, shall specify a date for the filing thereof.
    (c) Contents; effect of failure to deny. Unless otherwise directed 
by the hearing officer or the Commission, an answer shall specifically 
admit, deny, or state that the party does not have, and is unable to 
obtain, sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the 
order instituting proceedings. When a party intends in good faith to 
deny only a part of an allegation, the party shall specify so much of it 
as is true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of a lack of 
information shall have the effect of a denial. A

[[Page 160]]

defense of res judicata, statute of limitations or any other matter 
constituting an affirmative defense shall be asserted in the answer. Any 
allegation not denied shall be deemed admitted.
    (d) Motion for more definite statement. A party may file with an 
answer a motion for a more definite statement of specified matters of 
fact or law to be considered or determined. Such motion shall state the 
respects in which, and the reasons why, each such matter of fact or law 
should be required to be made more definite. If the motion is granted, 
the order granting such motion shall set the periods for filing such a 
statement and any answer thereto.
    (e) Amendments. A party may amend its answer at any time by written 
consent of each adverse party or with leave of the Commission or the 
hearing officer. Leave shall be freely granted when justice so requires.
    (f) Failure to file answer: default. If a party respondent fails to 
file an answer required by this section within the time provided, such 
person may be deemed in default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(a). A party may 
make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(b).


<R05>
 201.221  Prehearing conference.

    (a) Purposes of conference. The purposes of a prehearing conference 
include, but are not limited to:

conference. Such conferences may be held with or without the hearing 
officer present as the hearing officer deems appropriate. Where such a 
conference is held outside the presence of the hearing officer, the 
hearing officer shall be advised promptly by the parties of any 
agreements reached. Such conferences also may be held with one or more 
persons participating by telephone or other remote means.
    (c) Subjects to be discussed. At a prehearing conference 
consideration may be given and action taken with respect to any and all 
of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Exchange of witness and exhibit lists and copies of exhibits;
    (3) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and stipulations concerning 
the contents, authenticity, or admissibility into evidence of documents;

prehearing production of documents in response to subpoenas duces tecum 
as set forth in Sec. 201.232;
    (12) Specification of procedures as set forth in Sec. 201.202; and
    (13) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly and expeditious 
disposition of the proceeding.
    (d) Required prehearing conference. Except where the emergency 
nature of a proceeding would make a prehearing conference clearly 
inappropriate, at least one prehearing conference should be held.
    (e) Prehearing orders. At or following the conclusion of any 
conference held pursuant to this section, the hearing officer shall 
enter a ruling or order which recites the agreements reached and any 
procedural determinations made by the hearing officer.
    (f) Failure to appear: default. Any person who is named in an order 
instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may be made or 
sanctions imposed and who fails to appear, in person or through a 
representative, at a prehearing conference of which he or she has been 
duly notified may be deemed in default pursuant to

Sec. 201.155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a default 
pursuant to Sec. 201.155(b).

Sec. 201.230  Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Availability of documents for inspection and copying.

    For purposes of this section, the term documents shall include 
writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings and other 
data compilations, including data stored by computer, from which 
information can be obtained.
    (a) Documents to be available for inspection and copying. (1) Unless 
otherwise provided by this section, or by order of the Commission or the 
hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall make available for 
inspection and copying by any party documents obtained by the Division 
prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the 
investigation leading to the Division's recommendation to institute 
proceedings. Such documents shall include:
    (i) Each subpoena issued;
    (ii) Every other written request to persons not employed by the 
Commission to provide documents or to be interviewed;
    (iii) The documents turned over in response to any such subpoenas or 
other written requests;
    (iv) All transcripts and transcript exhibits;
    (v) Any other documents obtained from persons not employed by the 
Commission; and
    (vi) Any final examination or inspection reports prepared by the 
Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, the Division of 
Market Regulation, or the Division of Investment Management.
    (2) Nothing in this paragraph (a) shall limit the right of the 
Division to make available any other document, or shall limit the right 
of a respondent to seek access to or production pursuant to subpoena of 
any other document, or shall limit the authority of the hearing officer 
to order the production of any document pursuant to subpoena.
    (b) Documents that may be withheld. (1) The Division of Enforcement 
may withhold a document if:
    (i) The document is privileged;
    (ii) The document is an internal memorandum, note or writing 
prepared by a Commission employee, other than an examination or 
inspection report as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, 
or is otherwise attorney work product and will not be offered in 
evidence;
    (iii) The document would disclose the identity of a confidential 
source; or
    (iv) The hearing officer grants leave to withhold a document or 
category of documents as not relevant to the subject matter of the 
proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
    (2) Nothing in this paragraph (b) authorizes the Division of 
Enforcement in connection with an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding 
to withhold, contrary to the doctrine of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 
87 (1963), documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
    (c) Withheld document list. The hearing officer may require the 
Division of

[[Page 162]]

Enforcement to submit for review a list of documents withheld pursuant 
to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section or to submit any 
document withheld, and may determine whether any such document should be 
made available for inspection and copying.
    (d) Timing of inspection and copying. Unless otherwise ordered by 
the Commission or the hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall 
commence making documents available to a respondent for inspection and 
copying pursuant to this section no later than 14 days after the 
respondent files an answer. In a proceeding in which a temporary cease-
and-desist order is sought pursuant to Sec. 201.510 or a temporary 
suspension of registration is sought pursuant to Sec. 201.520, documents 
shall be made available no later than the day after service of the 
decision as to whether to issue a temporary cease-and-desist order or 
temporary suspension order.
    (e) Place of inspection and copying. Documents subject to inspection 
and copying pursuant to this section shall be made available to the 
respondent for inspection and copying at the Commission office where 
they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties, 
in writing, may agree. A respondent shall not be given custody of the 
documents or leave to remove the documents from the Commission's offices 
pursuant to the requirements of this section other than by written 
agreement of the Division of Enforcement. Such agreement shall specify 
the documents subject to the agreement, the date they shall be returned 
and such other terms or conditions as are appropriate to provide for the 
safekeeping of the documents.
    (f) Copying costs and procedures. The respondent may obtain a 
photocopy of any documents made available for inspection. The respondent 
shall be responsible for the cost of photocopying. Unless otherwise 
ordered, charges for copies made by the Division of Enforcement at the 
request of the respondent will be at the rate charged pursuant to the 
fee schedule at 17 CFR 200.80e for copies. The respondent shall be given 
access to the documents at the Commission's offices or such other place 
as the parties may agree during normal business hours for copying of 
documents at the respondent's expense.
    (g) Issuance of investigatory subpoenas after institution of 
proceedings. The Division of Enforcement shall promptly inform the 
hearing officer and each party if investigatory subpoenas are issued 
under the same investigation file number or pursuant to the same order 
directing private investigation (``formal order'') under which the 
investigation leading to the institution of proceedings was conducted. 
The hearing officer shall order such steps as necessary and appropriate 
to assure that the issuance of investigatory subpoenas after the 
institution of proceedings is not for the purpose of obtaining evidence 
relevant to the proceedings and that any relevant documents that may be 
obtained through the use of investigatory subpoenas in a continuing 
investigation are made available to each respondent for inspection and 
copying on a timely basis.
    (h) Failure to make documents available--harmless error. In the 
event that a document required to be made available to a respondent 
pursuant to this section is not made available by the Division of 
Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or 
decided shall be required, unless the respondent shall establish that 
the failure to make the document available was not harmless error.

<R05>
Sec. 201.231  Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Production of witness statements.

    (a) Availability. Any respondent in an enforcement or disciplinary 
proceeding may move that the Division of Enforcement produce for 
inspection and copying any statement of any person called or to be 
called as a witness by the division that pertains, or is expected to 
pertain, to his or her direct testimony and that would be required to be 
produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. Such production 
shall be made at a time and place fixed by the hearing officer and shall 
be made available to any party, provided, however, that the production 
shall be made under conditions intended to preserve the items to be 
inspected or copied.

[[Page 163]]

    (b) Failure to produce--harmless error. In the event that a 
statement required to be made available for inspection and copying by a 
respondent is not turned over by the Division of Enforcement, no 
rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall 
be required unless the respondent establishes that the failure to turn 
over the statement was not harmless error.


<R05>
Sec. 201.232  Subpoenas.

    (a) Availability; procedure. In connection with any hearing ordered 
by the Commission, a party may request the issuance of subpoenas 
requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses at the designated 
time and place of hearing, and subpoenas requiring the production of 
documentary or other tangible evidence returnable at any designated time 
or place. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for issuance 
of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant 
to Sec. 201.150. A person whose request for a subpoena has been denied 
or modified may not request that any other person issue the subpoena.
    (1) Unavailability of hearing officer. In the event that the hearing 
officer assigned to a proceeding is unavailable, the party seeking 
issuance of the subpoena may seek its issuance from the first available 
of the following persons: The Chief Administrative Law Judge, the law 
judge most senior in service as a law judge, the duty officer, any other 
member of the Commission, or any other person designated by the 
Commission to issue subpoenas. Requests for issuance of a subpoena made 
to the Commission, or any member thereof, must be submitted to the 
Secretary, not to an individual Commissioner.
    (2) Signing may be delegated. A hearing officer may authorize 
issuance of a subpoena, and may delegate the manual signing of the 
subpoena to any other person authorized to issue subpoenas.
    (b) Standards for issuance. Where it appears to the person asked to 
issue the subpoena that the subpoena sought may be unreasonable, 
oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in 
his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the 
subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general 
relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence 
sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the person 
requested to issue the subpoena determines that the subpoena or any of 
its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly 
burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue it only 
upon such conditions as fairness requires. In making the foregoing 
determination, the person issuing the subpoena may inquire of the other 
participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be 
proved.
    (c) Service. Service shall be made pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 201.150 (b) through (d). The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall 
apply to the issuance of subpoenas for purposes of investigations, as 
required by 17 CFR 203.8, as well as hearings.
    (d) Tender of fees required. When a subpoena compelling the 
attendance of a person at a hearing or deposition is issued at the 
instance of anyone other than an officer or agency of the United States, 
service is valid only if the subpoena is accompanied by a tender to the 
subpoenaed person of the fees for one day's attendance and mileage 
specified by paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) Application to quash or modify. (1) Procedure. Any person to 
whom a subpoena is directed or who is an owner, creator or the subject 
of the documents that are to be produced pursuant to a subpoena may, 
prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more 
than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena, request that 
the subpoena be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by 
application filed with the Secretary and served on all parties pursuant 
to Sec. 201.150. The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued may, 
within five days of service of the application, file an opposition to 
the application. If a hearing officer has been assigned to the 
proceeding, the application to quash shall be directed to that hearing 
officer for consideration, even if the subpoena was issued by another 
person.
    (2) Standards governing application to quash or modify. If 
compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly 
burdensome, the

[[Page 164]]

hearing officer or the Commission shall quash or modify the subpoena, or 
may order return of the subpoena only upon specified conditions. These 
conditions may include but are not limited to a requirement that the 
party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall make reasonable 
compensation to the person to whom the subpoena was addressed for the 
cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place for return of the 
subpoena.
    (f) Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses summoned before the 
Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to 
witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose 
depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be 
entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of 
the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party 
at whose instance the witnesses appear.


<R05>
Sec. 201.233  Depositions upon oral examination.

    (a) Procedure. Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness 
by deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why 
such deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the 
party believes the witness will be unable to attend or testify at the 
hearing; the name and address of the prospective witness; the matters 
concerning which the prospective witness is expected to be questioned; 
and the proposed time and place for the taking of the deposition.
    (b) Required finding when ordering a deposition. In the discretion 
of the Commission or the hearing officer, an order for deposition may be 
issued upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give 
testimony material to the proceeding, that it is likely the prospective 
witness will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of 
age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability, and that the 
taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.
    (c) Contents of order. An order for deposition shall designate by 
name a deposition officer. The designated officer may be the hearing 
officer or any other person authorized to administer oaths by the laws 
of the United States or of the place where the deposition is to be held. 
An order for deposition also shall state:
    (1) The name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;
    (2) The scope of the testimony to be taken;
    (3) The time and place of the deposition;
    (4) The manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition; 
and
    (5) The number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to 
be filed upon completion of the deposition.
    (d) Procedure at depositions. A witness whose testimony is taken by 
deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put 
to him or her. Examination and cross-examination of deponents may 
proceed as permitted at a hearing. The witness being deposed may have 
counsel present during the deposition.
    (e) Objections to questions or evidence. Objections to questions or 
evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied 
upon. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the 
deposition officer upon the deposition, but a deposition officer other 
than the hearing officer shall not have the power to decide on the 
competency, materiality or relevance of evidence. Failure to object to 
questions or evidence before the deposition officer shall not be deemed 
a waiver unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been 
obviated or removed if presented at that time.
    (f) Filing of depositions. The questions propounded and all answers 
or objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a 
transcript prepared by the deposition officer, or under his or her 
direction. The transcript shall be subscribed by the witness and 
certified by the deposition officer. The original deposition and 
exhibits shall be filed with the Secretary. A copy of the deposition 
shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase at 
prescribed rates.
    (g) Payment. The cost of the transcript shall be paid by the party 
requesting the deposition.

[[Page 165]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.234  Depositions upon written questions.

    (a) Availability. Depositions may be taken and submitted on written 
questions upon motion of any party. The motion shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 201.233(a). A decision on the motion shall 
be governed by the provisions of Sec. 201.233(b).
    (b) Procedure. Written questions shall be filed with the motion. 
Within 10 days after service of the motion and written questions, any 
party may file objections to such written questions and any party may 
file cross-questions. When a deposition is taken pursuant to this 
section no persons other than the witness, counsel to the witness, the 
deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does not act as 
reporter, a reporter, shall be present at the examination of the 
witness. No party shall be present or represented unless otherwise 
permitted by order. The deposition officer shall propound the questions 
and cross-questions to the witness in the order submitted.
    (c) Additional requirements. The order for deposition, filing of the 
deposition, form of the deposition and use of the deposition in the 
record shall be governed by paragraphs (c) through (g) of Sec. 201.233, 
except that no cross-examination shall be made.


<R05>
Sec. 201.235  Introducing prior sworn statements of witnesses into the record.

    (a) At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn 
statement of a witness, not a party, otherwise admissible in the 
proceeding, may make a motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If 
only part of a statement is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may 
require that all relevant portions of the statement be introduced. If 
all of a statement is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may 
require that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A 
motion to introduce a prior sworn statement may be granted if:
    (1) The witness is dead;
    (2) The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that 
the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior 
sworn statement;
    (3) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, 
sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;
    (4) The party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,
    (5) In the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, it 
would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior 
sworn statement to be used. In making this determination, due regard 
shall be given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in 
an open hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn 
statement in lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given 
to the convenience of the parties in avoiding unnecessary expense.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 201.240  Settlement.

    (a) Availability. Any person who is notified that a proceeding may 
or will be instituted against him or her, or any party to a proceeding 
already instituted, may, at any time, propose in writing an offer of 
settlement.
    (b) Procedure. An offer of settlement shall state that it is made 
pursuant to this section; shall recite or incorporate as a part of the 
offer the provisions of paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this section; 
shall be signed by the person making the offer, not by counsel; and 
shall be submitted to the interested division.
    (c) Consideration of offers of settlement. (1) Offers of settlement 
shall be considered by the interested division when time, the nature of 
the proceedings, and the public interest permit.
    (2) Where a hearing officer is assigned to a proceeding, the 
interested division and the party submitting the offer may request that 
the hearing officer express his or her views regarding the 
appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for the hearing 
officer to express his or her views on an offer of settlement or 
otherwise to participate in a settlement conference constitutes a waiver 
by the persons making the request of any right to claim bias or 
prejudgment by the hearing officer based on the views expressed.

[[Page 166]]

    (3) The interested division shall present the offer of settlement to 
the Commission with its recommendation, except that, if the division's 
recommendation is unfavorable, the offer shall not be presented to the 
Commission unless the person making the offer so requests.
    (4) By submitting an offer of settlement, the person making the 
offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:
    (i) All hearings pursuant to the statutory provisions under which 
the proceeding is to be or has been instituted;
    (ii) The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (iii) Proceedings before, and an initial decision by, a hearing 
officer;
    (iv) All post-hearing procedures; and
    (v) Judicial review by any court.
    (5) By submitting an offer of settlement the person further waives:
    (i) Such provisions of the Rules of Practice or other requirements 
of law as may be construed to prevent any member of the Commission's 
staff from participating in the preparation of, or advising the 
Commission as to, any order, opinion, finding of fact, or conclusion of 
law to be entered pursuant to the offer; and
    (ii) Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Commission based 
on the consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or 
any part of the proceeding.
    (6) If the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the person 
making the offer shall be notified of the Commission's action and the 
offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall 
not constitute a part of the record in any proceeding against the person 
making the offer, provided, however, that rejection of an offer of 
settlement does not affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to any discussions 
concerning the rejected offer of settlement.
    (7) Final acceptance of any offer of settlement will occur only upon 
the issuance of findings and an order by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.250  Motion for summary disposition.

    (a) After a respondent's answer has been filed and, in an 
enforcement or a disciplinary proceeding, documents have been made 
available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to 
Sec. 201.230, the respondent, or the interested division may make a 
motion for summary disposition of any or all allegations of the order 
instituting proceedings with respect to that respondent. If the 
interested division has not completed presentation of its case in chief, 
a motion for summary disposition shall be made only with leave of the 
hearing officer. The facts of the pleadings of the party against whom 
the motion is made shall be taken as true, except as modified by 
stipulations or admissions made by that party, by uncontested 
affidavits, or by facts officially noted pursuant to Sec. 201.323.
    (b) The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion for 
summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. The hearing 
officer may grant the motion for summary disposition if there is no 
genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the 
motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law. If it 
appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present by affidavit 
prior to hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, 
the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion. A hearing officer's 
decision to deny leave to file a motion for summary disposition is not 
subject to interlocutory appeal.
    (c) The motion for summary disposition, supporting memorandum of 
points and authorities, and any declarations, affidavits or attachments 
shall not exceed 35 pages in length.

                        Rules Regarding Hearings


<R05>
Sec. 201.300  Hearings.

    Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be held only upon 
order of the Commission. All hearings shall be conducted in a fair, 
impartial, expeditious and orderly manner.

[[Page 167]]


<R05>
Sec. 201.301  Hearings to be public.

    All hearings, except hearings on applications for confidential 
treatment filed pursuant to Sec. 201.190, hearings held to consider a 
motion for a protective order pursuant to Sec. 201.322, and hearings on 
ex parte application for a temporary cease-and-desist order, shall be 
public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission on its own motion or 
the motion of a party. No hearing shall be nonpublic where all 
respondents request that the hearing be made public.


<R05>
Sec. 201.302  Record of hearings.

    (a) Recordation. Unless ordered otherwise by the hearing officer or 
the Commission, all hearings shall be recorded and a written transcript 
thereof shall be prepared.
    (b) Availability of a transcript. Transcripts of public hearings 
shall be available for purchase at prescribed rates. Transcripts of 
nonpublic proceedings, and transcripts subject to a protective order 
pursuant to Sec. 201.322, shall be available for purchase only by 
parties; provided, however, that any person compelled to submit data or 
evidence in a hearing may purchase a copy of his or her own testimony.
    (c) Transcript correction. Prior to the filing of post-hearing 
briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, or within such earlier time 
as directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, a party or witness 
may make a motion to correct the transcript. Proposed corrections of the 
transcript may be submitted to the hearing officer by stipulation 
pursuant to Sec. 201.324, or by motion. Upon notice to all parties to 
the proceeding, the hearing officer may, by order, specify corrections 
to the transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 201.310  Failure to appear at hearings: Default.

    Any person named in an order instituting proceedings as a person 
against whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed who fails to 
appear at a hearing of which he or she has been duly notified may be 
deemed to be in default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(a). A party may make a 
motion to set aside a default pursuant to Sec. 201.155(b).


<R05>
Sec. 201.320  Evidence: Admissibility.

    The Commission or the hearing officer may receive relevant evidence 
and shall exclude all evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial or unduly 
repetitious.


<R05>
Sec. 201.321  Evidence: Objections and offers of proof.

    (a) Objections. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence 
must be made on the record and shall be in short form, stating the 
grounds relied upon. Exceptions to any ruling thereon by the hearing 
officer need not be noted at the time of the ruling. Such exceptions 
will be deemed waived on appeal to the Commission, however, unless 
raised:
    (1) Pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with 
Sec. 201.400;
    (2) In a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to 
Sec. 201.340; or
    (3) In a petition for Commission review of an initial decision filed 
in accordance with Sec. 201.410.
    (b) Offers of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, 
the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall 
be included in the record. Excluded material shall be retained pursuant 
to Sec. 201.350(b).


<R05>
Sec. 201.322  Evidence: Confidential information, protective orders.

    (a) Procedure. In any proceeding as defined in Sec. 201.101(a), a 
party, any person who is the owner, subject or creator of a document 
subject to subpoena or which may be introduced as evidence, or any 
witness who testifies at a hearing may file a motion requesting a 
protective order to limit from disclosure to other parties or to the 
public documents or testimony that contain confidential information. The 
motion should include a general summary or extract of the documents 
without revealing confidential details. If the movant seeks a protective 
order against disclosure to other parties as well as the public, copies 
of the documents shall not be served on other parties. Unless the 
documents are unavailable, the movant shall file for in camera 
inspection a sealed copy of the documents as to which the order is 
sought.

[[Page 168]]

    (b) Basis for issuance. Documents and testimony introduced in a 
public hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective 
order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from 
disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
    (c) Requests for additional information supporting confidentiality. 
A movant under paragraph (a) of this section may be required to furnish 
in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for 
confidentiality. Failure to supply the information so requested within 
five days from the date of receipt by the movant of a notice of the 
information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public 
disclosure of that portion of the documents to which the additional 
information relates, unless the Commission or the hearing officer shall 
otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such 
five-day period.
    (d) Confidentiality of documents pending decision. Pending a 
determination of a motion under this section, the documents as to which 
confidential treatment is sought and any other documents that would 
reveal the confidential information in those documents shall be 
maintained under seal and shall be disclosed only in accordance with 
orders of the Commission or the hearing officer. Any order issued in 
connection with a motion under this section shall be public unless the 
order would disclose information as to which a protective order has been 
granted, in which case that portion of the order that would reveal the 
protected information shall be nonpublic.


<R05>
Sec. 201.323  Evidence: Official notice.

    Official notice may be taken of any material fact which might be 
judicially noticed by a district court of the United States, any matter 
in the public official records of the Commission, or any matter which is 
peculiarly within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. If 
official notice is requested or taken of a material fact not appearing 
in the evidence in the record, the parties, upon timely request, shall 
be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 201.324  Evidence: Stipulations.

    The parties may, by stipulation, at any stage of the proceeding 
agree upon any pertinent facts in the proceeding. A stipulation may be 
received in evidence and, when received, shall be binding on the parties 
to the stipulation.


<R05>

    A witness at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall 
testify under oath or affirmation.


<R05>
Sec. 201.326  Evidence: Presentation, rebuttal and cross-examination.

    In any proceeding in which a hearing is required to be conducted on 
the record after opportunity for hearing in accord with 5 U.S.C. 556(a), 
a party is entitled to present its case or defense by oral or 
documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such 
cross-examination as, in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing 
officer, may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. 
The scope and form of evidence, rebuttal evidence, if any, and cross-
examination, if any, in any other proceeding shall be determined by the 
Commission or the hearing officer in each proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 201.340  Proposed findings, conclusions and supporting briefs.

    (a) Opportunity to file. Before an initial decision is issued, each 
party shall have an opportunity, reasonable in light of all the 
circumstances, to file in writing proposed findings and conclusions 
together with, or as a part of, its brief.
    (b) Procedure. Proposed findings of fact must be supported by 
citations to specific portions of the record. If successive filings are 
directed, the proposed findings and conclusions of the party assigned to 
file first shall be set forth in serially numbered paragraphs, and any 
counter statement of proposed findings and conclusions must, in addition 
to any other matter, indicate those paragraphs of the proposals already 
filed as to which there is no dispute. A reply brief may be filed by the 
party assigned to file first, or, where simultaneous filings are 
directed, reply

[[Page 169]]

briefs may be filed by each party, within the period prescribed therefor 
by the hearing officer. No further briefs may be filed except with leave 
of the hearing officer.
    (c) Time for filing. In any proceeding in which an initial decision 
is to be issued:
    (1) At the end of each hearing, the hearing officer shall, by order, 
after consultation with the parties, prescribe the period within which 
proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs are to be filed. 
The party or parties directed to file first shall make its or their 
initial filing within 30 days of the end of the hearing unless the 
hearing officer, for good cause shown, permits a different period and 
sets forth in the order the reasons why the different period is 
necessary.
    (2) The total period within which all such proposed findings and 
conclusions and supporting briefs and any counter statements of proposed 
findings and conclusions and reply briefs are to be filed shall be no 
longer than 90 days after the close of the hearing unless the hearing 
officer, for good cause shown, permits a different period and sets forth 
in an order the reasons why the different period is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 201.350  Record in proceedings before hearing officer; retention of documents; copies.

The Secretary shall retain any such documents until the later of the 
date upon which a Commission order ending the proceeding becomes final, 
or the conclusion of any judicial review of the Commission's order.
    (c) Substitution of copies. A true copy of a document may be 
substituted for any document in the record or any document retained 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 201.351  Transmittal of documents to Secretary; record index; certification.

    (a) Transmittal from hearing officer to Secretary of partial record 
index. The hearing officer may, at any time, transmit to the Secretary 
motions, exhibits or any other original documents filed with or accepted 
into evidence by the hearing officer, together with an index of such 
documents. The hearing officer, may, by order, require the interested 
division or other persons to assist in promptly transporting such 
documents from the hearing location to the Office of the Secretary.
    (b) Preparation, certification of record index. Promptly after the 
close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit to the 
Secretary an index of the originals of any motions, exhibits or any 
other documents filed with or accepted into evidence by the hearing 
officer that have not been previously transmitted to the Secretary, and 
the Secretary shall prepare a record index. Prior to issuance of an 
initial decision, or if no initial decision is to be prepared, within 30 
days of the close of the hearing, the Secretary shall transmit the 
record index to the hearing officer and serve a copy of the record index 
on each party. Any person may file proposed corrections to the record 
index

[[Page 170]]

with the hearing officer within 15 days of service of the record index. 
The hearing officer shall, by order, direct whether any corrections to 
the record index shall be made. The Secretary shall make such 
corrections, if any, and issue a revised record index. If an initial 
decision is to be issued, the initial decision shall include a 
certification that the record consists of the items set forth in the 
record index or revised record index issued by the Secretary.
    (c) Final transmittal of record items to the Secretary. After the 
close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit to the

Secretary, or if no initial decision is to be issued, within 60 days of 
the close of the hearing, the Secretary shall inform the hearing officer 
if any portions of the record are not in the Secretary's custody.


<R05>
Sec. 201.360  Initial decision of hearing officer.

    (a) When required. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, the 
hearing officer shall prepare an initial decision in any proceeding in 
which the Commission directs a hearing officer to preside at a hearing, 
provided, however, that an initial decision may be waived by the parties 
with the consent of the hearing officer pursuant to Sec. 201.202.
    (b) Content. An initial decision shall include: Findings and 
conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, as to all the material 
issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record and the 
appropriate order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof. The initial 
decision shall also state the time period, not to exceed 21 days after 
service of the decision, except for good cause shown, within which a 
petition for review of the initial decision may be filed. The reasons 
for any extension of time shall be stated in the initial decision. The 
initial decision shall also include a statement that, as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section:
    (1) The initial decision shall become the final decision of the 
Commission as to each party unless a party files a petition for review 
of the initial decision or the Commission determines on its own 
initiative to review the initial decision as to a party; and
    (2) If a party timely files a petition for review or the Commission 
takes action to review as to a party, the initial decision shall not 
become final with respect to that party.
    (c) Filing, service and publication. The hearing officer shall file 
the initial decision with the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly 
serve the initial decision upon the parties and shall promptly publish 
notice of the filing thereof in the SEC News Digest. Thereafter, the 
Secretary shall publish the initial decision in the SEC Docket; 
provided, however, that in nonpublic proceedings no notice shall be 
published unless the Commission otherwise directs.
    (d) When final. (1) Unless a party or an aggrieved person entitled 
to review files a petition for review in accordance with the time limit 
specified in the initial decision, or unless the Commission on its own 
initiative orders review pursuant to Sec. 201.411, an initial decision 
shall become the final decision of the Commission.
    (2) If a petition for review is timely filed by a party or an 
aggrieved person entitled to review, or if the Commission upon its own 
initiative has ordered review of a decision with respect to a party or a 
person aggrieved who would be entitled to review, the initial decision 
shall not become final as to that party or person.
    (e) Order of finality. In the event that the initial decision 
becomes the final decision of the Commission with respect to a party, 
the Commission shall issue an order that the decision has become final 
as to that party. The order of finality shall state the date on which 
sanctions, if any, take effect. Notice of the order shall be published 
in the SEC News Digest and the SEC Docket.

             Appeal to the Commission and Commission Review


<R05>
Sec. 201.400  Interlocutory review.

    (a) Availability. The Commission will not review a hearing officer's 
ruling prior to its consideration of the entire proceeding in the 
absence of extraordinary circumstances. The Commission may decline to 
consider a ruling certified by a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section if it determines that interlocutory review is not 
warranted or appropriate under the circumstances. The Commission may, at 
any time, on its own motion, direct that any matter be submitted to it 
for review.
    (b) Expedited consideration. Interlocutory review of a hearing 
officer's ruling shall be expedited in every way, consistent with the 
Commission's other responsibilities.
    (c) Certification process. A ruling submitted to the Commission for 
interlocutory review must be certified in writing by the hearing officer 
and shall specify the material relevant to the ruling involved. The 
hearing officer shall not certify a ruling unless:
    (1) His or her ruling would compel testimony of Commission members, 
officers or employees or the production of documentary evidence in their 
custody; or
    (2) Upon application by a party, within five days of the hearing 
officer's ruling, the hearing officer is of the opinion that:
    (i) The ruling involves a controlling question of law as to which 
there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and
    (ii) An immediate review of the order may materially advance the 
completion of the proceeding.
    (d) Proceedings not stayed. The filing of an application for review 
or the grant of review shall not stay proceedings before the hearing 
officer unless he or she, or the Commission, shall so order. The 
Commission will not consider the motion for a stay unless the motion 
shall have first been made to the hearing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 201.401  Issuance of stays.

    (a) Procedure. A request for a stay shall be made by written motion, 
filed pursuant to Sec. 201.154, and served on all parties pursuant to 
Sec. 201.150. The motion shall state the reasons for the relief 
requested and the facts relied upon, and, if the facts are subject to 
dispute, the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn 
statements or copies thereof. Portions of the record relevant to the 
relief sought, if available to the movant, shall be filed with the 
motion. The Commission may issue a stay based on such motion or on its 
own motion.
    (b) Scope of relief. The Commission may grant a stay in whole or in 
part, and may condition relief under this section upon such terms, or 
upon the implementation of such procedures, as it deems appropriate.
    (c) Stay of a Commission order. A motion for a stay of a Commission 
order may be made by any person aggrieved thereby who would be entitled 
to review in a federal court of appeals. A motion seeking to stay the 
effectiveness of a Commission order pending judicial review may be made 
to the Commission at any time during which the Commission retains 
jurisdiction over the proceeding.
    (d) Stay of an action by a self-regulatory organization--(1) 
Availability. A motion for a stay of an action by a self-regulatory 
organization for which the Commission is the appropriate regulatory 
agency, for which action review may be sought pursuant to Sec. 201.420, 
may be made by any person aggrieved thereby.
    (2) Summary entry. A stay may be entered summarily, without notice 
and opportunity for hearing.
    (3) Expedited consideration. Where the action complained of has 
already taken effect and the motion for stay is filed within 10 days of 
the effectiveness of the action, or where the action complained of, 
will, by its terms, take effect within five days of the filing of the 
motion for stay, the consideration of and decision on the motion for a 
stay shall be expedited in every way, consistent with the Commission's 
other responsibilities. Where consideration will be expedited, persons 
opposing the motion for a stay may file a statement in opposition within 
two days of service of the motion unless the Commission,

[[Page 172]]

by written order, shall specify a different period.


<R05>
Sec. 201.410  Appeal of initial decisions by hearing officers.

    (a) Petition for review; when available. In any proceeding in which 
an initial decision is made by a hearing officer, any party, and any 
other person who would have been entitled to judicial review of the 
decision entered therein if the Commission itself had made the decision, 
may file a petition for review of the decision with the Commission.
    (b) Procedure. The petition for review of an initial decision shall 
be filed with the Commission within such time after service of the 
initial decision as prescribed by the hearing officer pursuant to 
Sec. 201.360(b). The petition shall set forth the specific findings and 
conclusions of the initial decision as to which exception is taken, 
together with supporting reasons for each exception. Supporting reasons 
may be stated in summary form. Any exception to an initial decision not 
stated in the petition for review, or in a previously filed proposed 
finding made pursuant to Sec. 201.340, may, at the discretion of the 
Commission, be deemed to have been waived by the petitioner.
    (c) Financial disclosure statement requirement. Any person who files 
a petition for review of an initial decision that asserts that person's 
inability to pay either disgorgement, interest or a penalty shall file 
with the opening brief a sworn financial disclosure statement containing 
the information specified in Sec. 201.630(b).
    (d) Opposition to review. A party may seek leave to file a brief in 
opposition to a petition for review within five days of the filing of 
the petition. The Commission will grant leave, or order the filing of an 
opposition on its own motion, only if it determines that briefing will 
significantly aid the decisional process. A brief in opposition shall 
identify those issues which do not warrant consideration by the 
Commission and shall state succinctly the reasons therefore.
    (e) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission 
for review of an initial decision is a prerequisite to the seeking of 
judicial review of a final order entered pursuant to such decision.


<R05>
Sec. 201.411  Commission consideration of initial decisions by hearing officers.

    (a) Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set 
aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, an initial 
decision by a hearing officer and may make any findings or conclusions 
that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the record.
    (b) Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for 
review--(1) Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been 
filed, the Commission shall review any initial decision that:
    (i) Denies any request for action pursuant to Section 8(a) or 
Section 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(a), (c), or 
the first sentence of Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 
78l(d);
    (ii) Suspends trading in a security pursuant to Section 12(k) of the 
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(k); or
    (iii) Is in a case of adjudication (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) not 
required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for 
hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in 5 
U.S.C. 554(a) (1) through (6)).
    (2) Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any 
other decision. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission 
shall consider whether the petition for review makes a reasonable 
showing that:
    (i) A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the 
proceeding; or
    (ii) The decision embodies:
    (A) A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly 
erroneous; or
    (B) A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or
    (C) An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is 
important and that the Commission should review.
    (c) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. 
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any initial 
decision, or a portion of any initial decision, within

[[Page 173]]

21 days after the end of the period established for filing a petition 
for review pursuant to Sec. 201.410(b) or any brief in opposition to a 
petition for review permitted pursuant to Sec. 201.410(d). A party who 
does not intend to file a petition for review, and who desires the 
Commission's determination whether to order review on its own initiative 
to be made in a shorter time, may make a motion for an expedited 
decision, accompanied by a written statement that the party waives its 
right to file a petition for review. The vote of one member of the 
Commission, conveyed to the Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a 
matter before the Commission for review.
    (d) Limitations on matters reviewed. Review by the Commission of an 
initial decision shall be limited to the issues specified in the 
petition for review or the issues, if any, specified in the briefing 
schedule order issued pursuant to Sec. 201.450(a). On notice to all 
parties, however, the Commission may, at any time prior to issuance of 
its decision, raise and determine any other matters that it deems 
material, with opportunity for oral or written argument thereon by the 
parties.
    (e) Summary affirmance. The Commission may summarily affirm an 
initial decision based upon the petition for review and any response 
thereto, without further briefing, if it finds that no issue raised in 
the petition for review warrants further consideration by the 
Commission.
    (f) Failure to obtain a majority. In the event a majority of 
participating Commissioners do not agree to a disposition on the merits, 
the initial decision shall be of no effect, and an order will be issued 
in accordance with this result.


<R05>
Sec. 201.420  Appeal of determinations by self-regulatory organizations.

    (a) Application for review; when available. An application for 
review by the Commission may be filed by any person who is aggrieved by 
a self-regulatory organization determination as to which a notice is 
required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of 
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1). Such determinations include any:
    (1) Final disciplinary sanction;
    (2) Denial or conditioning of membership or participation;
    (3) Prohibition or limitation in respect to access to services 
offered by that self-regulatory organization or a member thereof; or
    (4) Bar from association.
    (b) Procedure. An application for review may be filed with the 
Commission pursuant to Sec. 201.151 within 30 days after notice of the 
determination was filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) 
of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1), and received by the aggrieved 
person applying for review. The application shall be served by the 
applicant on the self-regulatory organization. The application shall 
identify the determination complained of, set forth in summary form a 
brief statement of alleged errors in the determination and supporting 
reasons therefor and state an address where the applicant can be served 
with the record index. The application shall be accompanied by the 
notice of appearance required by Sec. 201.102(d).
    (c) Determination not stayed. Filing an application for review with 
the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall not 
operate as a stay of the complained of determination made by the self-
regulatory organization unless the Commission otherwise orders either 
pursuant to a motion filed in accordance with Sec. 201.401 or on its own 
motion.
    (d) Certification of the record; service of the index. Fourteen days 
after receipt of an application for review or a Commission order for 
review, the self-regulatory organization shall certify and file with the 
Commission one copy of the record upon which the action complained of 
was taken, and shall file with the Commission three copies of an index 
to such record, and shall serve upon each party one copy of the index.


<R05>
Sec. 201.421  Commission consideration of determinations by self-regulatory organizations.

    (a) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. 
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any 
determination by a self-regulatory organization that could be subject to 
an application for review

[[Page 174]]

pursuant to Sec. 201.420(a) within 40 days after notice thereof was 
filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Exchange 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1).
    (b) Supplemental briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to 
issuance of its decision raise or consider any matter that it deems 
material, whether or not raised by the parties. Notice to the parties 
and an opportunity for supplemental briefing with respect to issues not 
briefed by the parties shall be given where the Commission believes that 
such briefing would significantly aid the decisional process.


<R05>
Sec. 201.430  Appeal of actions made pursuant to delegated authority.

    (a) Scope of rule. Any person aggrieved by an action made by 
authority delegated in Secs. 200.30-1 through 200.30-18 of this chapter 
may seek review of the action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Procedure--(1) Notice of intention to petition for review. A 
party or any person aggrieved by an action made pursuant to delegated 
authority may seek Commission review of the action by filing a written 
notice of intention to petition for review within five days after actual 
notice to the party of the action or service of notice of the action 
pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b), whichever is earlier. The notice shall 
identify the petitioner and the action complained of, and shall be 
accompanied by a notice of appearance pursuant to Sec. 201.102(d).
    (2) Petition for review. Within five days after the filing of a 
notice of intention to petition for review pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the person seeking review shall file a petition for 
review containing a clear and concise statement of the issues to be 
reviewed and the reasons why review is appropriate. The petition shall 
include exceptions to any findings of fact or conclusions of law made, 
together with supporting reasons for such exceptions based on 
appropriate citations to such record as may exist. These reasons may be 
stated in summary form.
    (c) Prerequisite to judicial review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission 
for review of an action made by authority delegated in Secs. 200.30-1 
through 200.30-18 of this chapter is a prerequisite to the seeking of 
judicial review of a final order entered pursuant to such an action.

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995; 60 FR 46500, Sept. 7, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 201.431  Commission consideration of actions made pursuant to delegated authority.

    (a) Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set 
aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, any action 
made pursuant to authority delegated in Secs. 200.30-1 through 200.30-18 
of this chapter.
    (b) Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for 
review--(1) Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been 
filed, the Commission shall review any action that it would be required 
to review pursuant to Sec. 201.411(b)(1) if the action was made as the 
initial decision of a hearing officer.
    (2) Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any 
other action. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission 
shall consider the factors set forth in Sec. 201.411(b)(2).
    (c) Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review. 
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any action 
made pursuant to delegated authority at any time, provided, however, 
that where there are one or more parties to the matter, such review 
shall not be ordered more than ten days after the action. The vote of 
one member of the Commission, conveyed to the Secretary, shall be 
sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission for review.
    (d) Required items in an order for review. In an order granting a 
petition for review or directing review on the Commission's own 
initiative, the Commission shall set forth the time within which any 
party or other person may file a statement in support of or in 
opposition to the action made by delegated authority and shall state 
whether a stay shall be granted, if none is in effect, or shall be 
continued, if in effect pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.

[[Page 175]]

    (e) Automatic stay of delegated action. An action made pursuant to 
delegated authority shall have immediate effect and be deemed the action 
of the Commission. Upon filing with the Commission of a notice of 
intention to petition for review, or upon notice to the Secretary of the 
vote of a Commissioner that a matter be reviewed, an action made 
pursuant to delegated authority shall be stayed until the Commission 
orders otherwise, provided, however, there shall be no automatic stay of 
an action:
    (1) To grant a stay of action by the Commission or a self-regulatory 
organization as authorized by 17 CFR 200.30-14(g) (5)-(6); or
    (2) To commence a subpoena enforcement proceeding as authorized by 
17 CFR 200.30-4(a)(10).
    (f) Effectiveness of stay or of Commission decision to modify or 
reverse a delegated action. As against any person who shall have acted 
in reliance upon any action at a delegated level, any stay or any 
modification or reversal by the Commission of such action shall be 
effective only from the time such person receives actual notice of such 
stay, modification or reversal.

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995; 60 FR 46500, Sept. 7, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 201.450  Briefs filed with the Commission.

    (a) Briefing schedule order. Other than review ordered pursuant to 
Sec. 201.431, if review of a determination is mandated by statute, rule, 
or judicial order or the Commission determines to grant review as a 
matter of discretion, the Commission shall issue a briefing schedule 
order directing the party or parties to file opening briefs and 
specifying particular issues, if any, as to which briefing should be 
limited or directed. Unless otherwise provided, opening briefs shall be 
filed within 40 days of the date of the briefing schedule order. 
Opposition briefs shall be filed within 30 days after the date opening 
briefs are due. Reply briefs shall be filed within 14 days after the 
date opposition briefs are due. No briefs in addition to those specified 
in the briefing schedule order may be filed except with leave of the 
Commission. The briefing schedule order shall be issued:
    (1) At the time the Commission orders review on its own initiative 
pursuant to Secs. 201.411 or 201.421, or orders interlocutory review on 
its own motion pursuant to Sec. 201.400(a); or
    (2) Within 21 days, or such longer time as provided by the 
Commission, after:
    (i) The last day permitted for filing a petition for review pursuant 
to Sec. 201.410(b) or a brief in opposition to a petition for review 
pursuant to Sec. 201.410(d);
    (ii) Receipt by the Commission of an index to the record of a 
determination of a self-regulatory organization filed pursuant to 
Sec. 201.420(d);
    (iii) Receipt by the Commission of the mandate of a court of appeals 
with respect to a judicial remand; or
    (iv) Certification of a ruling for interlocutory review pursuant to 
Sec. 201.400(c).
    (b) Contents of briefs. Briefs shall be confined to the particular 
matters at issue. Each exception to the findings or conclusions being 
reviewed shall be stated succinctly. Exceptions shall be supported by 
citation to the relevant portions of the record, including references to 
the specific pages relied upon, and by concise argument including 
citation of such statutes, decisions and other authorities as may be 
relevant. If the exception relates to the admission or exclusion of 
evidence, the substance of the evidence admitted or excluded shall be 
set forth in the brief, in an appendix thereto, or by citation to the 
record. Reply briefs shall be confined to matters in opposition briefs 
of other parties.
    (c) Length limitation. Opening and opposition briefs shall not 
exceed 50 pages and reply briefs shall not exceed 25 pages, exclusive of 
pages containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any 
addendum, except with leave of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.451  Oral argument before the Commission.

    (a) Availability. The Commission, on its own motion or the motion of 
a party or any other aggrieved person entitled to Commission review, may 
order oral argument with respect to any matter. Motions for oral 
argument with respect to whether to affirm all or

[[Page 176]]

part of an initial decision by a hearing officer shall be granted unless 
exceptional circumstances make oral argument impractical or inadvisable. 
The Commission will consider appeals, motions and other matters properly 
before it on the basis of the papers filed by the parties without oral 
argument unless the Commission determines that the presentation of facts 
and legal arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process 
would be significantly aided by oral argument.
    (b) Procedure. Requests for oral argument shall be made by separate 
motion accompanying the initial brief on the merits. The Commission 
shall issue an order as to whether oral argument is to be heard, and if 
so, the time and place therefor. The grant or denial of a motion for 
oral argument shall be made promptly after the filing of the last brief 
called for by the briefing schedule. If oral argument is granted, the 
time fixed for oral argument shall be changed only by written order of 
the Commission, for good cause shown. The order shall state at whose 
request the change is made and the reasons for any such change.
    (c) Time allowed. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, not more 
than one half-hour per side will be allowed for oral argument. The 
Commission may, in its discretion, determine that several persons have a 
common interest, and that the interests represented will be considered a 
single side for purposes of allotting time for oral argument. Time will 
be divided equally among persons on a single side, provided, however, 
that by mutual agreement they may reallocate their time among 
themselves. A request for additional time must be made by motion filed 
reasonably in advance of the date fixed for argument.
    (d) Participation of Commissioners. A member of the Commission who 
was not present at the oral argument may participate in the decision of 
the proceeding, provided that the member has reviewed the transcript of 
such argument prior to such participation. The decision shall state 
whether the required review was made.


<R05>
Sec. 201.452  Additional evidence.

    Upon its own motion or the motion of a party, the Commission may 
allow the submission of additional evidence. A party may file a motion 
for leave to adduce additional evidence at any time prior to issuance of 
a decision by the Commission. Such motion shall show with particularity 
that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable 
grounds for failure to adduce such evidence previously. The Commission 
may accept or hear additional evidence, may remand the proceeding to a 
self-regulatory organization, or may remand or refer the proceeding to a 
hearing officer for the taking of additional evidence, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 201.460  Record before the Commission.

    The Commission shall determine each matter on the basis of the 
record.
    (a) Contents of the record.
    (1) In proceedings for final decision before the Commission other 
than those reviewing a determination by a self-regulatory organization, 
the record shall consist of:
    (i) All items part of the record below in accordance with 
Sec. 201.350;
    (ii) Any petitions for review, cross-petitions or oppositions; and
    (iii) All briefs, motions, submissions and other papers filed on 
appeal or review.
    (2) In a proceeding for final decision before the Commission 
reviewing a determination by a self-regulatory organization, the record 
shall consist of:
    (i) The record certified pursuant to Sec. 201.420(d) by the self-
regulatory organization;
    (ii) Any application for review; and
    (iii) Any submissions, moving papers, and briefs filed on appeal or 
review.
    (b) Transmittal of record to Commission. Within 14 days after the 
last date set for filing briefs or such later date as the Commission 
directs, the Secretary shall transmit the record to the Commission.
    (c) Review of documents not admitted. Any document offered in 
evidence but excluded by the hearing officer or the Commission and any 
document marked for identification but not offered as an exhibit shall 
not be considered a part

[[Page 177]]

of the record before the Commission on appeal but shall be transmitted 
to the Commission by the Secretary if so requested by the Commission. In 
the event that the Commission does not request the document, the 
Secretary shall retain the document not admitted into the record until 
the later of:
    (1) The date upon which the Commission's order becomes final, or
    (2) The conclusion of any judicial review of that order.


<R05>
Sec. 201.470  Reconsideration.

    (a) Scope of rule. A party or any person aggrieved by a 
determination in a proceeding may file a motion for reconsideration of a 
final order issued by the Commission.
    (b) Procedure. A motion for reconsideration shall be filed within 10 
days after service of the order complained of on each party, or within 
such time as the Commission may prescribe upon motion of the person 
seeking reconsideration, if made within the foregoing 10-day period. The 
motion for reconsideration shall briefly and specifically state the 
matters of record alleged to have been erroneously decided, the grounds 
relied upon, and the relief sought. Except with permission of the 
Commission, a motion for reconsideration shall not exceed 15 pages. No 
responses to a motion for reconsideration shall be filed unless 
requested by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.490  Receipt of petitions for judicial review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(1).

    The Commission officer and office designated pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
2112(a)(1) to receive copies of petitions for review of Commission 
orders from the persons instituting review in a court of appeals, are 
the Secretary and the Office of the Secretary at the Commission's 
Headquarters. Ten copies of each petition shall be submitted. Each copy

Sec. 201.510  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Application process.

    (a) Procedure. A request for entry of a temporary cease-and-desist 
order shall be made by application filed by the Division of Enforcement. 
The application shall set forth the statutory provision or rule that 
each respondent is alleged to have violated; the temporary relief sought 
against each respondent, including whether the respondent would be 
required to take action to prevent the dissipation or conversion of 
assets; and whether the relief is sought ex parte.
    (b) Accompanying documents. The application shall be accompanied by 
a declaration of facts signed by a person with knowledge of the facts 
contained therein, a memorandum of points and authorities, a proposed 
order imposing the temporary relief sought, and, unless relief is sought

the temporary relief should be imposed. If a proceeding for a permanent 
cease-and-desist order has not already been commenced, a proposed order 
instituting proceedings to

[[Page 178]]

determine whether a permanent cease-and-desist order should be imposed 
shall also be filed with the application.
    (c) With whom filed. The application shall be filed with the 
Secretary or, if the Secretary is unavailable, with the duty officer. In 
no event shall an application be filed with an administrative law judge.
    (d) Record of proceedings. Hearings, including ex parte 
presentations made by the Division of Enforcement pursuant to 
Sec. 201.513, shall be recorded or transcribed pursuant to Sec. 201.302.


<R05>
Sec. 201.511  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Notice; procedures for hearing.

    (a) Notice: how given. Notice of an application for a temporary 
cease-and-desist order shall be made by serving a notice of hearing and 
order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b) or, where timely service 
of a notice of hearing pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b) is not practicable, 
by any other means reasonably calculated to give actual notice that a 
hearing will be held, including telephonic notification of the general 
subject matter, time, and place of the hearing. If an application is 
made ex parte, pursuant to Sec. 201.513, no notice to a respondent need 
be given prior to the Commission's consideration of the application.
    (b) Hearing before the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, hearings on an application for a temporary cease-
and-desist order shall be held before the Commission.
    (c) Presiding officer: designation. The Chairman shall preside or 
designate a Commissioner to preside at the hearing. If the Chairman is 
absent or unavailable at the time of hearing and no other Commissioner 
has been designated to preside, the duty officer on the day the hearing 
begins shall preside or designate another Commissioner to preside.
    (d) Procedure at hearing. (1) The presiding officer shall have all 
those powers of a hearing officer set forth in Sec. 201.111 and shall 
rule on the admissibility of evidence and other procedural matters, 
including, but not limited to whether oral testimony will be heard; the 
time allowed each party for the submission of evidence or argument; and 
whether post-hearing submission of briefs, proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law will be permitted and if so, the procedures for 
submission; provided, however, that the person presiding may consult 
with other Commissioners participating in the hearing on these or any 
other question of procedure.
    (2) Each Commissioner present at the hearing shall be afforded a 
reasonable opportunity to ask questions of witnesses, if any, or of 
counsel.
    (3) A party or witness may participate by telephone. Alternative 
means of remote access, including a video link, shall be permitted in 
the Commission's discretion. Factors the Commission may consider in 
determining whether to permit alternative means of remote access 
include, but are not limited to, whether allowing an alternative means 
of access will delay the hearing, whether the alternative means is 
reliable, and whether the party proposing its use has made arrangements 
to pay for its cost.
    (4) After a hearing has begun, the Commission may, on its own 
motion, or the motion of a party, assign a hearing officer to preside at 
the taking of oral testimony or other evidence and to certify the record 
of such testimony or other evidence to the Commission within a fixed 
period of time. No recommended or initial decision shall be made by such 
a hearing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 201.512  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Issuance after notice and opportunity for hearing.

    (a) Basis for issuance. A temporary cease-and-desist order shall be 
issued only if the Commission determines that the alleged violation or 
threatened violation specified in an order instituting proceedings 
whether to enter a permanent cease-and-desist order pursuant to 
Securities Act Section 8A(a), 15 U.S.C. 77h-1(a), Exchange Act Section 
21C(a), 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(a), Investment Company Act Section 9(f)(1), 15 
U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(1), or Investment Advisers Act Section 203(k)(1), 15 
U.S.C. 80b-3(k)(1), or the continuation thereof,

[[Page 179]]

is likely to result in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, 
significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public 
interest, including, but not limited to, losses to the Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation, prior to the completion of proceedings 
on the permanent cease-and-desist order.
    (b) Content, scope and form of order. Every temporary cease-and-
desist order granted shall:
    (1) Describe the basis for its issuance, including the alleged or 
threatened violations and the harm that is likely to result without the 
issuance of an order;
    (2) Describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the order 
instituting proceedings or any other document, the act or acts the 
respondent is to take or refrain from taking; and
    (3) Be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance.
    (c) Effective upon service. A temporary cease-and-desist order is 
effective upon service upon the respondent.
    (d) Service: how made. Service of a temporary cease-and-desist order 
shall be made pursuant to Sec. 201.141(a). The person who serves the 
order shall promptly file a declaration of service identifying the 
person served, the method of service, the date of service, the address 
to which service was made and the person who made service; provided, 
however, failure to file such a declaration shall have no effect on the 
validity of the service.
    (e) Commission review. At any time after the respondent has been 
served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the respondent may apply 
to the Commission to have the order set aside, limited or suspended. The 
application shall set forth with specificity the facts that support the 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 201.513  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Issuance without prior notice and opportunity for hearing.

    In addition to the requirements for issuance of a temporary cease-
and-desist order set forth in Sec. 201.512, the following requirements 
shall apply if a temporary cease-and-desist order is to be entered 
without prior notice and opportunity for hearing:
    (a) Basis for issuance without prior notice and opportunity for 
hearing. A temporary cease-and-desist order may be issued without notice 
and opportunity for hearing only if the Commission determines, from 
specific facts in the record of the proceeding, that notice and hearing 
prior to entry of an order would be impracticable or contrary to the 
public interest.
    (b) Content of the order. An ex parte temporary cease-and-desist 
order shall state specifically why notice and hearing would have been 
impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
    (c) Hearing before the Commission. If a respondent has been served 
with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior 
Commission hearing, the respondent may apply to the Commission to have 
the order set aside, limited, or suspended, and if the application is 
made within 10 days after the date on which the order was served, may 
request a hearing on such application. The Commission shall hold a 
hearing and render a decision on the respondent's application at the 
earliest possible time. The hearing shall begin within two days of the 
filing of the application unless the applicant consents to a longer 
period or the Commission, by order, for good cause shown, sets a later 
date. The Commission shall render a decision on the application within 
five calendar days of its filing, provided, however, that the 
Commission, by order, for good cause shown, may extend the time within 
which a decision may be rendered for a single period of five calendar 
days, or such longer time as consented to by the applicant. If the 
Commission does not render its decision within 10 days of the 
respondent's application or such longer time as consented to by the 
applicant, the temporary order shall be suspended until a decision is 
rendered.
    (d) Presiding officer, procedure at hearing. Procedures with respect 
to the selection of a presiding officer and the conduct of the hearing 
shall be in accordance with Sec. 201.511.


<R05>
Sec. 201.514  Temporary cease-and-desist orders: Judicial review; duration.

    (a) Availability of judicial review. Judicial review of a temporary 
cease-and-

[[Page 180]]

Act, 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(d)(2), Section 9(f)(4)(B) of the Investment Company 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(4)(B), or Section 203(k)(4)(B) of the Investment 
Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-3(k)(4)(B).
    (b) Duration. Unless set aside, limited, or suspended, either by 
order of the Commission, a court of competent jurisdiction, or a hearing 
officer acting pursuant to Sec. 201.531, or by operation of 
Sec. 201.513, a temporary cease-and-desist order shall remain effective 
and enforceable until the earlier of:
    (1) The completion of the proceedings whether a permanent order 
shall be entered; or
    (2) 180 days, or such longer time as consented to by the respondent, 
after issuance of a briefing schedule order pursuant to Sec. 201.540(b), 
if an initial decision whether a permanent order should be entered is 
appealed.


<R05>
Sec. 201.520  Suspension of registration of brokers, dealers, or other Exchange Act-registered entities: Application.

    (a) Procedure. A request for suspension of a registered broker,

    (a) Basis for issuance. An order suspending a registration, pending

necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of 
investors.
    (b) Content, scope and form of order. Each order suspending a

<R05>
Sec. 201.530  Initial decision on permanent order: Timing for submitting proposed findings and preparation of decision.

[[Page 182]]

apply to preparation of an initial decision as to whether such order

<R05>
Sec. 201.531  Initial decision on permanent order: Effect on temporary order.

decision is issued, a temporary sanction is in effect as to any 
respondent, the initial decision shall specify:
    (1) Which terms or conditions of a temporary cease-and-desist order, 
if any, shall become permanent; and
    (2) Whether a temporary suspension of a respondent's registration, 
if any, shall be made a permanent revocation of registration.
    (b) Modification of temporary order. If any temporary sanction shall 
not become permanent under the terms of the initial decision, the 
hearing officer shall issue a separate order setting aside, limiting or 
suspending the temporary sanction then in effect in accordance with the 
terms of the initial decision. The hearing officer shall decline to 
suspend a term or condition of a temporary cease-and-desist order if it 
is found that the continued effectiveness of such term or condition is

            Rules Regarding Disgorgement and Penalty Payments


<R05>
Sec. 201.600  Interest on sums disgorged.

    (a) Interest required. Prejudgment interest shall be due on any sum 
required to be paid pursuant to an order of disgorgement. The 
disgorgement order shall specify each violation that forms the basis for 
the disgorgement ordered; the date which, for purposes of calculating 
disgorgement, each such violation was deemed to have occurred; the 
amount to be disgorged for each such violation; and the total sum to be 
disgorged. Prejudgment interest shall be due from the first day of the 
month following each such violation through the last day of the month 
preceding the month in which payment of disgorgement is made. The order 
shall state the amount of prejudgment interest owed as of the date of 
the disgorgement order and that interest shall continue to accrue on all 
funds owed until they are paid.
    (b) Rate of interest. Interest on the sum to be disgorged shall be 
computed at the underpayment rate of interest established under Section 
6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2), and shall 
be compounded quarterly. The Commission or the hearing officer may, by 
order, specify a lower rate of prejudgment interest as to any funds 
which the respondent has placed in an escrow or otherwise guaranteed for 
payment of disgorgement upon a final determination of the respondent's 
liability. Escrow and other guarantee arrangements must be approved by 
the Commission or the hearing officer prior to entry of the disgorgement 
order.


<R05>
Sec. 201.601  Prompt payment of disgorgement, interest and penalties.

    (a) Timing of payments. Unless otherwise provided, funds due 
pursuant to an order by the Commission requiring the payment of 
disgorgement, interest or penalties shall be paid no later than 21 days 
after service of the order, and funds due pursuant to an order by a 
hearing officer shall be paid on the first day after the order becomes 
final pursuant to Sec. 201.360.
    (b) Stays. A stay of any order requiring the payment of 
disgorgement, interest or penalties may be sought at any time pursuant 
to Sec. 201.401.


<R05>
Sec. 201.610  Submission of proposed plan of disgorgement.

    The Commission or the hearing officer may, at any time, order any 
party to submit a plan for the administration and distribution of 
disgorgement funds. Unless ordered otherwise, the Division of 
Enforcement shall submit a proposed plan no later than 60 days after 
funds or other assets have been turned over by the respondent pursuant 
to a Commission disgorgement order and any appeals of the disgorgement 
order have been waived or completed, or appeal is no longer available.


<R05>
Sec. 201.611  Contents of plan of disgorgement; provisions for payment.

    (a) Required plan elements. Unless otherwise ordered, a plan for the 
administration of a disgorgement fund shall include the following 
elements:
    (1) Procedures for the receipt of additional funds, including the 
specification of an account where funds will be held and the instruments 
in which the funds may be invested;
    (2) Specification of categories of persons potentially eligible to 
receive proceeds from the fund;
    (3) Procedure for providing notice to such persons of the existence 
of the fund and their potential eligibility to receive proceeds of the 
fund;
    (4) Procedures for making and approving claims, procedures for 
handling disputed claims and a cut-off date for the making of claims;
    (5) A proposed date for the termination of the fund, including 
provision for the disposition of any funds not otherwise distributed;
    (6) Procedures for the administration of the fund, including 
selection, compensation and, as necessary, indemnification of a fund 
administrator to oversee the fund, process claims, prepare accountings, 
file tax returns and, subject to the approval of the Commission, make 
distributions from the fund to investors; and

[[Page 184]]

    (7) Such other provisions as the Commission or the hearing officer 
may require.
    (b) Payment to registry of the court or court-appointed receiver. 
Subject to such conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer 
shall deem appropriate, a plan of disgorgement may provide for payment 
of disgorgement funds into a court registry or to a court-appointed 
receiver in any case pending in federal or state court against a 
respondent or any other person based upon a complaint alleging 
violations arising from the same or substantially similar facts as those 
alleged in the Commission's order instituting proceedings.
    (c) Payment to the United States Treasury under certain 
circumstances. When, in the opinion of the Commission or the hearing 
officer, the cost of administering a plan of disgorgement relative to 
the value of the available disgorgement funds and the number of 
potential claimants would not justify distribution of the disgorgement 
funds to injured investors, the plan may provide that the funds shall be 
paid directly to the general fund of the United States Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 201.612  Notice of proposed plan of disgorgement and opportunity for comment by non-parties.

    Notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement shall be published in the 
SEC News Digest, in the SEC Docket, and in such other publications as 
the Commission or the hearing officer may require. The notice shall 
specify how copies of the proposed plan may be obtained and shall state 
that persons desiring to comment on the proposed plan may submit their 
views, in writing, to the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 201.613  Order approving, modifying or disapproving proposed plan of disgorgement.

    At any time more than 30 days after publication of notice of a 
proposed plan of disgorgement, the hearing officer or the Commission 
shall, by order, approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the 
proposed plan. In the discretion of the Commission or the hearing 
officer, a proposed plan of disgorgement that is substantially modified 
prior to adoption may be republished for an additional comment period 
pursuant to Sec. 201.612. The order approving or disapproving the plan 
should be entered within 30 days after the end of the final period 
allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless the Commission or the 
hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good cause 
shown.


<R05>
Sec. 201.614  Administration of plan of disgorgement.

    (a) Appointment and removal of administrator. The Commission or the 
hearing officer shall have discretion to appoint any person, including a 
Commission employee, as administrator of a plan of disgorgement and to 
delegate to that person responsibility for administering the plan. A 
respondent may be required or permitted to administer or assist in 
administering a plan of disgorgement, subject to such terms and 
conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deem appropriate to 
ensure the proper distribution of funds. An administrator may be removed 
at any time by order of the Commission or hearing officer.
    (b) Administrator to post bond. If the administrator is not a 
Commission employee, the administrator shall be required to obtain a 
bond in the manner prescribed by 11 U.S.C. 322, in an amount to be 
approved by the Commission. The cost of the bond may be paid for as a 
cost of administration. The Commission may waive posting of a bond for 
good cause shown.
    (c) Administrator's fees. If the administrator is a Commission 
employee, no fee shall be paid to the administrator for his or her 
services. If the administrator is not a Commission employee, he or she 
may file an application for fees for completed services, and upon 
approval by the Commission or a hearing officer, may be paid a 
reasonable fee for those services. Any objections thereto shall be filed 
within 21 days of service of the application on the parties.
    (d) Source of funds. Unless otherwise ordered, fees and other 
expenses of administering the plan of disgorgement shall be paid first 
from the interest earned on disgorged funds, and if the interest is not 
sufficient, then from the corpus.

[[Page 185]]

    (e) Accountings. During the first 10 days of each calendar quarter, 
or as otherwise directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, the 
administrator shall file an accounting of all monies earned or received 
and all monies spent in connection with the administration of the plan 
of disgorgement. A final accounting shall be submitted for approval of 
the Commission or hearing officer prior to discharge of the 
administrator and cancellation of the administrator's bond, if any.
    (f) Amendment. A plan may be amended upon motion by any party or the 
plan administrator or upon the Commission's or hearing officer's own 
motion.


<R05>
Sec. 201.620  Right to challenge order of disgorgement.

    Other than in connection with the opportunity to submit comments as 
provided in Sec. 201.612, no person shall be granted leave to intervene 
or to participate in a proceeding or otherwise to appear to challenge an 
order of disgorgement; or an order approving, approving with 
modifications, or disapproving a plan of disgorgement; or any 
determination relating to a plan of disgorgement based solely upon that 
person's eligibility or potential eligibility to participate in a 
disgorgement fund or based upon any private right of action such person 
may have against any person who is also a respondent in an enforcement 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 201.630  Inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties.

    (a) Generally. In any proceeding in which an order requiring payment 
of disgorgement, interest or penalties may be entered, a respondent may 
present evidence of an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or a 
penalty. The Commission may, in its discretion, or the hearing officer 
may, in his or her discretion, consider evidence concerning ability to 
pay in determining whether disgorgement, interest or a penalty is in the 
public interest.
    (b) Financial disclosure statement. Any respondent who asserts an 
inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties may be required to 
file a sworn financial disclosure statement and to keep the statement 
current. The financial statement shall show the respondent's assets, 
liabilities, income or other funds received and expenses or other 
payments, from the date of the first violation alleged against that 
respondent in the order instituting proceedings, or such later date as 
specified by the Commission or a hearing officer, to the date of the 
order requiring the disclosure statement to be filed. By order, the 
Commission or the hearing officer may prescribe the use of the 
Disclosure of Assets and Financial Information Form (see Form D-A at 
Sec. 209.1 of this chapter) or any other form, may specify other time 
periods for which disclosure is required, and may require such other 
information as deemed necessary to evaluate a claim of inability to pay.
    (c) Confidentiality. Any respondent submitting financial information 
pursuant to this section or Sec. 201.410(c) may make a motion, pursuant 
to Sec. 201.322, for the issuance of a protective order against 
disclosure of the information submitted to the public or to any parties 
other than the Division of Enforcement. Prior to a ruling on the motion, 
no party receiving information as to which a motion for a protective 
order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any other 
person without the prior permission of the Commission or the hearing 
officer.
    (d) Service required. Notwithstanding any provision of Sec. 201.322, 
a copy of the financial disclosure statement shall be served on the 
Division of Enforcement.
    (e) Failure to file required financial information: sanction. Any 
respondent who, after making a claim of inability to pay either 
disgorgement, interest or a penalty, fails to file a financial 
disclosure statement when such a filing has been ordered or is required 
by rule may, in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, 
be deemed to have waived the claim of inability to pay. No sanction 
pursuant to Secs. 201.155 or 201.180 shall be imposed for a failure to 
file such a statement.

      Informal Procedures and Supplementary Information Concerning 
                        Adjudicatory Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 201.900  Informal Procedures and Supplementary Information Concerning Adjudicatory Proceedings.

    (a) Guidelines for the timely completion of proceedings.(1) Timely 
resolution of adjudicatory proceedings is one factor in assessing the 
effectiveness of the adjudicatory program in protecting investors, 
promoting public confidence in the securities markets and assuring 
respondents a fair hearing. Establishment of guidelines for the timely 
completion of key phases of contested administrative proceedings 
provides a standard for both the Commission and the public to gauge the 
Commission's adjudicatory program on this criterion. The Commission has 
directed that, to the extent possible:
    (i) An administrative law judge's initial decision should be filed 
with the Secretary within 10 months of issuance of the order instituting 
proceedings.
    (ii) A decision by the Commission on review of an interlocutory 
matter should be completed within 45 days of the date set for filing the 
final brief on the matter submitted for review.
    (iii) A decision by the Commission on a motion to stay a decision 
that has already taken effect or that will take effect within five days 
of the filing of the motion, should be issued within five days of the 
date set for filing of the opposition to the motion for a stay. If the 
decision complained of has not taken effect, the Commission's decision 
should be issued within 45 days of the date set for filing of the 
opposition to the motion for a stay.
    (iv) A decision by the Commission with respect to an appeal from the 
initial decision of a hearing officer, a review of a determination by a 
self-regulatory organization, or a remand of a prior Commission decision 
by a court of appeals should be issued within 11 months from the date 
the petition for review, application for review, or mandate of the court 
is filed.
    (2) The guidelines in this paragraph (a) do not create a requirement 
that each portion of a proceeding or the entire proceeding be completed 
within the periods described. Among other reasons, a proceeding at 
either the hearing stage or on review by the Commission may require 
additional time because it is unusually complex or because the record is 
exceptionally long. In addition, fairness is enhanced if the 
Commission's deliberative process is not constrained by an inflexible 
schedule. In some proceedings, deliberation may be delayed by the need 
to consider more urgent matters, to permit the preparation of dissenting 
opinions, or for other good cause. The guidelines will be used by the 
Commission as one of several criteria in monitoring and evaluating its 
adjudicatory program. The guidelines will be examined periodically, and, 
if necessary, readjusted in light of changes in the pending caseload and 
the available level of staff resources.
    (b) Reports to the Commission on pending cases. The administrative 
law judges, the Secretary and the General Counsel have each been 
delegated authority to issue certain orders or adjudicate certain 
proceedings. See 17 CFR 200.30-1 et seq. Proceedings are also assigned 
to the General Counsel for the preparation of a proposed order or 
opinion which will then be recommended to the Commission for 
consideration. In order to improve accountability by and to the 
Commission for management of the docket, the Commission has directed 
that confidential status reports with respect to all filed adjudicatory 
proceedings shall be made periodically to the Commission. These reports 
will be made through the Secretary, with a minimum frequency established 
by the Commission. In connection with these periodic reports, if a 
proceeding assigned to an administrative law judge or pending before the 
Commission has not been concluded within 30 days of the guidelines 
established in paragraph (a) of this section, the Chief Administrative 
Law Judge or the General Counsel, respectively, shall specifically 
apprise the Commission of that fact, and shall describe the procedural 
posture of the case, project an estimated date for conclusion of the 
proceeding, and provide such other information as is necessary to enable 
the Commission to determine whether additional steps

[[Page 187]]

are necessary to reach a fair and timely resolution of the matter.
    (c) Publication of information concerning the pending case docket. 
Ongoing disclosure of information about the adjudication program 
caseload increases awareness of the importance of the program, 
facilitates oversight of the program and promotes confidence in the 
efficiency and fairness of the program by investors, securities industry 
participants, self-regulatory organizations and other members of the 
public. The Commission has directed the Secretary to publish in the SEC 
Docket in the first and seventh months of each fiscal year summary 
statistical information about the status of pending adjudicatory 
proceedings and changes in the Commission's caseload over the prior six 
months. The report will include the number of cases pending before the 
administrative law judges and the Commission at the beginning and end of 
the six-month period. The report will also show increases in the 
caseload arising from new cases being instituted, appealed or remanded 
to the Commission and decreases in the caseload arising from the 
disposition of proceedings by issuance of initial decisions, issuance of 
final decisions issued on appeal of initial decisions, other 
dispositions of appeals of initial decisions, final decisions on review 
of self-regulatory organization determinations, other dispositions on 
review of self-regulatory organization determinations, and decisions 
with respect to stays or interlocutory motions. For each category of 
decision, the report shall also show the median age of the cases at the 
time of the decision and the number of cases decided within the 
guidelines for the timely completion of adjudicatory proceedings.

Sec. 202.1  General.

    (a) The statutes administered by the Commission provide generally 
(1) for the filing with it of certain statements, such as registration 
statements, periodic and ownership reports, and proxy solicitation 
material, and for the filing of certain plans of reorganization, 
applications and declarations seeking Commission approvals; (2) for 
Commission determination through formal procedures of matters initiated 
by private parties or by the Commission; (3) for the investigation and 
examination of persons and records where necessary to carry out the 
purposes of the statutes and for enforcement of statutory provisions; 
and (4) for the adoption of rules and regulations where necessary to 
effectuate the purposes of the statutes.
    (b) In addition to the Commission's rules of practice set forth in 
part 201 of this chapter, the Commission has promulgated rules and 
regulations pursuant to the several statutes it administers (parts 230, 
240, 250, 260, 270 and 275 of this chapter). These parts contain 
substantive provisions and include as well numerous provisions detailing 
the procedure for meeting specific standards embodied in the statutes. 
The Commission's rules and regulations under each of the statutes are 
available in pamphlet form upon request to the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
    (c) The statutes and the published rules, regulations and forms 
thereunder prescribe the course and method of formal procedures to be 
followed in Commission proceedings. These are supplemented where 
feasible by certain informal procedures designed to aid the public and 
facilitate the execution of the Commission's functions. There follows a 
brief description of procedures generally followed by the Commission 
which have not been formalized in rules.
    (d) The informal procedures of the Commission are largely concerned 
with the rendering of advice and assistance by the Commission's staff to 
members of the public dealing with the Commission. While opinions 
expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official 
expression of the Commission's views, they represent the views of 
persons who are continuously working with the provisions of the statute 
involved. And any statement by the director, associate director, 
assistant director, chief accountant, chief counsel, or chief financial 
analyst of a division can be relied upon as representing the views of 
that division. In certain instances an informal statement of the views 
of the Commission may be obtained. The staff, upon request or on its own 
motion, will generally present

[[Page 192]]

questions to the Commission which involve matters of substantial 
importance and where the issues are novel or highly complex, although 
the granting of a request for an informal statement by the Commission is 
entirely within its discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 202.2  Pre-filing assistance and interpretative advice.

    The staff of the Commission renders interpretative and advisory 
assistance to members of the general public, prospective registrants, 
applicants and declarants. For example, persons having a question 
regarding the availability of an exemption may secure informal 
administrative interpretations of the applicable statute or rule as they 
relate to the particular facts and circumstances presented. Similarly, 
persons contemplating filings with the Commission may receive advice of 
a general nature as to the preparation thereof, including information as 
to the forms to be used and the scope of the items contained in the 
forms. Inquiries may be directed to an appropriate officer of the 
Commission's staff. In addition, informal discussions with members of 
the staff may be arranged whenever feasible, at the Commission's central 
office or, except in connection with matters under the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935 and certain matters under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, at one of its regional or district offices.

[25 FR 6736, July 15, 1960, as amended at 59 FR 5945, Feb. 9, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 202.3  Processing of filings.

    (a) Registration statements, proxy statements, letters of 
notification, periodic reports, applications for qualification of 
indentures, and similar documents filed with the Commission under the 
Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and certain 
filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935 are routed to the Division of Corporation 
Finance, which passes initially on the adequacy of disclosure and 
recommends the initial action to be taken. If the filing appears to 
afford inadequate disclosure, as for example through omission of 
material information or through violation of accepted accounting 
principles and practices, the usual practice is to bring the deficiency 
to the attention of the person who filed the document by letter from the 
Assistant Director assigned supervision over the particular filing, and 
to afford a reasonable opportunity to discuss the matter and make the 
necessary corrections. This informal procedure is not generally employed 
when the deficiencies appear to stem from careless disregard of the 
statutes and rules or a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead or 
where the Commission deems formal proceedings necessary in the public 
interest. If an electronic filing is not prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the current EDGAR Filer Manual, the filing may be 
suspended and the filer so notified. Reasonable opportunity will be 
afforded the filer to make the necessary corrections or resubmit the 
filing as needed. Where it appears that the filing affords adequate 
disclosure, acceleration of its effectiveness when appropriate normally 
will be granted. A similar procedure is followed with respect to filings 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and certain filings relating to 
investment companies under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, which are 
routed to the Division of Investment Management, and filings under the 
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which are also routed to the 
Division of Investment Management. A similar procedure is also followed 
in the Commission's Regional Offices with respect to registration 
statements on Forms SB-1 and SB-2 (17 CFR 239.9 and 239.10) and related 
filings under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
    (b)(1) Applications for registration as brokers, dealers, investment 
advisers, municipal securities dealers and transfer agents are submitted 
to the Office of Filings and Information Services where they are 
examined to determine whether all necessary information has been 
supplied and whether all required financial statements and other 
documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective applications may 
be returned with a request for correction or

held until corrected before being accepted as a filing. The files of the 
Commission and other sources of information are considered to determine 
whether any person connected with the applicant appears to have engaged 
in activities which would warrant commencement of proceedings on the 
question of denial of registration. The staff confers with applicants 
and makes suggestions in appropriate cases for amendments and 
supplemental information. Where it appears appropriate in the public 
interest and where a basis therefore exists, denial proceedings may be 
instituted. Within 45 days of the date of the filing of a broker-dealer, 
investment adviser or municipal securities dealer application (or within 
such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission 
shall by order grant registration or institute proceedings to determine 
whether registration should be denied. An application for registration 
as a transfer agent shall become effective within 30 days after receipt 
of the application (or within such shorter period as the Commission may 
determine). The Office of Filings and Information Services is also 
responsible for the processing and substantive examination of statements 
of beneficial ownership of securities and changes in such ownership 
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act of 1935, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and 
for the examination of reports filed pursuant to Sec. 230.144 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Applications for registration as national securities exchanges, 
or exemption from registration as exchanges by reason of such exchanges' 
limited volume of transactions filed with the Commission are routed to 
the Division of Market Regulation, which examines these applications to 
determine whether all necessary information has been supplied and 
whether all required financial statements and other documents have been 
furnished in proper form. Defective applications may be returned with a 
request for correction or held until corrected before being accepted as 
a filing. The files of the Commission and other sources of information 
are considered to determine whether any person connected with the 
applicant appears to have engaged in activities which would warrant 
commencement of proceedings on the question of denial of registration. 
The staff confers with applicants and makes suggestions in appropriate 
cases for amendments and supplemental information. Where it appears 
appropriate in the public interest and where a basis therefore exists, 
denial proceedings may be instituted. Within 90 days of the date of the 
filing of an application for registration as a national securities 
exchange, or exemption from registration by reason of such exchanges' 
limited volume of transactions (or within such longer period as to which 
the applicant consents), the Commission shall by order grant 
registration, or institute proceedings to determine whether registration 
should be denied as provided in Sec. 240.19(a)(1) of this chapter.

Sec. 202.3a  Instructions for filing fees.

    Payment of filing fees specified by the following rules shall be 
made according to the directions listed in this part: Sec. 230.111 (17

Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Personal checks cannot be 
accepted for payment of fees. To ensure proper posting, all filers must 
include their assigned CIK account numbers on fee payments. If a third 
party submits a fee payment, the fee payment must specify the account 
number to which the fee is to be applied. Filing fees paid pursuant to 
Section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, including fees paid pursuant 
to section 24(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-
24(f)) or pursuant to Section 307(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 
should be designated as ``restricted,'' except that filing fees paid 
with respect to registration statements filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) 
(Sec. 230.462(b) of this chapter) should be designated as 
``unrestricted.'' Specific instructions on the various methods of making 
fee payments to the lockbox depository are as follows:
    (a) Wire transfer: Those who wish to wire fee payments may use any 
bank or wire transfer service to initiate the transaction. All remitters 
must follow standard Federal Reserve instructions to ensure that fees 
transferred are received and identifiable. Specific information required 
for transmission to the Mellon Bank is listed below. Where an item is in 
boldface type, the entry should be made exactly as indicated. Where an 
item is in italics, the filer-specific information should be included.
    (1) Receiving Bank's ABA Number (field two); 043000261
    (2) Type Code (field three): 1040
    (3) Name of registrant and name of payor, if different (field nine): 
ORG= registrant's name/payor's name (if different)
    (4) Receiving Bank's Name (field ten): MELLONBANK
    (5) Transaction Code (field eleven): CTR/
    (6) Beneficiary of payment (field twelve): BNF=SEC/AC-9108739/WRE

<R05>
Sec. 202.4  Facilitating administrative hearings.

    (a) Applications, declarations, and other requests involving formal 
Commission action after opportunity for hearing are scrutinized by the 
appropriate division for conformance with applicable statutory standards 
and Commission rules and generally the filing party is advised of 
deficiencies. Prior to passing upon applications and declarations the 
Commission receives the views of all interested persons at public 
hearings whenever appropriate; hence, any applicant or declarant seeking 
Commission approval of proposed transactions by a particular time should 
file his application or declaration in time to allow for the 
presentation and consideration of such views.
    (b) After the staff has had an opportunity to study an application 
or declaration, interested persons may informally discuss the problems 
therein raised to the extent that time and the nature of the case permit 
(e.g., consideration is usually given to whether the proceeding is 
contested and if so to the nature of the contest). In such event, the 
staff will, to the extent feasible, advise as to the nature of the 
issues raised by the filing, the necessity for any amendments to the 
documents filed, the type of evidence it believes should be presented at 
the hearing and, in some instances, the nature, form, and contents of 
documents to be submitted as formal exhibits. The staff will, in 
addition, generally advise as to Commission policy in past cases which 
dealt with the same subject matter as the filing under consideration.
    (c) During the course of the hearings, the staff is generally 
available for informal discussions to reconcile bona fide divergent 
views not only between itself and other persons interested in the 
proceedings, but among all interested persons; and, when circumstances 
permit, an attempt is made to narrow, if possible, the issues to be 
considered at the formal hearing.
    (d) In some instances the Commission in the order accompanying its 
findings and opinion reserves jurisdiction over certain matters relating 
to the proceeding, such as payment of fees and expenses, accounting 
entries, terms and conditions relating to securities to be issued, and 
other matters. In such cases, upon receipt of satisfactory information 
and data the Commission considers whether further hearing is required 
before releasing jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 202.5  Enforcement activities.

    (a) Where, from complaints received from members of the public, 
communications from Federal or State agencies, examination of filings 
made with the Commission, or otherwise, it appears that there may be 
violation of the acts administered by the Commission or the rules or 
regulations thereunder, a preliminary investigation is generally made. 
In such preliminary investigation no process is issued or testimony 
compelled. The Commission may, in its discretion, make such formal 
investigations and authorize the use of process as it deems necessary to 
determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to 
violate any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules of a 
self-regulatory organization of which the person is a member or 
participant. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the 
investigation or examination is non-public and the reports thereon are 
for staff and Commission use only.
    (b) After investigation or otherwise the Commission may in its 
discretion take one or more of the following actions: Institution of 
administrative proceedings looking to the imposition of remedial 
sanctions, initiation of injunctive proceedings in the courts, and, in 
the case of a willful violation, reference of the matter to the 
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Commission may also, 
on some occasions, refer the matter to, or grant requests for access to 
its files

[[Page 196]]

made by, domestic and foreign governmental authorities or foreign 
securities authorities, self-regulatory organizations such as stock 
exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and 
other persons or entities.
    (c) Persons who become involved in preliminary or formal 
investigations may, on their own initiative, submit a written statement 
to the Commission setting forth their interests and position in regard 
to the subject matter of the investigation. Upon request, the staff, in 
its discretion, may advise such persons of the general nature of the 
investigation, including the indicated violations as they pertain to 
them, and the amount of time that may be available for preparing and 
submitting a statement prior to the presentation of a staff 
recommendation to the Commission for the commencement of an 
administrative or injunction proceeding. Submissions by interested 
persons should be forwarded to the appropriate Division Director, 
Regional Director, or District Administrator with a copy to the staff 
members conducting the investigation and should be clearly referenced to 
the specific investigation to which they relate. In the event a 
recommendation for the commencement of an enforcement proceeding is 
presented by the staff, any submissions by interested persons will be 
forwarded to the Commission in conjunction with the staff memorandum.
    (d) In instances where the staff has concluded its investigation of 
a particular matter and has determined that it will not recommend the 
commencement of an enforcement proceeding against a person, the staff, 
in its discretion, may advise the party that its formal investigation 
has been terminated. Such advice if given must in no way be construed as 
indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may 
ultimately result from the staff's investigation of the particular 
matter.
    (e) The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit 
brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory 
nature pending before it, it is important to avoid creating, or 
permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered 
or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur. 
Accordingly, it hereby announces its policy not to permit a defendant or 
respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction 
while denying the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings. 
In this regard, the Commission believes that a refusal to admit the 
allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or 
respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.
    (f) In the course of the Commission's investigations, civil 
lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, the staff, with appropriate 
authorization, may discuss with persons involved the disposition of such 
matters by consent, by settlement, or in some other manner. It is the 
policy of the Commission, however, that the disposition of any such 
matter may not, expressly or impliedly, extend to any criminal charges 
that have been, or may be, brought against any such person or any 
recommendation with respect thereto. Accordingly, any person involved in 
an enforcement matter before the Commission who consents, or agrees to 
consent, to any judgment or order does so solely for the purpose of 
resolving the claims against him in that investigative, civil, or 
administrative matter and not for the purpose of resolving any criminal 
charges that have been, or might be, brought against him. This policy 
reflects the fact that neither the Commission nor its staff has the 
authority or responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or 
otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and 
responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and representatives of 
the Department of Justice.

Sec. 202.6  Adoption, revision, and rescission of rules and regulations of general application.

    (a) The procedure followed by the Commission in connection with the 
adoption, revision, and rescission of rules of general application 
necessarily

[[Page 197]]

varies in accordance with the nature of the rule, the extent of public 
interest therein, and the necessity for speed in its adoption. Rules 
relating to Commission organization, procedure and management, for 
example, are generally adopted by the Commission without affording 
public discussion thereof. On the other hand, in the adoption of 
substantive rules materially affecting an industry or a segment of the 
public, such as accounting rules, every feasible effort is made in 
advance of adoption to receive the views of persons to be affected. In 
such cases, proposals for the adoption, revision, or rescission of rules 
are initiated either by the Commission or by members of the public, and 
to the extent practicable, the practices set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section are observed.
    (b) After preliminary consideration by the Commission a draft of the 
proposed rule is published in the Federal Register and mailed to 
interested persons (e.g., other interested regulatory bodies, principal 
registrants or persons to be affected, stock exchanges, professional 
societies and leading authorities on the subject concerned and other 
persons requesting such draft) for comments. Unless accorded 
confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of the Commission, 
written comments filed with the Commission on or before the closing date 
for comments become a part of the public record upon the proposed rule. 
The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the public 
record written comments received by the Commission after the closing 
date.
    (c) Following analysis of comments received, the rule may be adopted 
in the form published or in a revised form in the light of such 
comments. In some cases, a revised draft is prepared and published and, 
where appropriate, an oral hearing may be held before final action upon 
the proposal. Any interested person may appear at the hearing and/or may 
submit written comment for consideration in accordance with the 
Commission's notice of the rulemaking procedure to be followed. The rule 
in the form in which it is adopted by the Commission is publicly 
released and is published in the Federal Register.

exchange members, brokers and dealers required by Sec. 240.17a-5 of this

Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (b) Electronic filings. All documents required to be filed in 
electronic format with the Commission pursuant to the federal securities 
laws or the rules and regulations thereunder shall be filed at the 
principal office in Washington, DC via EDGAR by delivery to the 
Commission of a magnetic tape or diskette, or by direct transmission.

Sec. 202.9  Small entity enforcement penalty reduction policy.

    The Commission's policy with respect to whether to reduce or assess 
civil money penalties against a small entity is:
    (a) The Commission will consider on a case-by-case basis whether to 
reduce or not assess civil money penalties against a small entity. In 
determining whether to reduce or not assess penalties against a specific 
small entity, the following considerations will apply:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, penalty 
reduction will not be available for any small entity if:
    (i) The small entity was subject previously to an enforcement 
action;
    (ii) Any of the small entity's violations involved willful or 
criminal conduct; or
    (iii) The small entity did not make a good faith effort to comply 
with the law.
    (2) In considering whether the Commission will reduce or refrain 
from assessing a civil money penalty, the Commission may consider:
    (i) The egregiousness of the violations;
    (ii) The isolated or repeated nature of the violations;
    (iii) The violator's state of mind when committing the violations;
    (iv) The violator's history (if any) of legal or regulatory 
violations;
    (v) The extent to which the violator cooperated during the 
investigation;
    (vi) Whether the violator has engaged in subsequent remedial efforts 
to mitigate the effects of the violation and to prevent future 
violations;
    (vii) The degree to which a penalty will deter the violator or 
others from committing future violations; and
    (viii) Any other relevant fact.
    (3) The Commission also may consider whether to reduce or not assess 
a civil money penalty against a small entity, including a small entity 
otherwise excluded from this policy under paragraphs (a)(1) (i)-(iii) of 
this section, if the small entity can demonstrate to the Commission's 
satisfaction that it is financially unable to pay the penalty, 
immediately or over a reasonable period of time, in whole or in part.
    (4) For purposes of this policy, an entity qualifies as ``small'' if 
it is a small business or small organization as defined by Commission 
rules adopted for the purpose of compliance with the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.<SUP>1</SUP> An entity not included in these definitions 
will be considered ``small'' for purposes of this policy if it meets the 
total asset amount that applies to issuers as set forth in Sec. 230.157a 
of this chapter.<SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Pursuant to the Reg. Flex. Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 601(3), the 
Commission has adopted appropriate definitions of ``small business'' for 
purposes of the Reg. Flex. Act. See 17 CFR 270.0-10, 275.0-7, 240.0-10, 
230.157, 250.110, and 260.0-7. The Commission recently proposed 
amendments to certain of these definitions. Definitions of ``Small 
Business'' or ``Small Organization'' Under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, and the Securities Act of 1933, Securities Act Rel. No. 7383, 
62 FR 4106 (Jan. 28, 1997). The Commission extended the comment period 
for the proposed amendments to April 30, 1997, 62 FR 13356 (Mar. 20, 
1997). Based on an analysis of the language and legislative history of 
the Reg. Flex. Act, Congress does not appear to have intended that Act 
to apply to natural persons (as opposed to individual proprietorships) 
or to foreign entities. The Commission understands that staff at the 
Small Business Administration have taken the same position.
    \2\ At present, this threshold is $5 million. Thus, non-regulated 
entities, such as general partnerships, privately held corporations or 
professional service organizations, with assets of $5 million or less 
may qualify for penalty-reduction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) This policy does not create a right or remedy for any person. 
This policy shall not apply to any remedy that may be sought by the 
Commission other than civil money penalties, whether or not such other 
remedy may be characterized as penal or remedial.

[37 FR 25166, Nov. 28, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 203.7  Rights of witnesses.

    (a) Any person who is compelled or requested to furnish documentary 
evidence or testimony at a formal investigative proceeding shall, upon 
request, be shown the Commission's order of investigation. Copies of 
formal orders of investigation shall not be furnished, for their 
retention, to such persons requesting the same except with the express 
approval of officials in the Regional or District Offices at the level 
of Assistant Regional Director or District Administrator or higher, or 
officials in the Division or Divisions conducting or supervising the 
investigation at the level of Assistant Director or higher. Such 
approval shall not be given unless the person granting such approval, in 
his or her discretion, is satisfied that there exist reasons consistent 
both with the protection of privacy of persons involved in the 
investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of the investigation.
    (b) Any person compelled to appear, or who appears by request or 
permission of the Commission, in person at a formal investigative 
proceeding may be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel, as 
defined in Sec. 201.101(a) of this chapter (Rule 101(a) of the

of such examination, (2) question such person briefly at the conclusion 
of the examination to clarify any of the answers such person has given, 
and (3) make summary notes during such examination solely for the use of 
such person.
    (d) Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, in any public formal 
investigative proceeding, if the record shall contain implications of 
wrongdoing by any person, such person shall have the right to appear on 
the record; and in addition to the rights afforded other witnesses 
hereby, he shall have a reasonable opportunity of cross-examination and 
production of rebuttal testimony or documentary evidence. Reasonable 
shall mean permitting persons as full an opportunity to assert their 
position as may be granted consistent with administrative efficiency and 
with avoidance of undue delay. The determination of reasonableness in 
each instance shall be made in the discretion of the officer conducting 
the investigation.
    (e) The officer conducting the investigation may report to the 
Commission any instances where any witness or counsel has been guilty of 
dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct during the course of an 
investigation or any other instance of violation of these rules. The 
Commission will thereupon take such further action as the circumstances 
may warrant, including suspension or disbarment of counsel from further 
appearance or practice before it, in accordance with Sec. 201.2(e) of 
this chapter (Rule 2(e) of the Commission's rules of practice), or 
exclusion from further participation in the particular investigation.

                    Subpart A--Administrative Offset

    Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3716, 4 CFR 102.

    Source: 58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 204.1  Applicability and scope.

    (a) The procedures authorized for administrative offset are 
contained in Section 10 of the Debt Collection Act (codified at 31 
U.S.C. 3716). The Act requires that notice procedures be observed by the 
agency. The debtor is also afforded an opportunity to inspect and copy 
government records pertaining to the claim, enter into an agreement for 
repayment, and to a review of the claim (if requested). Like salary 
offset, agencies may cooperate with one another in order to effectuate 
recovery of the claim.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to the collection of debts 
owed to the United States arising from transactions with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (Commission). Administrative offset is 
authorized under Section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, 
as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3716). These 
regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards 
on administrative offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and 
the General Accounting Office (4 CFR part 102).


<R05>
Sec. 204.2  Definitions.

    (a) Administrative offset as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1) means 
withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by 
the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the 
Government.
    (b) Person includes a natural person or persons, profit or nonprofit 
corporation, partnership, association, trust, estate, consortium, or 
other entity which is capable of owing a debt to the United States 
Government except that agencies of the United States, or of any State or 
local government shall be excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 204.3  General.

    (a) The Chairperson of the Commission (or designee) will determine 
the feasibility of collection by administrative offset on a case-by-case 
basis for each claim established. The Chairperson (or designee) will 
consider the

[[Page 202]]

following issues in making a determination to collect a claim by 
administrative offset:
    (1) Can administrative offset be accomplished?
    (2) Is administrative offset practical and legal?
    (3) Does administrative offset best serve and protect the interest 
of the U.S. Government?
    (4) Is administrative offset appropriate given the debtor's 
financial condition?
    (b) The Chairperson (or designee) may initiate administrative offset 
with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United 
States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another 
agency or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists 
and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
    (c) The Chairperson (or designee) may request another agency which 
holds funds payable to a Commission debtor to offset that debt against 
the funds held and will provide certification that:
    (1) The debt exists; and
    (2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
    (d) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt 
that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material 
to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and 
reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials 
responsible for discovering the debt.
    (e) Administrative offset under this subpart may not be initiated 
against:
    (1) A debt in which administrative offset of the type of debt 
involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute;
    (2) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any 
State or local Government; or
    (3) Debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; the 
Social Security Act; or the tariff laws of the United States.
    (f) The procedures for administrative offset in this subpart do not 
apply to the offset of Federal salaries under 5 U.S.C. 5514.


<R05>
Sec. 204.4  Demand for payment--notice.

    (a) Whenever possible, the Commission will seek written consent from 
the debtor to initiate immediate collection before starting the formal 
notification process.
    (b) In cases where written agreement to collect cannot be obtained 
from the debtor, a formal notification process shall be followed, (4 CFR 
102.2). Prior to collecting a claim by administrative offset, the 
Commission shall send to the debtor, by certified or registered mail 
with return receipt, a written demand for payment in terms which inform 
the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. A total of three 
progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30 day intervals 
will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand 
indicates that a further demand would be futile or the debtor's response 
does not require rebuttal, or other pertinent information indicates that 
additional written demands would be unnecessary. In determining the 
timing of the demand letters, the Commission should give due regard to 
the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, if necessary to 
refer the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, such 
referral can be made within one year of the final determination of the 
fact and the amount of the debt. When appropriate to protect the 
Government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute of 
limitations from expiring), written demand may be preceded by other 
appropriate actions, including immediate referral for litigation.
    (c) Before offset is made, a written notice will be sent to the 
debtor. This notice will include:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) The date when payment is due (not less than thirty days from the 
date of mailing or hand delivery of the notice);
    (3) The agency's intention to collect the debt by administrative 
offset, including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to 
help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment 
by the payment due date or has not made an arrangement for payment by 
the payment due date;

[[Page 203]]

    (4) Any provision for interest, late payment penalties and 
administrative charges, if payment is not received by the due date;
    (5) The possible reporting of the claim to consumer reporting 
agencies and the possibility that the Commission will forward the claim 
to a collection agency;
    (6) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the Commission's 
records related to the claim;
    (7) The right of the debtor to request a review of the determination 
of indebtedness and, in the circumstances described below, to request an 
oral hearing from the Commission's designee;
    (8) The right of the debtor to enter into a written agreement with 
the agency to repay the debt in some other way; and
    (9) In appropriate cases, the right of the debtor to request a 
waiver.
    (d) Claims for payment of travel advances and employee training 
expenses require notification prior to administrative offset as 
described in this section. Because no oral hearing is required, notice 
of the right to a hearing need not be included in the notification.


<R05>
Sec. 204.5  Debtor's failure to respond.

    If the debtor fails to respond to the notice described in Sec. 204.4 
(c) by the proposed effective date specified in the notice, the 
Commission may take further action under this section or under the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 105). The 
Commission may collect by administrative offset if the debtor:
    (a) Has not made payment by the payment due date;
    (b) Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set 
out in Sec. 204.6; or
    (c) Has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date.


<R05>
Sec. 204.6  Agency review.

    (a) A debtor may dispute the existence of the debt, the amount of 
the debt, or the terms of repayment. A request to review a disputed debt 
must be submitted to the Commission official who provided notification 
within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice described 
in Sec. 204.4(c).
    (b) The Commission will provide a copy of the record to the debtor 
and advise him/her to furnish available evidence to support his or her 
position. Upon receipt of the evidence, the written record of 
indebtedness will be reviewed and the debtor will be informed of the 
results of that review.
    (c) Pending the resolution of a dispute by the debtor, transactions 
in any of the debtor's accounts maintained by the Commission may be 
temporarily suspended. Depending on the type of transaction, the 
suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as 
prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the 
dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be 
immediately lifted.
    (d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs authorized under the Federal Claims Collection Act 
of 1966, as amended, will continue to accrue.


<R05>
Sec. 204.7  Hearing.

    (a) A debtor will be provided a reasonable opportunity for an oral 
hearing by the Commission's designee when:
    (1) (i) By statute, consideration must be given to a request to 
waive the indebtedness;
    (ii) The debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness; and
    (iii) The waiver determination rests on an issue of creditability or 
veracity; or
    (2) The debtor requests reconsideration and the Commission's 
designee determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved 
by reviewing the documentary evidence.
    (b) In cases where an oral hearing is provided to the debtor, the 
Commission's designee will conduct the hearing, and provide the debtor 
with a written decision 30 days after the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 204.8  Written agreement for repayment.

    If the debtor requests a repayment agreement in place of offset, the 
Commission has discretion and should use sound judgment to determine 
whether to accept a repayment agreement in place of offset. If the debt 
is delinquent

[[Page 204]]

and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, the Commission 
will not accept a repayment agreement in place of offset unless the 
debtor is able to establish that offset would cause undue financial 
hardship or be unjust. No repayment arrangement will be considered 
unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty 
of perjury, reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and 
expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within ten business 
days of the Commission's request for the statement. At the Commission's 
option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety may be 
required for installment agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 
4 CFR part 103 and 31 CFR 5.3.


<R05>
Sec. 204.9  Administrative offset procedures.

    (a) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review 
within the time specified in Sec. 204.4, or if as a result of the 
review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement 
is executed, then administrative offset shall be ordered in accordance 
with this subpart without further notice.
    (b) Travel advance. The Commission will deduct outstanding advances 
provided to Commission travelers from other amounts owed the traveler by 
the agency whenever possible and practicable. Monies owed by an employee 
for outstanding travel advances that cannot be deducted from other 
travel amounts due that employee will be collected through salary offset 
as described in subpart B of this part.
    (c) Requests for offset to other Federal agencies. The Chairperson 
(or his or her designee) may request that a debt owed to the Commission 
be administratively offset against funds due and payable to a debtor by 
another Federal agency. In requesting administrative offset, the 
Commission, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency 
holding funds of the debtor:
    (1) That the debtor owes the debt;
    (2) The amount and basis of the debt; and
    (3) That the Commission has complied with the requirements of 31 
U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations and the 
applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102 with respect to providing the 
debtor with due process.
    (d) Requests for offset from other Federal agencies. Any Federal 
agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the 
Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to 
such Federal agency by the debtor. The Commission shall initiate the 
requested offset only upon:
    (1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency:
    (i) That the debtor owes the debt;
    (ii) The amount and basis of the debt;
    (iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of 
administrative offset; and
    (iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset 
regulations and with the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102, 
including providing any required hearing or review.
    (2) A determination by the Commission that collection by offset 
against funds payable by the Commission would be in the best interest of 
the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the 
particular case, and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 204.10  Civil and Foreign Service Retirement Fund.

    (a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Commission may request 
that monies due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund, the Foreign Service Retirement Fund or 
any other Federal retirement fund be administratively offset in 
reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal 
number of payments, debts owed the United States by the debtor. Such 
requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the respective 
fund servicing agency in accordance with such regulations as may be 
prescribed by the Chairperson of that agency. The requests for 
administrative offset will certify in writing the following:
    (1) The debtor owes the United States a debt and the amount of the 
debt;

[[Page 205]]

    (2) The Commission has complied with applicable regulations and 
procedures; and
    (3) The Commission has followed the requirements of the Federal 
Claims Collection Standards as described in this subpart.
    (b) Once the Commission decides to request offset under paragraph 
(a) of this section, it will make the request as soon as practical after 
completion of the applicable procedures in order that the fund servicing 
agency may identify and flag the debtor's account in anticipation of the 
time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments 
from the fund. This will satisfy any requirements that offset be 
initiated prior to expiration of the statute of limitations.
    (c) If the Commission collects part or all of the debt by other 
means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Commission shall act promptly to modify or 
terminate its request for offset.
    (d) This section does not require or authorize the fund servicing 
agency to review the merits of Commission's determination relative to 
the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 204.11  Jeopardy procedure.

    The Commission may effect an administrative offset against a payment 
to be made to the debtor prior to the completion of the procedures 
required by Sec. 204.4(c) if failure to take the offset would 
substantially jeopardize the Commission's ability to collect the debt, 
and the time available before the payment is to be made does not 
reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset 
shall be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. 
Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the 
Commission shall be promptly refunded.

least 30 calendar days prior to offsetting his/her salary. A program 
official need not notify an employee of adjustments to pay in connection 
with the employee's election of coverage or change in coverage under a 
Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the 
amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. 
When required, the written notice must include the following:
    (a) The nature, origin and amount of the indebtedness determined by 
the Commission to be due;
    (b) The intention of the Commission to collect the debt through 
deductions from the employee's current disposable pay account;
    (c) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of 
the intended deductions;
    (d) An explanation of the Commission's policy concerning interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, including a statement that such 
assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS;
    (e) The employee's right to inspect and copy Commission records 
relating to the debt (if copies of such records are not attached), or if 
the employee or his or her representative cannot personally inspect the 
records, the right to request and receive a copy of such records. The 
Commission will respond to a request for inspection and/or copying as 
soon as practicable;
    (f) The opportunity, under terms agreeable to the Commission, to 
enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment in 
lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the 
employee and the Commission, and documented in the Commission's files (4 
CFR 102.2(e));
    (g) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official 
arranged by the Commission if a petition is filed as prescribed by 
Sec. 204.35, Petition for pre-offset hearing. Such hearing official will 
be either an administrative law judge or at the chief administrative law 
judge's discretion, another hearing

[[Page 207]]

official who is also not under the control of the head of the agency;
    (h) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing, 
including a statement that the timely filing of a petition for hearing 
will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;
    (i) If a hearing is requested, the hearing official will issue a 
final decision, based on information presented to the hearing official, 
at the earliest practicable date, but no later than 60 days after the 
petition for the hearing is filed unless the employee requests and the 
hearing official, for good cause or in the interests of justice, deems 
it necessary to extend that time period (5 CFR 550.1104(d)(10));
    (j) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:
    (1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 
CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;
    (2) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or 
any other applicable statutory authority; and/or
    (3) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or 
any other applicable statutory authority.
    (k) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under 
statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection 
is being made;
    (l) The employee's right to a prompt refund if amounts paid or 
deducted by salary offset are later waived or found not owed to the 
United States, unless otherwise provided by law or contract; and
    (m) The specific address to which all correspondence shall be 
directed regarding the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 204.34  Employee response.

    (a) Introduction. An employee must respond to a pre-offset notice, 
if at all, within 15 calendar days following receipt, in one or more of 
the ways discussed in Sec. 204.34, Employee response, and Sec. 204.35, 
Petition for pre-offset hearing. Where applicable, the employee bears 
the burdens of proof and persuasion.
    (b) Responses must be submitted in writing to the program official 
who signed the pre-offset notice. A timely response will stay the 
commencement of collection by salary offset, at least until the issuance 
of a written decision. (See Sec. 204.37, Extensions of time). Failure to 
submit a timely response will be treated as an admission of 
indebtedness, and will result in salary offset in accordance with the 
terms specified in the pre-offset notice.
    (c) A response filed after expiration of the 15 day period may be 
accepted if the employee can show that the delay was due to 
circumstances beyond his or her control or failure to receive notice of 
the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it).
    (d) Voluntary repayment agreement. An employee may request to enter 
into a voluntary written agreement for repayment of the debt in lieu of 
offset. It is within the discretion of the program official whether to 
enter into such an agreement, and if so, upon what terms. Voluntary 
deductions may exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay. If an 
agreement is reached, the agreement must be in writing, and must be 
signed by both the employee and the program official. A signed copy must 
be sent to the Comptroller's office. The program official shall notify 
the employee in writing of its decision not to accept the proposed 
voluntary repayment schedule before making any deductions from the 
employee's salary.
    (e) Waiver. Any request for waiver of the debt must be accompanied 
by evidence that the waiver is authorized by law.
    (f) Reconsideration. An employee may request reconsideration of the 
existence or amount of the debt or the offset schedule as reflected in 
the pre-offset notice. The request must be accompanied by a detailed 
narrative and supporting documentation as to why the offset decision is 
erroneous and/or why the offset schedule imposes an undue hardship.


<R05>
Sec. 204.35  Petition for pre-offset hearing.

    (a) The employee may petition for a pre-offset hearing. The petition 
must state with specificity why the employee believes the agency's 
determination is in error.

[[Page 208]]

    (b) The petition must fully identify and explain, with reasonable 
specificity, all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, that the 
employee believes support his or her position. The petition must be 
signed by the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 204.36  Granting of a pre-offset hearing.

    (a) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the 
timeliness is waived, the program official must:
    (1) arrange for a hearing official. If the hearing official is an 
administrative law judge, he or she shall be designated by the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge as set forth in 17 CFR 200.310(a)(2); and
    (2) provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which 
the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are 
based.
    (b) The hearing official shall notify the employee by personal 
service, by first class, registered or certified mail, or by a reliable 
commercial courier or overnight delivery service whether the employee is 
entitled to an oral or ``paper'' (i.e., a review on the written record) 
hearing. (See 4 CFR 102.3(c).) Within 20 calendar days of receipt of 
this notice the employee shall provide the hearing official with a full 
description of all relevant facts, documentary evidence, and witnesses 
which the employee believes support his or her position. The hearing 
official may extend the time for the employee to respond to the notice 
for good cause shown.
    (c) If an oral hearing is scheduled, the hearing official shall 
notify the program official and the employee in writing of the date, 
time and location of the hearing. The place for the hearing shall be 
fixed by the hearing official with due regard for the public interest 
and the convenience and necessity of the parties, the participants, or 
their representatives.
    (d) If the employee is entitled to an oral hearing, but requests to 
have the hearing based only on the written submissions, the employee 
must notify the hearing official and the program official at least 3 
calendar days before the date of the oral hearing. The hearing official 
may waive the 3-day requirement for good cause.
    (e) Failure of the employee to appear at the oral hearing may result 
in dismissal of the petition and affirmation of the program official's 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 204.37  Extensions of time.

    The hearing official may for good cause or in the interests of 
justice postpone the commencement of the hearing, adjourn a convened 
hearing for a reasonable period of time or extend or shorten any other 
time limits prescribed under this section. This extension is not 
intended to abridge the 30 day initial notice or extend the 60 day 
decision requirement other than as provided for in 5 CFR 
550.1104(d)(10).


<R05>
Sec. 204.38  Pre-offset hearing.

    (a) The hearing official shall determine the form and content of 
hearings granted under this section, pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(c). All 
oral hearings shall be on the record. Except as otherwise ordered by the 
hearing official, hearings shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim by 
shorthand, mechanical means, electronic sound recording, or any other 
method, subject to the discretion and approval of the hearing official, 
and a transcript thereof shall be made.
    (b) Oral hearings are informal in nature. The Commission, 
represented by an attorney from the Office of General Counsel, and 
accompanied by a program official and the employee, and/or the 
employee's representative, orally shall explain their respective 
positions using relevant documentation. The employee may testify on his 
or her own behalf, subject to cross examination. Other witnesses may be 
called to testify where the hearing official determines the testimony to 
be relevant and not redundant. The Federal Rules of Evidence serve as a 
guideline, but are not controlling. The employee bears the burdens of 
proof and persuasion.
    (c) The hearing official shall:
    (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing;
    (2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum and 
avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing; and
    (3) Issue a decision in accordance with Sec. 204.39, Written 
decision, on the

[[Page 209]]

basis of the oral hearing and the written record.
    (d) Oral hearings are normally open to the public. However, the 
hearing official may close all or any portion of the hearing at either 
the request of either party or upon the hearing official's initiative 
when doing so is in the best interest[s] of the employee or the public.
    (e) Oral hearings may be conducted by conference call at the request 
of the employee or at the discretion of the hearing official.
    (f) Pre-offset ``paper'' hearing. If a hearing is to be held only 
upon written submissions, the hearing official shall issue a decision 
based solely upon the written record.


<R05>
Sec. 204.39  Written decision.

    (a) If pre-offset hearing is held. Within 60 days of the filing of 
the employee's petition for a pre-offset hearing, the hearing official 
will issue a written decision setting forth the basis of his/her 
findings in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1104(g)(3).
    (b) If the employee challenges the pre-offset notice under 
Sec. 204.34, Employee response and/or Sec. 204.35, Petition for pre-
offset hearing, without requesting a hearing or a hearing is denied, the 
program official must notify the employee of his/her final determination 
in writing before offset can begin. The agency's execution of a 
voluntary repayment agreement satisfies this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 204.40  Deductions.

    (a) When deductions may begin:
    (1) If a pre-offset hearing is held, deductions shall be made in 
accordance with the hearing official's decision.
    (2) If parties execute a voluntary repayment agreement, deductions 
shall be made in accordance with the terms of that agreement.
    (3) If the employee requests a waiver or reconsideration or the 
program official refuses to accept a proposed alternate repayment 
schedule, deductions shall be made in accordance with the program 
official's written decision.
    (4) If the employee consents to the terms and conditions set forth 
in the Commission's Pre-offset Notice or fails to respond in timely 
fashion to the Pre-offset Notice, or waives his/her right to a hearing 
without otherwise challenging the terms of the Pre-offset Notice, 
deductions shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set 
forth therein.
    (b) Retired or separated employees. If the employee retires, 
resigns, or is terminated before the debt is fully repaid, the remaining 
indebtedness will be offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 
101.
    (1) To the extent possible, the remaining indebtedness will be 
liquidated from any final payment due the former employee as of the date 
of separation (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.). See 
Sec. 204.40d(3), Offset deductions from final salary and/or lump-sum 
leave payment.
    (2) Thereafter, the remaining indebtedness will be recovered from 
later payments of any kind due the former employee from the United 
States. See 4 CFR 102.13.
    (c) Method of collection and source of deduction. The method of 
collecting debts under these regulations shall be by salary offset. 
Deductions will be made from the employee's current disposable pay 
account except as provided for in Sec. 204.34b, Employee response.
    (d) Amount and duration of deductions. Debts must be collected in 
one lump sum where possible. If the employee demonstrates financial 
hardship to the Commission's satisfaction or the amount of the debt 
exceeds 15 percent of the indebted employee's current disposable pay, 
collection must be made in installments over a period not greater than 
the anticipated period of active employment, except as provided in 
Section 34b, Employee Response.
    (1) Installment deductions will be made over the shortest period 
possible. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a 
reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability 
to pay.
    (2) The amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of 
the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. Installment 
payment of less than $100 per pay period will he accepted only in the 
most unusual circumstances.

[[Page 210]]

    (3) Offset deductions from final salary and/or lump-sum leave 
payment. Such an offset deduction may exceed 15 percent of an employee's 
final salary and/or lump-sum leave payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, 
64 CG 907.
    (e) Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this 
part will be assessed and/or waived according to the provisions of 4 CFR 
102.13.


<R05>
Sec. 204.41  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver 
of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any 
other provision of contract or law, unless there are statutory or 
contractual provisions to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 204.42  Refunds.

    (a) The Commission will refund promptly to the appropriate 
individual amounts offset under this regulation when:
    (1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States 
(unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (2) The Commission is directed by an administrative or judicial 
order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.
    (b) Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law 
or contract.


<R05>
Sec. 204.43  Coordinating offset with another federal agency.

    (a) Responsibility of the Commission as the Creditor Agency. The 
Commission shall request recovery from the current paying agency. Upon 
completion of the procedures established in these regulations and 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, 5 CFR 550.1108 the Commission must:
    (1) Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount 
and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the date the 
Government's right to collect the debt first accrued and that the 
Commission's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved 
by OPM.
    (2) If the collection must be made in installments, the Commission 
also must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of 
disposable pay to be collected in each installment, and if the 
Commission wishes, the number and the commencing date of the 
installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay 
period is required).
    (3) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) the action(s) was taken (unless the 
employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a 
statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the 
written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency).
    (4) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(4), the 
Commission must submit a debt claim containing the information specified 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section and an installment 
agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, 
to the employee's paying agency.
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission 
must submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for 
collection as provided in 5 CFR 550.1104(l). Pursuant to 5 CFR 1101, the 
paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify 
the creditor agency and employee. If the paying agency is aware that the 
employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written 
notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the 
debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the paying agency has 
fully complied with the provisions of this section. The Commission must 
submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making 
such payments before the collection can be made.
    (6) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from 
his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Commission may 
request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the 
employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 
831.1801) or other

[[Page 211]]

similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt (See 31 
U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 101).
    (7) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the 
Commission shall not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 
U.S.C. 5514 and subpart B of this part to resume the collection. The 
Commission must review the debt upon receiving the former paying 
agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection 
is resumed by the new paying agency. The Commission must submit a 
properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can 
be resumed.
    (b) Responsibility of the Commission as the paying agency--(1) 
Complete claim. When the Commission receives a properly certified claim 
from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the 
next officially established pay interval. The Commission must notify the 
employee in writing that the Commission has received a certified debt 
claim from the creditor agency (including the amount) and the date 
salary offset will begin and the amount of such deductions.
    (2) Incomplete claim. When the Commission receives an incomplete 
certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Commission must return 
the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 
subpart B of this part must be provided and a properly certified debt 
claim received before action will be taken to collect from the 
employee's current pay account.
    (3) Review. The Commission is not authorized to review the merits of 
the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or 
validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
    (4) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. If, 
after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Commission 
and before the Commission collects the debt in full, the employee 
transfers to another agency, the Commission must certify the total 
amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification must be 
furnished to the employee and one copy to the creditor agency along with 
notice of the employee's transfer.
    (c) Responsibility of the Program Official. (1) The Program Official 
shall coordinate debt collections and shall, as appropriate:
    (i) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petition by a federal 
employee; and
    (ii) Prescribe, upon consultation with the General Counsel, such 
practices and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the intent of 
this regulation.
    (2) The Program Official shall be responsible for:
    (i) Ensuring that each certification of debt sent to a paying agency 
is consistent with the pre-offset notice (Sec. 204.33, Pre-offset 
notice).
    (ii) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to 
Sec. 204.36, Granting of a pre-offset hearing.
    (iii) Ensuring that hearings are properly scheduled.

Sec. 204.44  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    Charges may be assessed for interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR

                      Subpart C--Tax Refund Offset

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 8347(a) and 8461(g), 31 U.S.C. 3720A.

    Source: 58 FR 64372, Dec. 7, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 204.50  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes procedures for the Commission to refer 
past-due legally enforceable debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
for offset against the income tax refunds of an individual, sole 
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, nonprofit organization or any 
other form of business association, (31 U.S.C. 3720A(4)) owing debts to 
the Commission. In the case of refunds of business associations, this 
section applies only to refunds payable on or after January 1, 1995 (31 
U.S.C. 3720A(5). It specifies the agency procedures and the rights of 
the debtor applicable to claims referred under the Federal Tax Refund 
Offset Program for the collection of debts owed to the Commission.

[[Page 212]]


<R05>
Sec. 204.51  Past-due legally enforceable debt.

    A past-due legally enforceable debt for referral to the IRS is a 
debt that:
    (a) Resulted from:
    (1) Erroneous payments made under the Civil Service Retirement or 
the Federal Employees' Retirement Systems; or
    (2) Unpaid health or life insurance premiums due under the Federal 
Employees' Health Benefits or Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance 
Programs; or
    (3) Any other statute administered by the Commission;
    (b) Is an obligation of a debtor;
    (c) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent at 
least three months but not more than ten years at the time the offset is 
made;
    (d) Is at least $25.00;
    (e) With respect to which the individual's rights described in the 
collection of debts owed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Fund (5 CFR 831.1301 through 831.1309) have been exhausted;
    (f) With respect to which either:
    (1) The Commission's records do not contain evidence that the person 
owing the debt (or his or her spouse) has filed for bankruptcy under 
title 11 of the United States Code; or
    (2) The Commission can clearly establish at the time of the referral 
that the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no 
longer in effect with respect to the person owing the debt or his or her 
spouse, and the debt was not discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding;
    (g) Cannot currently be collected under the salary offset provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (h) Is not eligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 
3716(a) because of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2), or cannot currently be 
collected as an administrative offset by the Commission under 31 U.S.C. 
3716(a) against amounts payable to the debtor by the Commission; and
    (i) Has been disclosed by the Commission to a consumer reporting 
agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless the consumer reporting 
agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the 
debt by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does 
not exceed $100.


<R05>
Sec. 204.52  Notification of intent to collect.

    (a) Notification before submission to the IRS. A request for 
reduction of an IRS income tax refund will be made only after the 
Commission makes a determination that an amount is owed and past-due and 
gives or makes a reasonable attempt to give the debtor 60 days written 
notice of the intent to collect by IRS tax refund offset.
    (b) Contents of notice. The Commission's notice of intent to collect 
by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state:
    (1) The amount of the debt;
    (2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of 
the Commission's Notice of Intent, the Commission intends to collect the 
debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor 
as a Federal income tax refund by an amount equal to the amount of the 
debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;
    (3) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and 
a contact name and a telephone number for any questions; and
    (4) That the debtor may present evidence to the Commission that all 
or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable by:
    (i) Sending a written request for a review of the evidence to the 
address provided in the notice;
    (ii) Stating in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why 
the debtor believes that the debt is not past due or is not legally 
enforceable; and
    (iii) Including in the request any documents that the debtor wishes 
to be considered or stating that the additional information will be 
submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period.


<R05>
Sec. 204.53  Reasonable attempt to notify.

    In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, 
the Commission must have used a mailing address for the debtor obtained 
from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) within a period of one 
year preceding

[[Page 213]]

the attempt to notify the debtor, unless the Commission received clear 
and concise notification from the debtor that notices from the agency 
are to be sent to an address different from the address obtained from 
IRS. Clear and concise notice means that the debtor has provided the 
agency with written notification, including the debtor's name and 
identifying number (as defined in 26 CFR 301.6109-1), and the debtor's 
intent to have the agency notices sent to the new address.


<R05>
Sec. 204.54  Commission action as a result of consideration of evidence submitted in response to the notice of intent.

    (a) Consideration of evidence. If, as a result of the Notice of 
Intent, the Commission receives notice that the debtor will submit 
additional evidence or receives additional evidence from the debtor 
within the prescribed time period, any notice to the IRS will be stayed 
until the Commission can:
    (1) Consider the evidence presented by the debtor; and
    (2) Determine whether or not all or a portion of the debt is still 
past due and legally enforceable; and
    (3) Notify the debtor of its determination.
    (b) Notification to the debtor. Following review of the evidence, 
the Commission's designee will issue a written decision notifying the 
debtor whether the Commission has sustained, amended, or canceled its 
determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. The 
notice will advise the debtor of any further action to be taken and 
explain the supporting rationale for the decision.
    (c) Commission action on the debt. (1) The Commission will notify 
the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against 
the debtor's Federal income tax refund if it sustains its decision that 
the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. The Commission will also 
notify the debtor whether the amount of the debt remains the same or is 
modified; and
    (2) The Commission will not refer the debt to the IRS for offset 
against the debtor's Federal income tax refund if it reverses its 
decision that the debt is past due and legally enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 204.55  Change in notification to Internal Revenue Service.

    (a) Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, after the 
Commission sends the IRS notification of an individual's liability for a 
debt, the Commission will promptly notify the IRS of any change in the 
notification, if the Commission:
    (1) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the 
information contained in the notification;
    (2) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the 
debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt

the authority to terminate a collection action or refer the matter to 
the Attorney General for civil remedies; and

    (a) The Commission may report delinquent debts to consumer reporting 
agencies (See 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3), 3711). Sixty days prior to release 
of information to a consumer reporting agency, the debtor shall be 
notified, in writing, of the intent to disclose the existence of the 
debt to a consumer reporting agency. Such notice of intent may be a 
separate correspondence or included in correspondence demanding direct 
payment. The notice shall be in conformance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) and 
the Federal Claims Collection Standards. The Commission shall provide, 
in this notice, the debtor with:
    (1) An opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to 
the debt;
    (2) An opportunity for an administrative review of the legal 
enforceability or past due status of the debt;
    (3) An opportunity to enter into a repayment agreement on terms 
satisfactory to the Commission to prevent the Commission from reporting 
the debt as overdue to consumer reporting agencies, and provide 
deadlines and method for requesting this relief;
    (4) An explanation of the rate of interest that will accrue on the 
debt, that all costs incurred to collect the debt will be charged to the 
debtor, the authority for assessing these costs, and the manner in which 
the Commission will calculate the amount of these cost;
    (5) An explanation that the Commission will report the debt to the 
consumer reporting agencies to the detriment of the debtor's credit 
rating; and
    (6) A description of the collection actions that the agency may take 
in the future if those presently proposed actions do not result in 
repayment of the loan obligation, including the filing of a lawsuit 
against the borrower by the agency and assignment of the debt for 
collection by offset against Federal income tax refunds or the filing of 
a lawsuit against the debtor by the Federal Government.
    (b) The information that may be disclosed to the consumer reporting 
agency is limited to:
    (1) The debtor's name, address, social security number or taxpayer 
identification number, and any other information necessary to establish 
the identity of the individual;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and
    (3) The Commission program or activity under which the claim arose.


<R05>
Sec. 204.77  Referrals to collection agencies.

    (a) The Commission has authority to contract for collection services 
to recover delinquent debts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(c) and the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 102.6).
    (b) The Commission will use private collection agencies where it 
determines that their use is in the best interest of the Government. 
Where the Commission determines that there is a need to contract for 
collection services, the contract will provide that:
    (1) The authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or 
terminate collection action, or refer the matter to the Department of 
Justice for litigation or to take any other action under this part will 
be retained by the Commission;
    (2) Contractors are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 
to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m) and to applicable Federal 
and State laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, 
such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692;
    (3) The contractor is required to strictly account for all amounts 
collected;
    (4) The contractor must agree that uncollectible accounts shall be 
returned with appropriate documentation to enable Commission to 
determine whether to pursue collection

[[Page 215]]

through litigation or to terminate collection; and
    (5) The contractor must agree to provide any data in its files 
relating to paragraphs (a) (1), (2) and (3) of Section 105.2 of the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards upon returning the account to the 
Commission for subsequent referral to the Department of Justice for 
litigation.
    (c) The Commission will not use a collection agency to collect a 
debt owed by a current employed or retired Federal employee, if 
collection by salary or annuity offset is available.

Sec. 209.0-1  Availability of forms.

    (a) This part identifies and describes the forms for use under the 
Securities and Exchange Commission's Rules of Practice, part 201 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Any person may obtain a copy of any form prescribed for use in 
this part by written request to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Any person may inspect 
the forms at this address and at the Commission's regional and district 
offices. (See Sec. 200.11 of this chapter for the addresses of the SEC 
regional and district offices.)


<R05>
Sec. 209.1  Form D-A: Disclosure of assets and financial information.

    (a) Rules 410 and 630 of the Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.410 and 
201.630) provide that under certain circumstances a respondent who 
asserts or intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement, interest 
or penalties may be required to disclose certain financial information. 
Unless otherwise ordered, this form may be used by individuals required 
to supply such information.
    (b) The respondent filing Form D-A is required promptly to notify 
the Commission of any material change in the answer to any question on 
this form.
    (c) Form D-A may not be withheld from the interested division. A 
respondent making financial information disclosures on this form after 
the institution of proceedings may make a motion, pursuant to Rule 322 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.322), for the issuance 
of a protective order to limit disclosure to the public or parties other 
than the interested division of the information submitted on Form D-A. A 
request for a protective order allows the requester an opportunity to 
justify the need for confidentiality. The making of a motion for a 
protective order, however, does not guarantee that disclosure will be 
limited.
    (d) No party receiving information for which a motion for a 
protective order has been made may transfer or convey the information to 
any other person prior to a ruling on the motion without the prior 
permission of the Commission or a hearing officer.
    (e) A person making financial information disclosures on Form D-A 
prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with an offer of 
settlement or otherwise, may request confidential treatment of the 
information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. See the 
Commission's Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') regulations, 17 CFR 
200.83. A request for confidential treatment allows the requester an 
opportunity to substantiate the need for confidentiality. No 
determination as to the validity of any request for confidential 
treatment will be made until a request for disclosure of the information 
under FOIA is received.

    (1) Any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more 
other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and 
organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer;
    (2) Any person who, in connection with the founding and organizing 
of the business or enterprise of an issuer, directly or indirectly 
receives in consideration of services or property, or both services and 
property, 10 percent or more of any class of securities of the issuer or 
10 percent or more of the proceeds from the sale of any class of 
securities. However, a person who receives such securities or proceeds

conditions:
    (1) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and 
advances to the subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year (for a proposed business combination to 
be accounted for as a pooling of interests, this condition is also met 
when the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the 
registrant exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at 
the date the combination is initiated); or
    (2) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share 
of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the subsidiary 
exceeds 10 percent of the total assets of the registrants and its 
subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed

    (3) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the 
income from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary 
items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of the 
subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of such income of the registrant and its 
subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.

    Computational note: For purposes of making the prescribed income 
test the following guidance should be applied:
    1. When a loss has been incurred by either the parent and its 
subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the 
equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded 
from the income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
purposes of the computation.
    2. If income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the 
average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average 
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss 
years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.
    3. Where the test involves combined entities, as in the case of 
determining whether summarized financial data should be presented, 
entities reporting losses shall not be aggregated with entities 
reporting income.

    (x) Subsidiary. A subsidiary of a specified person is an affiliate 
controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more

an amount which is material in relation to the particular subsidiary, 
excepting indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business which 
is not overdue and which matures within 1 year from the date of its 
creation, whether evidenced by securities or not. Indebtedness of a 
subsidiary which is secured by its parent by guarantee, pledge, 
assignment, or otherwise is to be excluded for purposes of paragraph 
(x)(2) of this section.
    (z) Voting shares. The term voting shares means the sum of all 
rights, other than as affected by events of default, to vote for 
election of directors and/or the sum of all interests in an 
unincorporated person.

    (aa) Wholly owned subsidiary. The term wholly owned subsidiary means 
a subsidiary substantially all of whose outstanding voting shares are 
owned by its parent and/or the parent's other wholly owned subsidiaries.

paragraph (aa)(2), summarized financial information referred to in this 
regulation shall mean the presentation of summarized information as to 
the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity for 
which the information is required. Summarized financial information 
shall include the following disclosures:

    (i) Current assets, noncurrent assets, current liabilities, 
noncurrent liabilities, and, when applicable, redeemable preferred 
stocks (see Sec. 210.5-02.28) and minority interests (for specialized

loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items and 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, and net income or

meaningful presentation); and

    (2) Summarized financial information for unconsolidated subsidiaries 
and 50 percent or less owned persons referred to in and required by 
Sec. 210.10-01(b) for interim periods shall include the information 
required by paragraph (aa)(1)(ii) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 210.2-01  Qualifications of accountants.

    (a) The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified 
public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as 
such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office. 
The Commission will not recognize any person as a public accountant who 
is not in good standing and entitled to practice as such under the laws 
of the place of his residence or principal office.
    (b) The Commission will not recognize any certified public 
accountant or public accountant as independent who is not in fact 
independent. For example, an accountant will be considered not 
independent with respect to any person or any of its parents, its 
subsidiaries, or other affiliates (1) in which, during the period of his 
professional engagement to examine the financial statements being 
reported on or at the date of his report, be, his firm, or a member of 
his firm had, or was committed to acquire, any direct financial interest 
or any material indirect financial interest; (2) with which, during the 
period of his professional engagement to examine the financial 
statements being reported on, at the date of his report or during the 
period covered by the financial statements, he, his firm, or a member of 
his firm

[[Page 222]]

was connected as a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, 
officer, or employee. A firm's independence will not be deemed to be 
affected adversely where a former officer or employee of a particular 
person is employed by or becomes a partner, shareholder or other 
principal in the firm and such individual has completely disassociated 
himself from the person and its affiliates and does not participate in 
auditing financial statements of the person or its affiliates covering 
any period of his employment by the person. For the purposes of 
Sec. 210.2-01(b), the term member means (i) all partners, shareholders, 
and other principals in the firm, (ii) any professional employee 
involved in providing any professional service to the person, its 
parents, subsidiaries, or other affiliates, and (iii) any professional 
employee having managerial responsibilities and located in [the 
engagement office] or other office of the firm which participates in a 
significant portion of the audit.
    (c) In determining whether an accountant may in fact be not 
independent with respect to a particular person, the Commission will 
give appropriate consideration to all relevant circumstances, including 
evidence bearing on all relationships between the accountant and that 
person or any affiliate thereof, and will not confine itself to the 
relationships existing in connection with the filing of reports with the 
Commission.

generally accepted auditing standards; and
    (2) Shall designate any auditing procedures deemed necessary by the 
accountant under the circumstances of the particular case, which have 
been omitted, and the reasons for their omission. Nothing in this rule 
shall be construed to imply authority for the omission of any procedure 
which independent accountants would ordinarily employ in the course of 
an audit made for the purpose of expressing the opinions required by 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Opinion to be expressed. The accountant's report shall state 
clearly:
    (1) The opinion of the accountant in respect of the financial 
statements covered by the report and the accounting principles and 
practices reflected therein; and
    (2) the opinion of the accountant as to the consistency of the 
application of the accounting principles, or as to any changes in such 
principles which have a material effect on the financial statements.
    (d) Exceptions. Any matters to which the accountant takes exception 
shall be clearly identified, the exception thereto specifically and 
clearly stated, and, to the extent practicable, the effect of each such 
exception on the related financial statements given. (See section 101 of 
the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies.)

    Notwithstanding any requirements as to examination by independent 
accountants, the financial statements of any foreign governmental agency 
may be examined by the regular and customary auditing staff of the 
respective government if public financial statements of such 
governmental agency are customarily examined by such auditing staff.

Sec. 210.2-04  Examination of financial statements of persons other than the registrant.

    If a registrant is required to file financial statements of any 
other person, such statements need not be examined if examination of 
such statements would not be required if such person were itself a 
registrant.

<R05>
Sec. 210.2-05  Examination of financial statements by more than one accountant.

    If, with respect to the examination of the financial statements, 
part of the examination is made by an independent accountant other than 
the principal accountant and the principal accountant elects to place 
reliance on the work of the other accountant and makes reference to that 
effect in his report, the separate report of the other accountant shall 
be filed. However, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 
reports of other accountants which may otherwise be required in filings 
need not be presented in annual reports to security holders furnished 
pursuant to the proxy and information statement rules under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Secs. 240.14a-3 and 240.14c-3].

    (a) Financial statements required. (1) Financial statements prepared 
and audited in accordance with this regulation should be furnished for 
the periods specified in paragraph (b) below if any of the following 
conditions exist:
    (i) Consummation of a business combination accounted for as a 
purchase has occurred or is probable (for purposes of this rule, the 
term purchase encompasses the purchase of an interest in a business 
accounted for by the equity method); or
    (ii) Consummation of a business combination to be accounted for as a 
pooling of interests is probable.
    (2) For purposes of determining whether the provisions of this rule 
apply, the determination of whether a business has been acquired should 
be made in accordance with the guidance set forth in Sec. 210.11-01(d).
    (3) Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable 
or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end for which 
audited financial statements of the registrant have been filed shall be 
treated under this section as if they are a single business combination. 
The required financial statements of related businesses may be presented 
on a combined basis for any periods they are under common control or 
management. For purposes of this section, businesses shall be deemed to 
be related if:
    (i) They are under common control or management;
    (ii) The acquisition of one business is conditional on the 
acquisition of each other business; or
    (iii) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.
    (4) This rule shall not apply to a business which is totally held by 
the registrant prior to consummation of the transaction.
    (b) Periods to be presented. (1) If securities are being registered 
to be offered to the security holders of the business to be acquired, 
the financial statements specified in Secs. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 shall 
be furnished for the business to be acquired, except as provided 
otherwise for filings on Form N-14, S-4 or F-

to certain proxy statements or in registration statements filed on Forms 
N-14, S-4 or F-4 (Secs. 239.23, 239.25 or 239.34 of this chapter).
    (2) In all cases not specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
financial statements of the business acquired or to be acquired shall be 
filed for the periods specified in this paragraph (b)(2) or such shorter 
period as the business has been in existence. The periods for which such 
financial statements are to be filed shall be determined using the 
conditions specified in the definition of significant subsidiary in 
Sec. 210.1-02(w) as follows:
    (i) If none of the conditions exceeds 20 percent, financial 
statements are not required. However, if the aggregate impact of the 
individually insignificant businesses acquired since the date of the 
most recent audited balance sheet filed for the registrant exceeds 50%, 
financial statements covering at least the substantial majority of the 
businesses acquired shall be furnished. Such financial statements shall 
be for at least the most recent fiscal year and any interim periods 
specified in Secs. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02.
    (ii) If any of the conditions exceeds 20 percent, but none exceed 40 
percent, financial statements shall be furnished for at least the most 
recent fiscal year and any interim periods specified in Secs. 210.3-01 
and 210.3-02.
    (iii) If any of the conditions exceeds 40 percent, but none exceed 
50 percent, financial statements shall be furnished for at least the two 
most recent fiscal years and any interim periods specified in 
Secs. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02.
    (iv) If any of the conditions exceeds 50 percent, the full financial 
statements specified in Secs. 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 shall be furnished. 
However, financial statements for the earliest of the three fiscal years 
required may be omitted if net revenues reported by the acquired 
business in its most recent fiscal year are less than $25 million.
    (3) The determination shall be made by comparing the most recent 
annual financial statements of each such business, or group of related 
businesses on a combined basis, to the registrant's most recent annual 
consolidated financial statements filed at or prior to the date of 
acquisition. However, if the registrant made a significant acquisition 
subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end and filed a report on Form 8-K 
(Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) which included audited financial 
statements of such acquired business for the periods required by this 
section and the pro forma financial information required by Sec. 210.11, 
such determination may be made by using pro forma amounts for the latest 
fiscal year in the report on Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) 
rather than by using the historical amounts of the registrant. The tests 
may not be made by ``annualizing'' data.
    (4) Financial statements required for the periods specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be omitted to the extent specified 
as follows:
    (i) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 230.419 of this chapter (Regulation C) and proxy statements need 
not include separate financial statements of the acquired or to be 
acquired business if it does not exceed any of the conditions of 
significance in the definition of significant subsidiary in Sec. 210.1-
02 at the 50 percent level, and either:
    (A) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or
    (B) The date of the final prospectus or prospectus supplement 
relating to an offering as filed with the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter, or mailing date in the case of a proxy 
statement, is no more than 74 days after consummation of the business 
combination, and the financial statements have not previously been filed 
by the registrant.
    (ii) An issuer, other than a foreign private issuer required to file 
reports on Form 6-K, that omits from its initial registration statement 
financial statements of a recently consummated business combination 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section shall furnish those 
financial statements and any pro forma information specified by Article 
11 of this chapter under cover of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this 
chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.

[[Page 227]]

    (iii) Separate financial statements of the acquired business need 
not be presented once the operating results of the acquired business 
have been reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of 
the registrant for a complete fiscal year unless such financial 
statements have not been previously filed or unless the acquired 
business is of such significance to the registrant that omission of such 
financial statements would materially impair an investor's ability to 
understand the historical financial results of the registrant. For 
example, if, at the date of acquisition, the acquired business met at 
least one of the conditions in the definition of significant subsidiary 
in Sec. 210.1-02 at the 80 percent level, the income statements of the 
acquired business should normally continue to be furnished for such 
periods prior to the purchase as may be necessary when added to the time 
for which audited income statements after the purchase are filed to 
cover the equivalent of the period specified in Sec. 210.3-02.
    (iv) A separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is 
not required when the registrant's most recent audited balance sheet 
required by Sec. 210.3-01 is for a date after the date the acquisition 
was consummated.
    (c) Financial statements of foreign business. If the business 
acquired or to be acquired is a foreign business, financial statements 
of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F 
(Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy this section.

Sec. 210.3-06  Financial statements covering a period of nine to twelve months.

    Except with respect to registered investment companies, the filing 
of financial statements covering a period of 9 to 12 months shall be 
deemed to satisfy a requirement for filing financial statements for a 
period of 1 year where:
    (a) The issuer has changed its fiscal year;
    (b) The issuer has made a significant business acquisition for which 
financial statements are required under Sec. 210.3-05 of this chapter 
and the financial statements covering the interim period pertain to the 
business being acquired; or
    (c) The Commission so permits pursuant to Sec. 210.3-13 of this 
chapter.
    Where there is a requirement for filing financial statements for a 
time period exceeding one year but not exceeding three consecutive years 
(with not more than 12 months included in any period reported upon), the 
filing of financial statements covering a period of nine to 12 months 
shall satisfy a filing requirement of financial statements for one year 
of that time period only if the conditions described in either paragraph 
(a), (b), or (c) of this section exist and financial statements are 
filed that cover the full fiscal year or years for all other years in 
the time period.

<R05>
Sec. 210.3-09  Separate financial statements of subsidiaries not consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons.

    (a) If any of the conditions set forth in Sec. 210.1-02(v), 
substituting 20 percent for 10 percent in the tests used therein to 
determine a significant subsidiary, are met for a majority-owned 
subsidiary not consolidated by the registrant or by a subsidiary of the 
registrant, separate financial statements of such subsidiary shall be 
filed. Similarly, if either the first or third condition set forth in 
Sec. 210.1-02(w), substituting 20 percent for 10 percent, is

[[Page 228]]

met by a 50 percent or less owned person accounted for by the equity 
method either by the registrant or a subsidiary of the registrant, 
separate financial statements of such 50 percent or less owned person 
shall be filed.
    (b) Insofar as practicable, the separate financial statements 
required by this section shall be as of the same dates and for the same 
periods as the audited consolidated financial statements required by 
Secs. 210.3-01 and 3-02. However, these separate financial statements 
are required to be audited only for those fiscal years in which either 
the first or third condition set forth in Sec. 210.1-02(w), substituting 
20 percent for 10 percent, is met. For purposes of a filing on Form 10-K 
(Sec. 249.310 of this chapter), if the fiscal year of any 50 percent or 
less owned person ends within 90 days before the date of the filing, or 
if the fiscal year ends after the date of the filing, the required 
financial statements may be filed as an amendment to the report within 
90 days, or within six months if the 50 percent or less owned person is 
a foreign business, after the end of such subsidiary's or person's 
fiscal year.
    (c) Notwithstanding the requirements for separate financial 
statements in paragraph (a) of this section, where financial statements 
of two or more majority-owned subsidiaries not consolidated are 
required, combined or consolidated statements of such subsidiaries may 
be filed subject to principles of inclusion and exclusion which clearly 
exhibit the financial position, cash flows and results of operations of 
the combined or consolidated group. Similarly, where financial 
statements of two or more 50 percent or less owned persons are required, 
combined or consolidated statements of such persons may be filed subject 
to the same principles of inclusion or exclusion referred to above.
    (d) If the 50 percent or less owned person is a foreign business, 
financial statements of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 
of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy this section.

Sec. 210.3-10  Financial statements of guarantors and affiliates whose securities collateralize an issue registered or being registered.

    (a) For each guarantor of any class of securities of a registrant 
and for each of the registrant's affiliates whose securities constitute 
a substantial portion of the collateral for any class of securities 
registered or being registered, there shall be filed the financial 
statements that would be required if the guarantor or affiliate were a 
registrant and required to file financial statements. However, financial 
statements need not be filed pursuant to this provision for any person 
whose statements are otherwise separately included in the filing on an 
individual basis or on a basis consolidated with its subsidiaries.
    (b) For the purposes of this provision, securities of a person shall 
be deemed to constitute a substantial portion of collateral if the 
aggregate principal amount, par value, or book value of the securities 
as carried by the registrant, or the market value of such securities, 
whichever is the greatest, equals 20 percent or more of the principal

    If a registrant is an inactive entity as defined below, the 
financial statements required by this regulation for

[[Page 229]]

purposes of reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may 
be unaudited. An inactive entity is one meeting all of the following 
conditions:
    (a) Gross receipts from all sources for the fiscal year are not in 
excess of $100,000;
    (b) The registrant has not purchased or sold any of its own stock, 
granted options therefor, or levied assessments upon outstanding stock,
    (c) Expenditures for all purposes for the fiscal year are not in 
excess of $100,000;
    (d) No material change in the business has occurred during the 
fiscal year, including any bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment or 
succession or any material acquisition or disposition of plants, mines, 
mining equipment, mine rights or leases; and

Sec. 210.3-12  Age of financial statements at effective date of registration statement or at mailing date of proxy statement.

    (a) If the financial statements in a filing are as of a date 135 
days or more prior to the date the filing is expected to become 
effective or proposed mailing date in the case of a proxy statement, the 
financial statements shall be updated, except as specified in the 
following paragraphs, with a balance sheet as of an interim date within 
135 days and with statements of income and cash flows for the interim 
period between the end of the most recent fiscal year and the date of 
the interim balance sheet provided and for the corresponding period of 
the preceding fiscal year. Such interim financial statements may be 
unaudited and need not be presented in greater detail than is required 
by Sec. 210.10-01. Notwithstanding the above requirements, the most 
recent interim financial statements shall be at least as current as the 
most recent financial statements filed with the Commission on Form 10-Q 
and Form 10-QSB.
    (b) Where the anticipated effective date of a filing, or in the case 
of a proxy statement the proposed mailing date, falls within 90 days 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the filing need not include 
financial statements more current than as of the end of the third fiscal 
quarter of the most recently completed fiscal year unless the audited 
financial statements for such fiscal year are available or unless the 
anticipated effective date or proposed mailing date falls after 45 days 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year and the registrant does not 
meet the conditions prescribed under paragraph (c) of Sec. 210.3-01. If 
the anticipated effective date or proposed mailing date falls after 45 
days subsequent to the end of the fiscal year and the registrant does 
not meet the conditions prescribed under paragraph (c) of Sec. 210.3-01, 
the filing must include audited financial statements for the most 
recently completed fiscal year.
    (c) Where a filing is made near the end of a fiscal year and audited 
financial statements for that fiscal year are not included in the 
filing, the filing shall be updated with such audited financial 
statements if they become available prior to the anticipated effective 
date, or proposed mailing date in the case of a proxy statement.
    (d) The age of the registrant's most recent audited financial 
statements included in a registration statement filed under the 
Securities Act of 1933 or filed on Form 10 and Form 10-SB (17 CFR 
249.210) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall not be more 
than one year and 45 days old at the date the registration statement 
becomes effective if the registration statement relates to the security 
of an issuer that was not subject, immediately prior to the time of 
filing the registration statement, to the reporting requirements of 
section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (e) For filings by registered management investment companies, the 
requirements of Sec. 210.3-18 shall apply in lieu of the requirements of 
this section.
    (f) Any foreign private issuer may file financial statements whose 
age is specified in Sec. 210.3-19. Financial statements of a foreign 
business which are furnished pursuant to Secs. 210.3-05 or

permit the omission of one or more of the financial statements herein 
required or the filing in substitution therefor of appropriate 
statements of comparable character. The Commission may also by informal

Sec. 210.3-14  Special instructions for real estate operations to be acquired.

    (a) If, during the period for which income statements are required, 
the registrant has acquired one or more properties which in the 
aggregate are significant, or since the date of the latest balance sheet 
required has acquired or proposes to acquire one or more properties 
which in the aggregate are significant, the following shall be furnished 
with respect to such properties:
    (1) Audited income statements (not including earnings per unit) for 
the three most recent fiscal years, which shall exclude items not 
comparable to the proposed future operations of the property such as 
mortgage interest, leasehold rental, depreciation, corporate expenses 
and Federal and state income taxes: Provided, however, That such audited 
statements need be presented for only the most recent fiscal year if
    (i) The property is not acquired from a related party;
    (ii) Material factors considered by the registrant in assessing the 
property are described with specificity in the filing with regard to the 
property, including sources of revenue (including, but not limited to, 
competition in the rental market, comparative rents, occupancy rates) 
and expense (including, but not limited to, utility rates, ad valorem 
tax rates, maintenance expenses, capital improvements anticipated); and
    (iii) The registrant indicates in the appropriate filing that, after 
reasonable inquiry, the registrant is not aware of any material factors 
relating to that specific property other than those discussed in 
response to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section that would cause the 
reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of 
future operating results.
    Note: The discussion of material factors considered should be 
combined with that required by Item 15 of Form S-11.

    (2) If the property is to be operated by the registrant, there shall 
be furnished a statement showing the estimated taxable operating results 
of the registrant based on the most recent twelve month period including 
such adjustments as can be factually supported. If the property is to be 
acquired subject to a net lease the estimated taxable operating results 
shall be based on the rent to be paid for the first year of the lease. 
In either case, the estimated amount of cash to be made available by 
operations shall be shown. There shall be stated in an introductory 
paragraph the principal assumptions which have been made in preparing 
the statements of estimated taxable operating results and cash to be 
made available by operations.
    (3) If appropriate under the circumstances, there shall be given in 
tablular form for a limited number of years the estimated cash 
distribution per unit showing the portion thereof reportable as taxable 
income and the portion representing a return of capital together with an 
explanation of annual variations, if any. If taxable net income per unit 
will become greater than the cash available for distribution per unit, 
that fact and approximate year of occurrence shall be stated, if 
significant.

    (a) For filings by registered management investment companies, the 
following financial statements shall be filed:

as of the end of the most recent fiscal year;
    (2) An audited statement of operations for the most recent fiscal 
year conforming to the requirements of Sec. 210.6-07.
    (3) An audited statement of cash flows for the most recent fiscal

requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.)
    (4) Audited statements of changes in net assets conforming to the 
requirements of Sec. 210.6-09 for the two most recent fiscal years.
    (b) If the filing is made within 60 days after the end of the

recent fiscal year are not available, the balance sheet or statement of 
assets and liabilities may be as of the end of the preceding fiscal year 
and the filing shall include an additional balance sheet or statement of 
assets and liabilities as of an interim date within 245 days of the date 
of filing. In addition, the statements of operations and cash flows (if 
required by generally accepted accounting principles) shall be provided 
for the preceding fiscal year and the statement of changes in net assets 
shall be provided for the two preceding fiscal years and each of the 
statements shall be provided for the interim period between the end of 
the preceding fiscal year and the date of the most recent balance sheet 
or statement of assets and liabilities being filed. Financial statements 
for the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year need not be 
provided.
    (c) If the most current balance sheet or statement of assets and 
liabilities in a filing is as of a date 245 days or more prior to the 
date the filing is expected to become effective, the financial 
statements shall be updated with a balance sheet or statement of assets 
and liabilities as of an interim date within 245 days. In addition, the 
statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets shall be 
provided for the interim period between the end of the most recent 
fiscal year for which a balance sheet or statement of assets and 
liabilities is presented and the date of the most recent interim balance 
sheet or statement of assets and liabilities filed.
    (d) Interim financial statements provided in accordance with these 
requirements may be unaudited but shall be presented in the same detail 
as required by Secs. 210.6-01 to 210.6-10. When unaudited financial 
statements are presented in a registration statement, they shall include 
the statement required by Sec. 210.3-03(d).

Sec. 210.3-19  Special provisions as to financial statements for foreign private issuers.

    (a) A foreign private issuer, as defined in rule 405 (Sec. 230.405 
of this chapter), other than a registered management investment company 
or an employee plan, shall include the following financial statements 
for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and, where 
appropriate, its predecessors:
    (1) Audited balance sheets as of the end of each of the two most 
recent fiscal years.
    (2) Audited statements of income and cash flows for each of the 
three fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance 
sheet being filed.
    (b) If the filing, other than an annual report on Form 20-F, 
(Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) is made effective within six full months 
after the end of the registrant's fiscal year and if the audited balance 
sheet for the most recent fiscal year is not available, the audited 
balance sheets in the filing may be as of the end of the two preceding 
fiscal years; Provided, That on the effective date the filing shall 
include a balance sheet, which may be unaudited, as of an interim date 
within ten months of the effective date (except as permitted in 
paragraph (e) of this section).
    (c) If the filing is made effective after six full months subsequent 
to the end of the most recent fiscal year, the filing shall include the 
audited financial statements described in paragraph (a) of this section. 
In addition, if the effective date of the filing is later than ten full 
months after the end of the most

[[Page 233]]

recent fiscal year, the filing shall also include a balance sheet, which 
may be unaudited, as of an interim date within ten months of the 
effective date (except as permitted in paragraph (e) of this section).
    (d) If the interim balance sheet is required by this rule, 
statements of income and cash flows for the interim period between the 
latest audited balance sheet and the date of the interim balance sheet 
being filed and for the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal 
year shall also be filed. Such interim financial statements may be 
unaudited and need not be presented in greater detail than is required 
by Rule 10-01 (Sec. 210.10-01 of this chapter).
    (e) The balance sheet shall be as of a date within one year of the 
effective date if the only securities to be offered are (1) upon the 
exercise of outstanding rights granted by the issuer of the securities 
to be offered, if such rights are granted pro rata to all existing 
security holders of the class of securities to which the rights attach; 
or (2) pursuant to a dividend or interest reinvestment plan; or (3) upon 
the conversion of oustanding convertible securities or upon the exercise 
of outstanding transferable warrants issued by the issuer. The 
provisions of this paragraph are not applicable if securities are to be 
offered or sold in a standby underwriting in the United States or 
similar arrangement.
    (f) Notwithstanding the above provisions of this section, if a 
foreign private issuer prepares and discloses to its shareholders or 
otherwise makes public, pursuant to applicable foreign laws or 
regulations or stock exchange requirements or otherwise, interim 
financial information relating to revenues and income that is more 
current than the financial statements included in the filing in order to 
comply with the other provisions of this section, such information also 
shall be included in the filing and shall be accompanied by:
    (1) A description of material variations in the accounting 
principles, practices and methods used in preparing the financial 
statements from the principles, practices and methods accepted in the 
United States; and
    (2) Quantification of any material variations that are not 
quantified with respect to their occurrence in the annual or interim 
financial statements included in the filing.

Sec. 210.3-20  Currency for financial statements of foreign private issuers.

    (a) A foreign private issuer, as defined in Sec. 230.405 of this 
chapter, shall state amounts in its primary financial statements in the 
currency which it deems appropriate.
    (b) The currency in which amounts in the financial statements are 
stated shall be disclosed prominently on the face of the financial 
statements. If dividends on publicly-held equity securities will be 
declared in a currency other than the reporting currency, a note to the 
financial statements shall identify that currency. If there are material 
exchange restrictions or controls relating to the issuer's reporting 
currency, the currency of the issuer's domicile, or the currency in 
which the issuer will pay dividends, prominent disclosure of this fact 
shall be made in the financial statements. If the reporting currency is 
not the U.S. dollar, dollar-equivalent financial statements or 
convenience translations shall not be presented, except a translation 
may be presented of the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent 
interim period presented using the exchange rate as of the most recent 
balance sheet included in the filing, except that a rate as of the most 
recent practicable date shall be used if materially different.
    (c) If the financial statements of a foreign private issuer are 
stated in a currency of a country that has experienced cumulative 
inflationary effects exceeding a total of 100 percent over the most 
recent three year period, and have not been recast or otherwise 
supplemented to include information on a historical cost/constant 
currency or current cost basis prescribed or permitted by appropriate 
authoritative standards, the issuer shall present supplementary 
information to quantify the effects of changing prices upon its 
financial position and results of operations.

[[Page 234]]

    (d) Notwithstanding the currency selected for reporting purposes, 
the issuer shall measure separately its own transactions, and those of 
each of its material operations (e.g., branches, divisions, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures, and similar entities) that is included in 
the issuer's consolidated financial statements and not located in a 
hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the issuer or the operation 
conducts its business. Assets and liabilities so determined shall be 
translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the 
balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses shall be 
translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction 
or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the 
period; and all translation effects of exchange rate changes shall be 
included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') 
of shareholder's equity. For purposes of this paragraph, the currency of 
an operation's primary economic environment is normally the currency in 
which cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary 
environment is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100% 
or more over the most recent three year period. Departures from the 
methodology presented in this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to 
Items 17(c)(2) or 18(c)(2) of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter).
    (e) The issuer shall state its primary financial statements in the 
same currency for all periods for which financial information is 
presented. If the financial statements are stated in a currency that is 
different from that used in financial statements previously filed with 
the Commission, the issuer shall recast its financial statements as if 
the newly adopted currency had been used since at least the earliest 
period presented in the filing. The decision to change and the reason 
for the change in the reporting currency shall be disclosed in a note to 
the financial statements in the period in which the change occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 210.3A-01  Application of Sec. 210.3A-01 to Sec. 210.3A-05.

    Sections 210.3A-01 to 210.3A-05 shall govern the presentation of 
consolidated and combined financial statements.

[44 FR 19386, Apr. 3, 1979. Redesignated at 45 FR 63687, Sept. 25, 1980, 
and amended at 50 FR 25215, June 18, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 210.3A-02  Consolidated financial statements of the registrant and its subsidiaries.

    In deciding upon consolidation policy, the registrant must consider 
what financial presentation is most meaningful in the circumstances and 
should follow in the consolidated financial statements principles of 
inclusion or exclusion which will clearly exhibit the financial position 
and results of operations of the registrant. There is a presumption that 
consolidated statements are more meaningful than separate statements and 
that they are usually necessary for a fair presentation when one entity 
directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest in another 
entity. Other particular facts and circumstances may require combined 
financial statements, an equity method of accounting, or valuation 
allowances in order to achieve a fair presentation. In any case, the 
disclosures required by Sec. 210.3A-03 should clearly explain the 
accounting policies followed by the registrant in this area, including 
the circumstances involved in any departure from the normal practice of 
consolidating majority owned subsidiaries and not consolidating entities 
that are less than majority owned. Among the factors that the registrant 
should consider in determining the most meaningful presentation are the 
following:
    (a) Majority ownership: Generally, registrants shall consolidate 
entities that are majority owned and shall not consolidate entities that 
are not majority owned. The determination of majority ownership requires 
a careful analysis of the facts and circumstances of a particular 
relationship among entities. In rare situations, consolidation of a 
majority owned subsidiary may not result in a fair presentation, because 
the registrant, in substance, does not have

[[Page 235]]

a controlling financial interest (for example, when the subsidiary is in 
legal reorganization or in bankruptcy, or when control is likely to be 
temporary). In other situations, consolidation of an entity, 
notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership, is necessary 
to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of 
the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary 
relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock.
    (b) Different fiscal periods: Generally, registrants shall not 
consolidate any entity whose financial statements are as of a date or 
for periods substantially different from those of the registrant. 
Rather, the earnings or losses of such entities should be reflected in 
the registrant's financial statements on the equity method of 
accounting. However:
    (1) A difference in fiscal periods does not of itself justify the 
exclusion of an entity from consolidation. It ordinarily is feasible for 
such entity to prepare, for consolidation purposes, statements for a 
period which corresponds with or closely approaches the fiscal year of 
the registrant. Where the difference is not more than 93 days, it is 
usually acceptable to use, for consolidation purposes, such entity's 
statements for its fiscal period. Such difference, when it exists, 
should be disclosed as follows: the closing date of the entity should be 
expressly indicated, and the necessity for the use of different closing 
dates should be briefly explained. Furthermore, recognition should be 
given by disclosure or otherwise to the effect of intervening events 
which materially affect the financial position or results of operations.
    (2) Notwithstanding the 93-day provision specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, in connection with the retroactive combination 
of financial statements of entities following a pooling of interests, 
the financial statements of the constituents may be combined even if 
their respective fiscal periods do not end within 93 days, except that 
the financial statements for the latest fiscal year shall be recast to 
dates which do not differ by more than 93 days, if practicable. 
Disclosure shall be made of the periods combined and of the sales or 
revenues, net income before extraordinary items and net income of any 
interim periods excluded from or included more than once in results of 
operations as a result of such recasting.
    (c) Bank Holding Company Act: Registrants shall not consolidate any 
subsidiary or group of subsidiaries of a registrant subject to the Bank 
Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended as to which (1) a decision 
requiring divestiture has been made, or (2) there is substantial 
likelihood that divestiture will be necessary in order to comply with 
provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act.
    (d) Foreign subsidiaries: Due consideration shall be given to the 
propriety of consolidating with domestic corporations foreign 
subsidiaries which are operated under political, economic or currency 
restrictions. If consolidated, disclosure should be made as to the 
effect, insofar as this can reasonably be determined, of foreign 
exchange restrictions upon the consolidated financial position and 
operating results of the registrant and its subsidiaries.

Sec. 210.4-01  Form, order, and terminology.

    (a) Financial statements should be filed in such form and order, and 
should use such generally accepted terminology, as will best indicate 
their significance and character in the light of the provisions 
applicable thereto. The information required with respect to any 
statement shall be furnished as a minimum requirement to which shall be 
added such further material information as is necessary to make the 
required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they 
are made, not misleading.
    (1) Financial statements filed with the Commission which are not 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate, despite footnote or 
other disclosures, unless the Commission has otherwise provided. This 
article and other articles of Regulation S-X provide clarification of 
certain disclosures which must be included in any event, in financial 
statements filed with the Commission.
    (2) In all filings of foreign private issuers (see Sec. 230.405 of 
this chapter), except as stated otherwise in the applicable form, the 
financial statements may be prepared according to a comprehensive body 
of accounting principles other than those generally accepted in the 
United States if a reconciliation to United States generally accepted 
accounting principles and the provisions of Regulation S-X of the type 
specified in Item 18 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) is 
also filed as part of the financial statements. Alternatively, the 
financial statements may be prepared according to United States 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (b) All money amounts required to be shown in financial statements 
may be expressed in whole dollars or multiples thereof, as appropriate: 
Provided, That, when stated in other than whole dollars, an indication 
to that effect is inserted immediately beneath the caption of the 
statement or schedule, at the top of the money columns, or at an 
appropriate point in narrative material.
    (c) Negative amounts (red figures) shall be shown in a manner which 
clearly distinguishes the negative attribute. When determining methods 
of display, consideration should be given

Sec. 210.4-08  General notes to financial statements.

    If applicable to the person for which the financial statements are 
filed, the following shall be set forth on the face of the appropriate 
statement or in appropriately captioned notes. The information shall be 
provided for each statement required to be filed, except that the 
information required by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall be 
provided as of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed and for 
paragraph (j) as specified therein. When specific statements are 
presented separately, the pertinent notes shall accompany such 
statements unless cross-referencing is appropriate.
    (a) Principles of consolidation or combination. With regard to 
consolidated or combined financial statements, refer to Secs. 210.3A-01 
to 3A-08 for requirements for supplemental information in notes to the 
financial statements.
    (b) Assets subject to lien. Assets mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise 
subject to lien, and the approximate amounts thereof, shall be 
designated and the obligations collateralized briefly identified.
    (c) Defaults. The facts and amounts concerning any default in 
principal, interest, sinking fund, or redemption provisions with respect 
to any issue of securities or credit agreements, or any breach of 
covenant of a related indenture or agreement, which default or breach 
existed at the date of the most recent balance sheet being filed and 
which has not been subsequently cured, shall be stated in the notes to 
the financial statements. If a default or breach exists but acceleration 
of the obligation has been waived for a stated period of time beyond the 
date of the most recent balance sheet being filed, state the amount of 
the obligation and the period of the waiver.
    (d) Preferred shares. (1) Aggregate preferences on involuntary 
liquidation,

[[Page 238]]

if other than par or stated value, shall be shown parenthetically in the 
equity section of the balance sheet.
    (2) Disclosure shall be made of any restriction upon retained 
earnings that arises from the fact that upon involuntary liquidation the 
aggregate preferences of the preferred shares exceeds the par or stated 
value of such shares.
    (e) Restrictions which limit the payment of dividends by the 
registrant. (1) Describe the most significant restrictions, other than 
as reported under paragraph (d) of this section, on the payment of 
dividends by the registrant, indicating their sources, their pertinent 
provisions, and the amount of retained earnings or net income restricted 
or free of restrictions.
    (2) Disclose the amount of consolidated retained earnings which 
represents undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned persons 
accounted for by the equity method.
    (3) The disclosures in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) and (ii) in this 
section shall be provided when the restricted net assets of consolidated 
and unconsolidated subsidiaries and the parent's equity in the 
undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for 
by the equity method together exceed 25 percent of consolidated net 
assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. For 
purposes of this test, restricted net assets of subsidiaries shall mean 
that amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets (after 
intercompany eliminations) reflected in the balance sheets of its 
consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the most 
recent fiscal year which may not be transferred to the parent company in 
the form of loans, advances or cash dividends by the subsidiaries 
without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, 
foreign government, etc.). Not all limitations on transferability of 
assets are considered to be restrictions for purposes of this test, 
which considers only specific third party restrictions on the ability of 
subsidiaries to transfer funds outside of the entity. For example, the 
presence of subsidiary debt which is secured by certain of the 
subsidiary's assets does not constitute a restriction under this rule. 
However, if there are any loan provisions prohibiting dividend payments, 
loans or advances to the parent by a subsidiary, these are considered 
restrictions for purposes of computing restricted net assets. When a 
loan agreement requires that a subsidiary maintain certain working 
capital, net tangible asset, or net asset levels, or where formal 
compensating arrangements exist, there is considered to be a restriction 
under the rule because the lender's intent is normally to preclude the 
transfer by dividend or otherwise of funds to the parent company. 
Similarly, a provision which requires that a subsidiary reinvest all of 
its earnings is a restriction, since this precludes loans, advances or 
dividends in the amount of such undistributed earnings by the entity. 
Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or 
advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of 
cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be 
used. Redeemable preferred stocks (Sec. 210.5-02.28) and minority 
interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this 
test.
    (i) Describe the nature of any restrictions on the ability of 
consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer 
funds to the registrant in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances 
(i.e., borrowing arrangements, regulatory restraints, foreign 
government, etc.).
    (ii) Disclose separately the amounts of such restricted net assets 
for unconsolidated subsidiaries and consolidated subsidiaries as of the 
end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
    (f) Significant changes in bonds, mortgages and similar debt. Any 
significant changes in the authorized or issued amounts of bonds, 
mortgages and similar debt since the date of the latest balance sheet 
being filed for a particular person or group shall be stated.
    (g) Summarized financial information of subsidiaries not 
consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons. (1) The summarized 
information as to assets, liabilities and results of operations as 
detailed in Sec. 210.1-02(bb) shall be presented in notes to the 
financial statements on an individual or group basis for:
    (i) Subsidiaries not consolidated; or

[[Page 239]]

    (ii) For 50 percent or less owned persons accounted for by the 
equity method by the registrant or by a subsidiary of the registrant, if 
the criteria in Sec. 210.1-02(w) for a significant subsidiary are met:
    (A) Individually by any subsidiary not consolidated or any 50% or 
less owned person; or
    (B) On an aggregated basis by any combination of such subsidiaries 
and persons.
    (2) Summarized financial information shall be presented insofar as 
is practicable as of the same dates and for the same periods as the 
audited consolidated financial statements provided and shall include the 
disclosures prescribed by Sec. 210.1-02(bb). Summarized information of 
subsidiaries not consolidated shall not be combined for disclosure 
purposes with the summarized information of 50 percent or less owned 
persons.
    (h) Income tax expense. (1) Disclosure shall be made in the income 
statement or a note thereto, of (i) the components of income (loss) 
before income tax expense (benefit) as either domestic or foreign; (ii) 
the components of income tax expense, including (A) taxes currently 
payable and (B) the net tax effects, as applicable, of timing 
differences (indicate separately the amount of the estimated tax effect 
of each of the various types of timing differences, such as 
depreciation, warranty costs, etc., where the amount of each such tax 
effect exceeds five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the 
income before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate; 
other differences may be combined.)
    Note: Amounts applicable to United States Federal income taxes, to 
foreign income taxes and the other income taxes shall be stated 
separately for each major component. Amounts applicable to foreign 
income (loss) and amounts applicable to foreign or other income taxes 
which are less than five percent of the total of income before taxes or 
the component of tax expense, respectively, need not be separately 
disclosed. For purposes of this rule, foreign income (loss) is defined 
as income (loss) generated from a registrant's foreign operations, i.e., 
operations that are located outside of the registrant's home country.

    (2) Provide a reconciliation between the amount of reported total 
income tax expense (benefit) and the amount computed by multiplying the 
income (loss) before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax 
rate, showing the estimated dollar amount of each of the underlying 
causes for the difference. If no individual reconciling item amounts to 
more than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income 
before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate, and the 
total difference to be reconciled is less than five percent of such 
computed amount, no reconciliation need be provided unless it would be 
significant in appraising the trend of earnings. Reconciling items that 
are individually less than five percent of the computed amount may be 
aggregated in the reconciliation. The reconciliation may be presented in 
percentages rather than in dollar amounts. Where the reporting person is 
a foreign entity, the income tax rate in that person's country of 
domicile should normally be used in making the above computation, but 
different rates should not be used for subsidiaries or other segments of 
a reporting entity. When the rate used by a reporting person is other 
than the United States Federal corporate income tax rate, the rate used 
and the basis for using such rate shall be disclosed.
    (3) Paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section shall be applied in 
the following manner to financial statements which reflect the adoption 
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 109, Accounting for 
Income Taxes.
    (i) The disclosures required by paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section 
and by the parenthetical instruction at the end of paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section and by the introductory sentence of paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section shall not apply.
    (ii) The instructional note between paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of 
this section and the balance of the requirements of paragraphs (h) (1) 
and (2) of this section shall continue to apply.
    (i) Warrants or rights outstanding. Information with respect to 
warrants or rights outstanding at the date of the related balance sheet 
shall be set forth as follows:

[[Page 240]]

    (1) Title of issue of securities called for by warrants or rights.
    (2) Aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants or rights 
outstanding.
    (3) Date from which warrants or rights are exercisable.
    (4) Price at which warrant or right is exercisable.
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) Related party transactions which affect the financial 
statements. (1) Related party transactions should be identified and the 
amounts stated on the face of the balance sheet, income statement, or 
statement of cash flows.
    (2) In cases where separate financial statements are presented for 
the registrant, certain investees, or subsidiaries, separate disclosure 
shall be made in such statements of the amounts in the related 
consolidated financial statements which are (i) eliminated and (ii) not 
eliminated. Also, any intercompany profits or losses resulting from 
transactions with related parties and not eliminated and the effects 
thereof shall be disclosed.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements--(1) Repurchase 
agreements (assets sold under agreements to repurchase). (i) If, as of 
the most recent balance sheet date, the carrying amount (or market 
value, if higher than the carrying amount or if there is no carrying 
amount) of the securities or other assets sold under agreements to 
repurchase (repurchase agreements) exceeds 10% of total assets, disclose 
separately in the balance sheet the aggregate amount of liabilities 
incurred pursuant to repurchase agreements including accrued interest 
payable thereon.
    (ii)(A) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the carrying 
amount (or market value, if higher than the carrying amount) of 
securities or other assets sold under repurchase agreements, other than 
securities or assets specified in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section, exceeds 10% of total assets, disclose in an appropriately 
captioned footnote containing a tabular presentation, segregated as to 
type of such securities or assets sold under agreements to repurchase 
(e.g., U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations and 
loans), the following information as of the balance sheet date for each 
such agreement or group of agreements (other than agreements involving 
securities or assets specified in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section) maturing (1) overnight; (2) term up to 30 days; (3) term of 30 
to 90 days; (4) term over 90 days and (5) demand:
    (i) The carrying amount and market value of the assets sold under 
agreement to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or 
other assets on deposit under the repurchase agreements; and
    (ii) The repurchase liability associated with such transaction or 
group of transactions and the interest rate(s) thereon.
    (B) For purposes of paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(A) of this section only, do 
not include securities or other assets for which unrealized changes in 
market value are reported in current income or which have been obtained 
under reverse repurchase agreements.
    (iii) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the amount at 
risk under repurchase agreements with any individual counterparty or 
group of related counterparties exceeds 10% of stockholders' equity (or 
in the case of investment companies, net asset value), disclose the name 
of each such counterparty or group of related counterparties, the amount 
at risk with each, and the weighted average maturity of the repurchase 
agreements with each. The amount at risk under repurchase agreements is 
defined as the excess of carrying amount (or market value, if higher 
than the carrying amount or if there is no carrying amount) of the 
securities or other assets sold under agreement to repurchase, including 
accrued interest plus any cash or other assets on deposit to secure the 
repurchase obligation, over the amount of the repurchase liability 
(adjusted for accrued interest). (Cash deposits in connection with 
repurchase agreements shall not be reported as unrestricted cash 
pursuant to rule 5-02.1.)
    (2) Reverse repurchase agreements (assets purchased under agreements 
to resell). (i) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the 
aggregate carrying amount of reverse repurchase

[[Page 241]]

agreements (securities or other assets purchased under agreements to 
resell) exceeds 10% of total assets: (A) Disclose separately such amount 
in the balance sheet; and (B) disclose in an appropriately captioned 
footnote: (1) The registrant's policy with regard to taking possession 
of securities or other assets purchased under agreements to resell; and 
(2) whether or not there are any provisions to ensure that the market 
value of the underlying assets remains sufficient to protect the 
registrant in the event of default by the counterparty and if so, the 
nature of those provisions.
    (ii) If, as of the most recent balance sheet date, the amount at 
risk under reverse repurchase agreements with any individual 
counterparty or group of related counterparties exceeds 10% of 
stockholders' equity (or in the case of investment companies, net asset 
value), disclose the name of each such counterparty or group of related 
counterparties, the amount at risk with each, and the weighted average 
maturity of the reverse repurchase agreements with each. The amount at 
risk under reverse repurchase agreements is defined as the excess of the 
carrying amount of the reverse repurchase agreements over the market 
value of assets delivered pursuant to the agreements by the counterparty 
to the registrant (or to a third party agent that has affirmatively 
agreed to act on behalf of the registrant) and not returned to the 
counterparty, exept in exchange for their approximate market value in a 
separate transaction.
    (n) Accounting policies for certain derivative instruments. 
Disclosures regarding accounting policies shall include descriptions of 
the accounting policies used for derivative financial instruments and 
derivative commodity instruments and the methods of applying those 
policies that materially affect the determination of financial position, 
cash flows, or results of operation. This description shall include, to 
the extent material, each of the following items:
    (1) A discussion of each method used to account for derivative 
financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments;
    (2) The types of derivative financial instruments and derivative 
commodity instruments accounted for under each method; (3) The criteria 
required to be met for each accounting method used, including a 
discussion of the criteria required to be met for hedge or deferral 
accounting and accrual or settlement accounting (e.g., whether and how 
risk reduction, correlation, designation, and effectiveness tests are 
applied);
    (4) The accounting method used if the criteria specified in 
paragraph (n)(3) of this section are not met;
    (5) The method used to account for terminations of derivatives 
designated as hedges or derivatives used to affect directly or 
indirectly the terms, fair values, or cash flows of a designated item;
    (6) The method used to account for derivatives when the designated 
item matures, is sold, is extinguished, or is terminated. In addition, 
the method used to account for derivatives designated to an anticipated 
transaction, when the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to 
occur; and
    (7) Where and when derivative financial instruments and derivative 
commodity instruments, and their related gains and losses, are reported 
in the statements of financial position, cash flows, and results of 
operations.

Instructions to Paragraph (n): 1. For purposes of this paragraph (n), 
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
(collectively referred to as ``derivatives'') are defined as follows:
    (i) Derivative financial instruments have the same meaning as 
defined by generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB''), Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 119, ``Disclosure about Derivative Financial 
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,'' (``FAS 119'') 
paragraphs 5-7, (October 1994)), and include futures, forwards, swaps, 
options, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics.
    (ii) Derivative commodity instruments include, to the extent such 
instruments are not derivative financial instruments, commodity futures, 
commodity forwards, commodity swaps, commodity options, and other 
commodity instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by 
contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another 
financial instrument. For purposes of this paragraph, settlement in cash 
includes settlement in cash of the net change

[[Page 242]]

in value of the derivative commodity instrument (e.g., net cash 
settlement based on changes in the price of the underlying commodity).
    2. For purposes of paragraphs (n)(2), (n)(3), (n)(4), and (n)(7), 
the required disclosures should address separately derivatives entered 
into for trading purposes and derivatives entered into for purposes 
other than trading. For purposes of this paragraph, trading purposes has 
the same meaning as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
(see, e.g., FAS 119, paragraph 9a (October 1994)).
    3. For purposes of paragraph (n)(6), anticipated transactions means 
transactions (other than transactions involving existing assets or 
liabilities or transactions necessitated by existing firm commitments) 
an enterprise expects, but is not obligated, to carry out in the normal 
course of business (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 80, ``Accounting for Futures Contracts,'' paragraph 9, 
(August 1984)).
    4. Registrants should provide disclosures required under paragraph 
(n) in filings with the Commission that include financial statements of 
fiscal periods ending after June 15, 1997.

Sec. 210.4-9  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 210.4-10  Financial accounting and reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and 
          Conservation Act of 1975.

    This section prescribes financial accounting and reporting standards 
for registrants with the Commission engaged in oil and gas producing 
activities in filings under the Federal securities laws and for the 
preparation of accounts by persons engaged, in whole or in part, in the 
production of crude oil or natural gas in the United States, pursuant to 
section 503 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 
6383) (EPCA) and section 11(c) of the Energy Supply and Environmental 
Coordination Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 796) (ESECA), as amended by section 
505 of EPCA. The application of this section to those oil and gas 
producing operations of companies regulated for ratemaking purposes on 
an individual-company-cost-of-service basis may, however, give 
appropriate recognition to differences arising because of the effect of 
the ratemaking process.

Exemption. Any person exempted by the Department of Energy from any 
record-keeping or reporting requirements pursuant to section 11(c) of 
ESECA, as amended, is similarly exempted from the related provisions of 
this section in the preparation of accounts pursuant to EPCA. This 
exemption does not affect the applicability of this section to filings 
pursuant to the Federal securities laws.

                               Definitions

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply to the terms listed 
below as they are used in this section:
    (1) Oil and gas producing activities. (i) Such activities include:
    (A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas 
liquids, or natural gas (oil and gas) in their natural states and 
original locations.
    (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose 
of further exploration and/or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas 
from existing reservoirs on those properties.
    (C) The construction, drilling and production activities necessary 
to retrieve oil and gas from its natural reservoirs, and the 
acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field 
gathering and storage systems--including lifting the oil and gas to the 
surface and gathering, treating, field processing (as in the case of 
processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons) and field storage. For 
purposes of this section, the oil and gas production function shall 
normally be regarded as terminating at the outlet valve on the lease or 
field storage tank; if unusual physical or operational circumstances 
exist, it may be appropriate to regard the production functions as 
terminating at the first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids are 
delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine 
terminal.
    (ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include:
    (A) The transporting, refining and marketing of oil and gas.
    (B) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other 
than oil and gas.

[[Page 243]]

    (C) The production of geothermal steam or the extraction of 
hydrocarbons as a by-product of the production of geothermal steam or 
associated geothermal resources as defined in the Geothermal Steam Act 
of 1970.
    (D) The extraction of hydrocarbons from shale, tar sands, or coal.
    (2) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are the 
estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids 
which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable 
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under 
existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of 
the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes 
in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on 
escalations based upon future conditions.
    (i) Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is 
supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test. The 
area of a reservoir considered proved includes (A) that portion 
delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water contacts, 
if any, and (B) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but 
which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis 
of available geological and engineering data. In the absence of 
information on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of 
hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir.
    (ii) Reserves which can be produced economically through application 
of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included 
in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project, 
or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides 
support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was 
based.
    (iii) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following: (A) 
Oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified 
separately as indicated additional reserves; (B) crude oil, natural gas, 
and natural gas liquids, the recovery of which is subject to reasonable 
doubt because of uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics, 
or economic factors; (C) crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas 
liquids, that may occur in undrilled prospects; and (D) crude oil, 
natural gas, and natural gas liquids, that may be recovered from oil 
shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.
    (3) Proved developed oil and gas reserves. Proved developed oil and 
gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through 
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional 
oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid 
injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the 
natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as 
proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after 
the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production 
response that increased recovery will be achieved.
    (4) Proved undeveloped reserves. Proved undeveloped oil and gas 
reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells 
on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major 
expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage 
shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units 
that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves 
for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be 
demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from 
the existing productive formation. Under no circumstances should 
estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage 
for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery 
technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved 
effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
    (5) Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves.
    (6) Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.
    (7) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves 
have been specifically attributed.
    (8) Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple 
reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological 
structural feature

[[Page 244]]

and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a 
field that are separated vertically by intervening impervious, strata, 
or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are 
associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as 
a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural 
feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized 
geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, 
provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc.
    (9) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation 
containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is 
confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and 
separate from other reservoirs.
    (10) Exploratory well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or gas 
in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found 
to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir, or to extend a 
known reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not 
a development well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as 
those items are defined below.
    (11) Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an 
oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be 
productive.
    (12) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of 
supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service 
wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air 
injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, 
or injection for in-situ combustion.
    (13) Stratigraphic test well. A drilling effort, geologically 
directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic 
condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intention of 
being completed for hydrocarbon production. This classification also 
includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable 
holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic test wells are 
classified as (i) exploratory-type, if not drilled in a proved area, or 
(ii) development-type, if drilled in a proved area.
    (14) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or 
otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and 
options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable 
to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, 
brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in 
acquiring properties.
    (15) Exploration costs. Costs incurred in identifying areas that may 
warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered 
to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves, including costs of 
drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test 
wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the 
related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) 
and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, 
which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support 
equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are:
    (i) Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, 
rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries 
and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others 
conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to 
as geological and geophysical or G&G costs.
    (ii) Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as 
delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title 
defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records.
    (iii) Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions.
    (iv) Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells.
    (v) Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells.
    (16) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved 
reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering 
and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, 
including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support 
equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are 
costs incurred to:

[[Page 245]]

    (i) Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, 
including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining 
specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road 
building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to 
the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves.
    (ii) Drill and equip development wells, development-type 
stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of 
platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping 
equipment, and the wellhead assembly.
    (iii) Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as 
lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring 
devices, and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and 
processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems.
    (iv) Provide improved recovery systems.
    (17) Production costs. (i) Costs incurred to operate and maintain 
wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and 
applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other 
costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and 
facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. 
Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are:
    (A) Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and 
facilities.
    (B) Repairs and maintenance.
    (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in 
operating the wells and related equipment and facilities.
    (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and 
wells and related equipment and facilities.
    (E) Severance taxes.
    (ii) Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil 
and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, 
refining, and marketing activities. To the extent that the support 
equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, 
their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, 
development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, 
depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and 
development costs are not production costs but also become part of the 
cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs 
identified above.

                        Successful Efforts Method

    (b) A reporting entity that follows the successful efforts method 
shall comply with the accounting and financial reporting disclosure 
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, as 
amended.

                            Full Cost Method

    (c) Application of the full cost method of accounting. A reporting 
entity that follows the full cost method shall apply that method to all 
of its operations and to the operations of its subsidiaries, as follows:
    (1) Determination of cost centers. Cost centers shall be established 
on a country-by-country basis.
    (2) Costs to be capitalized. All costs associated with property 
acquisition, exploration, and development activities (as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section) shall be capitalized within the 
appropriate cost center. Any internal costs that are capitalized shall 
be limited to those costs that can be directly identified with 
acquisition, exploration, and development activities undertaken by the 
reporting entity for its own account, and shall not include any costs 
related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar 
activities.
    (3) Amortization of capitalized costs. Capitalized costs within a 
cost center shall be amortized on the unit-of-production basis using 
proved oil and gas reserves, as follows:
    (i) Costs to be amortized shall include (A) all capitalized costs, 
less accumulated amortization, other than the cost of properties 
described in paragraph (ii) below; (B) the estimated future expenditures 
(based on current costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves; 
and (C) estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated 
salvage values.
    (ii) The cost of investments in unproved properties and major 
development projects may be excluded from

[[Page 246]]

capitalized costs to be amortized, subject to the following:
    (A) All costs directly associated with the acquisition and 
evaluation of unproved properties may be excluded from the amortization 
computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be 
assigned to the properties, subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Until such a determination is made, the properties shall be 
assessed at least annually to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. 
Unevaluated properties whose costs are individually significant shall be 
assessed individually. Where it is not practicable to individually 
assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not 
individually significant, such properties may be grouped for purposes of 
assessing impairment. Impairment may be estimated by applying factors 
based on historical experience and other data such as primary lease 
terms of the properties, average holding periods of unproved properties, 
and geographic and geologic data to groupings of individually 
insignificant properties and projects. The amount of impairment assessed 
under either of these methods shall be added to the costs to be 
amortized.
    (2) The costs of drilling exploratory dry holes shall be included in 
the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is 
dry.
    (3) If geological and geophysical costs cannot be directly 
associated with specific unevaluated properties, they shall be included 
in the amortization base as incurred. Upon complete evaluation of a 
property, the total remaining excluded cost (net of any impairment) 
shall be included in the full cost amortization base.
    (B) Certain costs may be excluded from amortization when incurred in 
connection with major development projects expected to entail 
significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves 
attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation 
of an offshore drilling platform from which development wells are to be 
drilled, the installation of improved recovery programs, and similar 
major projects undertaken in the expectation of significant additions to 
proved reserves). The amounts which may be excluded are applicable 
portions of (1) the costs that relate to the major development project 
and have not previously been included in the amortization base, and (2) 
the estimated future expenditures associated with the development 
project. The excluded portion of any common costs associated with the 
development project should be based, as is most appropriate in the 
circumstances, on a comparison of either (i) existing proved reserves to 
total proved reserves expected to be established upon completion of the 
project, or (ii) the number of wells to which proved reserves have been 
assigned and total number of wells expected to be drilled. Such costs 
may be excluded from costs to be amortized until the earlier 
determination of whether additional reserves are proved or impairment 
occurs.
    (C) Excluded costs and the proved reserves related to such costs 
shall be transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing (well-by-
well or property-by-property) basis as the project is evaluated and 
proved reserves established or impairment determined. Once proved 
reserves are established, there is no further justification for 
continued exclusion from the full cost amortization base even if other 
factors prevent immediate production or marketing.
    (iii) Amortization shall be computed on the basis of physical units, 
with oil and gas converted to a common unit of measure on the basis of 
their approximate relative energy content, unless economic circumstances 
(related to the effects of regulated prices) indicate that use of units 
of revenue is a more appropriate basis of computing amortization. In the 
latter case, amortization shall be computed on the basis of current 
gross revenues (excluding royalty payments and net profits 
disbursements) from production in relation to future gross revenues, 
based on current prices (including consideration of changes in existing 
prices provided only by contractual arrangements), from estimated 
production of proved oil and gas reserves. The effect of a significant 
price increase during the year on estimated future gross revenues shall 
be reflected in the amortization

[[Page 247]]

provision only for the period after the price increase occurs.
    (iv) In some cases it may be more appropriate to depreciate natural 
gas cycling and processing plants by a method other than the unit-of-
production method.
    (v) Amortization computations shall be made on a consolidated basis, 
including investees accounted for on a proportionate consolidation 
basis. Investees accounted for on the equity method shall be treated 
separately.
    (4) Limitation on capitalized costs. (i) For each cost center, 
capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred 
income taxes, shall not exceed an amount (the cost center ceiling) equal 
to the sum of:
    (A) The present value of estimated future net revenues computed by 
applying current prices of oil and gas reserves (with consideration of 
price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) 
to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the 
date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future 
expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and 
producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of ten 
percent and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions; plus
    (B) the cost of properties not being amortized pursuant to paragraph 
(i)(3)(ii) of this section; plus
    (C) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties 
included in the costs being amortized; less
    (D) income tax effects related to differences between the book and 
tax basis of the properties referred to in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) (B) and 
(C) of this section.
    (ii) If unamortized costs capitalized within a cost center, less 
related deferred income taxes, exceed the cost center ceiling, the 
excess shall be charged to expense and separately disclosed during the 
period in which the excess occurs. Amounts thus required to be written 
off shall not be reinstated for any subsequent increase in the cost 
center ceiling.
    (5) Production costs. All costs relating to production activities, 
including workover costs incurred solely to maintain or increase levels 
of production from an existing completion interval, shall be charged to 
expense as incurred.
    (6) Other transactions. The provisions of paragraph (h) of this 
section, ``Mineral property conveyances and related transactions if the 
successful efforts method of accounting is followed,'' shall apply also 
to those reporting entities following the full cost method except as 
follows:
    (i) Sales and abandonments of oil and gas properties. Sales of oil 
and gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, shall be 
accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss 
recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the 
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and 
gas attributable to a cost center. For instance, a significant 
alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur for sales involving 
less than 25 percent of the reserve quantities of a given cost center. 
If gain or loss is recognized on such a sale, total capitalization costs 
within the cost center shall be allocated between the reserves sold and 
reserves retained on the same basis used to compute amortization, unless 
there are substantial economic differences between the properties sold 
and those retained, in which case capitalized costs shall be allocated 
on the basis of the relative fair values of the properties. Abandonments 
of oil and gas properties shall be accounted for as adjustments of 
capitalized costs; that is, the cost of abandoned properties shall be 
charged to the full cost center and amortized (subject to the limitation 
on capitalized costs in paragraph (b) of this section).
    (ii) Purchases of reserves. Purchases of oil and gas reserves in 
place ordinarily shall be accounted for as additional capitalized costs 
within the applicable cost center; however, significant purchases of 
production payments or properties with lives substantially shorter than 
the composite productive life of the cost center shall be accounted for 
separately.
    (iii) Partnerships, joint ventures and drilling arrangements. (A) 
Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section, all 
consideration received from

[[Page 248]]

sales or transfers of properties in connection with partnerships, joint 
venture operations, or various other forms of drilling arrangements 
involving oil and gas exploration and development activities (e.g., 
carried interest, turnkey wells, management fees, etc.) shall be 
credited to the full cost account, except to the extent of amounts that 
represent reimbursement of organization, offering, general and 
administrative expenses, etc., that are identifiable with the 
transaction, if such amounts are currently incurred and charged to 
expense.
    (B) Where a registrant organizes and manages a limited partnership 
involved only in the purchase of proved developed properties and 
subsequent distribution of income from such properties, management fee 
income may be recognized provided the properties involved do not require 
aggregate development expenditures in connection with production of 
existing proved reserves in excess of 10% of the partnership's recorded 
cost of such properties. Any income not recognized as a result of this 
limitation would be credited to the full cost account and recognized 
through a lower amortization provision as reserves are produced.
    (iv) Other services. No income shall be recognized in connection 
with contractual services performed (e.g. drilling, well service, or 
equipment supply services, etc.) in connection with properties in which 
the registrant or an affiliate (as defined in Sec. 210.1-02(b)) holds an 
ownership or other economic interest, except as follows:
    (A) Where the registrant acquires an interest in the properties in 
connection with the service contract, income may be recognized to the 
extent the cash consideration received exceeds the related contract 
costs plus the registrant's share of costs incurred and estimated to be 
incurred in connection with the properties. Ownership interests acquired 
within one year of the date of such a contract are considered to be 
acquired in connection with the service for purposes of applying this 
rule. The amount of any guarantees or similar arrangements undertaken as 
part of this contract should be considered as part of the costs related 
to the properties for purposes of applying this rule.
    (B) Where the registrant acquired an interest in the properties at 
least one year before the date of the service contract through 
transactions unrelated to the service contract, and that interest is 
unaffected by the service contract, income from such contract may be 
recognized subject to the general provisions for elimination of inter-
company profit under generally accepted accounting principles.
    (C) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (i)(6)(iv) (A) and 
(B) of this section, no income may be recognized for contractual 
services performed on behalf of investors in oil and gas producing 
activities managed by the registrant or an affiliate. Furthermore, no 
income may be recognized for contractual services to the extent that the 
consideration received for such services represents an interest in the 
underlying property.
    (D) Any income not recognized as a result of these rules would be 
credited to the full cost account and recognized through a lower 
amortization provision as reserves are produced.
    (7) Disclosures. Reporting entities that follow the full cost method 
of accounting shall disclose all of the information required by 
paragraph (k) of this section, with each cost center considered as a 
separate geographic area, except that reasonable groupings may be made 
of cost centers that are not significant in the aggregate. In addition:
    (i) For each cost center for each year that an income statement is 
required, disclose the total amount of amortization expense (per 
equivalent physical unit of production if amortization is computed on 
the basis of physical units or per dollar of gross revenue from 
production if amortization is computed on the basis of gross revenue).
    (ii) State separately on the face of the balance sheet the aggregate 
of the capitalized costs of unproved properties and major development 
projects that are excluded, in accordance with paragraph (i)(3) of this 
section, from the capitalized costs being amortized. Provide a 
description in the notes to the financial statements of the current 
status of the significant properties or

[[Page 249]]

projects involved, including the anticipated timing of the inclusion of 
the costs in the amortization computation. Present a table that shows, 
by category of cost, (A) the total costs excluded as of the most recent 
fiscal year; and (B) the amounts of such excluded costs, incurred (1) in 
each of the three most recent fiscal years and (2) in the aggregate for 
any earlier fiscal years in which the costs were incurred. Categories of 
cost to be disclosed include acquisition costs, exploration costs, 
development costs in the case of significant development projects and 
capitalized interest.

                              Income Taxes

    (d) Income taxes. Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation by 
a method which complies with generally accepted accounting principles 
shall be followed for intangible drilling and development costs and 
other costs incurred that enter into the determination of taxable income 
and pretax accounting income in different periods.

Sec. 210.5-02  Balance sheets.

    The purpose of this rule is to indicate the various line items and 
certain additional disclosures which, if applicable, and except as 
otherwise permitted by the Commission, should appear on the face of the 
balance sheets or related notes filed for the persons to whom this 
article pertains (see Sec. 210.4-01(a)).

                         Assets and Other Debits

                    Current Assets, when appropriate

                           [See Sec. 210.4-05]

    1. Cash and cash items. Separate disclosure shall be made of the 
cash and cash items which are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. The 
provisions of any restrictions shall be described in a note to the 
financial statements. Restrictions may include legally restricted 
deposits held as compensating balances against short-term borrowing 
arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements 
of intention with regard to particular deposits; however, time deposits 
and short-term certificates of deposit are not generally included in 
legally restricted deposits. In cases where compensating balance 
arrangements exist but are not agreements which legally restrict the use 
of cash amounts shown on the balance sheet, describe in the notes to the 
financial statements these arrangements and the amount involved, if 
determinable, for the most recent audited balance sheet required and for 
any subsequent unaudited balance sheet required in the notes to the 
financial statements. Compensating balances that are

[[Page 250]]

maintained under an agreement to assure future credit availability shall 
be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements along with the 
amount and terms of such agreement.
    2. Marketable securities. The accounting and disclosure requirements 
for current marketable equity securities are specified by generally 
accepted accounting principles. With respect to all other current 
marketable securities, state, parenthetically or otherwise, the basis of 
determining the aggregate amount shown in the balance sheet, along with 
the alternatives of the aggregate cost or the aggregate market value at 
the balance sheet date.
    3. Accounts and notes receivable. (a) State separately amounts 
receivable from (1) customers (trade); (2) related parties (see 
Sec. 210.4-08(k)); (3) underwriters, promoters, and employees (other 
than related parties) which arose in other than the ordinary course of 
business; and (4) others.
    (b) If the aggregate amount of notes receivable exceeds 10 percent 
of the aggregate amount of receivables, the above information shall be 
set forth separately, in the balance sheet or in a note thereto, for 
accounts receivable and notes receivable.
    (c) If receivables include amounts due under long-term contracts 
(see Sec. 210.5-02.6(d)), state separately in the balance sheet or in a 
note to the financial statements the following amounts:
    (1) Balances billed but not paid by customers under retainage 
provisions in contracts.
    (2) Amounts representing the recognized sales value of performance 
and such amounts that had not been billed and were not billable to 
customers at the date of the balance sheet. Include a general 
description of the prerequisites for billing.
    (3) Billed or unbilled amounts representing claims or other similar 
items subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate 
realization. Include a description of the nature and status of the 
principal items comprising such amount.
    (4) With respect to (1) through (3) above, also state the amounts 
included in each item which are expected to be collected after one year. 
Also state, by year, if practicable, when the amounts of retainage (see 
(1) above) are expected to be collected.
    4. Allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable. The amount 
is to be set forth separately in the balance sheet or in a note thereto.
    5. Unearned income.
    6. Inventories. (a) State separately in the balance sheet or in a 
note thereto, if practicable, the amounts of major classes of inventory 
such as: (1) Finished goods; (2) inventoried costs relating to long-term 
contracts or programs (see (d) below and Sec. 210.4-05); (3) work in 
process (see Sec. 210.4-05); (4) raw materials; and (5) supplies. If the 
method of calculating a LIFO inventory does not allow for the practical 
determination of amounts assigned to major classes of inventory, the 
amounts of those classes may be stated under cost flow assumptions other 
that LIFO with the excess of such total amount over the agggregate LIFO 
amount shown as a deduction to arrive at the amount of the LIFO 
inventory.
    (b) The basis of determining the amounts shall be stated.
    If cost is used to determine any portion of the inventory amounts, 
the description of this method shall include the nature of the cost 
elements included in inventory. Elements of cost include, among other 
items, retained costs representing the excess of manufacturing or 
production costs over the amounts charged to cost of sales or delivered 
or in-process units, initial tooling or other deferred startup costs, or 
general and administrative costs.
    The method by which amounts are removed from inventory (e.g., 
average cost, first-in, first-out, last-in, first-out, estimated average 
cost per unit) shall be described. If the estimated average cost per 
unit is used as a basis to determine amounts removed from inventory 
under a total program or similar basis of accounting, the principal 
assumptions (including, where meaningful, the aggregate number of units 
expected to be delivered under the program, the number of units 
delivered to date and the number of units on order) shall be disclosed.
    If any general and administrative costs are charged to inventory, 
state in a note to the financial statements the aggregate amount of the 
general and administrative costs incurred in each period and the actual 
or estimated amount remaining in inventory at the date of each balance 
sheet.
    (c) If the LIFO inventory method is used, the excess of replacement 
or current cost over stated LIFO value shall, if material, be stated 
parenthetically or in a note to the financial statements.
    (d) For purposes of Secs. 210.5-02.3 and 210.5-02.6, long-term 
contracts or programs include (1) all contracts or programs for which 
gross profits are recognized on a percentage-of-completion method of 
accounting or any variant thereof (e.g., delivered unit, cost to cost, 
physical completion), and (2) any contracts or programs accounted for on 
a completed contract basis of accounting where, in either case, the 
contracts or programs have associated with them material amounts of 
inventories or unbilled receivables and where such contracts or programs 
have been or are expected to be performed over a period of more than 
twelve months. Contracts or programs of shorter duration may also be 
included, if deemed appropriate.
    For all long-term contracts or programs, the following information, 
if applicable,

[[Page 251]]

shall be stated in a note to the financial statements:
    (i) The aggregate amount of manufacturing or production costs and 
any related deferred costs (e.g., initial tooling costs) which exceeds 
the aggregate estimated cost of all in-process and delivered units on 
the basis of the estimated average cost of all units expected to be 
produced under long-term contracts and programs not yet complete, as 
well as that portion of such amount which would not be absorbed in cost 
of sales based on existing firm orders at the latest balance sheet date. 
In addition, if practicable, disclose the amount of deferred costs by 
type of cost (e.g., initial tooling, deferred production, etc.).
    (ii) The aggregate amount representing claims or other similar items 
subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate 
realization, and include a description of the nature and status of the 
principal items comprising such aggregate amount.
    (iii) The amount of progress payments netted against inventory at 
the date of the balance sheet.
    7. Prepaid expenses.
    8. Other current assets. State separately, in the balance sheet or 
in a note thereto, any amounts in excess of five percent of total 
current assets.
    9. Total current assets, when appropriate.
    10. Securities of related parties. (See Sec. 210.4-08(k).)
    11. Indebtedness of related parties--not current. (See Sec. 210.4-
08(k).)
    12. Other investments. The accounting and disclosure requirements 
for non-current marketable equity securities are specified by generally 
accepted accounting principles. With respect to other security 
investments and any other investment, state, parenthetically or 
otherwise, the basis of determining the aggregate amounts shown in the 
balance sheet, along with the alternate of the aggregate cost or 
aggregate market value at the balance sheet date.
    13. Property, plant and equipment.
    (a) State the basis of determining the amounts.
    (b) Tangible and intangible utility plant of a public utility 
company shall be segregated so as to show separately the original cost, 
plant acquisition adjustments, and plant adjustments, as required by the 
system of accounts prescribed by the applicable regulatory authorities. 
This rule shall not be applicable in respect to companies which are not 
required to make such a classification.
    14. Accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization of 
property, plant and equipment. The amount is to be set forth separately 
in the balance sheet or in a note thereto.
    15. Intangible assets. State separately each class of such assets 
which is in excess of five percent of the total assets, along with the 
basis of determining the respective amounts. Any significant addition or 
deletion shall be explained in a note.
    16. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. 
The amount is to be set forth separately in the balance sheet or in a 
note thereto.
    17. Other assets. State separately, in the balance sheet or in a 
note thereto, any other item not properly classed in one of the 
preceding asset captions which is in excess of five percent to total 
assets. Any significant addition or deletion should be explained in a 
note. With respect to any significant deferred charge, state the policy 
for deferral and amortization.
    18. Total assets.

                  Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity

        Current Liabilities, When Appropriate (See Sec. 210.4-05)

    19. Accounts and notes payable. (a) State separately amounts payable 
to (1) banks for borrowings; (2) factors or other financial institutions 
for borrowings; (3) holders of commercial paper; (4) trade creditors; 
(5) related parties (see Sec. 210.4-08(k)); (6) underwriters, promoters, 
and employees (other than related parties); and (7) others. Amounts 
applicable to (1), (2) and (3) may be stated separately in the balance 
sheet or in a note thereto.
    (b) The amount and terms (including commitment fees and the 
conditions under which lines may be withdrawn) of unused lines of credit 
for short-term financing shall be disclosed, if significant, in the 
notes to the financial statements. The weighted average interest rate on 
short term borrowings outstanding as of the date of each balance sheet 
presented shall be furnished in a note. The amount of these lines of 
credit which support a commercial paper borrowing arrangement or similar 
arrangements shall be separately identified.
    20. Other current liabilities. State separately, in the balance 
sheet or in a note thereto, any item in excess of 5 percent of total 
current liabilities. Such items may include, but are not limited to, 
accrued payrolls, accrued interest, taxes, indicating the current 
portion of deferred income taxes, and the current portion of long-term 
debt. Remaining items may be shown in one amount.
    21. Total current liabilities, when appropriate.

                             Long-Term Debt

    22. Bonds, mortgages and other long-term debt, including capitalized 
leases. (a) State separately, in the balance sheet or in a note thereto, 
each issue or type of obligation and such information as will indicate 
(see Sec. 210.4-06):
    (1) The general character of each type of debt including the rate of 
interest; (2) the date of maturity, or, if maturing serially, a brief 
indication of the serial maturities, such

[[Page 252]]

as ``maturing serially from 1980 to 1990''; (3) if the payment of 
principal or interest is contingent, an appropriate indication of such 
contingency; (4) a brief indication of priority; and (5) if convertible, 
the basis. For amounts owed to related parties, see Sec. 210.4-08(k).
    (b) The amount and terms (including commitment fees and the 
conditions under which commitments may be withdrawn) of unused 
commitments for long-term financing arrangements that would be disclosed 
under this rule if used shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial 
statements if significant.
    23. Indebtedness to related parties--noncurrent. Include under this 
caption indebtedness to related parties as required under Sec. 210.4-
08(k).
    24. Other liabilities. State separately, in the balance sheet or in 
a note thereto, any item not properly classified in one of the preceding 
liability captions which is in excess of 5 percent of total liabilities.

    28. Preferred stocks subject to mandatory redemption requirements or 
whose redemption is outside the control of the issuer. (a) Include under 
this caption amounts applicable to any class of stock which has any of 
the following characteristics: (1) it is redeemable at a fixed or 
determinable price on a fixed or determinable date or dates, whether by 
operation of a sinking fund or otherwise; (2) it is redeemable at the 
option of the holder; or (3) it has conditions for redemption which are 
not solely within the control of the issuer, such as stocks which must 
be redeemed out of future earnings. Amounts attributable to preferred 
stock which is not redeemable or is redeemable solely at the option of 
the issuer shall be included under Sec. 210.5-02.29 unless it meets one 
or more of the above criteria.
    (b) State on the face of the balance sheet the title of each issue, 
the carrying amount, and redemption amount. (If there is more than one 
issue, these amounts may be aggregated on the face of the balance sheet 
and details concerning each issue may be presented in the note required 
by paragraph (c) below.) Show also the dollar amount of any shares 
subscribed but unissued, and show the deduction of subscriptions 
receivable therefrom. If the carrying value is different from the 
redemption amount, describe the accounting treatment for such difference 
in the note required by paragraph (c) below. Also state in this note or 
on the face of the balance sheet, for each issue, the number of shares 
authorized and the number of shares issued or outstanding, as

    (c) State in a separate note captioned ``Redeemable Preferred 
Stocks'' (1) a general description of each issue, including its 
redemption features (e.g. sinking fund, at option of holders, out of 
future earnings) and the rights, if any, of holders in the event of 
default, including the effect, if any, on junior securities in the event 
a required dividend, sinking fund, or other redemption payment(s) is not 
made; (2) the combined aggregate amount of redemption requirements for 
all issues each year for the five years following the date of the latest 
balance sheet; and (3) the changes in each issue for each period for 
which an income statement is required to be filed. (See also Sec. 210.4-
08(d).)
    (d) Securities reported under this caption are not to be included 
under a general heading ``stockholders' equity'' or combined in a total 
with items described in captions 29, 30 or 31 which follow.

                     Non-Redeemable Preferred Stocks

    29. Preferred stocks which are not redeemable or are redeemable 
solely at the option of the issuer. State on the face of the balance 
sheet, or if more than one issue is outstanding state in a note, the 
title of each issue and the dollar amount thereof. Show also the dollar 
amount of any shares subscribed but unissued, and show the deduction of 
subscriptions receivable therefrom. State on the face of the balance 
sheet or in a note, for each issue, the number of shares authorized and 
the number of shares issued or outstanding, as appropriate (see

Sec. 210.5-04  What schedules are to be filed.

    (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in the applicable form:
    (1) The schedules specified below in this Section as Schedules II 
and III shall be filed as of the date of the most recent audited 
balanced sheet for each person or group.
    (2) Schedule II shall be filed for each period for which an audited 
income statement is required to be filed for each person or group.
    (3) Schedules I and IV shall be filed as of the date and for periods 
specified in the schedule.
    (b) When information is required in schedules for both the 
registrant and the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated it may 
be presented in the form of a single schedule: Provided, That items 
pertaining to the registrant are separately shown and that such single 
schedule affords a properly summarized presentation of the facts. If the 
information required by any schedule (including the notes thereto) may 
be shown in the related financial statement or in a note thereto without 
making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be 
followed and the schedule omitted.
    (c) The schedules shall be examined by the independent accountant if 
the related financial statements are so examined.

    Schedule I--Condensed financial information of registrant. The 
schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be filed when the restricted 
net assets (Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 
percent of consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently 
completed fiscal year. For purposes of the above test, restricted net 
assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the 
registrant's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of 
the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the parent company 
by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without 
the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign 
government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may 
be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer 
in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the 
subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (Sec. 210.5-02.28) 
and minority interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for 
purposes of this test.
    Schedule II--Valuation and qualifying accounts. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-09 shall be filed in support of valuation and 
qualifying accounts included in each balance sheet but not included in 
Schedule VI. (See Sec. 210.4-02.)
    Schedule III--Real estate and accumulated depreciation. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-28 shall be filed for real estate (and the 
related accumulated depreciation) held by persons a substantial portion 
of whose business is that of acquiring and holding for investment real 
estate or interests in real estate, or interests in other persons a 
substantial portion of whose business is that of acquiring and holding 
real estate or interests in real estate for investment. Real estate used 
in the business shall be excluded from the schedule.
    Schedule IV--Mortgage loans on real estate. The schedule prescribed 
by Sec. 210.12-29 shall be filed by persons specified under Schedule XI 
for investments in mortgage loans on real estate.
    Schedule V--Supplemental Information Concerning Property-casualty 
Insurance Operations. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-18 shall be 
filed when a registrant, its subsidiaries or 50%-or-less-owned equity 
basis investees, have liabilities for property-casualty (``P/C'') 
insurance claims. The required information shall be presented as of the 
same dates and for the same periods for which the information is 
reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements required by 
Secs. 210.3-01 and 3-02. The schedule may be omitted if reserves for 
unpaid P/C claims and claims adjustment expenses of the registrant and 
its consolidated subsidiaries, its unconsolidated subsidiaries and its 
50%-or-less-owned equity basis investees did

[[Page 255]]

not, in the aggregate, exceed one-half of common stockholders' equity of 
the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the beginning of 
the fiscal year. For purposes of this test only the proportionate share 
of the registrant and its other subsidiaries in the reserves for unpaid 
claims and claim adjustment expenses of 50%-or-less-owned equity basis 
investees taken in the aggregate after intercompany eliminations shall 
be taken into account.

the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, shall be stated in a note 
referred to in the appropriate statements. Such note shall also indicate 
briefly the principal assumptions on which the company relied in making

the Internal Revenue Code shall, on the last day of its taxable year 
(and not earlier), make provision for taxes on such undistributed 
capital gains realized during such year.

or preference in involuntary liquidation (whichever is appropriate) of 
securities of the same class prior to such sale; and

repurchased during the period of report and the cost thereof. Closed-end 
management investment companies shall furnish the following additional

determine the exact amounts involved.

shall, in the case of a person which in essence is comprised of more 
than one separate investment company, be given as if each class or 
series of such investment company were a separate investment company; 
this shall not prevent the inclusion, at the option of such person, of 
information applicable to other classes or series of such person on a 
comparative basis, except as to footnotes which need not be comparative.
    (2) If the particular class or series for which information is 
provided may be affected by other classes or series of such investment 
company, such as by the offset of realized gains in one series with 
realized losses in another, or through contingent liabilities, such 
situation shall be disclosed.

together with the lesser of future payments by certificate holders as 
and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3\1/2\ per centum per annum 
(or such other rate as may be appropriate under the circumstances of a 
particular case) compounded annually, shall provide the minimum maturity 
or face amount of the certificate when due.
    (ii) For certificates of the fully-paid type, such amount which, as 
and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3\1/2\ per centum per annum 
(or such other rate as may be appropriate under the circumstances of a 
particular case) compounded annually, shall provide the amount or 
amounts payable when due.
    (iii) Such amount or accrual therefor, as shall have been credited 
to the account of any certificate holder in the form of any credit, or 
any dividend, or any interest in addition to the minimum maturity or 
face amount specified in the certificate, plus any accumulations on any 
amount so credited or accrued at rates required under the terms of the 
certificate.
    (iv) An amount equal to all advance payments made by certificate 
holders, plus any accumulations thereon at rates required under the 
terms of the certificate.
    (v) Amounts for other appropriate contingency reserves, for death 
and disability benefits or for reinstatement rights on any certificate 
providing for such benefits or rights.
    (l) Inapplicable captions. Attention is directed to the provisions 
of Secs. 210.4-02 and 210.4-03 which permit the omission

[[Page 258]]

of separate captions in financial statements as to which the items and 
conditions are not present, or the amounts involved not significant. 
However, amounts involving directors, officers, and affiliates shall 
nevertheless be separately set forth except as otherwise specifically 
permitted under a particular caption.

Sec. 210.7-05  What schedules are to be filed.

    (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in the applicable form:
    (1) The schedule specified below in this section as Schedules I 
shall be as of the date of the most recent audited balance sheet for 
each person or group.
    (2) The schedules specified below in this section as Schedule IV and 
V shall be filed for each period for which an audited income statement 
is required to be filed for each person or group.
    (3) Schedules II, III and V shall be filed as of the date and for 
periods specified in the schedule.
    (b) When information is required in schedules for both the 
registrant and the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated it may 
be presented in the form of a single schedule: Provided, That items 
pertaining to the registrant are shown separately and that such single 
schedule affords a properly summarized presentation of the facts. If the 
information required by any schedule (including the notes thereto) may 
be shown in the related financial statement or in a note thereto without 
making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be 
followed and the schedule omitted.
    (c) The schedules shall be examined by the independent accountant.

    Schedule I--Summary of investments--other than investments in 
related parties. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-15 shall be 
filed in support of caption 1 of the most recent audited balance sheet.
    Schedule II--Condensed financial information of registrant. The 
schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be filed when the restricted 
net assets (Sec. 210.4.08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 
percent of consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently 
completed fiscal year. For purposes of the above test, restricted net 
assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the 
registrant's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of 
the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the parent company 
by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without 
the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign 
government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may 
be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer 
in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the 
subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (Sec. 210.7-03.21) 
and minority interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for 
purposes of this test.
    Schedule III--Supplementary insurance information. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-16 shall be filed giving segment detail in 
support of various balance sheet and income statement captions. The 
required balance sheet information shall be presented as of the date of 
each audited balance sheet filed, and the income statement information 
shall be presented for each period for which an audited income statement 
is required to be filed, for each person or group.
    Schedule IV--Reinsurance. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-17 
shall be filed for reinsurance ceded and assumed.
    Schedule V--Valuation and qualifying accounts. The schedule 
prescribed by Sec. 210.12-09 shall be filed in support of valuation and 
qualifying accounts included in the balance sheet (see Sec. 210.4-02).
    Schedule VI--Supplemental Information Concerning Property-Casualty 
Insurance Operations. The information required by Sec. 210.12-18 shall 
be presented as of the same dates and for the same periods for which the 
information is reflected in the audited consolidated financial 
statements required by Secs. 210.3-01 and 3-02. The schedule may be 
omitted if reserves for unpaid property-casualty claims and claim 
adjustment expenses of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries, 
its unconsolidated subsidiaries and its 50%-or-less-owned equity basis 
investees did not in the aggregate, exceed one-half of common 
stockholders' equity of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries 
as of the beginning of the fiscal year. For purposes of this test, only 
the proportionate share of the registrant and its other subsidiaries in 
the reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of 50%-or-
less-owned equity investees taken in the aggregate after intercompany 
eliminations shall be taken into account. Article 12--Form and Content

    (2) If a significant portion of the aggregate amount of loans 
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year disclosed pursuant to 
(e)(1)(i) above relates to loans which are disclosed as nonaccrual, past 
due, restructured or potential problems (see Item III.C. 1. or 2. of

charged to income, and losses charged to the allowance.

<R05>
Sec. 210.9-05  Foreign activities.

    (a) General requirement. Separate disclosure concerning foreign 
activities shall be made for each period in which either (1) assets, or

<R05>
Sec. 210.9-06  Condensed financial information of registrant.

    The information prescribed by Sec. 210.12-04 shall be presented in a 
note to the financial statements when the restricted net assets 
(Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of 
consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed 
fiscal year. The investment in and indebtedness of and to bank 
subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet 
from amounts for other subsidiaries; the amount of cash dividends paid 
to the registrant for each of the last three years by bank subsidiaries 
shall be stated separately in the condensed income statement from 
amounts for other subsidiaries. For purposes of the above test, 
restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that 
amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of 
the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the 
parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash 
dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory 
agency, foreign government, etc.). Where restrictions on the amount of 
funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted 
as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least 
restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks 
(Sec. 210.5-02.28) and minority interests shall be deducted in computing 
net assets for purposes of this test.


<R05>
Sec. 210.9-07  [Reserved]

                      Interim Financial Statements


<R05>
Sec. 210.10-01  Interim financial statements.

    (a) Condensed statements. Interim financial statements shall follow 
the general form and content of presentation prescribed by the other 
sections of this Regulation with the following exceptions:
    (1) Interim financial statements required by this rule need only be 
provided as to the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and may 
be unaudited. Separate statements of other entities which may otherwise 
be required by this regulation may be omitted.
    (2) Interim balance sheets shall include only major captions (i.e., 
numbered captions) prescribed by the applicable sections of this 
Regulation with the exception of inventories. Data as to raw materials, 
work in process and finished goods inventories shall be included either 
on the face of the balance sheet or in the notes to the financial 
statements, if applicable. Where any major balance sheet caption is less 
than 10% of total assets, and the amount in the caption has not 
increased or decreased by more than 25% since the end of the preceding 
fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

[[Page 274]]

    (3) Interim statements of income shall also include major captions 
prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation. When any major 
income statement caption is less than 15% of average net income for the 
most recent three fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not 
increased or decreased by more than 20% as compared to the corresponding 
interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined 
with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be 
excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the most recent three 
years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. 
Notwithstanding these tests, Sec. 210.4-02 applies and de minimis 
amounts therefore need not be shown separately, except that registrants 
reporting under Sec. 210.9 shall show investment securities gains or 
losses separately regardless of size.
    (4) The statement of cash flows may be abbreviated starting with a 
single figure of net cash flows from operating activities and showing 
cash changes from investing and financing activities individually only 
when they exceed 10% of the average of net cash flows from operating 
activities for the most recent three years. Notwithstanding this test, 
Sec. 210.4-02 applies and de minimis amounts therefore need not be shown 
separately.
    (5) The interim financial information shall include disclosures 
either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying 
footnotes sufficient so as to make the interim information presented not 
misleading. Registrants may presume that users of the interim financial 
information have read or have access to the audited financial statements 
for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional 
disclosure needed for a fair presentation, except in regard to material 
contingencies, may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote 
disclosure which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained 
in the most recent annual report to security holders or latest audited 
financial statements, such as a statement of significant accounting 
policies and practices, details of accounts which have not changed 
significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year, and detailed disclosures prescribed by 
Rule 4-08 of this Regulation, may be omitted. However, disclosure shall 
be provided where events subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal 
year have occurred which have a material impact on the registrant. 
Disclosures should encompass for example, significant changes since the 
end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as: 
accounting principles and practices; estimates inherent in the 
preparation of financial statements; status of long-term contracts; 
capitalization including significant new borrowings or modification of 
existing financing arrangements; and the reporting entity resulting from 
business combinations or dispositions. Notwithstanding the above, where 
material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be 
provided even though a significant change since year end may not have 
occurred.
    (6) Detailed schedules otherwise required by this Regulation may be 
omitted for purposes of preparing interim financial statements.
    (7) In addition to the financial statements required by paragraphs 
(a)(2), (3) and (4) of this section, registrants in the development 
stage shall provide the cumulative financial statements (condensed to 
the same degree as allowed in this paragraph) and disclosures required 
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7, ``Accounting and 
Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises'' to the date of the latest 
balance sheet presented.
    (b) Other instructions as to content. The following additional 
instructions shall be applicable for purposes of preparing interim 
financial statements:
    (1) Summarized income statement information shall be given 
separately as to each subsidiary not consolidated or 50 percent or less 
owned persons or as to each group of such subsidiaries or fifty percent 
or less owned persons for which separate individual or group statements 
would otherwise be required for annual periods. Such summarized 
information, however, need not be furnished for any such unconsolidated 
subsidiary or person which would not be required pursuant to Rule

[[Page 275]]

13a-13 or 15d-13 to file quarterly financial information with the 
Commission if it were a registrant.
    (2) If appropriate, the income statement shall show earnings per 
share and dividends declared per share applicable to common stock. The 
basis of the earnings per share computation shall be stated together 
with the number of shares used in the computation. In addition, see Item 
601(b)(11) of Regulation S-K, (17 CFR 229.601(b)(11)).
    (3) If, during the most recent interim period presented, the 
registrant or any of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a 
business combination treated for accounting purposes as a pooling of 
interests, the interim financial statements for both the current year 
and the preceding year shall reflect the combined results of the pooled 
businesses. Supplemental disclosure of the separate results of the 
combined entities for periods prior to the combination shall be given, 
with appropriate explanations.
    (4) Where a material business combination accounted for as a 
purchase has occurred during the current fiscal year, pro forma 
disclosure shall be made of the results of operations for the current 
year up to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided 
(and for the corresponding period in the preceding year) as though the 
companies had combined at the beginning of the period being reported on. 
This pro forma information should as a minimum show revenue, income 
before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting 
changes, including such income on a per share basis, and net income and 
net income per share.
    (5) Where the registrant has disposed of any significant segment of 
its business (as defined in paragraph 13 of Accounting Principles Board 
Opinion No. 30) during any of the periods covered by the interim 
financial statements, the effect thereof on revenues and net income--
total and per share--for all periods shall be disclosed.
    (6) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by 
existing standards for accounting changes, the registrant shall state 
the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making 
it. In addition, for filings on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB, a letter from 
the registrant's independent accountant shall be filed as an exhibit (in 
accordance with the provisions of Item 601 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 
229.601) in the first Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB subsequent to the date 
of an accounting change indicating whether or not the change is to an 
alternative principle which in his judgment is preferable under the 
circumstances; except that no letter from the accountant need be filed 
when the change is made in response to a standard adopted by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board which requires such change.
    (7) Any material retroactive prior period adjustment made during any 
period convered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, 
together with the effect thereof upon net income--total and per share--
of any prior period included and upon the balance of retained earnings. 
If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted 
retroactively by such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of 
such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be 
made.
    (8) Any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall 
reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, 
necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods 
presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Such 
adjustments shall include, for example, appropriate estimated provisions 
for bonus and profit sharing arrangements normally determined or settled 
at year-end. If all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, a 
statement to that effect shall be made; otherwise, there shall be 
furnished information describing in appropriate detail the nature and 
amount of any adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments 
entering into the determination of the results shown.
    (c) Periods to be covered. The periods for which interim financial 
statements are to be provided in registration statements are prescribed 
elsewhere in this Regulation (see Secs. 210.3-01 and 3-02). For filings 
on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB, financial statements shall be provided as 
set forth below:

[[Page 276]]

    (1) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal 
quarter and a balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal year 
shall be provided. The balance sheet as of the end of the preceding 
fiscal year may be condensed to the same degree as the interim balance 
sheet provided. An interim balance sheet as of the end of the 
corresponding fiscal quarter of the preceding fiscal year need not be 
provided unless necessary for an understanding of the impact of seasonal 
fluctuations on the registrant's financial condition.
    (2) Interim statements of income shall be provided for the most 
recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding 
fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the 
corresponding periods of the preceding fiscal year. Such statements may 
also be presented for the cumulative twelve month period ended during 
the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding 
period.
    (3) Interim statements of cash flows shall be provided for the 
period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the 
most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding period of the 
preceding fiscal year. Such statements may also be presented for the 
cumulative twelve month period ended during the most recent fiscal 
quarter and for the corresponding preceding period.
    (4) Registrants engaged in seasonal production and sale of a single-
crop agricultural commodity may provide interim statements of income and 
cash flows for the twelve month period ended during the most recent 
fiscal quarter and for the corresponding preceding period in lieu of the 
year-to-date statements specified in (2) and (3) above.
    (d) Review by independent public accountant. The interim financial 
information included in filings with the Commission need not be reviewed 
by an independent public accountant prior to filing. If, however, a 
review of the data is made in accordance with established professional 
standards and procedures for such a review, the registrant may state 
that the independent accountant has performed such a review. If such a 
statement is made, the report of the independent accountant on such 
review shall accompany the interim financial information.
    (e) Filing of other interim financial information in certain cases. 
The Commission may, upon the informal written request of the registrant, 
and where consistent with the protection of investors, permit the 
omission of any of the interim financial information herein required or

<R05>
Sec. 210.11-01  Presentation requirements.

    (a) Pro forma financial information shall be furnished when any of 
the following conditions exist:
    (1) During the most recent fiscal year or subsequent interim period 
for which a balance sheet is required by Sec. 210.3-01, a significant 
business combination accounted for as a purchase has occurred (for 
purposes of these rules, the term ``purchase'' encompasses the purchase 
of an interest in a business accounted for by the equity method);

[[Page 277]]

    (2) After the date of the most recent balance sheet filed pursuant 
to Sec. 210.3-01, consummation of a significant business combination to 
be accounted for by either the purchase method or pooling-of-interests 
method of accounting has occurred or is probable;
    (3) Securities being registered by the registrant are to be offered 
to the security holders of a significant business to be acquired or the 
proceeds from the offered securities will be applied directly or 
indirectly to the purchase of a specific significant business;
    (4) The disposition of a significant portion of a business either by 
sale, abandonment or distribution to shareholders by means of a spin-
off, split-up or split-off has occurred or is probable and such 
disposition is not fully reflected in the financial statements of the 
registrant included in the filing;
    (5) During the most recent fiscal year or subsequent interim period 
for which a balance sheet is required by Sec. 210.3-01, the registrant 
has acquired one or more real estate operations or properties which in 
the aggregate are significant, or since the date of the most recent 
balance sheet filed pursuant to that section the registrant has acquired 
or proposes to acquire one or more operations or properties which in the 
aggregate are significant.
    (6) Pro forma financial information required by Sec. 229.914 is 
required to be provided in connection with a roll-up transaction as 
defined in Sec. 229.901(c).
    (7) The registrant previously was a part of another entity and such 
presentation is necessary to reflect operations and financial position 
of the registrant as an autonomous entity; or
    (8) Consummation of other events or transactions has occurred or is 
probable for which disclosure of pro forma financial information would 
be material to investors.
    (b) A business combination or disposition of a business shall be 
considered significant if:
    (1) A comparison of the most recent annual financial statements of 
the business acquired or to be acquired and the registrant's most recent 
annual consolidated financial statements filed at or prior to the date 
of acquisition indicates that the business would be a significant 
subsidiary pursuant to the conditions specified in Sec. 210.1-02(w), 
substituting 20 percent for 10 percent each place it appears therein; or
    (2) The business to be disposed of meets the conditions of a 
significant subsidiary in Sec. 210.1-02(w).
    (c) The pro forma effects of a business combination need not be 
presented pursuant to this section if separate financial statements of 
the acquired business are not included in the filing.
    (d) For purposes of this rule, the term business should be evaluated 
in light of the facts and circumstances involved and whether there is 
sufficient continuity of the acquired entity's operations prior to and 
after the transactions so that disclosure of prior financial information 
is material to an understanding of future operations. A presumption 
exists that a separate entity, a subsidiary, or a division is a 
business. However, a lesser component of an entity may also constitute a 
business. Among the facts and circumstances which should be considered 
in evaluating whether an acquisition of a lesser component of an entity 
constitutes a business are the following:
    (1) Whether the nature of the revenue-producing activity of the 
component will remain generally the same as before the transaction; or
    (2) Whether any of the following attributes remain with the 
component after the transaction:
    (i) Physical facilities,
    (ii) Employee base,
    (iii) Market distribution system,
    (iv) Sales force,
    (v) Customer base,
    (vi) Operating rights,
    (vii) Production techniques, or
    (viii) Trade names.
    (e) This rule does not apply to transactions between a parent 
company and its totally held subsidiary.

<R05>
Sec. 210.11-02  Preparation requirements.

    (a) Objective. Pro forma financial information should provide 
investors with information about the continuing impact of a particular 
transaction by showing how it might have affected historical financial 
statements if the transaction had been consummated at

[[Page 278]]

an earlier time. Such statements should assist investors in analyzing 
the future prospects of the registrant because they illustrate the 
possible scope of the change in the registrant's historical financial 
position and results of operations caused by the transaction.
    (b) Form and content. (1) Pro forma financial information shall 
consist of a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma condensed 
statements of income, and accompanying explanatory notes. In certain 
circumstances (i.e., where a limited number of pro forma adjustments are 
required and those adjustments are easily understood), a narrative 
description of the pro forma effects of the transaction may be furnished 
in lieu of the statements described herein.
    (2) The pro forma financial information shall be accompanied by an 
introductory paragraph which briefly sets forth a description of (i) the 
transaction, (ii) the entities involved, and (iii) the periods for which 
the pro forma information is presented. In addition, an explanation of 
what the pro forma presentation shows shall be set forth.
    (3) The pro forma condensed financial information need only include 
major captions (i.e., the numbered captions) prescribed by the 
applicable sections of this Regulation. Where any major balance sheet 
caption is less than 10 percent of total assets, the caption may be 
combined with others. When any major income statement caption is less 
than 15 percent of average net income of the registrant for the most 
recent three fiscal years, the caption may be combined with others. In 
calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded unless 
losses were incurred in each of the most recent three years, in which 
case the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. 
Notwithstanding these tests, de minimis amounts need not be shown 
separately.
    (4) Pro forma statements shall ordinarily be in columnar form 
showing condensed historical statements, pro forma adjustments, and the 
pro forma results.
    (5) The pro forma condensed income statement shall disclose income 
(loss) from continuing operations before nonrecurring charges or credits 
directly attributable to the transaction. Material nonrecurring charges 
or credits and related tax effects which result directly from the 
transaction and which will be included in the income of the registrant 
within the 12 months succeeding the transaction shall be disclosed 
separately. It should be clearly indicated that such charges or credits 
were not considered in the pro forma condensed income statement. If the 
transaction for which pro forma financial information is presented 
relates to the disposition of a business, the pro forma results should 
give effect to the disposition and be presented under an appropriate 
caption.
    (6) Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed income 
statement shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at 
the beginning of the fiscal year presented and shall include adjustments 
which give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the 
transaction, (ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the 
registrant, and (iii) factually supportable. Pro forma adjustments 
related to the pro forma condensed balance sheet shall be computed 
assuming the transaction was consummated at the end of the most recent 
period for which a balance sheet is required by Sec. 210.3-01 and shall 
include adjustments which give effect to events that are directly 
attributable to the transaction and factually supportable regardless of 
whether they have a continuing impact or are nonrecurring. All 
adjustments should be referenced to notes which clearly explain the 
assumptions involved.
    (7) Historical primary and fully diluted per share data based on 
continuing operations (or net income if the registrant does not report 
either discontinued operations, extraordinary items, or the cumulative 
effects of accounting changes) for the registrant, and primary and fully 
diluted pro forma per share data based on continuing operations before 
nonrecurring charges or credits directly attributable to the transaction 
shall be presented on the face of the pro forma condensed income 
statement together with the number of shares used to compute such

[[Page 279]]

per share data. For transactions involving the issuance of securities, 
the number of shares used in the calculation of the pro forma per share 
data should be based on the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the period adjusted to give effect to shares 
subsequently issued or assumed to be issued had the particular 
transaction or event taken place at the beginning of the period 
presented. If a convertible security is being issued in the transaction, 
consideration should be given to the possible dilution of the pro forma 
per share data.
    (8) If the transaction is structured in such a manner that 
significantly different results may occur, additional pro forma 
presentations shall be made which give effect to the range of possible 
results.

    Instructions: 1. The historical statement of income used in the pro 
forma financial information shall not report operations of a segment 
that has been discontinued, extraordinary items, or the cumulative 
effects of accounting changes. If the historical statement of income 
includes such items, only the portion of the income statement through 
``income from continuing operations'' (or the appropriate modification 
thereof) should be used in preparing pro forma results.
    2. For a purchase transaction, pro forma adjustments for the income 
statement shall include amortization of goodwill, depreciation and other 
adjustments based on the allocated purchase price of net assets 
acquired. In some transactions, such as in financial institution 
acquisitions, the purchase adjustments may include significant discounts 
of the historical cost of the acquired assets to their fair value at the 
acquisition date. When such adjustments will result in a significant 
effect on earnings (losses) in periods immediately subsequent to the 
acquisition which will be progressively eliminated over a relatively 
short period, the effect of the purchase adjustments on reported results 
of operations for each of the next five years should be disclosed in a 
note.
    3. For a disposition transaction, the pro forma financial 
information shall begin with the historical financial statements of the 
existing entity and show the deletion of the business to be divested 
along with the pro forma adjustments necessary to arrive at the 
remainder of the existing entity. For example, pro forma adjustments 
would include adjustments of interest expense arising from revised debt 
structures and expenses which will be or have been incurred on behalf of 
the business to be divested such as advertising costs, executive 
salaries and other costs.
    4. For entities which were previously a component of another entity, 
pro forma adjustments should include adjustments similar in nature to 
those referred to in Instruction 3 above. Adjustments may also be 
necessary when charges for corporate overhead, interest, or income taxes 
have been allocated to the entity on a basis other than one deemed 
reasonable by management.
    5. Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of real estate operations 
or properties for the pro forma income statement shall include a 
depreciation charge based on the new accounting basis for the assets, 
interest financing on any additional or refinanced debt, and other 
appropriate adjustments that can be factually supported. See also 
Instruction 4 above.
    6. When consummation of more than one transaction has occurred or is 
probable during a fiscal year, the pro forma financial information may 
be presented on a combined basis; however, in some circumstances (e.g., 
depending upon the combination of probable and consummated transactions, 
and the nature of the filing) it may be more useful to present the pro 
forma financial information on a disaggregated basis even though some or 
all of the transactions would not meet the tests of significance 
individually. For combined presentations, a note should explain the 
various transactions and disclose the maximum variances in the pro forma 
financial information which would occur for any of the possible 
combinations. If the pro forma financial information is presented in a 
proxy or information statement for purposes of obtaining shareholder 
approval of one of the transactions, the effects of that transaction 
must be clearly set forth.
    7. Tax effects, if any, of pro forma adjustments normally should be 
calculated at the statutory rate in effect during the periods for which 
pro forma condensed income statements are presented and should be 
reflected as a separate pro forma adjustment.

    (c) Periods to be presented. (1) A pro forma condensed balance sheet 
as of the end of the most recent period for which a consolidated balance 
sheet of the registrant is required by Sec. 210.3-01 shall be filed 
unless the transaction is already reflected in such balance sheet.
    (2)(i) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be filed for 
only the most recent fiscal year and for the period from the most recent 
fiscal year end to the most recent interim date for which a balance 
sheet is required. A pro forma condensed statement of income may be 
filed for the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year. 
A pro forma condensed statement of income shall not

[[Page 280]]

be filed when the historical income statement reflects the transaction 
for the entire period.
    (ii) For a business combination accounted for as a pooling of 
interests, the pro forma income statements (which are in effect a 
restatement of the historical income statements as if the combination 
had been consummated) shall be filed for all periods for which 
historical income statements of the registrant are required.
    (3) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be presented 
using the registrant's fiscal year end. If the most recent fiscal year 
end of any other entity involved in the transaction differs from the 
registrant's most recent fiscal year end by more than 93 days, the other 
entity's income statement shall be brought up to within 93 days of the 
registrant's most recent fiscal year end, if practicable. This updating 
could be accomplished by adding subsequent interim period results to the 
most recent fiscal year-end information and deducting the comparable 
preceding year interim period results. Disclosure shall be made of the 
periods combined and of the sales or revenues and income for any periods 
which were excluded from or included more than once in the condensed pro 
forma income statements (e.g., an interim period that is included both 
as part of the fiscal year and the subsequent interim period). For 
investment companies subject to Secs. 210.6-01 to 210.6-10, the periods 
covered by the pro forma statements must be the same.
    (4) Whenever unusual events enter into the determination of the 
results shown for the most recently completed fiscal year, the effect of 
such unusual events should be disclosed and consideration should be 
given to presenting a pro forma condensed income statement for the most 
recent twelve-month period in addition to those required in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) above if the most recent twelve-month period is more 
representative of normal operations.

Sec. 210.11-03  Presentation of financial forecast.

    (a) A financial forecast may be filed in lieu of the pro forma 
condensed statements of income required by Sec. 210.11-02(b)(1).
    (1) The financial forecast shall cover a period of at least 12 
months from the latest of (i) the most recent balance sheet included in 
the filing or (ii) the consummation date or estimated consummation date 
of the transaction.
    (2) The forecasted statement of income shall be presented in the 
same degree of detail as the pro forma condensed statement of income 
required by Sec. 210.11-02(b)(3).
    (3) Assumptions particularly relevant to the transaction and effects 
thereof should be clearly set forth.
    (4) Historical condensed financial information of the registrant and 
the business acquired or to be acquired, if any, shall be presented for 
at least a recent 12 month period in parallel columns with the financial 
forecast.
    (b) Such financial forecast shall be presented in accordance with 
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants.
    (c) Forecasted earnings per share data shall be substituted for pro 
forma per share data.
    (d) This rule does not permit the filing of a financial forecast in 
lieu of pro forma information required by generally accepted accounting 
principles.

  not previously been reported by name to the shareholders of the person
  for which the schedule is filed or to any exchange, or set forth in
  any registration statement, application, or annual report or otherwise
  made available to the public.
\2\ List separately: (a) Common shares; (b) preferred shares; (c) bonds
  and notes; (d) time deposits; and (e) put and call options purchased.
  Within each of these subdivisions, classify in an appropriate manner
  according to type of business; e.g., aerospace, banking, chemicals,
  machinery and machine tools, petroleum, utilities, etc.; or according
  to type of instrument; e.g., commercial paper, bankers' acceptances,
  certificates of deposit. Short-term debt instruments of the same
  issuer may be aggregated, in which case the range of interest rates
  and maturity dates shall be indicated. For issuers of periodic payment
  plan certificates and unit investment trusts, list separately: (i)
  Trust shares in trusts created or serviced by the depositor or sponsor
  of this trust; (ii) trust shares in other trusts; and (iii) securities
  of other investment companies. Restricted securities shall not be
  combined with unrestricted securities of the same issuer. Repurchase
  agreements shall be stated separately showing for each the name of the
  party or parties to the agreement, the date of the agreement, the
  total amount to be received upon repurchase, the repurchase date and

  the correlative amounts shown on the related balance sheet.

[[Page 282]]

 
\5\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities which is
  non-income producing. Evidences of indebtedness and preferred shares
  may be deemed to be income producing if, on the respective last
  interest payment date or date for the declaration of dividends prior
  to the date of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial
  payment of interest or a declaration of only a partial amount of the
  dividends payable; in such case, however, each such issue shall be
  indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the effect
  that, on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was
  paid or partial dividends declared. If, on such respective last
  interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no cash or in kind
  dividends declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income
  producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to be income producing
  unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance
  sheet, there was at least one dividend paid upon such common shares.
\6\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted
  securities. State the following in a footnote: (a) As to each such
  issue: (1) Acquisition date, (2) carrying value per unit of investment
  at date of related balance sheet, e.g., a percentage of current market
  value of unrestricted securities of the same issuer, etc., and (3) the
  cost of such securities; (b) as to each issue acquired during the year
  preceding the date of the related balance sheet, the carrying value
  per unit of investment of unrestricted securities of the same issuer
  at: (1) The day the purchase price was agreed to; and (2) the day on
  which an enforceable right to acquire such securities was obtained;
  and (c) the aggregate value of all restricted securities and the
  percentage which the aggregate value bears to net assets.
\7\ Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities held in
  connection with open put or call option contracts or loans for short
  sales.
\8\ State in a footnote the following amounts based on cost for Federal
  income tax purposes: (a) Aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for
  all securities in which there is an excess of value over tax cost, (b)
  the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in
  which there is an excess of tax cost over value, (c) the net
  unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and (d) the aggregate cost of
  securities for Federal income tax purposes.

\1\ (a) The required information is to be given as to all securities held as of the close of the period of
  report. Each issue shall be listed separately.
(b) Indicate by an appropriate symbol those securities which are non-income-producing securities. Evidences of
  indebtedness and preferred shares may be deemed to be income-producing if, on the respective last interest
  payment date or dates for the declaration of dividends prior to the date of the related balance sheet, there
  was only a partial payment of interest or a declaration of only a partial amount of the dividends payable; in
  such case, however, each such issue shall be indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the
  effect that, on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was paid or partial dividends
  declared. If, on such respective last interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no dividends
  declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income-producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to be income-
  producing unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance sheet, there was at least one
  dividend paid upon such common shares. List separately (1) bonds; (2) preferred shares; (3) common shares.
  Within each of these subdivisions classify according to type of business, insofar as practicable: e.g.,
  investment companies, railroads, utilities, banks, insurance companies, or industrials. Give totals for each
  group, subdivision, and class.
\2\ Indicate any securities subject to option at the end of the most recent period and state in a note the
  amount subject to option, the option prices, and the dates within which such options may be exercised.
\3\ Columns C and D shall be totaled. The totals of columns C and D should agree with the correlative amounts
  required to be shown by the related balance sheet captions. State in a footnote to column C the aggregate cost
  for Federal income tax purposes.
\4\ If any investments have been written down or reserved against by such companies pursuant to Sec.  210.6-
  21(f), indicate each such item by means of an appropriate symbol and explain in a footnote.
\5\ Where value is determined on any other basis than closing prices reported on any national securities
  exchange, explain such other basis in a footnote.

  amount subject to option, the option prices, and the dates within which such options may be exercised.
\3\ If the cost in column C represents other than cash expenditure, explain.
\4\ (a) Columns C, D and E shall be totaled. The totals of columns C and D should agree with correlative amounts
  required to be shown by the related balance sheet captions. State in a footnote the aggregate cost for Federal
  income tax purposes.
(b) If any investments have been written down or reserved against by such companies pursuant to Sec.  210.6-
  21(f), indicate each such item by means of an appropriate symbol and explain in a footnote.
\5\ State the basis of determining the amounts shown in column D.

\6\ Show in column E(1) as to each issue held at close of period, the dividends or interest included in caption
  1 of the profit and loss or income statement. In addition, show as the final item in column E(1) the aggregate
  dividends and interest included in the profit and loss or income statement in respect of investments in
  affiliates not held at the close of the period. The total of this column should agree with the amounts shown
  under such caption. Include in column E(2) all other dividends and interest. Explain briefly in an appropriate
  footnote the treatment accorded each item. Identify by an appropriate symbol all non-cash dividends and
  explain the circumstances in a footnote. See Secs.  210.6-22(b) and 210.6-23(a).

                        Subpart A--Regulation S-B


<R05>
Sec. 228.10  (Item 10) General.

    (a) Application of Regulation S-B. Regulation S-B is the source of 
disclosure requirements for ``small business issuer'' filings under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') and the

[[Page 295]]

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'').
    (1) Definition of small business issuer. A small business issuer is 
defined as a company that meets all of the following criteria:
    (i) has revenues of less than $25,000,000;
    (ii) is a U.S. or Canadian issuer;
    (iii) is not an investment company; and
    (iv) if a majority owned subsidiary, the parent corporation is also 
a small business issuer.
    Provided however, that an entity is not a small business issuer if 
it has a public float (the aggregate market value of the issuer's 
outstanding voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates) 
of $25,000,000 or more.
    Note: The public float of a reporting company shall be computed by 
use of the price at which the stock was last sold, or the average of the 
bid and asked prices of such stock, on a date within 60 days prior to 
the end of its most recent fiscal year. The public float of a company 
filing an initial registration statement under the Exchange Act shall be 
determined as of a date within 60 days of the date the registration 
statement is filed. In the case of an initial public offering of 
securities, public float shall be computed on the basis of the number of 
shares outstanding prior to the offering and the estimated public 
offering price of the securities.

    (2) Entering and Exiting the Small Business Disclosure System. (i) A 
company that meets the definition of small business issuer may use Form 
SB-2 for registration of its securities under the Securities Act; Form 
10-SB for registration of its securities under the Exchange Act; and 
Forms 10-KSB and 10-QSB for its annual and quarterly reports.
    (ii) For a non-reporting company entering the disclosure system for 
the first time either by filing a registration statement under the 
Securities Act on Form SB-2 or a registration statement under the 
Exchange Act on Form 10-SB, the determination as to whether a company is 
a small business issuer is made with reference to its revenues during 
its last fiscal year and public float as of a date within 60 days of the 
date the registration statement is filed. See Note to paragraph (a) of 
this Item.
    (iii) Once a small business issuer becomes a reporting company it 
will remain a small business issuer until it exceeds the revenue limit 
or the public float limit at the end of two consecutive years. For 
example, if a company exceeds the revenue limit for two consecutive 
years, it will no longer be considered a small business. However, if it 
exceeds the revenue limit in one year and the next year exceeds the 
public float limit, but not the revenue limit, it will still be 
considered a small business. See Note to paragraph (a) of this Item.
    (iv) A reporting company that is not a small business company must 
meet the definition of a small business issuer at the end of two 
consecutive fiscal years before it will be considered a small business 
issuer for purposes of using Form SB-2, Form 10-SB, Form 10-KSB and Form 
10-QSB. See Note to paragraph (a) of this Item.
    (v) The determination as to the reporting category (small business 
issuer or other issuer) made for a non-reporting company at the time it 
enters the disclosure system governs all reports relating to the 
remainder of the fiscal year. The determination made for a reporting 
company at the end of its fiscal year governs all reports relating to 
the next fiscal year. An issuer may not change from one category to 
another with respect to its reports under the Exchange Act for a single 
fiscal year. A company may, however, choose not to use a Form SB-2 for a 
registration under the Securities Act.
    (b) Definitions of terms.
    (1) Common Equity--means the small business issuer's common stock. 
If the small business issuer is a limited partnership, the term refers 
to the equity interests in the partnership.
    (2) Public market--no public market shall be deemed to exist unless, 
within the past 60 business days, both bid and asked quotations at fixed 
prices (excluding ``bid wanted'' or ``offer wanted'' quotations) have 
appeared regularly in any established quotation system on at least half 
of such business days. Transactions arranged without the participation 
of a broker or dealer functioning as such are not indicative of a 
``public market.''

[[Page 296]]

    (3) Reporting company--means a company that is obligated to file 
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under 
section 15(d) or 13(a) of the Exchange Act.
    (4) Small business issuer--refers to the issuer and all of its 
consolidated subsidiaries.
    (c) Preparing the disclosure document. (1) The purpose of a 
disclosure document is to inform investors. Hence, information should be 
presented in a clear, concise and understandable fashion. Avoid 
unnecessary details, repetition or the use of technical language. The 
responses to the items of this Regulation should be brief and to the 
point.
    (2) Small business issuers should consult the General Rules and 
Regulations under the Securities Act and Exchange Act for requirements 
concerning the preparation and filing of documents. Small business 
issuers should be aware that there are special rules concerning such 
matters as the kind and size of paper that is allowed and how filings 
should be bound. These special rules are located in Regulation C of the 
Securities Act (17 CFR 230.400 et seq.) and in Regulation 12B of the 
Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.12b-1 et seq.).
    (d) Commission policy on projections. The Commission encourages the 
use of management's projections of future economic performance that have 
a reasonable basis and are presented in an appropriate format. The 
guidelines below set forth the Commission's views on important factors 
to be considered in preparing and disclosing such projections. (See also 
17 CFR 230.175 and 240.3b-6).
    (1) Basis for projections. Management has the option to present in 
Commission filings its good faith assessment of a small business 
issuer's future performance. Management, however, must have a reasonable 
basis for such an assessment. An outside review of management's 
projections may furnish additional support in this regard. If management 
decides to include a report of such a review in a Commission filing, it 
should also disclose the qualifications of the reviewer, the extent of 
the review, the relationship between the reviewer and the registrant, 
and other material factors concerning the process by which any outside 
review was sought or obtained. Moreover, in the case of a registration 
statement under the Securities Act, the reviewer would be deemed an 
expert and an appropriate consent must be filed with the registration 
statement.
    (2) Format for projections. Traditionally, projections have been 
given for three financial items generally considered to be of primary 
importance to investors (revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) 
per share), projection information need not necessarily be limited to 
these three items. However, management should take care to assure that 
the choice of items projected is not susceptible to misleading 
inferences through selective projection of only favorable items. It 
generally would be misleading to present sales or revenue projections 
without one of the foregoing measures of income. The period that 
appropriately may be covered by a projection depends to a large extent 
on the particular circumstances of the company involved. For certain 
companies in certain industries, a projection covering a two or three 
year period may be entirely reasonable. Other companies may not have a 
reasonable basis for projections beyond the current year.
    (3) Investor understanding. Disclosures accompanying the projections 
should facilitate investor understanding of the basis for and 
limitations of projections. The Commission believes that investor 
understanding would be enhanced by disclosure of the assumptions which 
in management's opinion are most significant to the projections or are 
the key factors upon which the financial results of the enterprise 
depend and encourages disclosure of assumptions in a manner that will 
provide a frame-work for analysis of the projection. Management also 
should consider whether disclosure of the accuracy or inaccuracy of 
previous projections would provide investors with important insights 
into the limitations of projections.
    (e) Commission policy on security ratings. In view of the importance 
of security ratings (``ratings'') to investors and the marketplace, the 
Commission permits small business issuers to disclose ratings assigned 
by rating organizations to classes of debt securities,

[[Page 297]]

convertible debt securities and preferred stock in registration 
statements and periodic reports. In addition, the Commission permits, 
disclosure of ratings assigned by any nationally recognized statistical 
rating organizations (``NRSROs'') in certain communications deemed not 
to be a prospectus (``tombstone advertisements''). Below are the 
Commission's views on important matters to be considered in disclosing 
security ratings.
    (1)(i) If a small business issuer includes in a filing any rating(s) 
assigned to a class of securities, it should consider including any 
other rating assigned by a different NRSRO that is materially different. 
A statement that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell 
or hold securities and that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal 
at any time by the assigning rating organization should also be 
included.
    (ii)(A) If the rating is included in a filing under the Securities 
Act, the written consent of any rating organization that is not a NRSRO 
whose rating is included should be filed. The consent of any NRSRO is 
not required. (See Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.436(g) 
of this chapter.)
    (B) If a change in a rating already included is available before 
effectiveness of the registration statement, the small business issuer 
should consider including such rating change in the prospectus. If the 
rating change is material, consideration should be given to 
recirculating the preliminary prospectus.
    (C) If a materially different additional NRSRO rating or a material 
change in a rating already included becomes available during any period 
in which offers or sales are being made, the small business issuer 
should consider disclosing this information in a sticker to the 
prospectus.
    (iii) If there is a material change in the rating(s) assigned by any 
NRSRO(s) to any outstanding class(es) of securities of a reporting 
company, the registrant should consider filing a report on Form 8-K 
(Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) or other appropriate report under the 
Exchange Act disclosing such rating change.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Incorporation by Reference. Where rules, regulations, or 
instructions to forms of the Commission permit incorporation by 
reference, a document may be so incorporated by reference to the 
specific document and to the prior filing or submission in which such 
document was physically filed or submitted. Except where a registrant or 
issuer is expressly required to incorporate a document or documents by 
reference, reference may not be made to any document which incorporates 
another document by reference if the pertinent portion of the document 
containing the information or financial statements to be incorporated by 
reference includes an incorporation by reference to another document. No 
document on file with the Commission for more than five years may be 
incorporated by reference except:
    (1) Documents contained in registration statements, which may be 
incorporated by reference as long as the registrant has a reporting 
requirement with the Commission; or
    (2) Documents that the registrant specifically identifies by 
physical location by SEC file number reference, provided such materials 
have not been disposed of by the Commission pursuant to its Records 
Control Schedule (17 CFR 200.80f).
    (g) Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. The 
safe harbor provision included in paragraph (d) of Item 305 of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.305(d) of this chapter) shall apply to 
information required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.305 of this 
chapter) that is voluntarily provided by or on behalf of a small 
business issuer as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
    Note to paragraph (g): Such small business issuers are not required 
to provide the information required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K.

    (i) If the principal market for the small business issuer's common 
equity is an exchange, give the high and low sales prices for each 
quarter within the last two fiscal years and any subsequent interim 
period for which financial statements are required by Item 310(b).
    (ii) If the principal market is not an exchange, give the range of 
high and low bid information for the small business issuer's common 
equity for each quarter within the last two fiscal years and any 
subsequent interim period for which financial statements are required by 
Item 310(b). Show the source of the high and low bid information. If 
over-the-counter market quotations are provided, also state that the 
quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-
down or commission and may not represent actual transactions.

[[Page 301]]

    (2) If the information called for by paragraph (a) of this Item is 
being presented in a registration statement relating to a class of 
common equity for which at the time of filing there is no established 
public trading market, indicate the amount(s) of common equity:
    (i) that is subject to outstanding options or warrants to purchase, 
or securities convertible into, common equity of the registrant;
    (ii) that could be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities 
Act or that the registrant has agreed to register under the Securities 
Act for sale by security holders; or
    (iii) that is being or has been proposed to be, publicly offered by 
the registrant unless such common equity is being offered pursuant to an 
employee benefit plan (or dividend reinvestment plan), the offering of 
which could have a material effect on the market price of the 
registrant's common equity.
    (b) Holders. Give the approximate number of holders of record of 
each class of common equity.
    (c) Dividends. (1) Discuss any cash dividends declared on each class 
of common equity for the last two fiscal years and in any subsequent 
period for which financial information is required.
    (2) Describe any restrictions that limit the ability to pay 
dividends on common equity or that are likely to do so in the future.

Instruction: Canadian issuers should, in addition to the information 
called for by this Item, provide the information in Item 201(a)(1)(iv) 
of Regulation S-K and Instruction 4 thereto.

Sec. 228.303  (Item 303) Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.

    Small business issuers that have not had revenues from operations in 
each of the last two fiscal years, or the last fiscal year and any 
interim period in the current fiscal year for which financial statements 
are furnished in the disclosure document, shall provide the information 
in paragraph (a) of this Item. All other issuers shall provide the 
information in paragraph (b) of this Item.
    (a) Plan of Operation. (1) Describe the small business issuer's plan 
of operation for the next twelve months. This description should include 
such matters as:
    (i) a discussion of how long the small business issuer can satisfy 
its cash requirements and whether it will have to raise additional funds 
in the next twelve months;
    (ii) a summary of any product research and development that the 
small business issuer will perform for the term of the plan;

[[Page 302]]

    (iii) any expected purchase or sale of plant and significant 
equipment; and
    (iv) any expected significant changes in the number of employees.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations--(1) Full fiscal years. Discuss the small business 
issuer's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results 
of operations for each of the last two fiscal years. This discussion 
should address the past and future financial condition and results of 
operation of the small business issuer, with particular emphasis on the 
prospects for the future. The discussion should also address those key 
variable and other qualitative and quantitative factors which are 
necessary to an understanding and evaluation of the small business 
issuer. If material, the small business issuer should disclose the 
following:
    (i) Any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are 
reasonably likely to have a material impact on the small business 
issuer's short-term or long-term liquidity;
    (ii) Internal and external sources of liquidity;
    (iii) Any material commitments for capital expenditures and the 
expected sources of funds for such expenditures;
    (iv) Any known trends, events or uncertainties that have had or that 
are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or 
revenues or income from continuing operations;
    (v) Any significant elements of income or loss that do not arise 
from the small business issuer's continuing operations;
    (vi) The causes for any material changes from period to period in 
one or more line items of the small business issuer's financial 
statements; and
    (vii) Any seasonal aspects that had a material effect on the 
financial condition or results of operation.
    (2) Interim Periods. If the small business issuer must include 
interim financial statements in the registration statement or report, 
provide a comparable discussion that will enable the reader to assess 
material changes in financial condition and results of operations since 
the end of the last fiscal year and for the comparable interim period in 
the preceding year.

Instructions to Item 303: 1. The discussion and analysis shall focus 
specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management 
that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily 
indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition.
    2. Small business issuers are encouraged, but not required, to 
supply forward looking information. This is distinguished from presently 
known data which will impact upon future operating results, such as 
known future increases in costs of labor or materials. This latter data 
may be required to be disclosed.


<R05>
Sec. 228.304  (Item 304) Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

    (a)(1) If, during the small business issuer's two most recent fiscal 
years or any later interim period, the principal independent accountant 
or a significant subsidiary's independent accountant on whom the 
principal accountant expressed reliance in its report, resigned (or 
declined to stand for re-election) or was dismissed, then the small 
business issuer shall state:
    (i) Whether the former accountant resigned, declined to stand for 
re-election or was dismissed and the date;
    (ii) Whether the principal accountant's report on the financial 
statements for either of the past two years contained an adverse opinion 
or disclaimer of opinion, or was modified as to uncertainty, audit 
scope, or accounting principles, and also describe the nature of each 
such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion or modification;
    (iii) Whether the decision to change accountants was recommended or 
approved by the board of directors or an audit or similar committee of 
the board of directors; and
    (iv)(A) Whether there were any disagreements with the former 
accountant, whether or not resolved, on any matter of accounting 
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing 
scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the former accountant's 
satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject 
matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report; or

[[Page 303]]

    (B) The following information only if applicable. Indicate whether 
the former accountant advised the small business issuer that:
    (1) internal controls necessary to develop reliable financial 
statements did not exist; or
    (2) information has come to the attention of the former accountant 
which made the accountant unwilling to rely on management's 
representations, or unwilling to be associated with the financial 
statements prepared by management; or
    (3) the scope of the audit should be expanded significantly, or 
information has come to the accountant's attention that the accountant 
has concluded will, or if further investigated might, materially impact 
the fairness or reliability of a previously issued audit report or the 
underlying financial statements, or the financial statements issued or 
to be issued covering the fiscal period(s) subsequent to the date of the 
most recent audited financial statements (including information that 
might preclude the issuance of an unqualified audit report), and the 
issue was not resolved to the accountant's satisfaction prior to its 
resignation or dismissal; and
    (C) The subject matter of each such disagreement or event identified 
in response to paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this Item;
    (D) Whether any committee of the board of directors, or the board of 
directors, discussed the subject matter of the disagreement with the 
former accountant; and
    (E) Whether the small business issuer has authorized the former 
accountant to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor accountant 
concerning the subject matter of each of such disagreements or events 
and, if not, describe the nature of and reason for any limitation.
    (2) If during the period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this Item, 
a new accountant has been engaged as either the principal accountant to 
audit the issuer's financial statements or as the auditor of a 
significant subsidiary and on whom the principal accountant is expected 
to express reliance in its report, identify the new accountant and the 
engagement date. Additionally, if the issuer (or someone on its behalf) 
consulted the new accountant regarding:
    (i) The application of accounting principles to a specific completed 
or contemplated transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be 
rendered on the small business issuer's financial statements and either 
written or oral advice was provided that was an important factor 
considered by the small business issuer in reaching a decision as to the 
accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or
    (ii) Any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or event 
identified in response to paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this Item, then the 
small business issuer shall:
    (A) Identify the issues that were the subjects of those 
consultations;
    (B) Briefly describe the views of the new accountant given to the 
small business issuer and, if written views were received by the small 
business issuer, file them as an exhibit to the report or registration 
statement;
    (C) State whether the former accountant was consulted by the small 
business issuer regarding any such issues, and if so, describe the 
former accountant's views; and
    (D) Request the new accountant to review the disclosure required by 
this Item before it is filed with the Commission and provide the new 
accountant the opportunity to furnish the small business issuer with a 
letter addressed to the Commission containing any new information, 
clarification of the small business issuer's expression of its views, or 
the respects in which it does not agree with the statements made in 
response to this Item. Any such letter shall be filed as an exhibit to 
the report or registration statement containing the disclosure required 
by this Item.
    (3) The small business issuer shall provide the former accountant 
with a copy of the disclosures it is making in response to this Item no 
later than the day that the disclosures are filed with the Commission. 
The small business issuer shall request the former accountant to furnish 
a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the 
statements made by

[[Page 304]]

the issuer and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. 
The small business issuer shall file the letter as an exhibit to the 
report or registration statement containing this disclosure. If the 
letter is unavailable at the time of filing, the small business issuer 
shall request the former accountant to provide the letter so that it can 
be filed with the Commission within ten business days after the filing 
of the report or registration statement. Notwithstanding the ten 
business day period, the letter shall be filed within two business days 
of receipt. The former accountant may provide an interim letter 
highlighting specific areas of concern and indicating that a more 
detailed letter will be forthcoming within the ten business day period 
noted above. The interim letter, if any, shall be filed with the report 
or registration statement or by amendment within two business days of 
receipt.
    (b) If the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
Item exist, the small business issuer shall describe the nature of the 
disagreement or event and the effect on the financial statements if the 
method had been followed which the former accountants apparently would 
have concluded was required (unless that method ceases to be generally 
accepted because of authoritative standards or interpretations issued 
after the disagreement or event):
    (1) In connection with a change in accountants subject to paragraph 
(a) of this Item, there was any disagreement or event as described in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this Item;
    (2) During the fiscal year in which the change in accountants took 
place or during the later fiscal year, there have been any transactions 
or events similar to those involved in such disagreement or event; and
    (3) Such transactions or events were material and were accounted for 
or disclosed in a manner different from that which the former 
accountants apparently would have concluded was required.

Instructions to Item 304: 1. The disclosure called for by paragraph (a) 
of this Item need not be provided if it has been previously reported as 
that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-
2); the disclosure called for by paragraph (a) of this Item must be 
provided, however, notwithstanding prior disclosure, if required 
pursuant to Item 9 of Schedule 14A (Sec. 249.14a-101 et seq.). The 
disclosure called for by paragraph (b) of this Item must be furnished, 
where required, notwithstanding any prior disclosure about accountant 
changes or disagreements.
    2. When disclosure is required by paragraph (a) of this Item in an 
annual report to security holders pursuant to Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 
(Sec. 240.14a-3 or 240.14c-3 of this chapter), or in a proxy or 
information statement filed pursuant to the requirements of Schedule 14A 
(Sec. 240.14a-101 et seq.) or 14C (Sec. 240.14c-101 et seq.), in lieu of 
a letter pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) or (a)(3) of this Item, 
before filing such materials with or furnishing such materials to the 
Commission, the small business issuer shall furnish the disclosure 
required by paragraph (a) of this Item to each accountant who was 
engaged during the period set forth in paragraph (a) of this Item. If 
any such accountant believes that the statements made in response to 
paragraph (a) of this Item are incorrect or incomplete, it may present 
its views in a brief statement, ordinarily expected not to exceed 200 
words, to be included in the annual report or proxy or information 
statement. This statement shall be submitted to the small business 
issuer within ten business days of the date the accountant receives the 
small business issuer's disclosure. Further, unless the written views of 
the newly engaged accountant required to be filed as an exhibit by 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this Item have been previously filed with the 
Commission, the small business issuer shall file a Form 8-K (17 CFR 
249.308 of this chapter) along with the annual report or proxy or 
information statement for the purpose of filing the written views as 
exhibits.
    3. The information required by this Item need not be provided for a 
company being acquired by the small business issuer if such acquiree has 
not been subject to the filing requirements of either section 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or, because of section 12(i) of the Exchange 
Act, has not furnished an annual report to security holders pursuant to 
Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 (Sec. 240.14a-3 or 240.14c-3 of this chapter) 
for its latest fiscal year.
    4. In determining whether any disagreement or reportable event has 
occurred, an oral communication from the engagement partner or another 
person responsible for rendering the accounting firm's opinion (or their 
designee) will generally suffice as the accountant advising the small 
business issuer of a reportable event or as a statement of a 
disagreement at the ``decision-making level'' within the accounting firm 
and require disclosure under this Item.

<R05>
Sec. 228.310  (Item 310) Financial Statements.

    Notes: 1. Financial statements of a small business issuer, its 
predecessors or any businesses to which the small business issuer is a 
successor shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States.
    2. Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.1 through 210.12) Form and Content of 
and Requirements for Financial Statements shall not apply to the 
preparation of such financial statements, except that the report and 
qualifications of the independent accountant shall comply with the 
requirements of Article 2 of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.2), Articles 3-
19 and 3-20 (17 CFR 210.3-19 and 210.3-20) shall apply to financial 
statements of foreign private issuers, the description of accounting 
policies shall comply with Article 4-08(n) of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 
210.4-08(n)), and small business issuers engaged in oil and gas 
producing activities shall follow the financial accounting and reporting 
standards specified in Article 4-10 of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.4-10) 
with respect to such activities. To the extent that Article 11-01 [17 
CFR 210.11-01] (Pro Forma Presentation Requirements) offers enhanced 
guidelines for the preparation, presentation and disclosure of pro forma 
financial information, small business issuers may wish to consider these 
items. Financial statements of foreign private issuers shall be prepared 
and presented in accordance with the requirements of Item 18 of Form 20-
F except that Item 17 may be followed for financial statements included 
in filings other than registration statements for offerings of 
securities unless the only securities being offered are: (a) upon the 
exercise of outstanding rights granted by the issuer of the securities 
to be offered, if such rights are granted by the issuer of the 
securities to be offered, if such rights are granted on a pro rata basis 
to all existing securities holders of the class of securities to which 
the rights attach and there is no standby underwriting in the United 
States or similar arrangement; or (b) pursuant to a dividend or interest 
reinvestment plan; or (c) upon the conversion of outstanding convertible 
securities or upon the exercise of outstanding transferrable warrants 
issued by the issuer of the securities being offered, or by an affiliate 
of such issuer.
    3. The Commission, where consistent with the protection of 
investors, may permit the omission of one or more of the financial 
statements or the substitution of appropriate statements of comparable 
character. The Commission by informal written notice may require the 
filing of other financial statements where necessary or appropriate.

    (a) Annual Financial Statements. Small business issuers shall file 
an audited balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal year, 
or as of a date within 135 days if the issuers existed for a period less 
than one fiscal year, and audited statements of income, cash flows and 
changes in stockholders' equity for each of the two fiscal years 
preceding the date of such audited balance sheet (or such shorter period 
as the registrant has been in business).
    (b) Interim Financial Statements. Interim financial statements, 
which may be unaudited, shall include a balance sheet as of the end of 
the issuer's most recent fiscal quarter and income statements and 
statements of cash flows for the interim period up to the date of such 
balance sheet and the comparable period of the preceding fiscal year.

Instructions to Item 310(b): 1. Where Item 310 is applicable to a Form 
10-QSB (Sec. 249.308b) and the interim period is more than one quarter, 
income statements must also be provided for the most recent interim 
quarter and the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year.
    2. Interim financial statements must include all adjustments which 
in the opinion of management are necessary in order to make the 
financial statements not misleading. An affirmative statement that the 
financial statements have been so adjusted must be included with the 
interim financial statements.

    (1) Condensed Format. Interim financial statements may be condensed 
as follows:
    (i) Balance sheets should include separate captions for each balance 
sheet component presented in the annual financial statements which 
represents 10% or more of total assets. Cash and retained earnings 
should be presented regardless of relative significance to total assets. 
Registrants which present a classified balance sheet in their annual 
financial statements should present totals for current assets and 
current liabilities.
    (ii) Income statements should include net sales or gross revenue, 
each cost and expense category presented in the annual financial 
statements which exceeds 20% of sales or gross revenues, provision for 
income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and 
cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles or practices. 
(Financial institutions should substitute

[[Page 306]]

net interest income for sales for purposes of determining items to be 
disclosed.) Dividends per share should be presented.
    (iii) Cash flow statements should include cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities as well as cash at the beginning and 
end of each period and the increase or decrease in such balance.
    (iv) Additional line items may be presented to facilitate the 
usefulness of the interim financial statements including their 
comparability with annual financial statements.
    (2) Disclosure required and additional instructions as to Content. 
(i) Footnotes. Footnote and other disclosures should be provided as 
needed for fair presentation and to ensure that the financial statements 
are not misleading.
    (ii) Material Subsequent Events and Contingencies. Disclosure must 
be provided of material subsequent events and material contingencies 
notwithstanding disclosure in the annual financial statements.
    (iii) Significant Equity Investees. Sales, gross profit, net income 
(loss) from continuing operations and net income must be disclosed for 
equity investees which constitute 20% or more of a registrant's 
consolidated assets, equity or income from continuing operations.
    (iv) Significant Dispositions and Purchase Business Combinations. If 
a significant disposition or purchase business combination has occurred 
during the most recent interim period and the transaction required the 
filing of a Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter), pro forma data must 
be presented which reflects revenue, income from continuing operations, 
net income and income per share for the current interim period and the 
corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year as though the 
transaction occurred at the beginning of the periods.
    (v) Material Accounting Changes. Disclosure must be provided of the 
date and reasons for any material accounting change. The registrant's 
independent accountant must provide a letter in the first Form 10-QSB 
(Sec. 249.308b of this chapter) filed subsequent to the change 
indicating whether or not the change is to a preferable method. 
Disclosure must be provided of any retroactive change to prior period 
financial statements, including the effect of any such change on income 
and income per share.
    (vi) Development Stage Companies. A registrant in the development 
stage must provide cumulative from inception financial information.
    (c) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired or to be Acquired. 
(1) If a business combination accounted for as a ``purchase'' has 
occurred or is probable, or if a business combination accounted for as a 
``pooling of interest'' is probable, financial statements of the 
business acquired or to be acquired shall be furnished for the periods 
specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this Item.
    (i) The term ``purchase'' encompasses the purchase of an interest in 
a business accounted for by the equity method.
    (ii) Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable 
or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end for which 
audited financial statements of the issuer have been filed shall be 
treated as if they are a single business combination for purposes of 
this section. The required financial statements of related businesses 
may be presented on a combined basis for any periods they are under 
common control or management. A group of businesses are deemed to be 
related if:
    (A) They are under common control or management;
    (B) The acquisition of one business is conditional on the 
acquisition of each other business; or
    (C) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.
    (iii) Annual financial statements required by this paragraph (c) 
shall be audited. The form and content of the financial statements shall 
be in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Item.
    (2) The periods for which financial statements are to be presented 
are determined by comparison of the most recent annual financial 
statements of the business acquired or to be acquired and the small 
business issuer's most recent annual financial statements filed at or 
prior to the date of acquisition to evaluate each of the following 
conditions:

[[Page 307]]

    (i) Compare the small business issuer's investments in and advances 
to the acquiree to the total consolidated assets of the small business 
issuer as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. For a 
proposed business combination to be accounted for as a pooling of 
interests, also compare the number of common shares exchanged or to be 
exchanged by the small business issuer to its total common shares 
outstanding at the date the combination is initiated.
    (ii) Compare the small business issuer's proportionate share of the 
total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the acquiree to the 
total consolidated assets of the small business issuer as of the end of 
the most recently completed fiscal year.
    (iii) Compare the small business issuer's equity in the income from 
continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items and 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles of the acquiree 
to such consolidated income of the small business issuer for the most 
recently completed fiscal year.

Computational note to paragraph (c)(2): For purposes of making the 
prescribed income test the following guidance should be applied: If 
income of the small business issuer and its subsidiaries consolidated 
for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the 
average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average 
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss 
years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.

    (3)(i) If none of the conditions specified in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this Item exceeds 20%, financial statements are not required. If any of 
the conditions exceed 20%, but none exceeds 40%, financial statements 
shall be furnished for the most recent fiscal year and any interim 
periods specified in paragraph (b) of this item. If any of the 
conditions exceed 40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the 
two most recent fiscal years and any interim periods specified in 
paragraph (b) of this item.
    (ii) The separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is 
not required when the small business issuer's most recent audited 
balance sheet filed is for a date after the acquisition was consummated.
    (iii) If the aggregate impact of individually insignificant 
businesses acquired since the date of the most recent audited balance 
sheet filed for the registrant exceeds 50%, financial statements 
covering at least the substantial majority of the businesses acquired 
shall be furnished. Such financial statements shall be for the most 
recent fiscal year and any interim periods specified in paragraph (b) of 
this Item.
    (iv) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 230.419 of this chapter (Regulation C) and proxy statements need 
not include separate financial statements of the acquired or to be 
acquired business if it does not meet or exceed any of the conditions 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this Item at the 50 percent level, and 
either:
    (A) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or
    (B) The effective date of the registration statement, or mailing 
date in the case of a proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after 
consummation of the business combination, and the financial statements 
have not been filed previously by the registrant.
    (v) An issuer that omits from its initial registration statement 
financial statements of a recently consummated business combination 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section shall furnish those 
financial statements and any pro forma information specified by 
paragraph (d) of this Item under cover of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this 
chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.
    (4) If the small business issuer made a significant business 
acquisition subsequent to the latest fiscal year end and filed a report 
on Form 8-K which included audited financial statements of such acquired 
business for the periods required by paragraph (c)(3) of this Item and 
the pro forma financial information required by paragraph (d) of this 
Item, the determination of significance may be made by using pro forma 
amounts for the latest fiscal year in the report on Form 8-K rather than 
by using the historical amounts of the registrant. The tests may not be 
made by ``annualizing'' data.
    (d) Pro Forma Financial Information. (1) Pro forma information 
showing the

[[Page 308]]

effects of the acquisition shall be furnished if financial statements of 
a business acquired or to be acquired are presented.
    (2) Pro forma statements should be condensed, in columnar form 
showing pro forma adjustments and results and should include the 
following:
    (i) If the transaction was consummated during the most recent fiscal 
year or subsequent interim period, pro forma statements of income 
reflecting the combined operations of the entities for the latest fiscal 
year and interim period, if any, or;
    (ii) If consummation of the transaction has occurred or is probable 
after the date of the most recent balance sheet required by paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this Item, a pro forma balance sheet giving effect to the 
combination as of the date of the most recent balance sheet. For a 
purchase, pro forma statements of income reflecting the combined 
operations of the entities for the latest fiscal year and interim 
period, if any, and for a pooling of interests, pro forma statements of 
income for all periods for which income statements of the small business 
issuer are required.
    (e) Real Estate Operations Acquired or to be Acquired. If, during 
the period for which income statements are required, the small business 
issuer has acquired one or more properties which in the aggregate are 
significant, or since the date of the latest balance sheet required by 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Item, has acquired or proposes to acquire 
one or more properties which in the aggregate are significant, the 
following shall be furnished with respect to such properties:
    (1) Audited income statements (not including earnings per unit) for 
the two most recent years, which shall exclude items not comparable to 
the proposed future operations of the property such as mortgage 
interest, leasehold rental, depreciation, corporate expenses and federal 
and state income taxes; Provided, however, That such audited statements 
need be presented for only the most recent fiscal year if:
    (i) the property is not acquired from a related party;
    (ii) material factors considered by the small business issuer in 
assessing the property are described with specificity in the 
registration statement with regard to the property, including source of 
revenue (including, but not limited to, competition in the rental 
market, comparative rents, occupancy rates) and expenses (including but 
not limited to, utilities, ad valorem tax rates, maintenance expenses, 
capital improvements anticipated); and
    (iii) the small business issuer indicates that, after reasonable 
inquiry, it is not aware of any material factors relating to the 
specific property other than those discussed in response to paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this Item that would cause the reported financial 
information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating 
results.
    (2) If the property will be operated by the small business issuer, a 
statement shall be furnished showing the estimated taxable operating 
results of the small business issuer based on the most recent twelve-
month period including such adjustments as can be factually supported. 
If the property will be acquired subject to a net lease, the estimated 
taxable operating results shall be based on the rent to be paid for the 
first year of the lease. In either case, the estimated amount of cash to 
be made available by operations shall be shown. Disclosure must be 
provided of the principal assumptions which have been made in preparing 
the statements of estimated taxable operating results and cash to be 
made available by operations.
    (3) If appropriate under the circumstances, a table should be 
provided which shows, for a limited number of years, the estimated cash 
distribution per unit indicating the portion reportable as taxable 
income and the portion representing a return of capital with an 
explanation of annual variations, if any. If taxable net income per unit 
will be greater than the cash available for distribution per unit, that 
fact and approximate year of occurrence shall be stated, if significant.
    (f) Limited Partnerships. (1) Small business issuers which are 
limited partnerships must provide the balance sheets of the general 
partners as described in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(4) of this Item.
    (2) Where a general partner is a corporation, the audited balance 
sheet of

[[Page 309]]

the corporation as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year 
must be filed. Receivables, other than trade receivables, from 
affiliates of the general partner should be deducted from shareholders' 
equity of the general partner. Where an affiliate has committed itself 
to increase or maintain the general partner's capital, the audited 
balance sheet of such affiliate must also be presented.
    (3) Where a general partner is a partnership, there shall be filed 
an audited balance sheet of such partnership as of the end of its most 
recently completed fiscal year.
    (4) Where the general partner is a natural person, there shall be 
filed, as supplemental information, a balance sheet of such natural 
person as of a recent date. Such balance sheet need not be audited. The 
assets and liabilities should be carried at estimated fair market value, 
with provisions for estimated income taxes on unrealized gains. The net 
worth of such general partner(s), based on such balance sheet(s), singly 
or in the aggregate, shall be disclosed in the registration statement.
    (g) Age of Financial Statements. At the date of filing, financial 
statements included in filings other than filings on Form 10-KSB must be 
not less current than financial statements which would be required in 
Forms 10-KSB and 10-QSB if such reports were required to be filed. If 
required financial statements are as of a date 135 days or more prior to 
the date a registration statement becomes effective or proxy material is 
expected to be mailed, the financial statements shall be updated to 
include financial statements for an interim period ending within 135 
days of the effective or expected mailing date. Interim financial 
statements should be prepared and presented in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this Item:
    (1) When the anticipated effective or mailing date falls within 45 
days after the end of the fiscal year, the filing may include financial 
statements only as current as the end of the third fiscal quarter; 
Provided, however, That if the audited financial statements for the 
recently completed fiscal year are available or become available prior 
to effectiveness or mailing, they must be included in the filing;
    (2) If the effective date or anticipated mailing date falls after 45 
days but within 90 days of the end of the small business issuer's fiscal 
year, the small business issuer is not required to provide the audited 
financial statements for such year end provided that the following 
conditions are met:
    (i) If the small business issuer is a reporting company, all reports 
due must have been filed;
    (ii) For the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial 
statements are not yet available, the small business issuer reasonably 
and in good faith expects to report income from continuing operations 
before taxes; and
    (iii) For at least one of the two fiscal years immediately preceding 
the most recent fiscal year the small business issuer reported income 
from continuing operations before taxes.

<R05>
Sec. 228.402  (Item 402) Executive compensation.

    (a) General--(1) All compensation covered. This item requires clear, 
concise and understandable disclosure of all plan and non-plan 
compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to the named executive 
officers designated under paragraph (a)(2) of this item, and directors 
covered by paragraph (f) of this item by any person for all services 
rendered in all capacities to the registrant and its subsidiaries, 
unless otherwise specified in this item. Except as provided by paragraph 
(a)(4) of this item, all such compensation shall be reported pursuant to 
this item even if also called for by another requirement, including 
transactions between the registrant and a third party where the primary 
purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation to any such named 
executive officer or director. No item reported as compensation for one 
fiscal year need be reported as compensation for a subsequent fiscal 
year.
    (2) Persons covered. Disclosure shall be provided pursuant to this 
item for each of the following (the ``named executive officers''):
    (i) All individuals serving as the registrant's chief executive 
officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal 
year (``CEO''), regardless of compensation level;
    (ii) The registrant's four most highly compensated executive 
officers other than the CEO who were serving as executive officers at 
the end of the last completed fiscal year; and
    (iii) Up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would 
have been provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this item but for 
the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of 
the registrant at the end of the last completed fiscal year.

Instructions to Item 402(a)(2): 1. Determination of Most Highly 
Compensated Executive Officers. The determination as to which executive 
officers are most highly compensated shall be made by reference to total 
annual salary and bonus for the last completed fiscal year (as required 
to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this 
item), but including the dollar value of salary or bonus amounts forgone 
pursuant to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this 
item, provided, however, that no disclosure need be provided for any 
executive officer, other than the CEO, whose total annual salary and 
bonus, as so determined, does not exceed $100,000.
    2. Inclusion of Executive Officer of Subsidiary. It may be 
appropriate in certain circumstances for a registrant to include an 
executive officer of a subsidiary in the disclosure required by this 
item. See Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.3b-7].
    3. Exclusion of Executive Officer due to Unusual or Overseas 
Compensation. It may be appropriate in limited circumstances for a 
registrant not to include in the disclosure required by this item an 
individual, other than its CEO, who is one of the registrant's most 
highly compensated executive officers. Among the factors that should be 
considered in determining not to name an individual are: (a) the 
distribution or accrual of an unusually large amount of cash 
compensation (such as a bonus or commission) that is not

[[Page 311]]

part of a recurring arrangement and is unlikely to continue; and (b) the 
payment of amounts of cash compensation relating to overseas assignments 
that may be attributed predominantly to such assignments.

    (3) Information for full fiscal year. If the CEO served in that 
capacity during any part of a fiscal year with respect to which 
information is required, information should be provided as to all of his 
or her compensation for the full fiscal year. If a named executive 
officer (other than the CEO) served as an executive officer of the 
registrant (whether or not in the same position) during any part of a 
fiscal year with respect to which information is required, information 
shall be provided as to all compensation of that individual for the full 
fiscal year.
    (4) Transactions with third parties reported under item 404. This 
item includes transactions between the registrant and a third party 
where the primary purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation 
to a named executive officer. No information need be given in response 
to any paragraph of this item as to any such third-party transaction if 
the transaction has been reported in response to Item 404 of Regulation 
S-B (Sec. 228.404).
    (5) Omission of table or column. A table or column may be omitted, 
if there has been no compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to any 
of the named executives required to be reported in that table or column 
in any fiscal year covered by that table.
    (6) Definitions. For purposes of this item:
    (i) The term stock appreciation rights (SARs) refers to SARs payable 
in cash or stock, including SARs payable in cash or stock at the 
election of the registrant or a named executive officer.
    (ii) The term plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
any plan, contract, authorization or arrangement, whether or not set 
forth in any formal documents, pursuant to which the following may be 
received: cash, stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units, 
phantom stock, stock options, SARs, stock options in tandem with SARs, 
warrants, convertible securities, performance units and performance 
shares, and similar instruments. A plan may be applicable to one person. 
Registrants may omit information regarding group life, health, 
hospitalization, medical reimbursement or relocation plans that do not 
discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive 
officers or directors of the registrant and that are available generally 
to all salaried employees.
    (iii) The term long-term incentive plan means any plan providing 
compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance to occur 
over a period longer than one fiscal year, whether such performance is 
measured by reference to financial performance of the registrant or an 
affiliate, the registrant's stock price, or any other measure, but 
excluding restricted stock, stock option and SAR plans.
    (7) Location of specified information. The information required by 
paragraph (h) of this item need not be provided in any filings other 
than a registrant proxy or information statement relating to an annual 
meeting of security holders at which directors are to be elected (or 
special meeting or written consents in lieu of such meeting). Such 
information will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any 
filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the 
extent that the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference.
    (b) Summary compensation table--(1) General. The information 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this item, concerning the compensation 
of the named executive officers for each of the registrant's last three 
completed fiscal years, shall be provided in a Summary Compensation 
Table, in the tabular format specified below.

    (2) The Table shall include: (i) The name and principal position of 
the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) Fiscal year covered (column (b));
    (iii) Annual compensation (columns (c), (d) and (e)), including:
    (A) The dollar value of base salary (cash and non-cash) earned by 
the named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (c));
    (B) The dollar value of bonus (cash and non-cash) earned by the 
named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (d)); and

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(iii) (A) and (B): 1. Amounts deferred at 
the election of a named executive officer, whether pursuant to a plan 
established under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 
401(k)], or otherwise, shall be included in the salary column (column 
(c)) or bonus column (column (d)), as appropriate, for the fiscal year 
in which earned. If the amount of salary or bonus earned in a given 
fiscal year is not calculable through the latest practicable date, that 
fact must be disclosed in a footnote and such amount must be disclosed 
in the subsequent fiscal year in the appropriate column for the fiscal 
year in which earned.
    2. For stock or any other form of non-cash compensation, disclose 
the fair market value at the time the compensation is awarded, earned or 
paid.
    3. Registrants need not include in the salary column (column (c)) or 
bonus column (column (d)) any amount of salary or bonus forgone at the 
election of a named executive officer pursuant to a registrant program 
under which stock, stock-based or other forms of non-cash compensation 
may be received by a named executive in lieu of a portion of annual 
compensation earned in a covered fiscal year. However, the receipt of 
any such form of non-cash compensation in lieu of salary or bonus earned 
for a covered fiscal year must be disclosed in the appropriate column of 
the Table corresponding to that fiscal year (i.e., restricted stock 
awards (column (f)); options or SARs (column (g)); all other 
compensation (column (i)), or, if made pursuant to a long-term incentive 
plan and therefore not reportable at grant in the Summary Compensation 
Table, a footnote must be added to the salary or bonus column so 
disclosing and referring to the Long-Term Incentive Plan Table (required 
by paragraph (e) of this item) where the award is reported.

    (C) The dollar value of other annual compensation not properly 
categorized as salary or bonus, as follows (column (e)):
    (1) Perquisites and other personal benefits, securities or property, 
unless the aggregate amount of such compensation is the lesser of either 
$50,000 or 10% of the total of annual salary and bonus reported for the 
named executive officer in columns (c) and (d);
    (2) Above-market or preferential earnings on restricted stock, 
options, SARs or deferred compensation paid during the fiscal year or 
payable during that period but deferred at the election of the named 
executive officer;

[[Page 313]]

    (3) Earnings on long-term incentive plan compensation paid during 
the fiscal year or payable during that period but deferred at the 
election of the named executive officer;
    (4) Amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the payment of 
taxes; and
    (5) The dollar value of the difference between the price paid by a 
named executive officer for any security of the registrant or its 
subsidiaries purchased from the registrant or its subsidiaries (through 
deferral of salary or bonus, or otherwise), and the fair market value of 
such security at the date of purchase, unless that discount is available 
generally, either to all security holders or to all salaried employees 
of the registrant.

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(iii)(C): 1. Each perquisite or other 
personal benefit exceeding 25% of the total perquisites and other 
personal benefits reported for a named executive officer must be 
identified by type and amount in a footnote or accompanying narrative 
discussion to column (e).
    2. Perquisites and other personal benefits shall be valued on the 
basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the registrant and its 
subsidiaries.
    3. Interest on deferred or long-term compensation is above-market 
only if the rate of interest exceeds 120% of the applicable federal 
long-term rate, with compounding (as prescribed under section 1274(d) of 
the Internal Revenue Code, [26 U.S.C. 1274(d)]) at the rate that 
corresponds most closely to the rate under the registrant's plan at the 
time the interest rate or formula is set. In the event of a 
discretionary reset of the interest rate, the requisite calculation must 
be made on the basis of the interest rate at the time of such reset, 
rather than when originally established. Only the above-market portion 
of the interest must be included. If the applicable interest rates vary 
depending upon conditions such as a minimum period of continued service, 
the reported amount should be calculated assuming satisfaction of all 
conditions to receiving interest at the highest rate.
    4. Dividends (and dividend equivalents) on restricted stock, 
options, SARs or deferred compensation denominated in stock (``deferred 
stock'') are preferential only if earned at a rate higher than dividends 
on the registrant's common stock. Only the preferential portion of the 
dividends or equivalents must be included.

    (iv) Long-term compensation (columns (f), (g) and (h)), including:
    (A) The dollar value (net of any consideration paid by the named 
executive officer) of any award of restricted stock, including share 
units (calculated by multiplying the closing market price of the 
registrant's unrestricted stock on the date of grant by the number of 
shares awarded) (column (f));
    (B) The sum of the number of securities underlying stock options 
granted (including options that subsequently have been transferred), 
with or without tandem SARs, and the number of freestanding SARs (column 
(g)); and
    (C) The dollar value of all payouts pursuant to long-term incentive 
plans (``LTIPs'') as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this item 
(column (h)).

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(iv): 1. Awards of restricted stock that 
are subject to performance-based conditions to vesting, in addition to 
lapse of time and/or continued service with the registrant or a 
subsidiary, may be reported as LTIP awards pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this item instead of in column (f). If this approach is selected, once 
the restricted stock vests, it must be reported as an LTIP payout in 
column (h).
    2. The registrant shall, in a footnote to the Summary Compensation 
Table (appended to column (f), if included), disclose:
    a. The number and value of the aggregate restricted stock holdings 
at the end of the last completed fiscal year. The value shall be 
calculated in the manner specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this 
item using the value of the registrant's shares at the end of the last 
completed fiscal year;
    b. For any restricted stock award reported in the Summary 
Compensation Table that will vest, in whole or in part, in under three 
years from the date of grant, the total number of shares awarded and the 
vesting schedule; and
    c. Whether dividends will be paid on the restricted stock reported 
in column (f).
    3. If at any time during the last completed fiscal year, the 
registrant has adjusted or amended the exercise price of stock options 
or freestanding SARs previously awarded to a named executive officer, 
whether through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, or any 
other means (``repriced''), the registrant shall include the number of 
options or freestanding SARs so repriced as Stock Options/SARs granted 
and required to be reported in column (g).
    4. If any specified performance target, goal or condition to payout 
was waived with respect to any amount included in LTIP payouts reported 
in column (h), the registrant shall so state in a footnote to column 
(h).


[[Page 314]]


    (v) All other compensation for the covered fiscal year that the 
registrant could not properly report in any other column of the Summary 
Compensation Table (column (i)). Any compensation reported in this 
column for the last completed fiscal year shall be identified and 
quantified in a footnote. Such compensation shall include, but not be 
limited to:
    (A) The amount paid, payable or accrued to any named executive 
officer pursuant to a plan or arrangement in connection with:
    (1) The resignation, retirement or any other termination of such 
executive officer's employment with the registrant and its subsidiaries; 
or
    (2) A change in control of the registrant or a change in the 
executive officer's responsibilities following such a change in control.
    (B) The dollar value of above-market or preferential amounts earned 
on restricted stock, options, SARs or deferred compensation during the 
fiscal year, or calculated with respect to that period, except that if 
such amounts are paid during the period, or payable during the period 
but deferred at the election of a named executive officer, this 
information shall be reported as Other Annual Compensation in column 
(e). See Instructions 3 and 4 to paragraph 402(b) (2) (iii) (C) of this 
item;
    (C) The dollar value of amounts earned on long-term incentive plan 
compensation during the fiscal year, or calculated with respect to that 
period, except that if such amounts are paid during that period, or 
payable during that period at the election of the named executive 
officer, this information shall be reported as Other Annual Compensation 
in column (e);
    (D) Annual registrant contributions or other allocations to vested 
and unvested defined contribution plans; and
    (E) The dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf 
of, the registrant during the covered fiscal year with respect to term 
life insurance for the benefit of a named executive officer, and, if 
there is any arrangement or understanding, whether formal or informal, 
that such executive officer has or will receive or be allocated an 
interest in any cash surrender value under the insurance policy, either:
    (1) The full dollar value of the remainder of the premiums paid by, 
or on behalf of, the registrant; or
    (2) If the premiums will be refunded to the registrant on 
termination of the policy, the dollar value of the benefit to the 
executive officer of the remainder of the premium paid by, or on behalf 
of, the registrant during the fiscal year. The benefit shall be 
determined for the period, projected on an actuarial basis, between 
payment of the premium and the refund.

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(v): 1. LTIP awards and amounts received

change methods from one year to the next, that fact, and the reason 
therefor, should be disclosed in a footnote to column (i).

Instruction to Item 402(b): Information with respect to fiscal years 
prior to the last completed fiscal year will not be required if the 
registrant was not a reporting company pursuant to Section 13(a) or

    (2) The Table shall include, with respect to each grant:
    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) number of securities underlying option/SARs granted (column 
(b)).
    (iii) The percent the grant represents of total options and SARs 
granted to employees during the fiscal year (column (c));
    (iv) The per-share exercise or base price of the options or SARs 
granted (column (d)). If such exercise or base price is less than the 
market price of the underlying security on the date of grant, a 
separate, adjoining column shall be added showing market price on the 
date of grant; and
    (v) The expiration date of the options or SARs (column (e)).

Instructions to Item 402(c): 1. If more than one grant of options and/or 
freestanding SARs was made to a named executive officer during the last 
completed fiscal year, a separate line should be used to provide 
disclosure of each such grant. However, multiple grants during a single 
fiscal year may be aggregated where each grant was made at the same 
exercise and/or base price and has the same expiration date, and the 
same performance vesting thresholds, if any. A single grant consisting 
of options and/or freestanding SARs shall be reported as separate grants 
with respect to each tranche with a different exercise and/or base 
price, performance vesting threshold, or expiration date.
    2. Options or freestanding SARs granted in connection with an option 
repricing transaction shall be reported in this table. See Instruction 3 
to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this item.
    3. Any material term of the grant, including but not limited to the 
date of exercisability, the number of SARs, performance units or other 
instruments granted in tandem with options, a performance-based 
condition to exercisability, a reload feature, or a tax-reimbursement 
feature, shall be footnoted.
    4. If the exercise or base price is adjustable over the term of any 
option or freestanding SAR in accordance with any prescribed standard or 
formula, including but not limited to an index or premium price 
provision, describe the following, either by footnote to column (c) or 
in narrative accompanying the Table:
    (a) The standard or formula; and
    (b) Any constant assumption made by the registrant regarding any 
adjustment to the exercise price in calculating the potential option or 
SAR value.
    5. If any provision of a grant (other than an antidilution 
provision) could cause the exercise price to be lowered, registrants 
must clearly and fully disclose these provisions and their potential 
consequences either by a footnote or accompanying textual narrative.
    6. In determining the grant-date market or base price of the 
security underlying options or freestanding SARs, the registrant may use 
either the closing market price per share of the security, or any other 
formula prescribed for the security.

    (d) Aggregated option/SAR exercises and fiscal year-end option/SAR 
Value Table. (1) The information specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
item, concerning each exercise of stock options (or tandem SARs) and 
freestanding SARs during the last completed fiscal year by each of the 
named executive officers and the fiscal year-end value of unexercised 
options and SARs, shall be provided on an aggregated basis in the 
tabular format specified below:

    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) The number of shares received upon exercise, or, if no shares 
were received, the number of securities with respect to which the 
options or SARs were exercised (column (b));
    (iii) The aggregate dollar value realized upon exercise (column 
(c));
    (iv) The total number of securities underlying unexercised options 
and SARs held at the end of the last completed fiscal year, separately 
identifying the exercisable and unexercisable options and SARs (column

    (v) The aggregate dollar value of in-the-money, unexercised options 
and SARs held at the end of the fiscal year, separately identifying the 
exercisable and unexercisable options and SARs (column (e)).

Instructions to Item 402(d)(2): 1. Options or freestanding SARs are in-
the-money if the fair market value of the underlying securities exceeds 
the exercise or base price of the option or SAR. The dollar values in 
columns (c) and (e) are calculated by determining the difference between 
the fair market value of the securities underlying the options or SARs 
and the exercise or base price of the options or SARs at exercise or 
fiscal year-end, respectively.
    2. In calculating the dollar value realized upon exercise (column 
(c)), the value of any related payment or other consideration provided 
(or to be provided) by the registrant to or on behalf of a named 
executive officer, whether in payment of the exercise price or related 
taxes, shall not be included. Payments by the registrant in 
reimbursement of tax obligations incurred by a named executive officer 
are required to be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii)(C)(4) of this item.

    (e) Long-Term Incentive Plan (``LTIP'') awards table. (1) The

estimated payouts denominated in dollars or number of shares under the 
award (threshold, target and maximum amount) (columns (d) through (f)).

Instructions to Item 402(e): 1. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``long-term incentive plan'' or ``LTIP'' shall be defined in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this item.
    2. Describe in a footnote or in narrative text accompanying this 
table the material terms of any award, including a general description 
of the formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts 
payable. Registrants are not required to disclose any factor, criterion 
or performance-related or other condition to payout or maturation of a 
particular award that involves confidential commercial or business 
information, disclosure of which would adversely affect the registrant's 
competitive position.
    3. Separate disclosure shall be provided in the Table for each award 
made to a named executive officer, accompanied by the information 
specified in Instruction 2 to this paragraph. If awards are made to a 
named executive officer during the fiscal year under more than one plan, 
identify the particular plan under which each such award was made.
    4. For column (d), ``threshold'' refers to the minimum amount 
payable for a certain level of performance under the plan. For column 
(e), ``target'' refers to the amount payable if the specified

    6. A tandem grant of two instruments, only one of which is pursuant 
to a LTIP, need be reported only in the table applicable to the other 
instrument. For example, an option granted in tandem with a performance 
share would be reported only as an option grant, with the tandem feature 
noted.

    (f) Compensation of directors--(1) Standard arrangements. Describe 
any standard arrangements, stating amounts, pursuant to which directors 
of the registrant are compensated for any services provided as a 
director, including any additional amounts payable for committee 
participation or special assignments.
    (2) Other arrangements. Describe any other arrangements pursuant to 
which any director of the registrant was compensated during the 
registrant's last completed fiscal year for any service provided as a 
director, stating the amount paid and the name of the director.

Instruction to Item 402(f)(2): The information required by paragraph 
(f)(2) of this item shall include any arrangement, including consulting 
contracts, entered into in consideration of the director's service on 
the board. The material terms of any such arrangement shall be included.

    (g) Employment contracts and termination of employment and change-
in-control arrangements. Describe the terms and conditions of each of 
the following contracts or arrangements:
    (1) Any employment contract between the registrant and a named 
executive officer; and

received from the registrant, with respect to a named executive officer, 
if such plan or arrangement results or will result from the resignation, 
retirement or any other termination of such executive officer's 
employment with the registrant and its subsidiaries or from a change-in-
control of the registrant or a change in the named executive officer's 
responsibilities following a change-in-control and the amount involved, 
including all periodic payments or installments, exceeds $100,000.
    (h) Report on repricing of options/SARs. (1) If at any time during 
the last completed fiscal year, the registrant, while a reporting 
company pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 
U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)], has adjusted or amended the exercise price of 
stock options or SARs previously awarded to any of the named executive 
officers, whether through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, 
or any other means (``repriced''), the registrant shall provide the 
information specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this item.
    (2) The compensation committee (or other board committee performing 
equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the 
entire board of directors) shall explain in reasonable detail any such 
repricing of options and or SARs held by a named executive officer in 
the last completed

[[Page 318]]

fiscal year, as well as the basis for each such repricing.

Instructions to Item 402(h): 1. A replacement grant is any grant of 
options or SARs reasonably related to any prior or potential option or 
SAR cancellation, whether by an exchange of existing options or SARs for 
options or SARs with new terms; the grant of new options or SARs in 
tandem with previously granted options or SARs that will operate to 
cancel the previously granted options or SARs upon exercise; repricing 
of previously granted options or SARs; or otherwise. If a corresponding 
original grant was canceled in a prior year, information about such 
grant nevertheless must be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.
    2. If the replacement grant is not made at the current market price, 
describe the terms of the grant in a footnote or accompanying textual 
narrative.
    3. This paragraph shall not apply to any repricing occurring through 
the operation of:
    a. A plan formula or mechanism that results in the periodic 
adjustment of the option or SAR exercise or base price;
    b. A plan antidilution provision; or
    c. A recapitalization or similar transaction equally affecting all 
holders of the class of securities underlying the options or SARs.

Sec. 228.405  (Item 405) Compliance With Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

    Every small business issuer that has a class of equity securities 
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l) 
shall:
    (a) Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 (17 CFR 249.103 and 
249.104 of this chapter) and amendments thereto furnished to the 
registrant under Rule 16a-3(e) (17 CFR 240.16a-3(e) of this chapter) 
during its most recent fiscal year and Forms 5 and amendments thereto 
(Sec. 249.105 of this chapter) furnished to the registrant with respect 
to its most recent fiscal year, and any written representation referred 
to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this Item:
    (1) Under the caption ``Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting 
Compliance,'' identify each person who, at any time during the fiscal 
year, was a director, officer, beneficial owner of more than ten percent 
of any class of equity securities of the registrant registered pursuant 
to section 12 (``reporting person'') that failed to file on a timely 
basis, as disclosed in the above Forms, reports required by section 
16(a) of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year or prior 
fiscal years.
    (2) For each such person, set forth the number of late reports, the 
number of transactions that were not reported on a timely basis, and any 
known failure to file a required Form. A known failure to file would 
include, but not be limited to, a failure to file a Form 3, which is 
required of all reporting persons, and a failure to file a Form 5 in the 
absence of the written representation referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section, unless the registrant otherwise knows that no Form 5 is 
required.
    Note: The disclosure requirement is based on a review of the forms 
submitted to the registrant during and with respect to its most recent 
fiscal year, as specified above. Accordingly, a failure to file timely 
need only be disclosed once. For example, if in the most recently 
concluded fiscal year a reporting person filed a Form 4 disclosing a 
transaction that took place in the prior fiscal year, and should have 
been reported in that year, the registrant should disclose that late 
filing and transaction pursuant to this Item for the most recent fiscal 
year, but not in material filed with respect to subsequent years.

    (b) With respect to the disclosure required by paragraph (a) of this 
Item:

[[Page 321]]

    (1) A form received by the registrant within three calendar days of 
the required filing date may be presumed to have been filed with the 
Commission by the required filing date.
    (2) If the registrant:
    (i) receives a written representation from the reporting person that 
no Form 5 is required; and
    (ii) maintains the representation for two years, making a copy 
available to the Commission or its staff upon request, the registrant 
need not identify such reporting person pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this Item as having failed to file a Form 5 with respect to that fiscal 
year.

Sec. 228.512  (Item 512) Undertakings.

    Include each of the following undertakings that apply to the 
offering.
    (a) Rule 415 Offering. If the small business issuer is registering 
securities under Rule 415 of the Securities Act (Sec. 230.415 of this 
chapter), that the small business issuer will:
    (1) File, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, 
a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to:
    (i) Include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the 
Securities Act;
    (ii) Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, 
individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the 
information in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if 
the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which 
was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the 
estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of 
prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) 
(Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in 
volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum 
aggregate offering price set forth in the ``Calculation of Registration 
Fee'' table in the effective registration statement; and
    (iii) Include any additional or changed material information on the 
plan of distribution.
    Note: Small business issuers do not need to give the statements in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this Item if the registration 
statement is on Form S-3 or S-8 (Secs. 239.13 or 239.16b of this 
chapter), and the information required in a post-effective amendment is 
incorporated by reference from periodic reports filed by the small 
business issuer under the Exchange Act.

    (2) For determining liability under the Securities Act, treat each 
post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the 
securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to 
be the initial bona fide offering.
    (3) File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any 
of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering.
    (b) Warrants and rights offerings. If the small business issuer will 
offer the securities to existing security holders under warrants or 
rights and the small business issuer will reoffer to the public any 
securities not taken by security holders, with any modifications that 
suit the particular case--The small business issuer will supplement the 
prospectus, after the end of the subscription period, to include the 
results of the subscription offer, the transactions by the underwriters 
during the subscription period, the amount of unsubscribed securities 
that the underwriters will purchase and the terms of any later 
reoffering. If the underwriters make any public offering of the 
securities on terms different from those on the cover page of the 
prospectus, the small business issuer will file a post-effective 
amendment to state the terms of such offering.
    (c) Competitive bids. If the small business issuer is offering 
securities at competitive bidding, with modifications to suit the 
particular case, the small business issuer will:
    (1) Use its best efforts to distribute before the opening of bids, 
to prospective bidders, underwriters, and dealers, a reasonable number 
of copies of a prospectus that meet the requirements of section 10(a) of 
the Securities Act, and relating to the securities offered at 
competitive bidding, as contained in the registration statement, 
together with any supplements; and
    (2) File an amendment to the registration statement reflecting the 
results of bidding, the terms of the reoffering and related matters 
where required by the applicable form, not later than the first use, 
authorized by the issuer after the opening of bids, of a prospectus 
relating to the securities offered at competitive bidding, unless the 
issuer proposes no further public offering of such securities by the 
issuer or by the purchasers.
    (d) Equity offerings of nonreporting small business issuers. If a 
small business issuer that before the offering had

[[Page 327]]

no duty to file reports with the Commission under section 13(a) or 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act is registering equity securities for sale in an 
underwritten offering--The small business issuer will provide to the 
underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement 
certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as 
required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
    (e) Request for acceleration of effective date. If the small 
business issuer will request acceleration of the effective date of the 
registration statement under Rule 461 under the Securities Act, include 
the following:

    Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Act'') may be permitted to directors, 
officers and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant 
to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has 
been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in 
the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.


In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities 
(other than the payment by the small business issuer of expenses 
incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the 
small business issuer in the successful defense of any action, suit or 
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person 
in connection with the securities being registered, the small business 
issuer will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been 
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against 
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by 
the final adjudication of such issue.
    (f) If the issuer relies on Rule 430A under the Securities Act 
[Sec. 230.430A of this chapter], that the small business issuer will:
    (1) For determining any liability under the Securities Act, treat 
the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of 
this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in 
a form of prospectus filed by the small business issuer under Rule 
424(b)(1), or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act 
(Secs. 230.424(b)(1), (4) or 230.497(h)) as part of this registration 
statement as of the time the Commission declared it effective.
    (2) For determining any liability under the Securities Act, treat 
each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus as a 
new registration statement for the securities offered in the

Sec. 228.601  (Item 601) Exhibits.

    (a) Exhibits and index of exhibits. (1) The exhibits required by the 
exhibit table generally must be filed or incorporated by reference. The 
Financial Data Schedule required by paragraph (b)(27) of this Item must 
be submitted to the Commission as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
Item.
    (2) Each filing must have an index of exhibits. The exhibit index 
must list exhibits in the same order as the exhibit table. If the 
exhibits are incorporated by reference, this fact should be noted in the 
exhibit index. In the manually signed registration statement or report, 
the exhibit index should give the page number of each exhibit.
    (3) If a material contract or plan of acquisition, reorganization, 
arrangement, liquidation or succession is executed or becomes effective 
during the reporting period covered by a Form 10-QSB or Form 10-KSB, it 
must be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-QSB or Form 10-KSB filed for 
the same period. Any amendment or modification to a previously filed 
exhibit to a Form 10-SB, 10-KSB or 10-QSB document must be filed as an 
exhibit to a Form 10-QSB or 10-KSB. The amendment or modification does 
not need to be filed if the previously filed exhibit would not be 
currently required.

Instructions to Item 601(a): 1. If an exhibit (other than an opinion or 
consent) is filed in preliminary form and is later changed to include 
only interest, dividend or conversion rates, redemption or conversion 
prices, purchase or offering prices, underwriters' or dealers' 
commissions, names, addresses or

[[Page 328]]

participation of underwriters or similar matters and the information 
appears elsewhere in the registration statement or a prospectus, no 
amendment need be filed.
    2. Small business issuers may file copies of each exhibit, rather 
than originals, except as otherwise specifically noted.
    3. Electronic filings. Whenever an exhibit is filed in paper 
pursuant to a hardship exemption (Secs. 232.201 and 232.202 of this 
chapter), the letter ``P'' (paper) should be placed next to the exhibit 
in the list of exhibits required by Item 601(a)(2) of this Rule 
(Sec. 228.601(a)(2)). Whenever an electronic confirming copy of an 
exhibit is filed pursuant to a hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 or 
Sec. 232.202(d) of this chapter), the exhibit index should specify where 
the confirming electronic copy can be located; in addition, the 
designation ``CE'' (confirming electronic) should be placed next to the 
listed exhibit in the exhibit index.

sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. Such letter may be filed with

Commission in the report or which is expected to affect the financial 
statements of future fiscal years is to an alternative principle which 
in his judgment is preferable under the circumstances. No such letter 
need be filed when such change is made in response to a standard adopted 
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that creates a new 
accounting principle, that expresses a preference for an accounting 
principle, or that rejects a specific accounting principle.
    (19) Report furnished to security holders. If the issuer makes 
available to its stockholders or otherwise publishes, within the period 
prescribed for filing the report, a document or statement containing 
information meeting some or all of the requirements of Part I of Form

or report under a power of attorney, a manually signed copy of such

a reference in the index to where it is located. In addition, if an 
officer signs a registration statement for the small business issuer by 
a power of attorney, a certified copy of a resolution of the board of 
directors authorizing such signature. A power of attorney that is filed 
with the Commission must relate to a specific filing or an amendment,

and qualification does not apply to statements submitted in electronic 
format.Rather, such statements must be submitted as exhibits in the same 
electronic submission as the registration statement to which they 
relate, or in an amendment thereto, except that

[[Page 332]]

electronic filers that rely on Trust Indenture Act Section 305(b)(2) for 
determining the eligibility of the trustee under indentures for 
securities to be issued, offered or sold on a delayed basis by or on 
behalf of the registrant shall file such statements separately in the 
manner prescribed by Sec. 260.5b-1 through Sec. 260.5b-3 of this chapter 
and by the EDGAR Filer Manual.

after the effective date of the registration statement, and if such 
earnings statement is made available by ``other methods'' than those 
specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Sec. 230.158 of this chapter, it

foreign private issuer or foreign government. The schedule must be 
submitted in the electronic format prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual, 
and must set forth the financial information specified in the applicable 
table in the Appendices to this item.
    (ii) Any electronic filing that includes financial statements of the 
registrant for a recent fiscal year or interim year to date period, or 
both, for which financial statements have not previously been filed, 
otherwise than by incorporation by reference, shall include as an 
exhibit a Financial Data Schedule containing financial information for 
such fiscal year or interim year to date periods, or both.
    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(1)(ii): Financial Data Schedules are not 
required in connection with registration statements on Form S-8 
(Sec. 239.16b of this chapter) or annual reports on Form 11-K 
(Sec. 249.311 of this chapter), for employee stock purchase, savings and 
similar plans.
    Note 2 to paragraph (c)(1)(ii): Issuers of asset-backed securities 
(as that term is defined in the general instructions to Form S-3 
(Sec. 239.13 of this chapter), except that they need not be investment

reports filed pursuant to sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act 
are not required to submit a Financial Data Schedule in connection with 
those filings.

correspond to or be calculable from amounts reflected in the small 
business issuer's financial statements or associated notes.
    (iv) The schedule must be submitted as an exhibit to the filing(s)

the federal securities laws, nor will it be deemed a part of any 
registration statement to which it relates. It shall, however, be 
subject to all other liability and anti-fraud provisions of the federal 
securities laws. See Rule 402 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.402 of this 
chapter).
    (v) A Financial Data Schedule shall be submitted only in electronic 
format. Where a registrant submits a filing, otherwise required to 
include a Financial Data Schedule, in paper pursuant to a hardship 
exemption under Rule 201 or Rule 202(d) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.201 
or Sec. 232.202(d) of this chapter, respectively), the Financial Data 
Schedule shall not be included with the paper filing, but shall be 
included with the required confirming electronic copy.
    (vi) Financial Data Schedules shall not include pro forma financial 
information.
    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(1): Failure to furnish a Financial Data 
Schedule will not prevent acceptance of the filing for which the 
schedule is required. However, as the schedule may be used by the 
Commission staff in

[[Page 333]]

its review of the filing, processing of the filing may be delayed 
pending filing of the schedule. Further, registrants that have not filed 
a required Financial Data Schedule will be ineligible to use Form S-2 
(Sec. 239.12 of this chapter), Form S-3 (Sec. 239.13 of this chapter) 
and Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of this chapter). See the eligibility 
requirements of those forms.

Schedule are not required to be furnished with the paper copy sent to

Rule 901(d) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.901(d) of this chapter), or with 
the paper copies of filings required by the Commission rules to be 
furnished to the national securities exchange or national securities 
association upon which the registrant's securities are listed. 
Similarly, no paper copy of a Financial Data Schedule is required with 
filings made in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption; however, any 
required electronic confirming copy of such filing should be accompanied 
by a Financial Data Schedule, where appropriate pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (2) Format and presentation of Financial Data Schedule. (i) At the 
option of the registrant, the following legend may be inserted at the 
beginning of any Financial Data Schedule submitted to the Commission, in 
the manner prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual:


THIS SCHEDULE CONTAINS SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM 
[identify specific financial statements] AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS 
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SUCH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

    (ii) Items set forth in a Financial Data Schedule may be qualified 
by referencing a specific footnote to the Financial Data Schedule or 
cross-referencing notes to the registrant's financial statements.
    (iii) If any of the amounts reported in a previously submitted 
Financial Data Schedule are restated as a result of pooling of 
interests, an accounting principle change, a reorganization or 
recapitalization, correction of an error, or any other reason, then a 
schedule, as amended or restated, shall be submitted that sets forth the 
restated or amended information for each affected period during the 
latest three fiscal years and any interim periods of the latest two 
fiscal years; except that restated or amended information need not be 
furnished for any period for which a Financial Data Schedule was not 
previously required to be furnished. The document shall specify that the 
Financial Data Schedule has been restated or amended. A schedule that is 
filed to correct an error in a previously filed Financial Data Schedule 
shall be designated as an ``Amended Financial Data Schedule.'' A 
schedule that is filed as a result of a restatement that is not a 
correction of an error shall be designated as a ``Restated Financial 
Data Schedule.''
    Note to paragraph (c)(2)(iii): A registrant is not required to 
restate prior Financial Data Schedules for a recapitalization that is in 
the form of a stock split or reverse stock split, provided that the EPS> 
tag for the period in which the stock split occurs includes a footnote 
indicating that a stock split has occurred and its effective date, and 
that prior Financial Data Schedules have not been restated for the 
recapitalization.

    (iv) Except as otherwise provided in the EDGAR Filer Manual, a 
response is required for each item called for in the schedule. If 
information required by the applicable schedule is not included in the 
underlying financial data because it is either immaterial or 
inapplicable to the registrant, the registrant shall use the value ``0'' 
(zero) in response to that item.
    (3) Contents of Financial Data Schedule. The schedule shall set 
forth the financial information specified below that is applicable to

primary financial statements and that does not present combined totals 
for all lines of business may submit separate Financial Data Schedules 
for each line of business. Where a small business issuer prepares more

statement to the ending date of the reporting period, the amount of net 
offering proceeds to the issuer used for construction of plant, building 
and facilities; purchase and installation of machinery and equipment; 
purchases of real estate; acquisition of other business(es); repayment 
of indebtedness; working capital; temporary investments (which should be 
specified); and any other purposes for which at least five (5) percent 
of the issuer's total offering proceeds or $100,000 (whichever is less) 
has been used (which should be specified). Indicate if a reasonable 
estimate for the amount of net offering proceeds applied is provided 
instead of the actual amount of net offering proceeds used. Indicate 
whether such payments were:
    (A) Direct or indirect payments to directors, officers, general 
partners of the issuer or their associates; to persons owning ten (10) 
percent or more of any class of equity securities of the issuer; and to 
affiliates of the issuer; or
    (B) Direct or indirect payments to others; and

represents a material change in the use of proceeds described in the 
prospectus, the issuer should describe briefly the material change.

<R05>
Sec. 229.10  General.

    (a) Application of Regulation S-K. This part (together with the 
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq., as amended (Securities Act), and the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., as amended (Exchange Act) 
(parts 230 and 240 of this chapter), the Interpretative Releases under 
these Acts (parts 231 and 241 of this chapter) and the forms under these 
Acts (parts 239 and 249 of this chapter)) states the requirements 
applicable to the content of the non-financial statement portions of:
    (1) Registration statements under the Securities Act (part 239 of 
this chapter) to the extent provided in the forms to be used for 
registration under such Act; and
    (2) Registration statements under section 12 (subpart C of part 249 
of this chapter), annual or other reports under

[[Page 341]]

sections 13 and 15(d) (subparts D and E of part 249 of this chapter), 
annual reports to security holders and proxy and information statements 
under section 14 of the Exchange Act (part 240 of this chapter), and any 
other documents required to be filed under the Exchange Act, to the 
extent provided in the forms and rules under such Act.
    (b) Commission policy on projections. The Commission encourages the 
use in documents specified in Rule 175 under the Securities Act 
(Sec. 230.175 of this chapter) and Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange Act 
(Sec. 240.3b-6 of this chapter) of management's projections of future 
economic performance that have a reasonable basis and are presented in 
an appropriate format. The guidelines set forth herein represent the 
Commission's views on important factors to be considered in formulating 
and disclosing such projections.
    (1) Basis for projections. The Commission believes that management 
must have the option to present in Commission filings its good faith 
assessment of a registrant's future performance. Management, however, 
must have a reasonable basis for such an assessment. Although a history 
of operations or experience in projecting may be among the factors 
providing a basis for management's assessment, the Commission does not 
believe that a registrant always must have had such a history or 
experience in order to formulate projections with a reasonable basis. An 
outside review of management's projections may furnish additional 
support for having a reasonable basis for a projection. If management 
decides to include a report of such a review in a Commission filing, 
there also should be disclosure of the qualifications of the reviewer, 
the extent of the review, the relationship between the reviewer and the 
registrant, and other material factors concerning the process by which 
any outside review was sought or obtained. Moreover, in the case of a 
registration statement under the Securities Act, the reviewer would be 
deemed an expert and an appropriate consent must be filed with the 
registration statement.
    (2) Format for projections. In determining the appropriate format 
for projections included in Commission filings, consideration must be 
given to, among other things, the financial items to be projected, the 
period to be covered, and the manner of presentation to be used. 
Although traditionally projections have been given for three financial 
items generally considered to be of primary importance to investors 
(revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share), projection 
information need not necessarily be limited to these three items. 
However, management should take care to assure that the choice of items 
projected is not susceptible of misleading inferences through selective 
projection of only favorable items. Revenues, net income (loss) and 
earnings (loss) per share usually are presented together in order to 
avoid any misleading inferences that may arise when the individual items 
reflect contradictory trends. There may be instances, however, when it 
is appropriate to present earnings (loss) from continuing operations, or 
income (loss) before extraordinary items in addition to or in lieu of 
net income (loss). It generally would be misleading to present sales or 
revenue projections without one of the foregoing measures of income. The 
period that appropriately may be covered by a projection depends to a 
large extent on the particular circumstances of the company involved. 
For certain companies in certain industries, a projection covering a two 
or three year period may be entirely reasonable. Other companies may not 
have a reasonable basis for projections beyond the current year. 
Accordingly, management should select the period most appropriate in the 
circumstances. In addition, management, in making a projection, should 
disclose what, in its opinion, is the most probable specific amount or 
the most reasonable range for each financial item projected based on the 
selected assumptions. Ranges, however, should not be so wide as to make 
the disclosures meaningless. Moreover, several projections based on 
varying assumptions may be judged by management to be more meaningful 
than a single number or range and would be permitted.
    (3) Investor understanding. (i) When management chooses to include 
its projections in a Commission filing, the

[[Page 342]]

disclosures accompanying the projections should facilitate investor 
understanding of the basis for and limitations of projections. In this 
regard investors should be cautioned against attributing undue certainty 
to management's assessment, and the Commission believes that investors 
would be aided by a statement indicating management's intention 
regarding the furnishing of updated projections. The Commission also 
believes that investor understanding would be enhanced by disclosure of 
the assumptions which in management's opinion are most significant to 
the projections or are the key factors upon which the financial results 
of the enterprise depend and encourages disclosure of assumptions in a 
manner that will provide a framework for analysis of the projection.
    (ii) Management also should consider whether disclosure of the 
accuracy or inaccuracy of previous projections would provide investors 
with important insights into the limitations of projections. In this 
regard, consideration should be given to presenting the projections in a 
format that will facilitate subsequent analysis of the reasons for 
differences between actual and forecast results. An important benefit 
may arise from the systematic analysis of variances between projected 
and actual results on a continuing basis, since such disclosure may 
highlight for investors the most significant risk and profit-sensitive 
areas in a business operation.
    (iii) With respect to previously issued projections, registrants are 
reminded of their responsibility to make full and prompt disclosure of 
material facts, both favorable and unfavorable, regarding their 
financial condition. This responsibility may extend to situations where 
management knows or has reason to know that its previously disclosed 
projections no longer have a reasonable basis.
    (iv) Since a registrant's ability to make projections with relative 
confidence may vary with all the facts and circumstances, the 
responsibility for determining whether to discontinue or to resume 
making projections is best left to management. However, the Commission 
encourages registrants not to discontinue or to resume projections in 
Commission filings without a reasonable basis.
    (c) Commission policy on security ratings. In view of the importance 
of security ratings (ratings) to investors and the marketplace, the 
Commission permits registrants to disclose, on a voluntary basis, 
ratings assigned by rating organizations to classes of debt securities, 
convertible debt securities and preferred stock in registration 
statements and periodic reports. In addition, the Commission permits, 
pursuant to Rule 134(a)(14) under the Securities Act 
(Sec. 230.134(a)(14) of this chapter), voluntary disclosure of ratings 
assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
(NRSROs) in certain communications deemed not to be a prospectus 
(tombstone advertisements). Set forth herein are the Commission's views 
on important matters to be considered in disclosing security ratings.
    (1) Securities Act filings. (i) If a registrant includes in a 
registration statement filed under the Securities Act any rating(s) 
assigned to a class of securities, it should consider including: (A) Any 
other rating intended for public dissemination assigned to such class by 
a NRSRO (additional NRSRO rating) that is available on the date of the 
initial filing of the document and that is materially different from any 
rating disclosed; and (B) the name of each rating organization whose 
rating is disclosed; each such rating organization's definition or 
description of the category in which it rated the class of securities; 
the relative rank of each rating within the assigning rating 
organization's overall classification system; and a statement informing 
investors that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or 
hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any 
time by the assigning rating organization, and that each rating should 
be evaluated independently of any other rating. The registrant also 
should include the written consent of any rating organization that is 
not a NRSRO whose rating is included. With respect to the written 
consent of any NRSRO whose rating is included, see Rule 436(g) under the 
Securities Act (Sec. 230.436(g) of this chapter). When the registrant 
has filed a

[[Page 343]]

registration statement on Form F-9 (Sec. 239.39 of this chapter), see 
Rule 436(g) (Sec. 230.436(g) of this chapter) under the Securities Act 
with respect to the written consent of any rating organization specified 
in the Instruction to paragraph (a)(2) of General Instruction I of Form 
F-9.
    (ii) If a change in a rating already included is available 
subsequent to the filing of the registration statement, but prior to its 
effectiveness, the registrant should consider including such rating 
change in the final prospectus. If the rating change is material or if a 
materially different rating from any disclosed becomes available during 
this period, the registrant should consider amending the registration 
statement to include the rating change or additional rating and 
recirculating the preliminary prospectus.
    (iii) If a materially different additional NRSRO rating or a 
material change in a rating already included becomes available during 
any period in which offers or sales are being made, the registrant 
should consider disclosing such additional rating or rating change by 
means of post-effective amendment or sticker to the prospectus pursuant 
to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.424(b) of this 
chapter), unless, in the case of a registration statement on Form S-3 
(Sec. 239.13 of this chapter), it has been disclosed in a document 
incorporated by reference into the registration statement subsequent to 
its effectiveness and prior to the termination of the offering.
    (2) Exchange Act filings. (i) If a registrant includes in a 
registration statement or periodic report filed under the Exchange Act 
any rating(s) assigned to a class of securities, it should consider 
including the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) and (B) 
of this section.
    (ii) If there is a material change in the rating(s) assigned by any 
NRSRO(s) to any outstanding class(es) of securities of a registrant 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act, the registrant should consider filing a report on Form 8-K 
(Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) or other appropriate report under the 
Exchange Act disclosing such rating change.
    (d) Incorporation by Reference. Where rules, regulations, or 
instructions to forms of the Commission permit incorporation by 
reference, a document may be so incorporated by reference to the 
specific document and to the prior filing or submission in which such 
document was physically filed or submitted. Except where a registrant or 
issuer is expressly required to incorporate a document or documents by 
reference, reference may not be made to any document which incorporates 
another document by reference if the pertinent portion of the document 
containing the information or financial statements to be incorporated by 
reference includes an incorporation by reference to another document. No 
document on file with the Commission for more than five years may be 
incorporated by reference except:
    (1) Documents contained in registration statements, which may be 
incorporated by reference as long as the registrant has a reporting 
requirement with the Commission; or
    (2) Documents that the registrant specifically identifies by 
physical location by SEC file number reference, provided such materials 
have not been disposed of by the Commission pursuant to its Records 
Control Schedule (17 CFR 200.80f).

<R05>
Sec. 229.101  (Item 101) Description of business.

    (a) General development of business. Describe the general 
development of the business of the registrant, its subsidiaries and any 
predecessor(s) during the past five years, or such shorter period as the 
registrant may have been engaged in business. Information shall be 
disclosed for earlier periods if material to an understanding of the 
general development of the business.
    (1) In describing developments, information shall be given as to 
matters such as the following: the year in which the registrant was 
organized and

[[Page 344]]

its form of organization; the nature and results of any bankruptcy, 
receivership or similar proceedings with respect to the registrant or 
any of its significant subsidiaries; the nature and results of any other 
material reclassification, merger or consolidation of the registrant or 
any of its significant subsidiaries; the acquisition or disposition of 
any material amount of assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of 
business; and any material changes in the mode of conducting the 
business.
    (2) Registrants, (i) filing a registration statement on Form S-1 
(Sec. 239.11 of this chapter) under the Securities Act or on Form 10 and 
Form 10-SB (Sec. 249.210 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act, (ii) 
not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act immediately prior to the filing of such registration 
statement, and (iii) that (including predecessors) have not received 
revenue from operations during each of the 3 fiscal years immediately 
prior to the filing of registration statement, shall provide the 
following information:
    (A) If the registration statement is filed prior to the end of the 
registrant's second fiscal quarter, a description of the registrant's 
plan of operation for the remainder of the fiscal year; or
    (B) If the registration statement is filed subsequent to the end of 
the registrant's second fiscal quarter, a descripition of the 
registrant's plan of operation for the remainder of the fiscal year and 
for the first six months of the next fiscal year. If such information is 
not available, the reasons for its not being available shall be stated. 
Disclosure relating to any plan shall include such matters as:
    (1) In the case of a registration statement on Form S-1, a statement 
in narrative form indicating the registrant's opinion as to the period 
of time that the proceeds from the offering will satisfy cash 
requirements and whether in the next six months it will be necessary to 
raise additional funds to meet the expenditures required for operating 
the business of the registrant; the specific reasons for such opinion 
shall be set forth and categories of expenditures and sources of cash 
resources shall be identified; however, amounts of expenditures and cash 
resources need not be provided; in addition, if the narrative statement 
is based on a cash budget, such budget shall be furnished to the 
Commission as supplemental information, but not as part of the 
registration statement;
    (2) An explanation of material product research and development to 
be performed during the period covered in the plan;
    (3) Any anticipated material acquisition of plant and equipment and 
the capacity thereof;
    (4) Any anticipated material changes in number of employees in the 
various departments such as research and development, production, sales 
or administration; and
    (5) Other material areas which may be peculiar to the registrant's 
business.
    (b) Financial information about segments. Report for each segment, 
as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, revenues from 
external customers, a measure of profit or loss and total assets. A 
registrant must report this information for each of the last three 
fiscal years or for as long as it has been in business, whichever period 
is shorter. If the information provided in response to this paragraph 
(b) conforms with generally accepted accounting principles, a registrant 
may include in its financial statements a cross reference to this data 
in lieu of presenting duplicative information in the financial 
statements; conversely, a registrant may cross reference to the 
financial statements.
    (1) If a registrant changes the structure of its internal 
organization in a manner that causes the composition of its reportable 
segments to change, the registrant must restate the corresponding 
information for earlier periods, including interim periods, unless it is 
impracticable to do so. Following a change in the composition of its 
reportable segments, a registrant shall disclose whether it has restated 
the corresponding items of segment information for earlier periods. If 
it has not restated the items from earlier periods, the registrant shall 
disclose in the year in which the change occurs segment information for 
the current period under both the old basis and the new basis of 
segmentation, unless it is impracticable to do so.

[[Page 345]]

    (2) If the registrant includes, or is required by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210) to include, interim financial statements, 
discuss any facts relating to the performance of any of the segments 
during the period which, in the opinion of management, indicate that the 
three year segment financial data may not be indicative of current or 
future operations of the segment. Comparative financial information 
shall be included to the extent necessary to the discussion.
    (c) Narrative description of business. (1) Describe the business 
done and intended to be done by the registrant and its subsidiaries, 
focusing upon the registrant's dominant segment or each reportable 
segment about which financial information is presented in the financial 
statements. To the extent material to an understanding of the 
registrant's business taken as a whole, the description of each such 
segment shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) 
through (x) of this section. The matters specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
(xi) through (xiii) of this section shall be discussed with respect to 
the registrant's business in general; where material, the segments to 
which these matters are significant shall be identified.
    (i) The principal products produced and services rendered by the 
registrant in the segment and the principal markets for, and methods of 
distribution of, the segment's principal products and services. In 
addition, state for each of the last three fiscal years the amount or 
percentage of total revenue contributed by any class of similar products 
or services which accounted for 10 percent or more of consolidated 
revenue in any of the last three fiscal years or 15 percent or more of 
consolidated revenue, if total revenue did not exceed $50,000,000 during 
any of such fiscal years.
    (ii) A description of the status of a product or segment (e.g. 
whether in the planning stage, whether prototypes exist, the degree to 
which product design has progressed or whether further engineering is 
necessary), if there has been a public announcement of, or if the 
registrant otherwise has made public information about, a new product or 
segment that would require the investment of a material amount of the 
assets of the registrant or that otherwise is material. This paragraph 
is not intended to require disclosure of otherwise nonpublic corporate 
information the disclosure of which would affect adversely the 
registrant's competitive position.
    (iii) The sources and availability of raw materials.
    (iv) The importance to the segment and the duration and effect of 
all patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions held.
    (v) The extent to which the business of the segment is or may be 
seasonal.
    (vi) The practices of the registrant and the industry (respective 
industries) relating to working capital items (e.g., where the 
registrant is required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet 
rapid delivery requirements of customers or to assure itself of a 
continuous allotment of goods from suppliers; where the registrant 
provides rights to return merchandise; or where the registrant has 
provided extended payment terms to customers).
    (vii) The dependence of the segment upon a single customer, or a few 
customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a material 
adverse effect on the segment. The name of any customer and its 
relationship, if any, with the registrant or its subsidiaries shall be 
disclosed if sales to the customer by one or more segments are made in 
an aggregate amount equal to 10 percent or more of the registrant's 
consolidated revenues and the loss of such customer would have a 
material adverse effect on the registrant and its subsidiaries taken as 
a whole. The names of other customers may be included, unless in the 
particular case the effect of including the names would be misleading. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a group of customers under common 
control or customers that are affiliates of each other shall be regarded 
as a single customer.
    (viii) The dollar amount of backlog orders believed to be firm, as 
of a recent date and as of a comparable date in the preceding fiscal 
year, together with an indication of the portion thereof not reasonably 
expected to be filled within the current fiscal year, and seasonal or 
other material aspects of the

[[Page 346]]

backlog. (There may be included as firm orders government orders that 
are firm but not yet funded and contracts awarded but not yet signed, 
provided an appropriate statement is added to explain the nature of such 
orders and the amount thereof. The portion of orders already included in 
sales or operating revenues on the basis of percentage of completion or 
program accounting shall be excluded.)
    (ix) A description of any material portion of the business that may 
be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or 
subcontracts at the election of the Government.
    (x) Competitive conditions in the business involved including, where 
material, the identity of the particular markets in which the registrant 
competes, an estimate of the number of competitors and the registrant's 
competitive position, if known or reasonably available to the 
registrant. Separate consideration shall be given to the principal 
products or services or classes of products or services of the segment, 
if any. Generally, the names of competitors need not be disclosed. The 
registrant may include such names, unless in the particular case the 
effect of including the names would be misleading. Where, however, the 
registrant knows or has reason to know that one or a small number of 
competitors is dominant in the industry it shall be identified. The 
principal methods of competition (e.g., price, service, warranty or 
product performance) shall be identified, and positive and negative 
factors pertaining to the competitive position of the registrant, to the 
extent that they exist, shall be explained if known or reasonably 
available to the registrant.
    (xi) If material, the estimated amount spent during each of the last 
three fiscal years on company-sponsored research and development 
activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. In addition, state, if material, the estimated dollar amount 
spent during each of such years on customer-sponsored research 
activities relating to the development of new products, services or 
techniques or the improvement of existing products, services or 
techniques.
    (xii) Appropriate disclosure also shall be made as to the material 
effects that compliance with Federal, State and local provisions which 
have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into 
the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the 
environment, may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings and 
competitive position of the registrant and its subsidiaries. The 
registrant shall disclose any material estimated capital expenditures 
for environmental control facilities for the remainder of its current 
fiscal year and its succeeding fiscal year and for such further periods 
as the registrant may deem materials.
    (xiii) The number of persons employed by the registrant.
    (d) Financial information about geographic areas. (1) State for each 
of the registrant's last three fiscal years, or for each fiscal year the 
registrant has been engaged in business, whichever period is shorter:
    (i) Revenues from external customers attributed to:
    (A) The registrant's country of domicile;
    (B) All foreign countries, in total, from which the registrant 
derives revenues; and
    (C) Any individual foreign country, if material. Disclose the basis 
for attributing revenues from external customers to individual 
countries.
    (ii) Long-lived assets, other than financial instruments, long-term 
customer relationships of a financial institution, mortgage and other 
servicing rights, deferred policy acquisition costs, and deferred tax 
assets, located in:
    (A) The registrant's country of domicile;
    (B) All foreign countries, in total, in which the registrant holds 
assets; and
    (C) Any individual foreign country, if material.
    (2) A registrant shall report the amounts based on the financial 
information that it uses to produce the general-purpose financial 
statements. If providing the geographic information is impracticable, 
the registrant shall disclose that fact. A registrant may

[[Page 347]]

wish to provide, in addition to the information required by paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, subtotals of geographic information about groups 
of countries. To the extent that the disclosed information conforms with 
generally accepted accounting principles, the registrant may include in 
its financial statements a cross reference to this data in lieu of 
presenting duplicative data in its financial statements; conversely, a 
registrant may cross-reference to the financial statements.
    (3) A registrant shall describe any risks attendant to the foreign 
operations and any dependence on one or more of the registrant's 
segments upon such foreign operations, unless it would be more 
appropriate to discuss this information in connection with the 
description of one or more of the registrant's segments under paragraph 
(c) of this item.
    (4) If the registrant includes, or is required by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210), to include, interim financial statements, 
discuss any facts relating to the information furnished under this 
paragraph (d) that, in the opinion of management, indicate that the 
three year financial data for geographic areas may not be indicative of 
current or future operations. To the extent necessary to the discussion, 
include comparative information.
    (e) Available information. Disclose the following in any 
registration statement you file under the Securities Act of 1933:
    (1) Whether you file reports with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. If you are reporting company, identify the reports and other 
information you file with the SEC.
    (2) That the public may read and copy any materials you file with 
the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20549. State that the public may obtain information on 
the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-
SEC-0330. If you are an electronic filer, state that the SEC maintains 
an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information 
statements, and other information regarding issuers that file 
electronically with the SEC and state the address of that site (http://
www.sec.gov). You are encouraged to give your Internet address, if 
available;
    (f) Reports to security holders. Disclose the following information 
in any registration statement you file under the Securities Act:
    (1) If the SEC's proxy rules or regulations, or stock exchange 
requirements, do not require you to send an annual report to security 
holders or to holders of American depository receipts, describe briefly 
the nature and frequency of reports that you will give to security 
holders. Specify whether the reports that you give will contain 
financial information that has been examined and reported on, with an 
opinion expressed ``by'' an independent public or certified public 
accountant.
    (2) For a foreign private issuer, if the report will not contain 
financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles, you must state whether the report will 
include a reconciliation of this information with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.
    (g) Enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons. 
Disclose the following if you are a foreign private issuer filing a 
registration statement under the Securities Act:
    (1) Whether or not investors may bring actions under the civil 
liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws against the 
foreign private issuer, any of its officers and directors who are 
residents of a foreign country, any underwriters or experts named in the 
registration statement that are residents of a foreign country, and 
whether investors may enforce these civil liability provisions when the 
assets of the issuer or these other persons are located outside of the 
United States. The disclosure must address the following matters:
    (i) The investor's ability to effect service of process within the 
United States on the foreign private issuer or any person;
    (ii) The investor's ability to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. 
courts against foreign persons based upon the civil liability provisions 
of the U.S. Federal securities laws;
    (iii) The investor's ability to enforce, in an appropriate foreign 
court, judgments of U.S. courts based upon the

[[Page 348]]

civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws; and
    (iv) The investor's ability to bring an original action in an 
appropriate foreign court to enforce liabilities against the foreign 
private issuer or any person based upon the U.S. Federal securities 
laws.
    (2) If you provide this disclosure based on an opinion of counsel, 
name counsel in the prospectus and file as an exhibit to the 
registration statement a signed consent of counsel to the use of its 
name and opinion.

Instructions to Item 101: 1. In determining what information about the 
segments is material to an understanding of the registrant's business 
taken as a whole and therefore required to be disclosed, pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this Item, the registrant should take into account both 
quantitative and qualitative factors such as the significance of the 
matter to the registrant (e.g., whether a matter with a relatively minor 
impact on the registrant's business is represented by management to be 
important to its future profitability), the pervasiveness of the matter 
(e.g., whether it affects or may affect numerous items in the segment 
information), and the impact of the matter (e.g., whether it distorts 
the trends reflected in the segment information). Situations may arise 
when information should be disclosed about a segment, althought the 
information in quantitative terms may not appear significant to the 
registrant's business taken as a whole.
    2. Base the determination of whether information about segments is 
required for a particular year upon an evaluation of interperiod 
comparability. For instance, interperiod comparability would require a 
registrant to report segment information in the current period even if 
not material under the criteria for reportability of SFAS No. 131 if a 
segment has been significant in the immediately preceding period and the 
registrant expects it to be significant in the future.
    3. The Commission, upon written request of the registrant and where 
consistent with the protection of investors, may permit the omission of 
any of the information required by this Item or the furnishing in 
substitution thereof of appropriate information of comparable character.

[47 FR 11401, Mar. 16, 1982, as amended at 63 FR 6381, Feb. 6, 1998; 64

Sec. 229.102  (Item 102) Description of property.

    State briefly the location and general character of the principal 
plants, mines and other materially important physical properties of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries. In addition, identify the segment(s), 
as reported in the financial statements, that use the properties 
described. If any such property is not held in fee or is held subject to 
any major encumbrance, so state and describe briefly how held.

Instructions to Item 102: 1. What is required is such information as 
reasonably will inform investors as to the suitability, adequacy, 
productive capacity and extent of utilization of the facilities by the 
registrant. Detailed descriptions of the physical characteristics of 
individual properties or legal descriptions by metes and bounds are not 
required and shall not be given.
    2. In determining whether properties should be described, the 
registrant should take into account both quantitative and qualitative 
factors. See Instruction 1 to Item 101 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.101).
    3. In the case of an extractive enterprise, material information 
shall be given as to production, reserves, locations, development and 
the nature of the registrant's interest. If individual properties are of 
major significance to an industry segment:
    A. More detailed information concerning these matters shall be 
furnished; and
    B. Appropriate maps shall be used to disclose location data of 
significant properties except in cases for which numerous maps would be 
required.
    4. A. If reserve estimates are referred to in the document, the 
staff of the Office of Engineering, Division of Corporation Finance of 
the Commission, shall be consulted. That Office may request that a copy 
of the full report of the engineer or other expert who estimated the 
reserves be furnished as supplemental information and not as part of the 
filing. See Rule 418 of Regulation C (Sec. 230.418 of this chapter) and 
Rule 12b-4 of Regulation 12B (Sec. 240.12b-4 of this chapter) with 
respect to the submission to, and return by, the Commission of 
supplemental information.
    B. If the estimates of reserves, or any estimated valuation thereof, 
are represented as being based on estimates prepared or reviewed by 
independent consultants, those independent consultants shall be named in 
the document.
    5. Estimates of oil or gas reserves other than proved or, in the 
case of other extractive reserves, estimates other than proved or 
probable reserves, and any estimated values of such reserves shall not 
be disclosed in any document publicly filed with the Commission, unless 
such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign 
or state law; provided, however, that where such estimates previously 
have been provided to a person (or any of its affiliates)

[[Page 349]]

that is offering to acquire, merge or consolidate with the registrant or 
otherwise to acquire the registrant's securities, such estimates may be 
included in documents relating to such acquisition.
    6. The definitions in Sec. 210.4-10(a) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 
210] shall apply to this Item with respect to oil and gas operations.

Sec. 229.103  (Item 103) Legal proceedings.

    Describe briefly any material pending legal proceedings, other than 
ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the 
registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of 
their property is the subject. Include the name of the court or agency 
in which the proceedings are pending, the date instituted, the principal 
parties thereto, a description of the factual basis alleged to underlie 
the proceeding and the relief sought. Include similar information as to 
any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental 
authorities.

Instructions to Item 103: 1. If the business ordinarily results in 
actions for negligence or other claims, no such action or claim need be 
described unless it departs from the normal kind of such actions.
    2. No information need be given with respect to any proceeding that 
involves primarily a claim for damages if the amount involved, exclusive 
of interest and costs, does not exceed 10 percent of the current assets 
of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. However, 
if any proceeding presents in large degree the same legal and factual 
issues as other proceedings pending or known to be contemplated, the 
amount involved in such other proceedings shall be included in computing 
such percentage.
    3. Notwithstanding Instructions 1 and 2, any material bankruptcy, 
receivership, or similar proceeding with respect to the registrant or 
any of its significant subsidiaries shall be described.
    4. Any material proceedings to which any director, officer or 
affiliate of the registrant, any owner of record or beneficially of more 
than five percent of any class of voting securities of the registrant, 
or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate of the 
registrant, or security holder is a party adverse to the registrant or 
any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the 
registrant or any of its subsidiaries also shall be described.
    5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an administrative or judicial 
proceeding (including, for purposes of A and B of this Instruction, 
proceedings which present in large degree the same issues) arising under 
any Federal, State or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted 
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primary 
for the purpose of protecting the environment shall not be deemed 
``ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business'' and shall be 
described if:
    A. Such proceeding is material to the business or financial 
condition of the registrant;
    B. Such proceeding involves primarily a claim for damages, or 
involves potential monetary sanctions, capital expenditures, deferred 
charges or charges to income and the amount involved, exclusive of 
interest and costs, exceeds 10 percent of the current assets of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; or
    C. A governmental authority is a party to such proceeding and such 
proceeding involves potential monetary sanctions, unless the registrant 
reasonably believes that such proceeding will result in no monetary 
sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of 
less than $100,000; provided, however, that such proceedings which are 
similar in nature may be grouped and described generically.

              Subpart 229.200--Securities of the Registrant


<R05>
Sec. 229.201  (Item 201) Market price of and dividends on the registrant's common equity and related stockholder matters.

    (a) Market information. (1)(i) Identify the principal United States 
market or markets in which each class of the registrant's common equity 
is being traded. Where there is no established public trading market for 
a class of common equity, furnish a statement to that effect. For 
purposes of this Item the existence of limited or sporadic quotations 
should not of itself be deemed to constitute an ``established public 
trading market.'' In the case of foreign registrants, also identify the 
principal established foreign public trading market, if any, for each 
class of the registrant's common equity.
    (ii) If the principal United States market for such common equity is 
an exchange, state the high and low sales prices for the equity for each 
full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years and any 
subsequent interim period for which financial

[[Page 350]]

statements are included, or are required to be included by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210], as reported in the consolidated transaction 
reporting system or, if not so reported, as reported on the principal 
exchange market for such equity.
    (iii) If the principal United States market for such common equity 
is not an exchange, state the range of high and low bid information for 
the equity for each full quarterly period within the two most recent 
fiscal years and any subsequent interim period for which financial 
statements are included, or are required to be included by Article 3 of 
Regulation S-X, as regularly quoted in the automated quotation system of 
a registered securities association, or where the equity is not quoted 
in such a system, the range of reported high and low bid quotations, 
indicating the source of such quotations. Indicate, as applicable, that 
such over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, 
without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily 
represent actual transactions. Where there is an absence of an 
established public trading market, reference to quotations shall be 
qualified by appropriate explanation.
    (iv) Where a foreign registrant has identified a principal 
established foreign trading market for its common equity pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this Item, also provide market price information 
comparable, to the extent practicable, to that required for the 
principal United States market, including the source of such 
information. Such prices shall be stated in the currency in which they 
are quoted. The registrant may translate such prices into United States 
currency at the currency exchange rate in effect on the date the price 
disclosed was reported on the foreign exchange. If the primary United 
States market for the registrant's common equity trades using American 
Depositary Receipts, the United States prices disclosed shall be on that 
basis.
    (v) If the information called for by this Item is being presented in 
a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act or a proxy 
or information statement filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, the 
document also shall include price information as of the latest 
practicable date, and, in the case of securities to be issued in 
connection with an acquisition, business combination or other 
reorganization, as of the date immediately prior to the public 
announcement of such transaction.
    (2) If the information called for by this paragraph (a) is being 
presented in a registration statement on Form S-1 (Sec. 239.11 of this 
chapter) or Form SB-2 (Sec. 239.28 of this chapter) under the Securities 
Act or on Form 10 and Form 10-SB (Sec. 249.210 of this chapter) under 
the Exchange Act relating to a class of common equity for which at the 
time of filing there is no established United States public trading 
market, indicate the amount(s) of common equity (i) that is subject to 
outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible 
into, common equity of the registrant; (ii) that could be sold pursuant 
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act [Sec. 230.144 of this chapter] or 
that the registrant has agreed to register under the Securities Act for 
sale by security holders; or (iii) that is being, or has been publicly 
proposed to be, publicly offered by the registrant (unless such common 
equity is being offered pursuant to an employee benefit plan or dividend 
reinvestment plan), the offering of which could have a material effect 
on the market price of the registrant's common equity.
    (b) Holders. (1) Set forth the approximate number of holders of each 
class of common equity of the registrant as of the latest practicable 
date.
    (2) If the information called for by this paragraph (b) is being 
presented in a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities 
Act or a proxy statement or information statement filed pursuant to the 
Exchange Act that relates to an acquisition, business combination or 
other reorganization, indicate the effect of such transaction on the 
amount and percentage of present holdings of the registrant's common 
equity owned beneficially by (i) any person (including any group as that 
term is used in section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) who is known to 
the registrant to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of 
any class of the registrant's common equity and (ii)

[[Page 351]]

each director and nominee and (iii) all directors and officers as a 
group, and the registrant's present commitments to such persons with 
respect to the issuance of shares of any class of its common equity.
    (c) Dividends. (1) State the frequency and amount of any cash 
dividends declared on each class of its common equity by the registrant 
for the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period 
for which financial statements are required to be presented by 
Sec. 210.3 of Regulation S-X. Where there are restrictions (including, 
where appropriate, restrictions on the ability of registrant's 
subsidiaries to transfer funds to the registrant in the form of cash 
dividends, loans or advances) that currently materially limit the 
registrant's ability to pay such dividends or that the registrant 
reasonably believes are likely to limit materially the future payment of 
dividends on the common equity so state and either (i) describe briefly 
(where appropriate quantify) such restrictions, or (ii) cross reference 
to the specific discussion of such restrictions in the Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and operating results 
prescribed by Item 303 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.303) and the 
description of such restrictions required by Regulation S-X in the 
registrant's financial statements.
    (2) Where registrants have a record of paying no cash dividends 
although earnings indicate an ability to do so, they are encouraged to 
consider the question of their intention to pay cash dividends in the 
foreseeable future and, if no such intention exists, to make a statement 
of that fact in the filing. Registrants which have a history of paying 
cash dividends also are encouraged to indicate whether they currently 
expect that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the 
future and, if not, the nature of the change in the amount or rate of 
cash dividend payments.

Instructions to Item 201: 1. Registrants, the common equity of which is 
listed for trading on more than one securities exchange registered under 
the Exchange Act, are required to indicate each such exchange pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this Item; such registrants, however, need 
only report one set of price quotations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
of this Item; where available, these shall be the prices as reported in 
the consolidated transaction reporting system and, where the prices are 
not so reported, the prices on the most significant (in terms of volume) 
securities exchange for such shares.
    2. Market prices and dividends reported pursuant to this Item shall 
be adjusted to give retroactive effect to material changes resulting 
from stock dividends, stock splits and reverse stock splits.
    3. The computation of the approximate number of holders of 
registrant's common equity may be based upon the number of record 
holders or also may include individual participants in security position 
listings. See Rule 17Ad-8 under the Exchange Act. The method of 
computation that is chosen shall be indicated.
    4. If the registrant is a foreign issuer, describe briefly:
    A. Any governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the country in 
which the registrant is organized that restrict the export or import of 
capital, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange controls, or 
that affect the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident 
holders of the registrant's common equity; and
    B. All taxes, including withholding provisions, to which United 
States common equity holders are subject under existing laws and 
regulations of the foreign country in which the registrant is organized. 
Include a brief description of pertinent provisions of any reciprocal 
tax treaty between such foreign country and the United States regarding 
withholding. If there is no such treaty, so state.
    5. If the registrant is a foreign private issuer whose common equity 
of the class being registered is wholly or partially in bearer form, the 
response to this Item shall so indicate together with as much 
information as the registrant is able to provide with respect to 
security holdings in the United States. If the securities being 
registered trade in the United States in the form of American Depositary 
Receipts or similar certificates, the response to this Item shall so 
indicate together with the name of the depositary issuing such receipts 
and the number of shares or other units of the underlying

[[Page 352]]

security representing the trading units in such receipts.

Sec. 229.202  (Item 202) Description of registrant's securities.

    Note: If the securities being described have been accepted for 
listing on an exchange, the exchange may be identified. The document 
should not however, convey the impression that the registrant may apply 
successfully for listing of the securities on an exchange or that, in 
the case of an underwritten offering, the underwriters may request the 
registrant to apply for such listing, unless there is reasonable

securities exchange for listing.

it improbable that liability under such state statues would be imposed; 
(x) any restriction on alienability of the securities to be registered; 
and (xi) any provision discriminating against any existing or 
prospective holder of such securities as a result of such security 
holder owning a substantial amount of securities.
    (2) If the rights of holders of such stock may be modified otherwise 
than by a vote of a majority or more of the shares outstanding, voting 
as a class, so state and explain briefly.

reorganization, tender offer, sale or transfer of substantially all of 
its assets, or liquidation. Provisions and arrangements required by law 
or imposed by governmental or judicial authority need not be described 
or discussed pursuant to this paragraph (a)(5). Provisions or

accordance with Instruction 1 to this Item, set forth the aggregate 
amount of outstanding indebtedness as of the most recent practicable 
date that by the terms of such debt securities would be senior to such 
subordinated debt and describe briefly any limitation on the issuance of 
such additional senior indebtedness or state that there is no such 
limitation;
    (4) Provisions restricting the declaration of dividends or requiring 
the maintenance of any asset ratio or the creation or maintenance of 
reserves;
    (5) Provisions restricting the incurrence of additional debt or the 
issuance of additional securities; in the case of secured debt, whether 
the securities being registered are to be issued on the basis of 
unbonded bondable property, the deposit of cash or otherwise; as of the 
most recent practicable date, the approximate amount of unbonded 
bondable property available as a basis for the issuance of bonds; 
provisions permitting the withdrawal of cash deposited as a basis for 
the issuance of bonds; and provisions permitting the release or 
substitution of assets securing the issue; Provided, however, That

securities all of which will be retired, provided appropriate steps to 
ensure such retirement will be completed prior to or upon delivery by 
the registrant of the securities;
    (9) If debt securities are to be offered at a price such that they 
will be deemed to be offered at an ``original issue discount'' as 
defined in paragraph (a) of section 1273 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(26 U.S.C. 1273), or if a debt security is sold in a package with 
another security and the allocation of the offering price between the 
two securities may have the effect of offering the debt security at such 
an original issue discount, the tax effects thereof pursuant to sections 
1271-1278;
    (10) The name of the trustee(s) and the nature of any material 
relationship with the registrant or with any of its affiliates; the

business operations, that materially affect the comparability of the 
information

[[Page 356]]

registrant's future financial condition or results of operations.
    3. All references to the registrant in the table of selected

<R05>
Sec. 229.303  (Item 303) Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

    (a) Full fiscal years. Discuss registrant's financial condition, 
changes in financial condition and results of operations. The discussion 
shall provide information as specified in paragraphs (a) (1), (2) and 
(3) with respect to liquidity, capital resources and results of 
operations and also shall provide such other information that the 
registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial 
condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. 
Discussions of liquidity and capital resources may be combined whenever 
the two topics are interrelated. Where in the registrant's judgment a 
discussion of segment information or of other subdivisions of the 
registrant's business would be appropriate to an understanding of such 
business, the discussion shall focus on each relevant, reportable 
segment or other subdivision of the business and on the registrant as a 
whole.
    (1) Liquidity. Identify any known trends or any known demands, 
commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are 
reasonably likely to result in the registrant's liquidity increasing or 
decreasing in any material way. If a material deficiency is identified, 
indicate the course of action that the registrant has taken or proposes 
to take to remedy the deficiency. Also identify and separately describe 
internal and external sources of liquidity, and briefly discuss any 
material unused sources of liquid assets.
    (2) Capital resources. (i) Describe the registrant's material 
commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal 
period, and indicate the general purpose of such commitments and the 
anticipated source of funds needed to fulfill such commitments.
    (ii) Describe any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, 
in the registrant's capital resources. Indicate any expected material 
changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. The discussion 
shall consider changes between equity, debt and any off-balance sheet 
financing arrangements.
    (3) Results of operations. (i) Describe any unusual or infrequent 
events or transactions or any significant economic changes that 
materially affected the amount of reported income from continuing 
operations and, in each case, indicate the extent to which income was so 
affected. In addition, describe any other significant components of 
revenues or expenses that, in

[[Page 359]]

the registrant's judgment, should be described in order to understand 
the registrant's results of operations.
    (ii) Describe any known trends or uncertainties that have had or 
that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or 
unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing 
operations. If the registrant knows of events that will cause a material 
change in the relationship between costs and revenues (such as known 
future increases in costs of labor or materials or price increases or 
inventory adjustments), the change in the relationship shall be 
disclosed.
    (iii) To the extent that the financial statements disclose material 
increases in net sales or revenues, provide a narrative discussion of 
the extent to which such increases are attributable to increases in 
prices or to increases in the volume or amount of goods or services 
being sold or to the introduction of new products or services.
    (iv) For the three most recent fiscal years of the registrant, or 
for those fiscal years beginning after December 25, 1979, or for those 
fiscal years in which the registrant has been engaged in business, 
whichever period is shortest, discuss the impact of inflation and 
changing prices on the registrant's net sales and revenues and on income 
from continuing operations.

Instructions to Paragraph 303(a): 1. The registrant's discussion and 
analysis shall be of the financial statements and of other statistical 
data that the registrant believes will enhance a reader's understanding 
of its financial condition, changes in financial condition and results 
of operations. Generally, the discussion shall cover the three year 
period covered by the financial statements and shall use year-to-year 
comparisons or any other formats that in the registrant's judgment 
enhance a reader's understanding. However, where trend information is 
relevant, reference to the five year selected financial data appearing 
pursuant to Item 301 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.301) may be necessary.
    2. The purpose of the discussion and analysis shall be to provide to 
investors and other users information relevant to an assessment of the 
financial condition and results of operations of the registrant as 
determined by evaluating the amounts and certainty of cash flows from 
operations and from outside sources. The information provided pursuant 
to this Item need only include that which is available to the registrant 
without undue effort or expense and which does not clearly appear in the 
registrant's financial statements.
    3. The discussion and analysis shall focus specifically on material 
events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported 
financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future 
operating results or of future financial condition. This would include 
descriptions and amounts of (A) matters that would have an impact on 
future operations and have not had an impact in the past, and (B) 
matters that have had an impact on reported operations and are not 
expected to have an impact upon future operations.
    4. Where the consolidated financial statements reveal material 
changes from year to year in one or more line items, the causes for the 
changes shall be described to the extent necesary to an understanding of 
the registrant's businesses as a whole; Provided, however, That if the 
causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no 
repetition is required and a line-by-line analysis of the financial 
statements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate. 
Registrants need not recite the amounts of changes from year to year 
which are readily computable from the financial statements. The 
discussion shall not merely repeat numerical data contained in the 
consolidated financial statements.
    5. The term ``liquidity'' as used in this Item refers to the ability 
of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the 
enterprise's needs for cash. Except where it is otherwise clear from the 
discussion, the registrant shall indicate those balance sheet conditions 
or income or cash flow items which the registrant believes may be 
indicators of its liquidity condition. Liquidity generally shall be 
discussed on both a long-term and short-term basis. The issue of 
liquidity shall be discussed in the context of the registrant's own 
business or businesses. For example a discussion of working capital may 
be appropriate for certain manufacturing, industrial or related 
operations but might be inappropriate for a bank or public utility.
    6. Where financial statements presented or incorporated by reference 
in the registration statement are required by Sec. 210.4-08(e)(3) of 
Regulation S-X [17 CFR part 210] to include disclosure of restrictions 
on the ability of both consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries to 
transfer funds to the registrant in the form of cash dividends, loans or 
advances, the discussion of liquidity shall include a discussion of the 
nature and extent of such restrictions and the impact such restrictions 
have had and are expected to have on the ability of the parent company 
to meet its cash obligations.

[[Page 360]]

    7. Registrants are encouraged, but not required, to supply forward-
looking information. This is to be distinguished from presently known 
data which will impact upon future operating results, such as known 
future increases in costs of labor or materials. This latter data may be 
required to be disclosed. Any forward-looking information supplied is 
expressly covered by the safe harbor rule for projections. See Rule 175 
under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.175], Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange 
Act [17 CFR 240.3b-6] and Securities Act Release No. 6084 (June 25, 
1979) (44 FR 38810).
    8. Registrants are only required to discuss the effects of inflation 
and other changes in prices when considered material. This discussion 
may be made in whatever manner appears appropriate under the 
circumstances. All that is required is a brief textual presentation of 
management's views. No specific numerical financial data need be 
presented except as Rule 3-20(c) of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.3-20(c) of 
this chapter) otherwise requires. However, registrants may elect to 
voluntarily disclose supplemental information on the effects of changing 
prices as provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 89, ``Financial Reporting and Changing Prices'' or through other 
supplemental disclosures. The Commission encourages experimentation with 
these disclosures in order to provide the most meaningful presentation 
of the impact of price changes on the registrant's financial statements.
    9. Registrants that elect to disclose supplementary information on 
the effects of changing prices as specified by SFAS No. 89, ``Financial 
Reporting and Changing Prices,'' may combine such explanations with the 
discussion and analysis required pursuant to this Item or may supply 
such information separately with appropriate cross reference.
    10. All references to the registrant in the discussion and in this 
Item shall mean the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated.
    11. Foreign private registrants also shall discuss briefly any 
pertinent governmental economic, fiscal, monetary, or political policies 
or factors that have materially affected or could materially affect, 
directly or indirectly, their operations or investments by United States 
nationals.
    12. If the registrant is a foreign private issuer, the discussion 
shall focus on the primary financial statements presented in the 
registration statement or report. There shall be a reference to the 
reconciliation to United States generally accepted accounting 
principles, and a discussion of any aspects of the difference between 
foreign and United States generally accepted accounting principles, not 
discussed in the reconciliation, that the registrant believes is 
necessary for an understanding of the financial statements as a whole.

    (b) Interim periods. If interim period financial statements are 
included or are required to be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X 
(17 CFR 210), a management's discussion and analysis of the financial 
condition and results of operations shall be provided so as to enable 
the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results 
of operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (b) (1) and 
(2) of this Item. The discussion and analysis shall include a discussion 
of material changes in those items specifically listed in paragraph (a) 
of this Item, except that the impact of inflation and changing prices on 
operations for interim periods need not be addressed.
    (1) Material changes in financial condition. Discuss any material 
changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year 
to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the 
interim financial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the 
corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material 
changes in financial condition from that date to the date of the most 
recent interim balance sheet provided also shall be discussed. If 
discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim 
date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be 
combined at the discretion of the registrant.
    (2) Material changes in results of operations. Discuss any material 
changes in the registrant's results of operations with respect to the 
most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is 
provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding 
fiscal year. If the registrant is required to or has elected to provide 
an income statement for the most recent fiscal quarter, such discussion 
also shall cover material changes with respect to that fiscal quarter 
and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year. In 
addition, if the registrant has elected to provide an income statement 
for the twelve-month period ended as of the date of the most recent 
interim balance sheet provided, the discussion also shall cover material 
changes with respect to that twelve-month period and the twelve-month 
period ended as of the

[[Page 361]]

corresponding interim balance sheet date of the preceding fiscal year. 
Notwithstanding the above, if for purposes of a registration statement a 
registrant subject to paragraph (b) of Sec. 210.3-03 of Regulation S-X 
provides a statement of income for the twelve-month period ended as of 
the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided in lieu of 
the interim income statements otherwise required, the discussion of 
material changes in that twelve-month period will be in respect to the 
preceding fiscal year rather than the corresponding preceding period.

Instructions to Paragraph (b) of Item 303: 1. If interim financial 
statements are presented together with financial statements for full 
fiscal years, the discussion of the interim financial information shall 
be prepared pursuant to this paragraph (b) and the discussion of the 
full fiscal year's information shall be prepared pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this Item. Such discussions may be combined.
    2. In preparing the discussion and analysis required by this 
paragraph (b), the registrant may presume that users of the interim 
financial information have read or have access to the discussion and 
analysis required by paragraph (a) for the preceding fiscal year.
    3. The discussion and analysis required by this paragraph (b) is 
required to focus only on material changes. Where the interim financial 
statements reveal material changes from period to period in one or more 
significant line items, the causes for the changes shall be described if 
they have not already been disclosed: Provided, however, That if the 
causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no 
repetition is required. Registrants need not recite the amounts of 
changes from period to period which are readily computable from the 
financial statements. The discussion shall not merely repeat numerical 
data contained in the financial statements. The information provided 
shall include that which is available to the registrant without undue 
effort or expense and which does not clearly appear in the registrant's 
condensed interim financial statements.
    4. The registrant's discussion of material changes in results of 
operations shall identify any significant elements of the registrant's 
income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from or are 
not necessarily representative of the registrant's ongoing business.
    5. The registrant shall discuss any seasonal aspects of its business 
which have had a material effect upon its financial condition or results 
of operation.
    6. Registrants are encouraged but are not required to discuss 
forward-looking information. Any forward-looking information supplied is 
expressly covered by the safe harbor rule for projections. See Rule 175 
under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230. 175], Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange 
Act [17 CFR 249.3b-6] and Securities Act Release No. 6084 (June 25, 
1979) (44 FR 38810).

Sec. 229.304  (Item 304) Changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.

    (a)(1) If during the registrant's two most recent fiscal years or 
any subsequent interim period, an independent accountant who was 
previously engaged as the principal accountant to audit the registrant's 
financial statements, or an independent accountant who was previously 
engaged to audit a significant subsidiary and on whom the principal 
accountant expressed reliance in its report, has resigned (or indicated 
it has declined to stand for re-election after the completion of the 
current audit) or was dismissed, then the registrant shall:
    (i) State whether the former accountant resigned, declined to stand 
for re-election or was dismissed and the date thereof.
    (ii) State whether the principal accountant's report on the 
financial statements for either of the past two years contained an 
adverse opinion or a

[[Page 362]]

disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified or modified as to uncertainty, 
audit scope, or accounting principles; and also describe the nature of 
each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, modification, or 
qualification.
    (iii) State whether the decision to change accountants was 
recommended or approved by:
    (A) Any audit or similar committee of the board of directors, if the 
issuer has such a committee; or
    (B) The board of directors, if the issuer has no such committee.
    (iv) State whether during the registrant's two most recent fiscal 
years and any subsequent interim period preceding such resignation, 
declination or dismissal there were any disagreements with the former 
accountant on any matter of accounting principles or practices, 
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which 
disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former 
accountant, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter 
of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report. Also, (A) describe 
each such disagreement; (B) state whether any audit or similar committee 
of the board of directors, or the board of directors, discussed the 
subject matter of each of such disagreements with the former accountant; 
and (C) state whether the registrant has authorized the former 
accountant to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor accountant 
concerning the subject matter of each of such disagreements and, if not, 
describe the nature of any limitation thereon and the reason therefore. 
The disagreements required to be reported in response to this Item 
include both those resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction and 
those not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. 
Disagreements contemplated by this Item are those that occur at the 
decision-making level, i.e., between personnel of the registrant 
responsible for presentation of its financial statements and personnel 
of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report.
    (v) Provide the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
Item for each of the kinds of events (even though the registrant and the 
former accountant did not express a difference of opinion regarding the 
event) listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v) (A) through (D) of this section, 
that occurred within the registrant's two most recent fiscal years and 
any subsequent interim period preceding the former accountant's 
resignation, declination to stand for re-election, or dismissal 
(``reportable events''). If the event led to a disagreement or 
difference of opinion, then the event should be reported as a 
disagreement under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) and need not be repeated under 
this paragraph.
    (A) The accountant's having advised the registrant that the internal 
controls necessary for the registrant to develop reliable financial 
statements do not exist;
    (B) The accountant's having advised the registrant that information 
has come to the accountant's attention that has led it to no longer be 
able to rely on management's representations, or that has made it 
unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by 
management;
    (C) (1) The accountant's having advised the registrant of the need 
to expand significantly the scope of its audit, or that information has 
come to the accountant's attention during the time period covered by 
Item 304(a)(1)(iv), that if further investigated may:
    (i) Materially impact the fairness or reliability of either: a 
previously issued audit report or the underlying financial statements; 
or the financial statements issued or to be issued covering the fiscal 
period(s) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements 
covered by an audit report (including information that may prevent it 
from rendering an unqualified audit report on those financial 
statements), or
    (ii) Cause it to be unwilling to rely on management's 
representations or be associated with the registrant's financial 
statements, and
    (2) Due to the accountant's resignation (due to audit scope 
limitations or otherwise) or dismissal, or for any other reason, the 
accountant did not so expand the scope of its audit or conduct such 
further investigation; or

[[Page 363]]

    (D)(1) The accountant's having advised the registrant that 
information has come to the accountant's attention that it has concluded 
materially impacts the fairness or reliability of either (i) a 
previously issued audit report or the underlying financial statements, 
or (ii) the financial statements issued or to be issued covering the 
fiscal period(s) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial 
statements covered by an audit report (including information that, 
unless resolved to the accountant's satisfaction, would prevent it from 
rendering an unqualified audit report on those financial statements), 
and
    (2) Due to the accountant's resignation, dismissal or declination to 
stand for re-election, or for any other reason, the issue has not been 
resolved to the accountant's satisfaction prior to its resignation, 
dismissal or declination to stand for re-election.
    (2) If during the registrant's two most recent fiscal years or any 
subsequent interim period, a new independent accountant has been engaged 
as either the principal accountant to audit the registrant's financial 
statements, or as an independent accountant to audit a significant 
subsidiary and on whom the principal accountant is expected to express 
reliance in its report, then the registrant shall identify the newly 
engaged accountant and indicate the date of such accountant's 
engagement. In addition, if during the registrant's two most recent 
fiscal years, and any subsequent interim period prior to engaging that 
accountant, the registrant (or someone on its behalf) consulted the 
newly engaged accountant regarding:
    (i) Either: The application of accounting principles to a specified 
transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion 
that might be rendered on the registrant's financial statements, and 
either a written report was provided to the registrant or oral advice 
was provided that the new accountant concluded was an important factor 
considered by the registrant in reaching a decision as to the 
accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or
    (ii) Any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as 
defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) and the related instructions to this 
item) or a reportable event (as described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v)), 
then the registrant shall:
    (A) So state and identify the issues that were the subjects of those 
consultations;
    (B) Briefly describe the views of the newly engaged accountant as 
expressed orally or in writing to the registrant on each such issue and, 
if written views were received by the registrant, file them as an 
exhibit to the report or registration statement requiring compliance 
with this Item 304(a);
    (C) State whether the former accountant was consulted by the 
registrant regarding any such issues, and if so, provide a summary of 
the former accountant's views; and
    (D) Request the newly engaged accountant to review the disclosure 
required by this Item 304(a) before it is filed with the Commission and 
provide the new accountant the opportunity to furnish the registrant 
with a letter addressed to the Commission containing any new 
information, clarification of the registrant's expression of its views, 
or the respects in which it does not agree with the statements made by 
the registrant in response to Item 304(a). The registrant shall file any 
such letter as an exhibit to the report or registration statement 
containing the disclosure required by this Item.
    (3) The registrant shall provide the former accountant with a copy 
of the disclosures it is making in response to this Item 304(a) that the 
former accountant shall receive no later than the day that the 
disclosures are filed with the Commission. The registrant shall request 
the former accountant to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed 
to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by 
the registrant in response to this Item 304(a) and, if not, stating the 
respects in which it does not agree. The registrant shall file the 
former accountant's letter as an exhibit to the report on registration 
statement containing this disclosure. If the former accountant's letter 
is unavailable at the time of filing such report or registration 
statement, then the registrant shall request the former accountant to 
provide the letter as

[[Page 364]]

promptly as possible so that the registrant can file the letter with the 
Commission within ten business days after the filing of the report or 
registration statement. Notwithstanding the ten business day period, the 
registrant shall file the letter by amendment within two business days 
of receipt; if the letter is received on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday 
on which the Commission is not open for business, then the two business 
day period shall begin to run on and shall include the first business 
day thereafter. The former accountant may provide the registrant with an 
interim letter highlighting specific areas of concern and indicating 
that a more detailed letter will be forthcoming within the ten business 
day period noted above. If not filed with the report or registration 
statement containing the registrant's disclosure under this Item 304(a), 
then the interim letter, if any, shall be filed by the registrant by 
amendment within two business days of receipt.
    (b) If: (1) In connection with a change in accountants subject to 
paragraph (a) of this Item 304, there was any disagreement of the type 
described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) or any reportable event as described 
in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this Item;
    (2) During the fiscal year in which the change in accountants took 
place or during the subsequent fiscal year, there have been any 
transactions or events similar to those which involved such disagreement 
or reportable event; and
    (3) Such transactions or events were material and were accounted for 
or disclosed in a manner different from that which the former 
accountants apparently would have concluded was required, the registrant 
shall state the existence and nature of the disagreement or reportable 
event and also state the effect on the financial statements if the 
method had been followed which the former accountants apparently would 
have concluded was required.

These disclosures need not be made if the method asserted by the former 
accountants ceases to be generally accepted because of authoritative 
standards or interpretations subsequently issued.

Instructions to Item 304: 1. The disclosure called for by paragraph (a) 
of this Item need not be provided if it has been previously reported as 
that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-
2 of this chapter); the disclosure called for by paragraph (a) must be 
provided, however, notwithstanding prior disclosure, if required 
pursuant to Item 9 of Schedule 14A (Sec. 240.14a-101 of this chapter). 
The disclosure called for by paragraph (b) of this section must be 
furnished, where required, notwithstanding any prior disclosure about 
accountant changes or disagreements.
    2. When disclosure is required by paragraph (a) of this section in 
an annual report to security holders pursuant to Rule 14a-3 
(Sec. 240.14a-3 of this chapter) or Rule 14c-3 (Sec. 240.14c-3 of this 
chapter), or in a proxy or information statement filed pursuant to the 
requirements of Schedule 14A or 14C (Sec. 240.14a-101 or Sec. 240.14c-
101 of this chapter), in lieu of a letter pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(D) or (a)(3), prior to filing such materials with or furnishing 
such materials to the Commission, the registrant shall furnish the 
disclosure required by paragraph (a) of this section to any former 
accountant engaged by the registrant during the period set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section and to the newly engaged accountant. If 
any such accountant believes that the statements made in response to 
paragraph (a) of this section are incorrect or incomplete, it may 
present its views in a brief statement, ordinarily expected not to 
exceed 200 words, to be included in the annual report or proxy or 
information statement. This statement shall be submitted to the 
registrant within ten business days of the date the accountant receives 
the registrant's disclosure. Further, unless the written views of the 
newly engaged accountant required to be filed as an exhibit by paragraph 
(a)(2)(B) of this Item 304 have been previously filed with the 
Commission the registrant shall file a Form 8-K concurrently with the 
annual report or proxy or information statement for the purpose of 
filing the written views as exhibits thereto.
    3. The information required by Item 304(a) need not be provided for 
a company being acquired by the registrant that is not subject to the 
filing requirements of either section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act, or, because of section 12(i) of the Exchange Act, has not furnished 
an annual report to security holders pursuant to Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-
3 for its latest fiscal year.
    4. The term ``disagreements'' as used in this Item shall be 
interpreted broadly, to include any difference of opinion concerning

[[Page 365]]

any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement 
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which (if not resolved to the 
satisfaction of the former accountant) would have caused it to make 
reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with 
its report. It is not necessary for there to have been an argument to 
have had a disagreement, merely a difference of opinion. For purposes of 
this Item, however, the term disagreements does not include initial 
differences of opinion based on incomplete facts or preliminary 
information that were later resolved to the former accountant's 
satisfaction by, and providing the registrant and the accountant do not 
continue to have a difference of opinion upon, obtaining additional 
relevant facts or information.
    5. In determining whether any disagreement or reportable event has 
occurred, an oral communication from the engagement partner or another 
person responsible for rendering the accounting firm's opinion (or their 
designee) will generally suffice as the accountant advising the 
registrant of a reportable event or as a statement of a disagreement at 
the ``decision-making level'' within the accounting firm and require 
disclosure under this Item.

<R05>
Sec. 229.305  (Item 305) Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

    (a) Quantitative information about market risk. (1) Registrants 
shall provide, in their reporting currency, quantitative information 
about market risk as of the end of the latest fiscal year, in accordance 
with one of the following three disclosure alternatives. In preparing 
this quantitative information, registrants shall categorize market risk 
sensitive instruments into instruments entered into for trading purposes 
and instruments entered into for purposes other than trading purposes. 
Within both the trading and other than trading portfolios, separate 
quantitative information shall be presented, to the extent material, for 
each market risk exposure category (i.e., interest rate risk, foreign 
currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other relevant 
market risks, such as equity price risk). A registrant may use one of 
the three alternatives set forth in this section for all of the required 
quantitative disclosures about market risk. A registrant also may 
choose, from among the three alternatives, one disclosure alternative 
for market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
and another disclosure alternative for market risk sensitive instruments 
entered into for other than trading purposes. Alternatively, a 
registrant may choose any disclosure alternative, from among the three 
alternatives, for each risk exposure category within the trading and 
other than trading portfolios. The three disclosure alternatives are:
    (i)(A)(1) Tabular presentation of information related to market risk 
sensitive instruments; such information shall include fair values of the 
market risk sensitive instruments and contract terms sufficient to 
determine future cash flows from those instruments, categorized by 
expected maturity dates.
    (2) Tabular information relating to contract terms shall allow 
readers of the table to determine expected cash flows from the market 
risk sensitive instruments for each of the next five years. Comparable 
tabular information for any remaining years shall be displayed as an 
aggregate amount.
    (3) Within each risk exposure category, the market risk sensitive 
instruments shall be grouped based on common characteristics. Within the 
foreign currency exchange rate risk category, the market risk sensitive 
instruments shall be grouped by functional currency and within the 
commodity price risk category, the market risk sensitive instruments 
shall be grouped by type of commodity.
    (4) See the Appendix to this Item for a suggested format for 
presentation of this information; and
    (B) Registrants shall provide a description of the contents of the 
table and any related assumptions necessary to understand the 
disclosures required under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this Item 305; or
    (ii)(A) Sensitivity analysis disclosures that express the potential 
loss in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk 
sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical 
changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity 
prices, and other relevant market rates or prices over a selected

[[Page 366]]

period of time. The magnitude of selected hypothetical changes in rates 
or prices may differ among and within market risk exposure categories; 
and
    (B) Registrants shall provide a description of the model, 
assumptions, and parameters, which are necessary to understand the 
disclosures required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this Item 305; or
    (iii)(A) Value at risk disclosures that express the potential loss 
in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk sensitive 
instruments over a selected period of time, with a selected likelihood 
of occurrence, from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices;
    (B)(1) For each category for which value at risk disclosures are 
required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this Item 305, provide 
either:
    (i) The average, high and low amounts, or the distribution of the 
value at risk amounts for the reporting period; or
    (ii) The average, high and low amounts, or the distribution of 
actual changes in fair values, earnings, or cash flows from the market 
risk sensitive instruments occurring during the reporting period; or
    (iii) The percentage or number of times the actual changes in fair 
values, earnings, or cash flows from the market risk sensitive 
instruments exceeded the value at risk amounts during the reporting 
period;
    (2) Information required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B)(1) of this 
Item 305 is not required for the first fiscal year end in which a 
registrant must present Item 305 information; and
    (C) Registrants shall provide a description of the model, 
assumptions, and parameters, which are necessary to understand the 
disclosures required under paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this 
Item 305.
    (2) Registrants shall discuss material limitations that cause the 
information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this Item 305 not to 
reflect fully the net market risk exposures of the entity. This 
discussion shall include summarized descriptions of instruments, 
positions, and transactions omitted from the quantitative market risk 
disclosure information or the features of instruments, positions, and 
transactions that are included, but not reflected fully in the 
quantitative market risk disclosure information.
    (3) Registrants shall present summarized market risk information for 
the preceding fiscal year. In addition, registrants shall discuss the 
reasons for material quantitative changes in market risk exposures 
between the current and preceding fiscal years. Information required by 
this paragraph (a)(3), however, is not required if disclosure is not 
required under paragraph (a)(1) of this Item 305 for the current fiscal 
year. Information required by this paragraph (a)(3) is not required for 
the first fiscal year end in which a registrant must present Item 305 
information.
    (4) If registrants change disclosure alternatives or key model 
characteristics, assumptions, and parameters used in providing 
quantitative information about market risk (e.g., changing from tabular 
presentation to value at risk, changing the scope of instruments 
included in the model, or changing the definition of loss from fair 
values to earnings), and if the effects of any such change is material, 
the registrant shall:
    (i) Explain the reasons for the change; and
    (ii) Either provide summarized comparable information, under the new 
disclosure method, for the year preceding the current year or, in 
addition to providing disclosure for the current year under the new 
method, provide disclosures for the current year and preceding fiscal 
year under the method used in the preceding year.

Instructions to Paragraph 305(a): 1. Under paragraph 305(a)(1):
    A. For each market risk exposure category within the trading and 
other than trading portfolios, registrants may report the average, high, 
and low sensitivity analysis or value at risk amounts for the reporting 
period, as an alternative to reporting year-end amounts.
    B. In determining the average, high, and low amounts for the fiscal 
year under instruction 1.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 305(a), 
registrants should use sensitivity analysis or value at risk amounts 
relating to at least four equal time periods throughout the reporting 
period (e.g., four

[[Page 367]]

quarter-end amounts, 12 month-end amounts, or 52 week-end amounts).
    C. Functional currency means functional currency as defined by 
generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, ``Foreign Currency Translation'', 
(``FAS 52'') paragraph 20 (December 1981)).
    D. Registrants using the sensitivity analysis and value at risk 
disclosure alternatives are encouraged, but not required, to provide 
quantitative amounts that reflect the aggregate market risk inherent in 
the trading and other than trading portfolios.
    2. Under paragraph 305(a)(1)(i):
    A. Examples of contract terms sufficient to determine future cash 
flows from market risk sensitive instruments include, but are not 
limited to:
    i. Debt instruments--principal amounts and weighted average 
effective interest rates;
    ii. Forwards and futures--contract amounts and weighted average 
settlement prices;
    iii. Options--contract amounts and weighted average strike prices;
    iv. Swaps--notional amounts, weighted average pay rates or prices, 
and weighted average receive rates or prices; and
    v. Complex instruments--likely to be a combination of the contract 
terms presented in 2.A.i. through iv. of this Instruction;
    B. When grouping based on common characteristics, instruments should 
be categorized, at a minimum, by the following characteristics, when 
material:
    i. Fixed rate or variable rate assets or liabilities;
    ii. Long or short forwards and futures;
    iii. Written or purchased put or call options with similar strike 
prices;
    iv. Receive fixed and pay variable swaps, receive variable and pay 
fixed swaps, and receive variable and pay variable swaps;
    v. The currency in which the instruments' cash flows are 
denominated;
    vi. Financial instruments for which foreign currency transaction 
gains and losses are reported in the same manner as translation 
adjustments under generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., 
FAS 52 paragraph 20 (December 1981)); and
    vii. Derivatives used to manage risks inherent in anticipated 
transactions;
    C. Registrants may aggregate information regarding functional 
currencies that are economically related, managed together for internal 
risk management purposes, and have statistical correlations of greater 
than 75% over each of the past three years;
    D. Market risk sensitive instruments that are exposed to rate or 
price changes in more than one market risk exposure category should be 
presented within the tabular information for each of the risk exposure 
categories to which those instruments are exposed;
    E. If a currency swap (see, e.g., FAS 52 Appendix E for a definition 
of currency swap) eliminates all foreign currency exposures in the cash 
flows of a foreign currency denominated debt instrument, neither the 
currency swap nor the foreign currency denominated debt instrument are 
required to be disclosed in the foreign currency risk exposure category. 
However, both the currency swap and the foreign currency denominated 
debt instrument should be disclosed in the interest rate risk exposure 
category; and
    F. The contents of the table and related assumptions that should be 
described include, but are not limited to:
    i. The different amounts reported in the table for various 
categories of the market risk sensitive instruments (e.g., principal 
amounts for debt, notional amounts for swaps, and contract amounts for 
options and futures);
    ii. The different types of reported market rates or prices (e.g., 
contractual rates or prices, spot rates or prices, forward rates or 
prices); and
    iii. Key prepayment or reinvestment assumptions relating to the 
timing of reported amounts.
    3. Under paragraph 305(a)(1)(ii):
    A. Registrants should select hypothetical changes in market rates or 
prices that are expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term 
changes in those rates and prices. In this regard, absent economic 
justification for the selection of a different amount, registrants 
should use changes that are not less than 10 percent of end of period 
market rates or prices;
    B. For purposes of instruction 3.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 
305(a), the term reasonably possible has the same meaning as defined by 
generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, ``Accounting for Contingencies,'' 
(``FAS 5'') paragraph 3 (March 1975));
    C. For purposes of instruction 3.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 
305(a), the term near term means a period of time going forward up to 
one year from the date of the financial statements (see generally AICPA, 
Statement of Position 94-6, ``Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks 
and Uncertainties,'' (``SOP 94-6'') at paragraph 7 (December 30, 1994));
    D. Market risk sensitive instruments that are exposed to rate or 
price changes in more than one market risk exposure category should be 
included in the sensitivity analysis disclosures for each market risk 
category to which those instruments are exposed;
    E. Registrants with multiple foreign currency exchange rate 
exposures should prepare foreign currency sensitivity analysis

[[Page 368]]

disclosures that measure the aggregate sensitivity to changes in all 
foreign currency exchange rate exposures, including the effects of 
changes in both transactional currency/functional currency exchange rate 
exposures and functional currency/reporting currency exchange rate 
exposures. For example, assume a French division of a registrant 
presenting its financial statements in U.S. dollars ($US) invests in a 
deutschmark(DM)-denominated debt security. In these circumstances, the 
$US is the reporting currency and the DM is the transactional currency. 
In addition, assume this division determines that the French franc (FF) 
is its functional currency according to FAS 52. In preparing the foreign 
currency sensitivity analysis disclosures, this registrant should report 
the aggregate potential loss from hypothetical changes in both the DM/FF 
exchange rate exposure and the FF/$US exchange rate exposure; and
    F. Model, assumptions, and parameters that should be described 
include, but are not limited to, how loss is defined by the model (e.g., 
loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows), a general description of 
the modeling technique (e.g., duration modeling, modeling that measures 
the change in net present values arising from selected hypothetical 
changes in market rates or prices, and a description as to how 
optionality is addressed by the model), the types of instruments covered 
by the model (e.g., derivative financial instruments, other financial 
instruments, derivative commodity instruments, and whether other 
instruments are included voluntarily, such as certain commodity 
instruments and positions, cash flows from anticipated transactions, and 
certain financial instruments excluded under instruction 3.C.ii. of the 
General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b)), and other 
relevant information about the model's assumptions and parameters, 
(e.g., the magnitude and timing of selected hypothetical changes in 
market rates or prices used, the method by which discount rates are 
determined, and key prepayment or reinvestment assumptions).
    4. Under paragraph 305(a)(1)(iii):
    A. The confidence intervals selected should reflect reasonably 
possible near-term changes in market rates and prices. In this regard, 
absent economic justification for the selection of different confidence 
intervals, registrants should use intervals that are 95 percent or 
higher;
    B. For purposes of instruction 4.A. of the Instructions to Paragraph 
305(a), the term reasonably possible has the same meaning as defined by 
generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FAS 5, paragraph 3 
(March 1975));
    C. For purposes of instruction 4.A. of the Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a), the term near term means a period of time going 
forward up to one year from the date of the financial statements (see 
generally SOP 94-6, at paragraph 7 (December 30, 1994));
    D. Registrants with multiple foreign currency exchange rate 
exposures should prepare foreign currency value at risk analysis 
disclosures that measure the aggregate sensitivity to changes in all 
foreign currency exchange rate exposures, including the aggregate 
effects of changes in both transactional currency/functional currency 
exchange rate exposures and functional currency/reporting currency 
exchange rate exposures. For example, assume a French division of a 
registrant presenting its financial statements in U.S. dollars ($US) 
invests in a deutschmark(DM)-denominated debt security. In these 
circumstances, the $US is the reporting currency and the DM is the 
transactional currency. In addition, assume this division determines 
that the French franc (FF) is its functional currency according to FAS 
52. In preparing the foreign currency value at risk disclosures, this 
registrant should report the aggregate potential loss from hypothetical 
changes in both the DM/FF exchange rate exposure and the FF/$US exchange 
rate exposure; and
    E. Model, assumptions, and parameters that should be described 
include, but are not limited to, how loss is defined by the model (e.g., 
loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows), the type of model used 
(e.g., variance/covariance, historical simulation, or Monte Carlo 
simulation and a description as to how optionality is addressed by the 
model), the types of instruments covered by the model (e.g., derivative 
financial instruments, other financial instruments, derivative commodity 
instruments, and whether other instruments are included voluntarily, 
such as certain commodity instruments and positions, cash flows from 
anticipated transactions, and certain financial instruments excluded 
under instruction 3.C.ii. of the General Instructions to Paragraphs 
305(a) and 305(b)), and other relevant information about the model's 
assumptions and parameters, (e.g., holding periods, confidence 
intervals, and, when appropriate, the methods used for aggregating value 
at risk amounts across market risk exposure categories, such as by 
assuming perfect positive correlation, independence, or actual observed 
correlation).
    5. Under paragraph 305(a)(2), limitations that should be considered 
include, but are not limited to:
    A. The exclusion of certain market risk sensitive instruments, 
positions, and transactions from the disclosures required under 
paragraph 305(a)(1) (e.g., derivative commodity instruments not 
permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with 
another financial instrument, commodity positions, cash flows from 
anticipated transactions, and certain financial instruments excluded 
under instruction 3.C.ii. of the General Instructions to Paragraphs

[[Page 369]]

305(a) and 305(b)). Failure to include such instruments, positions, and 
transactions in preparing the disclosures under paragraph 305(a)(1) may 
be a limitation because the resulting disclosures may not fully reflect 
the net market risk of a registrant; and
    B. The ability of disclosures required under paragraph 305(a)(1) to 
reflect fully the market risk that may be inherent in instruments with 
leverage, option, or prepayment features (e.g., options, including 
written options, structured notes, collateralized mortgage obligations, 
leveraged swaps, and options embedded in swaps).

    (b) Qualitative information about market risk. (1) To the extent 
material, describe:
    (i) The registrant's primary market risk exposures;
    (ii) How those exposures are managed. Such descriptions shall 
include, but not be limited to, a discussion of the objectives, general 
strategies, and instruments, if any, used to manage those exposures; and
    (iii) Changes in either the registrant's primary market risk 
exposures or how those exposures are managed, when compared to what was 
in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year and what is 
known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.
    (2) Qualitative information about market risk shall be presented 
separately for market risk sensitive instruments entered into for 
trading purposes and those entered into for purposes other than trading.

Instructions to Paragraph 305(b): 1. For purposes of disclosure under 
paragraph 305(b), primary market risk exposures means:
    A. The following categories of market risk: interest rate risk, 
foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other 
relevant market rate or price risks (e.g., equity price risk); and
    B. Within each of these categories, the particular markets that 
present the primary risk of loss to the registrant. For example, if a 
registrant has a material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate 
risk and, within this category of market risk, is most vulnerable to 
changes in dollar/yen, dollar/pound, and dollar/peso exchange rates, the 
registrant should disclose those exposures. Similarly, if a registrant 
has a material exposure to interest rate risk and, within this category 
of market risk, is most vulnerable to changes in short-term U.S. prime 
interest rates, it should disclose the existence of that exposure.
    2. For purposes of disclosure under paragraph 305(b), registrants 
should describe primary market risk exposures that exist as of the end 
of the latest fiscal year, and how those exposures are managed.

    General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b): 1. The 
disclosures called for by paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b) are intended to 
clarify the registrant's exposures to market risk associated with 
activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial 
instruments, and derivative commodity instruments.
    2. In preparing the disclosures under paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), 
registrants are required to include derivative financial instruments, 
other financial instruments, and derivative commodity instruments.
    3. For purposes of paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), derivative 
financial instruments, other financial instruments, and derivative 
commodity instruments (collectively referred to as ``market risk 
sensitive instruments'') are defined as follows:
    A. Derivative financial instruments has the same meaning as defined 
by generally accepted accounting principles (see, e.g., FASB, Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119, ``Disclosure about Derivative 
Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,'' (``FAS 
119'') paragraphs 5-7 (October 1994)), and includes futures, forwards, 
swaps, options, and other financial instruments with similar 
characteristics;
    B. Other financial instruments means all financial instruments as 
defined by generally accepted accounting principles for which fair value 
disclosures are required (see, e.g., FASB, Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 107, ``Disclosures about Fair Value of 
Financial Instruments,'' (``FAS 107'') paragraphs 3 and 8 (December 
1991)), except for derivative financial instruments, as defined above;
    C.i. Other financial instruments include, but are not limited to, 
trade accounts receivable, investments, loans, structured notes, 
mortgage-backed securities, trade accounts payable, indexed debt 
instruments, interest-only and principal-only obligations, deposits, and 
other debt obligations;

[[Page 370]]

    ii. Other financial instruments exclude employers' and plans' 
obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefits, 
substantively extinguished debt, insurance contracts, lease contracts, 
warranty obligations and rights, unconditional purchase obligations, 
investments accounted for under the equity method, minority interests in 
consolidated enterprises, and equity instruments issued by the 
registrant and classified in stockholders' equity in the statement of 
financial position (see, e.g., FAS 107, paragraph 8 (December 1991)). 
For purposes of this item, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts 
payable need not be considered other financial instruments when their 
carrying amounts approximate fair value; and
    D. Derivative commodity instruments include, to the extent such 
instruments are not derivative financial instruments, commodity futures, 
commodity forwards, commodity swaps, commodity options, and other 
commodity instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by 
contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another 
financial instrument. For purposes of this paragraph, settlement in cash 
includes settlement in cash of the net change in value of the derivative 
commodity instrument (e.g., net cash settlement based on changes in the 
price of the underlying commodity).
    4.A. In addition to providing required disclosures for the market 
risk sensitive instruments defined in instruction 2. of the General 
Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants are encouraged 
to include other market risk sensitive instruments, positions, and 
transactions within the disclosures required under paragraphs 305(a) and 
305(b). Such instruments, positions, and transactions might include 
commodity positions, derivative commodity instruments that are not 
permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with 
another financial instrument, cash flows from anticipated transactions, 
and certain financial instruments excluded under instruction 3.C.ii. of 
the General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b).
    B. Registrants that voluntarily include other market risk sensitive 
instruments, positions and transactions within their quantitative 
disclosures about market risk under the sensitivity analysis or value at 
risk disclosure alternatives are not required to provide separate market 
risk disclosures for any voluntarily selected instruments, positions, or 
transactions. Instead, registrants selecting the sensitivity analysis 
and value at risk disclosure alternatives are permitted to present 
comprehensive market risk disclosures, which reflect the combined market 
risk exposures inherent in both the required and any voluntarily 
selected instruments, position, or transactions. Registrants that choose 
the tabular presentation disclosure alternative should present 
voluntarily selected instruments, positions, or transactions in a manner 
consistent with the requirements in Item 305(a) for market risk 
sensitive instruments.
    C. If a registrant elects to include voluntarily a particular type 
of instrument, position, or transaction in their quantitative 
disclosures about market risk, that registrant should include all, 
rather than some, of those instruments, positions, or transactions 
within those disclosures. For example, if a registrant holds in 
inventory a particular type of commodity position and elects to include 
that commodity position within their market risk disclosures, the 
registrant should include the entire commodity position, rather than 
only a portion thereof, in their quantitative disclosures about market 
risk.
    5.A. Under paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), a materiality assessment 
should be made for each market risk exposure category within the trading 
and other than trading portfolios.
    B. For purposes of making the materiality assessment under 
instruction 5.A. of the General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 
305(b), registrants should evaluate both:
    i. The materiality of the fair values of derivative financial 
instruments, other financial instruments, and derivative commodity 
instruments outstanding as of the end of the latest fiscal year; and

[[Page 371]]

    ii. The materiality of potential, near-term losses in future 
earnings, fair values, and/or cash flows from reasonably possible near-
term changes in market rates or prices.
    iii. If either paragraphs B.i. or B.ii. in this instruction of the 
General Instructions to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b) are material, the 
registrant should disclose quantitative and qualitative information 
about market risk, if such market risk for the particular market risk 
exposure category is material.
    C. For purposes of instruction 5.B.i. of the General Instructions to 
Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants generally should not net fair 
values, except to the extent allowed under generally accepted accounting 
principles (see, e.g., FASB Interpretation No. 39, ``Offsetting of 
Amounts Related to Certain Contracts'' (March 1992)). For example, under 
this instruction, the fair value of assets generally should not be 
netted with the fair value of liabilities.
    D. For purposes of instruction 5.B.ii. of the General Instructions 
to Paragraphs 305(a) and 305(b), registrants should consider, among 
other things, the magnitude of:
    i. Past market movements;
    ii. Reasonably possible, near-term market movements; and
    iii. Potential losses that may arise from leverage, option, and

                Appendix to Item 305--Tabular Disclosures

    The tables set forth below are illustrative of the format that might 
be used when a registrant elects to present the information required by 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of Item 305 regarding terms and information about 
derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments, and 
derivative commodity instruments. These examples are for illustrative 
purposes only. Registrants are not required to display the information 
in the specific format illustrated below. Alternative methods of display 
are permissible as long as the disclosure requirements of the section 
are satisfied. Furthermore, these examples were designed primarily to 
illustrate possible formats for presentation of the information required 
by the disclosure item and do not purport to illustrate the broad range 
of derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments, and 
derivative commodity instruments utilized by registrants.

                        Interest Rate Sensitivity

    The table below provides information about the Company's derivative 
financial instruments and other financial instruments

[[Page 373]]

that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate 
swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents 
principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by 
expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents 
notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected 
(contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the 
contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted 
average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield 
curve at the reporting date. The information is presented in U.S. dollar 
equivalents, which is the Company's reporting currency. The instrument's 
actual cash flows are denominated in both U.S. dollars ($US) and German 
deutschmarks (DM), as indicated in parentheses.

                        Exchange Rate Sensitivity

    The table below provides information about the Company's derivative 
financial instruments, other financial instruments, and firmly committed 
sales transactions by functional currency and presents such information 
in U.S. dollar equivalents.\1\ The table summarizes information on 
instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency 
exchange rates, including foreign currency forward exchange agreements, 
deutschmark (DM)-denominated debt obligations, and firmly committed DM 
sales transactions. For debt obligations, the table presents principal 
cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected 
maturity dates. For firmly committed DM-sales transactions, sales 
amounts are presented by the expected transaction date, which are not 
expected to exceed two years. For foreign currency forward exchange 
agreements, the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average 
exchange rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. These notional 
amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be 
exchanged under the contract.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The information is presented in U.S. dollars because that is the 
registrant's reporting currency.

the futures contracts the table presents the notional amounts in 
bushels, the weighted average contract prices, and the total dollar 
contract amount by expected maturity dates, the latest of which occurs 
one year from the reporting date. Contract amounts are used to calculate 
the contractual payments and quantity of corn to be exchanged under the 
futures contracts.

separate item captioned ``Executive officers of the registrant'' and 
included in Part I of the registrant's annual report on Form 10-K and 
Form 10-KSB.

    (c) Identification of certain significant employees. Where the 
registrant employs persons such as production managers, sales managers, 
or research scientists who are not executive officers but who make or 
are expected to make significant contributions to the business of the 
registrant, such persons shall be identified and their background 
disclosed to the same extent as in the case of executive officers. Such 
disclosure need not be made if the registrant was subject to section 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or was exempt from section 13(a) by 
section 12(g)(2)(G) of such Act immediately prior to the filing of the 
registration statement, report, or statement to which this Item is 
applicable.
    (d) Family relationships. State the nature of any family 
relationship between any director, executive officer, or person 
nominated or chosen by the registrant to become a director or executive 
officer.

Instruction to Paragraph 401(d): The term ``family relationship'' means 
any relationship by blood, marriage, or adoption, not more remote than 
first cousin.

    (e) Business experience--(1) Background. Briefly describe the 
business experience during the past five

[[Page 376]]

years of each director, executive officer, person nominated or chosen to 
become a director or executive officer, and each person named in answer 
to paragraph (c) of Item 401, including: Each person's principal 
occupations and employment during the past five years; the name and 
principal business of any corporation or other organization in which 
such occupations and employment were carried on; and whether such 
corporation or organization is a parent, subsidiary or other affiliate 
of the registrant. When an executive officer or person named in response 
to paragraph (c) of Item 401 has been employed by the registrant or a 
subsidiary of the registrant for less than five years, a brief 
explanation shall be included as to the nature of the responsibility 
undertaken by the individual in prior positions to provide adequate 
disclosure of his prior business experience. What is required is 
information relating to the level of his professional competence, which 
may include, depending upon the circumstances, such specific information 
as the size of the operation supervised.
    (2) Directorships. Indicate any other directorships held by each 
director or person nominated or chosen to become a director in any 
company with a class of securities registered pursuant to section 12 of 
the Exchange Act or subject to the requirements of section 15(d) of such 
Act or any company registered as an investment company under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1, et seq., as amended, 
naming such company.

Instruction to Paragraph (e) of Item 401: For the purposes of paragraph 
(e)(2), where the other directorships of each director or person 
nominated or chosen to become a director include directorships of two or 
more registered investment companies that are part of a ``fund complex'' 
as that term is defined in Item 22(a) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange 
Act (Sec. 240.14a-101 of this chapter), the registrant may, rather than 
listing each such investment company, identify the fund complex and 
provide the number of investment company directorships held by the 
director or nominee in such fund complex.

    (f) Involvement in certain legal proceedings. Describe any of the 
following events that occurred during the past five years and that are 
material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any director, 
person nominated to become a director or executive officer of the 
registrant:
    (1) A petition under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any state 
insolvency law was filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or 
similar officer was appointed by a court for the business or property of 
such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or 
within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or 
business association of which he was an executive officer at or within 
two years before the time of such filing;
    (2) Such person was convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named 
subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations

dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee 
of any investment company, bank, savings and loan association or 
insurance company, or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice 
in connection with such activity;
    (ii) Engaging in any type of business practice; or
    (iii) Engaging in any activity in connection with the purchase or 
sale of any security or commodity or in connection with any violation of 
Federal or State securities laws or Federal commodities laws;
    (4) Such person was the subject of any order, judgment or decree, 
not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any Federal or State

civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have 
violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil 
action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not 
been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated.

Instructions to Paragraph (f) of Item 401: 1. For purposes of computing 
the five year period referred to in this paragraph, the date of a 
reportable event shall be deemed the date on which the final order, 
judgment or decree was entered, or the date on which any rights of 
appeal from preliminary orders, judgments, or decrees have lapsed. With 
respect to bankruptcy petitions, the computation date shall be the date 
of filing for uncontested petitions or the date upon which approval of a 
contested petition became final.
    2. If any event specified in this paragraph (f) has occurred and 
information in regard thereto is omitted on the grounds that it is not 
material, the registrant may furnish to the Commission, at time of

<R05>
Sec. 229.402  (Item 402)  Executive compensation.

    (a) General--(1) Treatment of specific types of issuers--(i) Small 
business issuers. A registrant that qualifies as ``small business 
issuer,'' as defined by Item 10(a)(1) of Regulation S-B [17 CFR 
228.10(a)(1)], will be deemed to comply with this item if it provides 
the information required by paragraph (b) (Summary Compensation Table), 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)(i)-(v) (Option/SAR Grants Table), paragraph 
(d) (Aggregated Option/SAR Exercise and Fiscal Year-End Option/SAR Value 
Table), paragraph (e) (Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards Table), paragraph 
(g) (Compensation of Directors), paragraph

[[Page 378]]

(h) (Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change in 
Control Arrangements) and paragraph (i) (1) and (2) (Report on Repricing 
of Options/SARs) of this item.
    (ii) Foreign private issuers. A foreign private issuer will be 
deemed to comply with this item if it provides the information required 
by Items 11 and 12 of Form 20-F [17 CFR 249.220f], with more detailed 
information provided if otherwise made publicly available.
    (2) All compensation covered. This item requires clear, concise and 
understandable disclosure of all plan and non-plan compensation awarded 
to, earned by, or paid to the named executive officers designated under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this item, and directors covered by paragraph (g) of 
this item by any person for all services rendered in all capacities to 
the registrant and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified in this 
item. Except as provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this item, all such 
compensation shall be reported pursuant to this item, even if also 
called for by another requirement, including transactions between the 
registrant and a third party where the primary purpose of the 
transaction is to furnish compensation to any such named executive 
officer or director. No item reported as compensation for one fiscal 
year need be reported as compensation for a subsequent fiscal year.
    (3) Persons covered. Disclosure shall be provided pursuant to this 
item for each of the following (the ``named executive officers''):
    (i) All individuals serving as the registrant's chief executive 
officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal 
year (``CEO''), regardless of compensation level;
    (ii) The registrant's four most highly compensated executive 
officers other than the CEO who were serving as executive officers at 
the end of the last completed fiscal year; and
    (iii) Up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would 
have been provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this item but for 
the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer of 
the registrant at the end of the last completed fiscal year.

Instructions to Item 402(a)(3): 1. Determination of Most Highly 
Compensated Executive Officers. The determination as to which executive 
officers are most highly compensated shall be made by reference to total 
annual salary and bonus for the last completed fiscal year (as required 
to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this 
item), but including the dollar value of salary or bonus amounts forgone 
pursuant to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this 
item: Provided, however, That no disclosure need be provided for any 
executive officer, other than the CEO, whose total annual salary and 
bonus, as so determined, does not exceed $100,000.
    2. Inclusion of Executive Officer of Subsidiary. It may be 
appropriate in certain circumstances for a registrant to include an 
executive officer of a subsidiary in the disclosure required by this 
item. See Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.3b-7].
    3. Exclusion of Executive Officer due to Unusual or Overseas 
Compensation. It may be appropriate in limited circumstances for a 
registrant not to include in the disclosure required by this item an 
individual, other than its CEO, who is one of the registrant's most 
highly compensated executive officers. Among the factors that should be 
considered in determining not to name an individual are: (a) the 
distribution or accrual of an unusually large amount of cash 
compensation (such as a bonus or commission) that is not part of a 
recurring arrangement and is unlikely to continue; and (b) the payment 
of amounts of cash compensation relating to overseas assignments that 
may be attributed predominantly to such assignments.

    (4) Information for full fiscal year. If the CEO served in that 
capacity during any part of a fiscal year with respect to which 
information is required, information should be provided as to all of his 
or her compensation for the full fiscal year. If a named executive 
officer (other than the CEO) served as an executive officer of the 
registrant (whether or not in the same position) during any part of a 
fiscal year with respect to which information is required, information 
shall be provided as to all compensation of that individual for the full 
fiscal year.
    (5) Transactions with third parties reported under item 404. This 
item includes transactions between the registrant and a third party 
where the primary purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation 
to a named executive officer. No information need be given in response 
to any paragraph of this item, other than paragraph (j), as

[[Page 379]]

to any such third-party transaction if the transaction has been reported 
in response to Item 404 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.404).
    (6) Omission of table or column. A table or column may be omitted, 
if there has been no compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to any 
of the named executives required to be reported in that table or column 
in any fiscal year covered by that table.
    (7) Definitions. For purposes of this item:
    (i) The term stock appreciation rights (SARs) refers to SARs payable 
in cash or stock, including SARs payable in cash or stock at the 
election of the registrant or a named executive officer.
    (ii) The term plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
Any plan, contract, authorization or arrangement, whether or not set 
forth in any formal documents, pursuant to which the following may be 
received: cash, stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units, 
phantom stock, stock options, SARs, stock options in tandem with SARs, 
warrants, convertible securities, performance units and performance 
shares, and similar instruments. A plan may be applicable to one person. 
Registrants may omit information regarding group life, health, 
hospitalization, medical reimbursement or relocation plans that do not 
discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive 
officers or directors of the registrant and that are available generally 
to all salaried employees.
    (iii) The term long-term incentive plan means any plan providing 
compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance to occur 
over a period longer than one fiscal year, whether such performance is 
measured by reference to financial performance of the registrant or an 
affiliate, the registrant's stock price, or any other measure, but 
excluding restricted stock, stock option and SAR plans.
    (8) Location of specified information. The information required by 
paragraphs (i), (k) and (l) of this item need not be provided in any 
filings other than a registrant proxy or information statement relating 
to an annual meeting of security holders at which directors are to be 
elected (or special meeting or written consents in lieu of such 
meeting). Such information will not be deemed to be incorporated by 
reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, 
except to the extent that the registrant specifically incorporates it by 
reference.
    (9) Liability for specified information. The information required by 
paragraphs (k) and (l) of this item shall not be deemed to be 
``soliciting material'' or to be ``filed'' with the Commission or 
subject to Regulations 14A or 14C [17 CFR 240.14a-1 et seq. or 240.14c-1 
et seq.], other than as provided in this item, or to the liabilities of 
section 18 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78r], except to the extent 
that the registrant specifically requests that such information be 
treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporates it by 
reference into a filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
    (b) Summary Compensation Table. (1) General. The information 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this item, concerning the compensation 
of the named executive officers for each of the registrant's last three 
completed fiscal years, shall be provided in a Summary Compensation 
Table, in the tabular format specified below.

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name and principal position of the executive officer (column 
(a));
    (ii) Fiscal year covered (column (b));
    (iii) Annual compensation (columns (c), (d) and (e)), including:
    (A) The dollar value of base salary (cash and non-cash) earned by 
the named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (c));
    (B) The dollar value of bonus (cash and non-cash) earned by the 
named executive officer during the fiscal year covered (column (d)); and

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(iii) (A) and (B): 1. Amounts deferred at 
the election of a named executive officer, whether pursuant to a plan 
established under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 
401(k)], or otherwise, shall be included in the salary column (column 
(c)) or bonus column (column (d)), as appropriate, for the fiscal year 
in which earned. If the amount of salary or bonus earned in a given 
fiscal year is not calculable through the latest practicable date, that 
fact must be disclosed in a footnote and such amount must be disclosed 
in the subsequent fiscal year in the appropriate column for the fiscal 
year in which earned.
    2. For stock or any other form of non-cash compensation, disclose 
the fair market value at the time the compensation is awarded, earned or 
paid.
    3. Registrants need not include in the salary column (column (c)) or 
bonus column (column (d)) any amount of salary or bonus forgone at the 
election of a named executive officer pursuant to a registrant program 
under which stock, stock-based or other forms of non-cash compensation 
may be received by a named executive in lieu of a portion of annual 
compensation earned in a covered fiscal year. However, the receipt of 
any such form of non-cash compensation in lieu of salary or bonus earned 
for a covered fiscal year must be disclosed in the appropriate column of 
the Table corresponding to that fiscal year (i.e., restricted stock 
awards (column (f)); options or SARs (column (g)); all other 
compensation (column (i)), or, if made pursuant to a long-term incentive 
plan and therefore not reportable at grant in the Summary Compensation 
Table, a footnote must be added to the salary or bonus column so 
disclosing and referring to the Long-Term Incentive Plan Table (required 
by paragraph (e) of this item) where the award is reported.

    (C) The dollar value of other annual compensation not properly 
categorized as salary or bonus, as follows (column (e)):
    (1) Perquisites and other personal benefits, securities or property, 
unless the aggregate amount of such compensation is the lesser of either 
$50,000 or 10% of the total of annual salary and bonus reported for the 
named executive officer in columns (c) and (d);
    (2) Above-market or preferential earnings on restricted stock, 
options, SARs or deferred compensation paid during the fiscal year or 
payable during that period but deferred at the election of the named 
executive officer;
    (3) Earnings on long-term incentive plan compensation paid during 
the fiscal year or payable during that period but deferred at the 
election of the named executive officer;
    (4) Amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the payment of 
taxes; and

[[Page 381]]

    (5) The dollar value of the difference between the price paid by a 
named executive officer for any security of the registrant or its 
subsidiaries purchased from the registrant or its subsidiaries (through 
deferral of salary or bonus, or otherwise), and the fair market value of 
such security at the date of purchase, unless that discount is available 
generally, either to all security holders or to all salaried employees 
of the registrant.

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(iii)(C): 1. Each perquisite or other 
personal benefit exceeding 25% of the total perquisites and other 
personal benefits reported for a named executive officer must be 
identified by type and amount in a footnote or accompanying narrative 
discussion to column (e).
    2. Perquisites and other personal benefits shall be valued on the 
basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the registrant and its 
subsidiaries.
    3. Interest on deferred or long-term compensation is above-market 
only if the rate of interest exceeds 120% of the applicable federal 
long-term rate, with compounding (as prescribed under section 1274(d) of 
the Internal Revenue Code, [26 U.S.C. 1274(d)]) at the rate that 
corresponds most closely to the rate under the registrant's plan at the 
time the interest rate or formula is set. In the event of a 
discretionary reset of the interest rate, the requisite calculation must 
be made on the basis of the interest rate at the time of such reset, 
rather than when originally established. Only the above-market portion 
of the interest must be included. If the applicable interest rates vary 
depending upon conditions such as a minimum period of continued service, 
the reported amount should be calculated assuming satisfaction of all 
conditions to receiving interest at the highest rate.
    4. Dividends (and dividend equivalents) on restricted stock, 
options, SARs or deferred compensation denominated in stock (``deferred 
stock'') are preferential only if earned at a rate higher than dividends 
on the registrant's common stock. Only the preferential portion of the 
dividends or equivalents must be included.

    (iv) Long-term compensation (columns (f), (g) and (h)), including:
    (A) The dollar value (net of any consideration paid by the named 
executive officer) of any award of restricted stock, including share 
units (calculated by multiplying the closing market price of the 
registrant's unrestricted stock on the date of grant by the number of 
shares awarded) (column (f));
    (B) The sum of the number of securities underlying stock options 
granted (including options that subsequently have been transferred), 
with or without tandem SARs, and the number of freestanding SARs (column 
(g)); and
    (C) The dollar value of all payouts pursuant to long-term incentive 
plans (``LTIPs'') as defined in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this item 
(column (h)).

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(iv): 1. Awards of restricted stock that 
are subject to performance-based conditions on vesting, in addition to 
lapse of time and/or continued service with the registrant or a 
subsidiary, may be reported as LTIP awards pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this item instead of in column (f). If this approach is selected, once 
the restricted stock vests, it must be reported as an LTIP payout in 
column (h).
    2. The registrant shall, in a footnote to the Summary Compensation 
Table (appended to column (f), if included), disclose:
    a. The number and value of the aggregate restricted stock holdings 
at the end of the last completed fiscal year. The value shall be 
calculated in the manner specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this 
item using the value of the registrant's shares at the end of the last 
completed fiscal year;
    b. For any restricted stock award reported in the Summary 
Compensation Table that will vest, in whole or in part, in under three 
years from the date of grant, the total number of shares awarded and the 
vesting schedule; and
    c. Whether dividends will be paid on the restricted stock reported 
in column (f).
    3. If at any time during the last completed fiscal year, the 
registrant has adjusted or amended the exercise price of stock options 
or freestanding SARs previously awarded to a named executive officer, 
whether through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, or any 
other means (``repriced''), the registrant shall include the number of 
options or freestanding SARs so repriced as Stock Options/SARs granted 
and required to be reported in column (g).
    4. If any specified performance target, goal or condition to payout 
was waived with respect to any amount included in LTIP payouts reported 
in column (h), the registrant shall so state in a footnote to column 
(h).

    (v) All other compensation for the covered fiscal year that the 
registrant could not properly report in any other column of the Summary 
Compensation Table (column (i)). Any compensation reported in this 
column for the last completed fiscal year shall be identified and 
quantified in a footnote. Such

executive officer's responsibilities following such a change in control;
    (B) The dollar value of above-market or preferential amounts earned 
on restricted stock, options, SARs or deferred compensation during the 
fiscal year, or calculated with respect to that period, except that if 
such amounts are paid during the period, or payable during the period 
but deferred at the election of a named executive officer, this 
information shall be reported as Other Annual Compensation in column 
(e). See Instructions 3 and 4 to paragraph 402(b)(2)(iii)(C) of this 
item;
    (C) The dollar value of amounts earned on long-term incentive plan 
compensation during the fiscal year, or calculated with respect to that

officer, this information shall be reported as Other Annual Compensation 
in column (e);
    (D) Annual registrant contributions or other allocations to vested 
and unvested defined contribution plans; and

payment of the premium and the refund.

Instructions to Item 402(b)(2)(v): 1. LTIP awards and amounts received 
on exercise of options and SARs need not be reported as All Other

instead should be reported pursuant to paragraph (f) of this item.
    3. Where alternative methods of reporting are available under 
paragraph (b)(2)(v)(E) of this item, the same method should be used for 
each of the named executive officers. If the registrant chooses to 
change methods from one year to the next, that fact, and the reason 
therefor, should be disclosed in a footnote to column (i).

    Instruction to Item 402(b): Information with respect to fiscal years 
prior to the last completed fiscal year will not be required if the 
registrant was not a reporting company pursuant to Section 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act at any time during that year, except that the

    (2) The Table shall include, with respect to each grant:
    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) Number of securities underlying option/SARs granted (column 
(b)).
    (iii) The percent the grant represents of total options and SARs 
granted to employees during the fiscal year (column (c));
    (iv) The per-share exercise or base price of the options or SARs 
granted (column (d)). If such exercise or base price is less than the 
market price of the underlying security on the date of grant, a 
separate, adjoining column shall be added showing market price on the 
date of grant;
    (v) The expiration date of the options or SARs (column (e)); and
    (vi) Either (A) the potential realizable value of each grant of 
options or freestanding SARs or (B) the present value of each grant, as 
follows:
    (A) The potential realizable value of each grant of options or 
freestanding SARs, assuming that the market price of the underlying 
security appreciates in value from the date of grant to the end of the 
option or SAR term, at the following annualized rates:
    (1) 5% (column (f));
    (2) 10% (column (g)); and
    (3) If the exercise or base price was below the market price of the 
underlying security at the date of grant, provide an additional column 
labeled 0%, to show the value at grant-date market price; or
    (B) The present value of the grant at the date of grant, under any 
option pricing model (alternative column (f)).

Instructions to Item 402(c): 1. If more than one grant of options and/or 
freestanding SARs was made to a named executive officer during the last 
completed fiscal year, a separate line should be used to provide 
disclosure of each such grant. However, multiple grants during a single 
fiscal year may be aggregated where each grant was made at the same 
exercise and/or base price and has the same expiration date, and the 
same performance vesting thresholds, if any. A single grant consisting 
of options and/or freestanding SARs shall be reported as separate grants 
with respect to each tranche with a different exercise and/or base 
price, performance vesting threshold, or expiration date.
    2. Options or freestanding SARs granted in connection with an option 
repricing transaction shall be reported in this table. See Instruction 3 
to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this item.
    3. Any material term of the grant, including but not limited to the 
date of exercisability, the number of SARs, performance units or other 
instruments granted in tandem with options, a performance-based 
condition to exercisability, a reload feature, or a tax-reimbursement 
feature, shall be footnoted.
    4. If the exercise or base price is adjustable over the term of any 
option or freestanding SAR in accordance with any prescribed standard or 
formula, including but not limited to an index or premium price 
provision, describe the following, either by footnote to column (c) or 
in narrative accompanying the Table: (a) the standard or formula; and 
(b) any constant assumption made by the registrant regarding any 
adjustment to the exercise price in calculating the potential option or 
SAR value.
    5. If any provision of a grant (other than an antidilution 
provision) could cause the exercise price to be lowered, registrants 
must clearly and fully disclose these provisions and their potential 
consequences either by a footnote or accompanying textual narrative.
    6. In determining the grant-date market or base price of the 
security underlying options

[[Page 384]]

or freestanding SARs, the registrant may use either the closing market 
price per share of the security, or any other formula prescribed for the 
security.
    7. The potential realizable dollar value of a grant (columns (f) and 
(g)) shall be the product of:
    (a) The difference between:
    (i) The product of the per-share market price at the time of the 
grant and the sum of 1 plus the adjusted stock price appreciation rate 
(the assumed rate of appreciation compounded annually over the term of 
the option or SAR); and
    (ii) The per-share exercise price of the option or SAR; and
    (b) The number of securities underlying the grant at fiscal year-
end.
    8. Registrants may add one or more separate columns using the 
formula prescribed in Instruction 7 to paragraph (c) of this item, to 
reflect the following:
    a. The registrant's historic rate of appreciation over a period 
equivalent to the term of such options and/or SARs;
    b. 0% appreciation, where the exercise or base price was equal to or 
greater than the market price of the underlying securities on the date 
of grant; and
    c. N% appreciation, the percentage appreciation by which the 
exercise or base price exceeded the market price at grant. Where the 
grant included multiple tranches with exercise or base prices exceeding 
the market price of the underlying security by varying degrees, include 
an additional column for each additional tranche.
    9. Where the registrant chooses to use the grant-date valuation 
alternative specified in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B) of this item, the 
valuation shall be footnoted to describe the valuation method used. 
Where the registrant has used a variation of the Black-Scholes or 
binomial option pricing model, the description shall identify the use of 
such pricing model and describe the assumptions used relating to the 
expected volatility, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield and time 
of exercise. Any adjustments for non-transferability or risk of 
forfeiture also shall be disclosed. In the event another valuation 
method is used, the registrant is required to describe the methodology 
as well as any material assumptions.

    (d) Aggregated option/SAR exercises and fiscal year-end option/SAR 
value table. (1) The information specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
item, concerning each exercise of stock options (or tandem SARs) and 
freestanding SARs during the last completed fiscal year by each of the 
named executive officers and the fiscal year-end value of unexercised 
options and SARs, shall be provided on an aggregated basis in the 
tabular format specified below:

                Aggregated Option/SAR Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and FY-End Option/SAR Values

    (2) The table shall include:
    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) The number of shares received upon exercise, or, if no shares 
were received, the number of securities with respect to which the 
options or SARs were exercised (column (b));
    (iii) The aggregate dollar value realized upon exercise (column 
(c));
    (iv) The total number of securities underlying unexercised options 
and SARs held at the end of the last completed fiscal year, separately 
identifying the exercisable and unexercisable options and SARs (column 
(d)); and
    (v) The aggregate dollar value of in-the-money, unexercised options 
and SARs held at the end of the fiscal year, separately identifying the 
exercisable and unexercisable options and SARs (column (e)).

Instructions to Item 402(d)(2): 1. Options or freestanding SARs are in-
the-money if the fair market value of the underlying securities exceeds 
the exercise or base price of the option or SAR. The dollar values in 
columns (c) and (e) are calculated by determining the difference between 
the fair market value of

[[Page 385]]

the securities underlying the options or SARs and the exercise or base 
price of the options or SARs at exercise or fiscal year-end, 
respectively.
    2. In calculating the dollar value realized upon exercise (column 
(c)), the value of any related payment or other consideration provided 
(or to be provided) by the registrant to or on behalf of a named 
executive officer, whether in payment of the exercise price or related 
taxes, shall not be included. Payments by the registrant in 
reimbursement of tax obligations incurred by a named executive officer 
are required to be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii)(C)(4) of this item.

    (e) Long-Term Incentive Plan (``LTIP'') awards table. (1) The

    (2) The Table shall include:
    (i) The name of the executive officer (column (a));
    (ii) The number of shares, units or other rights awarded under any 
LTIP, and, if applicable, the number of shares underlying any such unit 
or right (column (b));
    (iii) The performance or other time period until payout or 
maturation of the award (column (c)); and
    (iv) For plans not based on stock price, the dollar value of the 
estimated payout, the number of shares to be awarded as the payout or a 
range of estimated payouts denominated in dollars or number of shares 
under the award (threshold, target and maximum amount) (columns (d) 
through (f)).

Instructions to Item 402(e): 1. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``long-term incentive plan'' or ``LTIP'' shall be defined in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this item.
    2. Describe in a footnote or in narrative text accompanying this 
table the material terms of any award, including a general description 
of the formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts 
payable. Registrants are not required to disclose any factor, criterion 
or performance-related or other condition to payout or maturation of a 
particular award that involves confidential commercial or business 
information, disclosure of which would adversely affect the registrant's 
competitive position.
    3. Separate disclosure shall be provided in the Table for each award 
made to a named executive officer, accompanied by the information 
specified in Instruction 2 to this paragraph. If awards are made to a 
named executive officer during the fiscal year under more than one plan, 
identify the particular plan under which each such award was made.
    4. For column (d), ``threshold'' refers to the minimum amount 
payable for a certain level of performance under the plan. For column 
(e), ``target'' refers to the amount payable if the specified 
performance target(s) are reached. For column (f), ``maximum'' refers to 
the maximum payout possible under the plan.
    5. In column (e), registrants must provide a representative amount 
based on the previous fiscal year's performance if the target award is 
not determinable.
    6. A tandem grant of two instruments, only one of which is pursuant 
to a LTIP, need be reported only in the table applicable to the other 
instrument. For example, an option granted in tandem with a performance 
share would be reported only as an option grant, with the tandem feature 
noted.

    (f) Defined benefit or actuarial plan disclosure--(1) Pension plan 
table. (i) For any defined benefit or actuarial plan under which 
benefits are determined primarily by final compensation (or average 
final compensation) and years of service, provide a separate Pension 
Plan Table showing estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement 
(including amounts attributable to any

[[Page 386]]

defined benefit supplementary or excess pension award plans) in

relationship of such covered compensation to the annual compensation 
reported in the Summary Compensation Table required by paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this item, and state the current compensation covered by 
the plan for any named executive officer whose covered compensation 
differs substantially (by more than 10%) from that set forth in the 
annual compensation columns of the Summary Compensation Table;
    (B) The estimated credited years of service for each of the named 
executive officers; and
    (C) A statement as to the basis upon which benefits are computed

    (2) Alternative pension plan disclosure. For any defined benefit or 
actuarial plan under which benefits are not determined primarily by 
final compensation (or average final compensation) and years of service, 
the registrant shall state in narrative form:

    (ii) The estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement at normal 
retirement age for each of the named executive officers.

Instructions to Item 402(f): 1. Pension Levels. Compensation set forth 
in the Pension Plan Table pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this item 
shall allow for reasonable increases in existing compensation levels; 
alternatively, registrants may present as the highest compensation level 
in the Pension Plan Table an amount equal to 120% of the amount of 
covered compensation of the most highly compensated individual named in 
the Summary Compensation Table required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
item.
    2. Normal Retirement Age. The term ``normal retirement age'' means 
normal retirement age as defined in a pension or similar plan or, if not 
defined therein, the earliest time at which a participant may retire 
without any benefit reduction due to age.

    (g) Compensation of Directors--(1) Standard arrangements. Describe 
any standard arrangements, stating amounts, pursuant to which directors 
of the registrant are compensated for any services provided as a 
director, including any additional amounts payable for committee

which any director of the registrant was compensated during the 
registrant's last completed fiscal year for any service provided as a 
director, stating the amount paid and the name of the director.

Instruction to Item 402(g)(2): The information required by paragraph 
(g)(2) of this item shall include any arrangement, including consulting 
contracts, entered into in consideration of the director's service on 
the board. The material terms of any such arrangement shall be included.

    (h) Employment contracts and termination of employment and change-
in-control arrangements. Describe the terms and conditions of each of 
the following contracts or arrangements:

received from the registrant, with respect to a named executive officer, 
if such plan or arrangement results or will result from the resignation, 
retirement or any other termination of such executive officer's 
employment with the registrant and its subsidiaries or

[[Page 387]]

from a change-in-control of the registrant or a change in the named 
executive officer's responsibilities following a change-in-control and 
the amount involved, including all periodic payments or installments, 
exceeds $100,000.
    (i) Report on repricing of options/SARs. (1) If at any time during 
the last completed fiscal year, the registrant, while a reporting 
company pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 
U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)], has adjusted or amended the exercise price of 
stock options or SARs previously awarded to any of the named executive 
officers, whether through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants, 
or any other means (``repriced''), the registrant shall provide the 
information specified in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this item.
    (2) The compensation committee (or other board committee performing 
equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the 
entire board of directors) shall explain in reasonable detail any such 
repricing of options and/or SARs held by a named executive officer in 
the last completed fiscal year, as well as the basis for each such 
repricing.

the name of each member of the registrant's compensation committee, or 
other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence 
of any such committee, the entire board of directors.
    2. A replacement grant is any grant of options or SARs reasonably

[[Page 388]]

    5. Information required by paragraph (i)(3) of this item shall not 
be provided for any repricings effected before the registrant became a 
reporting company pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act.

    (j) Additional information with respect to Compensation Committee 
Interlocks and Insider Participation in compensation decisions. Under 
the caption ``Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider 
Participation,''
    (1) The registrant shall identify each person who served as a member 
of the compensation committee of the registrant's board of directors (or 
board committee performing equivalent functions) during the last 
completed fiscal year, indicating each committee member who:
    (i) Was, during the fiscal year, an officer or employee of the 
registrant or any of its subsidiaries;
    (ii) Was formerly an officer of the registrant or any of its 
subsidiaries; or
    (iii) Had any relationship requiring disclosure by the registrant 
under any paragraph of Item 404 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.404). In 
this event, the disclosure required by Item 404 shall accompany such 
identification.
    (2) If the registrant has no compensation committee (or other board 
committee performing equivalent functions), the registrant shall 
identify each officer and employee of the registrant or any of its 
subsidiaries, and any former officer of the registrant or any of its 
subsidiaries, who, during the last completed fiscal year, participated 
in deliberations of the registrant's board of directors concerning 
executive officer compensation.
    (3) The registrant shall describe any of the following relationships 
that existed during the last completed fiscal year:
    (i) An executive officer of the registrant served as a member of the 
compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent 
functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of 
directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on 
the compensation committee (or other board committee performing 
equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the 
entire board of directors) of the registrant;
    (ii) An executive officer of the registrant served as a director of 
another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the 
compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent 
functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of 
directors) of the registrant; and
    (iii) An executive officer of the registrant served as a member of 
the compensation committee (or other board committee performing 
equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the 
entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive 
officers served as a director of the registrant.
    (4) Disclosure required under paragraph (j)(3) of this item 
regarding any compensation committee member or other director of the 
registrant who also served as an executive officer of another entity 
shall be accompanied by the disclosure called for by Item 404 
(Sec. 229.404) with respect to that person.

Instruction to Item 402(j): For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
``entity'' shall not include an entity exempt from tax under section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)].

    (k) Board compensation committee report on executive compensation. 
(1) Disclosure of the compensation committee's compensation policies 
applicable to the registrant's executive officers (including the named 
executive officers), including the specific relationship of corporate 
performance to executive compensation, is required with respect to 
compensation reported for the last completed fiscal year.
    (2) Discussion is required of the compensation committee's bases for 
the CEO's compensation reported for the last completed fiscal year, 
including the factors and criteria upon which the CEO's compensation was 
based. The committee shall include a specific discussion of the 
relationship of the registrant's performance to the CEO's compensation 
for the last completed fiscal year, describing each measure of the 
registrant's performance, whether qualitative or quantitative, on which 
the CEO's compensation was based.
    (3) The required disclosure shall be made over the name of each 
member of

[[Page 389]]

the registrant's compensation committee (or other board committee 
performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such 
committee, entire board of directors). If the board of directors 
modified or rejected in any material way any action or recommendation by 
such committee with respect to such decisions in the last completed 
fiscal year, the disclosure must so indicate and explain the reasons for 
the board's actions, and be made over the names of all members of the 
board.

Instructions to Item 402(k): 1. Boilerplate language should be avoided 
in describing factors and criteria underlying awards or payments of 
executive compensation in the statement required.
    2. Registrants are not required to disclose target levels with 
respect to specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related 
factors considered by the committee (or board), or any factors or 
criteria involving confidential commercial or business information, the 
disclosure of which would have an adverse effect on the registrant.

    (l) Performance graph. (1) Provide a line graph comparing the yearly 
percentage change in the registrant's cumulative total shareholder 
return on a class of common stock registered under section 12 of the 
Exchange Act (as measured by dividing (i) the sum of (A) the cumulative 
amount of dividends for the measurement period, assuming dividend 
reinvestment, and (B) the difference between the registrant's share 
price at the end and the beginning of the measurement period; by (ii) 
the share price at the beginning of the measurement period) with
    (i) the cumulative total return of a broad equity market index 
assuming reinvestment of dividends, that includes companies whose equity 
securities are traded on the same exchange or NASDAQ market or are of 
comparable market capitalization; Provided, however, That if the 
registrant is a company within the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, 
the registrant must use that index; and
    (ii) The cumulative total return, assuming reinvestment of 
dividends, of:
    (A) A published industry or line-of-business index;
    (B) Peer issuer(s) selected in good faith. If the registrant does 
not select its peer issuer(s) on an industry or line-of-business basis, 
the registrant shall disclose the basis for its selection; or
    (C) Issuer(s) with similar market capitalization(s), but only if the 
registrant does not use a published industry or line-of-business index 
and does not believe it can reasonably identify a peer group. If the 
registrant uses this alternative, the graph shall be accompanied by a 
statement of the reasons for this selection.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (l)(1) of this item, the term 
``measurement period'' shall be the period beginning at the 
``measurement point'' established by the market close on the last 
trading day before the beginning of the registrant's fifth preceding 
fiscal year, through and including the end of the registrant's last 
completed fiscal year. If the class of securities has been registered 
under section 12 of the Exchange Act for a shorter period of time, the 
period covered by the comparison may correspond to that time period.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) of this item, the term 
``published industry or line-of-business index'' means any index that is 
prepared by a party other than the registrant or an affiliate and is 
accessible to the registrant's security holders; provided, however, that 
registrants may use an index prepared by the registrant or affiliate if 
such index is widely recognized and used.
    (4) If the registrant selects a different index from an index used 
for the immediately preceding fiscal year, explain the reason(s) for 
this change and also compare the registrant's total return with that of 
both the newly selected index and the index used in the immediately 
preceding fiscal year.

Instructions to Item 402(l): 1. In preparing the required graphic 
comparisons, the registrant should:
    a. Use, to the extent feasible, comparable methods of presentation 
and assumptions for the total return calculations required by paragraph 
(l)(1) of this item; Provided, however, That if the registrant 
constructs its own peer group index under paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(B), the 
same methodology must be used in calculating both the registrant's total 
return and that on the peer group index; and
    b. Assume the reinvestment of dividends into additional shares of 
the same class of equity securities at the frequency with

[[Page 390]]

which dividends are paid on such securities during the applicable fiscal 
year.
    2. In constructing the graph:
    (a) The closing price at the measurement point must be converted 
into a fixed investment, stated in dollars, in the registrant's stock 
(or in the stocks represented by a given index), with cumulative returns 
for each subsequent fiscal year measured as a change from that 
investment; and
    (b) Each fiscal year should be plotted with points showing the 
cumulative total return as of that point. The value of the investment as 
of each point plotted on a given return line is the number of shares 
held at that point multiplied by the then-prevailing share price.
    3. The registrant is required to present information for the 
registrant's last five fiscal years, and may choose to graph a longer 
period; but the measurement point, however, shall remain the same.
    4. Registrants may include comparisons using performance measures in 
addition to total return, such as return on average common shareholders' 
equity, so long as the registrant's compensation committee (or other 
board committee performing equivalent functions or in the absence of any 
such committee, the entire board of directors) describes the link 
between that measure and the level of executive compensation in the 
statement required by paragraph (k) of this Item.
    5. If the registrant uses a peer issuer(s) comparison or comparison 
with issuer(s) with similar market capitalizations, the identity of 
those issuers must be disclosed and the returns of each component issuer 
of the group must be weighted according to the respective issuer's stock 
market capitalization at the beginning of each period for which a return 
is indicated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Changes in control. Describe any arrangements, known to the 
registrant, including any pledge by any person of securities of the 
registrant or any of its parents, the operation of which may at a 
subsequent date result in a change in control of the registrant.

Instructions to Item 403: 1. The percentages are to be calculated on the 
basis of the amount of outstanding securities, excluding securities held 
by or for the account of the registrant or its subsidiaries, plus 
securities deemed outstanding pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the 
Exchange Act 17 (CFR 240.13d-3(d)(1)). For purposes of paragraph (b), if 
the percentage of shares beneficially owned by any director or nominee, 
or by all directors and officers of the registrant as a group, does not 
exceed one percent of the class so owned, the registrant may, in lieu of 
furnishing a precise percentage, indicate this fact by means of an 
asterisk and explanatory footnote or other similar means.
    2. For the purposes of this Item, beneficial ownership shall be 
determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act 
(Sec. 240.13d-3 of this chapter). Include such additional subcolumns or 
other appropriate explanation of column (3) necessary to reflect amounts 
as to which the beneficial owner has (A) sole voting power, (B) shared 
voting power, (C) sole investment power, or (D) shared investment power.
    3. The registrant shall be deemed to know the contents of any 
statements filed with the Commission pursuant to section 13(d) or 13(g) 
of the Exchange Act. When applicable, a registrant may rely upon 
information set forth in such statements unless the registrant knows or 
has reason to believe that such information is not complete or accurate 
or that a statement or amendment should have been filed and was not.
    4. For purposes of furnishing information pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this Item, the registrant may indicate the source and date of such 
information.
    5. Where more than one beneficial owner is known to be listed for 
the same securities, appropriate disclosure should be made to avoid 
confusion. For purposes of paragraph (b), in computing the aggregate 
number of shares owned by directors and officers of the registrant as a 
group, the same shares shall not be counted more than once.
    6. Paragraph (c) of this Item does not require a description of 
ordinary default provisions contained in the charter, trust indentures 
or other governing instruments relating to securities of the registrant.
    7. Where the holder(s) of voting securities reported pursuant to 
paragraph (a) hold more than five percent of any class of voting 
securities of the registrant pursuant to any voting trust or similar 
agreement, state the title of such securities, the amount held or to be 
held pursuant to the trust or agreement (if not clear from the table) 
and the duration of the agreement. Give the names and addresses of the 
voting trustees and outline briefly their voting rights and other powers 
under the trust or agreement.

Sec. 229.404  (Item 404)  Certain relationships and related transactions.

    (a) Transactions with management and others. Describe briefly any 
transaction, or series of similar transactions, since the beginning of 
the registrant's last fiscal year, or any currently proposed 
transaction, or series of similar transactions, to which the registrant 
or any of its subsidiaries was or is to be a party, in which the amount 
involved exceeds $60,000 and in which any of the following persons had, 
or will have, a direct or indirect material interest, naming such person 
and indicating the person's relationship to the registrant, the nature 
of such person's interest in the transaction(s), the amount of such 
transaction(s) and, where practicable, the amount of such person's 
interest in the transaction(s):
    (1) Any director or executive officer of the registrant;
    (2) Any nominee for election as a director;
    (3) Any security holder who is known to the registrant to own of 
record or beneficially more than five percent of any class of the 
registrant's voting securities; and

[[Page 392]]

    (4) Any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing 
persons.

Instructions to Paragraph (a) of Item 404: 1. The materiality of any 
interest is to be determined on the basis of the significance of the 
information to investors in light of all the circumstances of the 
particular case. The importance of the interest to the person having the 
interest, the relationship of the parties to the transaction with each 
other and the amount involved in the transactions are among the factors 
to be considered in determining the significance of the information to 
investors.
    2. For purposes of paragraph (a), a person's immediate family shall 
include such person's spouse; parents; children; siblings; mothers and 
fathers-in-law; sons and daughters-in-law; and brothers and sisters-in-
law.
    3. In computing the amount involved in the transaction or series of 
similar transactions, include all periodic installments in the case of 
any lease or other agreement providing for periodic payments or 
installments.
    4. The amount of the interest of any person specified in paragraphs 
(a) (1) through (4) shall be computed without regard to the amount of 
the profit or loss involved in the transaction(s).
    5. In describing any transaction involving the purchase or sale of 
assets by or to the registrant or any of its subsidiaries, otherwise 
than in the ordinary course of business, state the cost of the assets to 
the purchaser and, if acquired by the seller within two years prior to 
the transaction, the cost thereof to the seller. Indicate the principle 
followed in determining the registrant's purchase or sale price and the 
name of the person making such determination.
    6. Information shall be furnished in answer to paragraph (a) with 
respect to transactions that involve remuneration from the registrant or 
its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to any of the persons 
specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) for services in any capacity 
unless the interest of such person arises solely from the ownership 
individually and in the aggregate of less than ten percent of any class 
of equity securities of another corporation furnishing the services to 
the registrant or its subsidiaries.
    7. No information need be given in answer to paragraph (a) as to any 
transactions where:
    A. The rates or charges involved in the transaction are determined 
by competitive bids, or the transaction involves the rendering of 
services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or 
charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority;
    B. The transaction involves services as a bank depositary of funds, 
transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar 
services; or
    C. The interest of the person specified in paragraphs (a) (1) 
through (4) arises solely from the ownership of securities of the 
registrant and such person receives no extra or special benefit not 
shared on a pro rata basis.
    8. Paragraph (a) requires disclosure of indirect, as well as direct, 
material interests in transactions. A person who has a position or 
relationship with a firm, corporation, or other entity that engages in a 
transaction with the registrant or its subsidiaries may have an indirect 
interest in such transaction by reason of such position or relationship. 
Such an interest, however, shall not be deemed ``material'' within the 
meaning of paragraph (a) where:
    A. The interest arises only: (i) From such person's position as a 
director of another corporation or organization which is a party to the 
transaction; or (ii) from the direct or indirect ownership by such 
person and all other persons specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through 
(4), in the aggregate, of less than a ten percent equity interest in 
another person (other than a partnership) which is a party to the 
transaction; or (iii) from both such position and ownership;
    B. The interest arises only from such person's position as a limited 
partner in a partnership in which the person and all other persons 
specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) have an interest of less 
than ten percent; or
    C. The interest of such person arises solely from the holding of an 
equity interest (including a limited partnership interest, but excluding 
a general partnership interest) or a creditor interest in another person 
that is a party to the transaction with the registrant or any of its 
subsidiaries, and the transaction is not material to such other person.
    9. There may be situations where, although these instrucions do not 
expressly authorize nondisclosure, the interest of a person specified in 
paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) in a particular transaction or series of 
transactions is not a direct or indirect material interest. In that 
case, information regarding such interest and transaction is not 
required to be disclosed in response to this paragraph.

    (b) Certain business relationships. Describe any of the following 
relationships regarding directors or nominees for director that exist, 
or have existed during the registrant's last fiscal year, indicating the 
identity of the entity with which the registrant has such a 
relationship, the name of the nominee or director affiliated with such 
entity and the nature of such nominee's or director's affiliation, the 
relationship between such entity and the registrant and the amount of 
the business done

[[Page 393]]

between the registrant and the entity during the registrant's last full 
fiscal year or proposed to be done during the registrant's current 
fiscal year:
    (1) If the nominee or director is, or during the last fiscal year 
has been, an executive officer of, or owns, or during the last fiscal 
year has owned, of record or beneficially in excess of ten percent 
equity interest in, any business or professional entity that has made 
during the registrant's last full fiscal year, or proposes to make 
during the registrant's current fiscal year, payments to the registrant 
or its subsidiaries for property or services in excess of five percent 
of (i) the registrant's consolidated gross revenues for its last full 
fiscal year, or (ii) the other entity's consolidated gross revenues for 
its last full fiscal year;
    (2) If the nominee or director is, or during the last fiscal year 
has been, an executive officer of, or owns, or during the last fiscal 
year has owned, of record or beneficially in excess of ten percent 
equity interest in, any business or professional entity to which the 
registrant or its subsidiaries has made during the registrant's last 
full fiscal year, or proposes to make during the registrant's current 
fiscal year, payments for property or services in excess of five percent 
of (i) the registrant's consolidated gross revenues for its last full 
fiscal year, or (ii) the other entity's consolidated gross revenues for 
its last full fiscal year;
    (3) If the nominee or director is, or during the last fiscal year 
has been, an executive officer of, or owns, or during the last fiscal 
year has owned, of record or beneficially in excess of ten percent 
equity interest in, any business or professional entity to which the 
registrant or its subsidiaries was indebted at the end of the 
registrant's last full fiscal year in an aggregate amount in excess of 
five percent of the registrant's total consolidated assets at the end of 
such fiscal year;
    (4) If the nominee or director is, or during the last fiscal year 
has been, a member of, or of counsel to, a law firm that the issuer has 
retained during the last fiscal year or proposes to retain during the 
current fiscal year; Provided, however, that the dollar amount of fees 
paid to a law firm by the registrant need not be disclosed if such 
amount does not exceed five percent of the law firm's gross revenues for 
that firm's last full fiscal year;
    (5) If the nominee or director is, or during the last fiscal year 
has been, a partner or executive officer of any investment banking firm 
that has performed services for the registrant, other than as a 
participating underwriter in a syndicate, during the last fiscal year or 
that the registrant proposes to have perform services during the current 
year; Provided, however, That the dollar amount of compensation received 
by an investment banking firm need not be disclosed if such amount does 
not exceed five percent of the investment banking firm's consolidated 
gross revenues for that firm's last full fiscal year; or
    (6) Any other relationships that the registrant is aware of between 
the nominee or director and the registrant that are substantially 
similar in nature and scope to those relationships listed in paragraphs 
(b) (1) through (5).

Instructions to Paragraph (b) of Item 404: 1. In order to determine 
whether payments or indebtedness exceed five percent of the consolidated 
gross revenues of any entity, other than the registrant, it is 
appropriate to rely on information provided by the nominee or director.
    2. In calculating payments for property and services the following 
may be excluded:
    A. Payments where the rates or charges involved in the transaction 
are determined by competitive bids, or the transaction involves the 
rendering of services as a common contract carrier, or public utility, 
at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental

    C. Payments made or received by subsidiaries other than significant 
subsidiaries as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X [Sec. 210.1-
02(w) of this chapter], provided that all such subsidiaries making or

indebtedness, when considered in the aggregate as a single subsidiary, 
would not constitute a significant subsidiary as defined in Rule 1-
02(w).
    4. No information called for by paragraph (b) need be given 
respecting any director who is no longer a director at the time of 
filing the registration statement or report containing such disclosure. 
If such information is being presented in a proxy or information 
statement, no information need be given respecting any director whose 
term of office as a director will not continue after the meeting to 
which the statement relates.

    (c) Indebtedness of management. If any of the following persons has 
been indebted to the registrant or its subsidiaries at any time since 
the beginning of the registrant's last fiscal year in an amount in 
excess of $60,000, indicate the name of such person, the nature of the

thereof outstanding as of the latest practicable date and the rate of 
interest paid or charged thereon:
    (1) Any director or executive officer of the registrant;
    (2) Any nominee for election as a director;

(c), the members of a person's immediate family are those persons 
specified in Instruction 2 to Item 404(a).
    2. Exclude from the determination of the amount of indebtedness all 
amounts due from the particular person for purchases subject to usual 
trade terms, for ordinary travel and expense payments and for other 
transactions in the ordinary course of business.
    3. If the lender is a bank, savings and loan association, or broker-
dealer extending credit under Federal Reserve Regulation T [12 CFR part 
220] and the loans are not disclosed as nonaccrual, past due, 
restructured or potential problems (see Item III.C. 1. and 2. of 
Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies), 
disclosure may consist of a statement, if such is the case, that the

16(b) of the Exchange Act and has not been discharged by payment, state 
the amount of any profit realized, that such profit will inure to the 
benefit of the registrant or its subsidiaries and whether suit will be 
brought or other steps taken to recover such profit. If, in the opinion 
of counsel, a question reasonably exists as to the recoverability of 
such profit, it will suffice to state all facts necessary to describe 
the transactions, including the prices and number of shares involved.

    (d) Transactions with promoters. Registrants that have been 
organized within the past five years and that are filing a registration 
statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act (Sec. 239.11 of this 
chapter) or on Form 10 and Form 10-SB under the Exchange Act

received by the registrant; and

[[Page 395]]

    (2) As to any assets acquired or to be acquired by the registrant 
from a promoter, state the amount at which the assets were acquired or 
are to be acquired and the principle followed or to be followed in 
determining such amount and identify the persons making the 
determination and their relationship, if any, with the registrant or any 
promoter. If the assets were acquired by the promoter within two years 
prior to their transfer to the registrant, also state the cost thereof 
to the promoter.

Instructions to Item 404: 1. No information need be given in response to 
any paragraph of Item 404 as to any compensation or other transaction 
reported in response to any other paragraph of Item 404 or to Item 402

compensation with respect to which information may be omitted pursuant 
to Item 402.
    2. If the information called for by Item 404 is being presented in a 
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act or the 
Exchange Act, information shall be given for the periods specified in 
the Item and, in addition, for the two fiscal years preceding the 
registrant's last fiscal year.

extent that the registrant discloses to its security holders or 
otherwise makes public the information specified in that Item.

<R05>
Sec. 229.405  (Item 405) Compliance with section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

    Every registrant having a class of equity securities registered 
pursuant to section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l), every 
closed-end investment company registered under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.), and every holding company 
registered pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 
(15 U.S.C. 79a et seq.) shall:
    (a) Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 (Sec. 249.103) and 4 
(Sec. 249.104) and amendments thereto furnished to the registrant 
pursuant to Sec. 240.16a-3(e) during its most recent fiscal year and 
Forms 5 and amendments thereto (Sec. 249.105) furnished to the 
registrant with respect to its most recent fiscal year, and any written 
representation referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this Item.
    (1) Under the caption ``Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting 
Compliance,'' identify each person who, at any time during the fiscal 
year, was a director, officer, beneficial owner of more than ten percent 
of any class of equity securities of the registrant registered pursuant 
to section 12 of the Exchange Act, or any other person subject to 
section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to the registrant because of 
the requirements of section 30 of the Investment Company Act or section 
17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (``reporting person'') that 
failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the above Forms, 
reports required by section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the most 
recent fiscal year or prior fiscal years.
    (2) For each such person, set forth the number of late reports, the 
number of transactions that were not reported on a timely basis, and any 
known failure to file a required Form. A known failure to file would 
include, but not be limited to, a failure to file a Form 3, which is 
required of all reporting persons, and a failure to file a Form 5 in the 
absence of the written representation referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section, unless the registrant otherwise knows that no Form 5 is 
required.
    Note: The disclosure requirement is based on a review of the forms 
submitted to the registrant during and with respect to its most recent 
fiscal year, as specified above. Accordingly, a failure to file timely 
need only be disclosed once. For example, if in the most recently 
concluded fiscal year a reporting person filed a Form 4 disclosing a 
transaction that took place in the prior fiscal year, and should have 
been reported in that year, the registrant should disclose that late 
filing and transaction pursuant to this Item 405 with respect to the 
most recently concluded fiscal year, but not in material filed with 
respect to subsequent years.

    (b) With respect to the disclosure required by paragraph (a) of this 
Item:
    (1) A form received by the registrant within three calendar days of 
the required filing date may be presumed to have been filed with the 
Commission by the required filing date.

[[Page 396]]

    (2) If the registrant (i) receives a written representation from the 
reporting person that no Form 5 is required; and (ii) maintains the 
representation for two years, making a copy available to the Commission 
or its staff upon request, the registrant need not identify such 
reporting person pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Item as having failed 
to file a Form 5 with respect to that fiscal year.

    The registrant must furnish the following information in plain 
English. See Sec. 230.421(d) of Regulation C of this chapter.
    (a) Front cover page of the registration statement. Where 
appropriate, include the delaying amendment legend from

Sec. 230.473 of Regulation C of this chapter.
    (b) Outside front cover page of the prospectus. Limit the outside 
cover page to one page. If the following information applies to your 
offering, disclose it on the outside cover page of the prospectus.
    (1) Name. The registrant's name. A foreign registrant must give the 
English translation of its name.

Instruction to paragraph 501(b)(1): If your name is the same as that of 
a company that is well known, include information to eliminate any 
possible confusion with the other company. If your name indicates a line 
of business in which you are not engaged or you are engaged only to a 
limited extent, include information to eliminate any misleading 
inference as to your business. In some circumstances, disclosure may not 
be sufficient and you may be required to change your name. You will not 
be required to change your name if you are an established company, the 
character of your business has changed, and the investing public is 
generally aware of the change and the character of your current 
business.

    (2) Title and amount of securities. The title and amount of 
securities offered. Separately state the amount of securities offered by 
selling security holders, if any. If the underwriter has any arrangement 
with the issuer, such as an over-allotment option, under which the 
underwriter may purchase additional shares in connection with the 
offering, indicate that this arrangement exists and state the amount of 
additional shares that the underwriter may purchase under the 
arrangement. Give a brief description of the securities except where the 
information is clear from the title of the security. For example, you 
are not required to describe common stock that has full voting, dividend 
and liquidation rights usually associated with common stock.
    (3) Offering price of the securities. Where you offer securities for 
cash, the price to the public of the securities, the underwriter's 
discounts and commissions, the net proceeds you receive, and any selling 
shareholder's net proceeds. Show this information on both a per share or 
unit basis and for the total amount of the offering. If you make the 
offering on a minimum/maximum basis, show this information based on the 
total minimum and total maximum amount of the offering. You may present 
the information in a table, term sheet format, or other clear 
presentation. You may present the information in any format that fits 
the design of the cover page so long as the information can be easily 
read and is not misleading:

Instructions to paragraph 501(b)(3): 1. If a preliminary prospectus is 
circulated and you are not subject to the reporting requirements of 
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, provide, as applicable:
    (A) A bona fide estimate of the range of the maximum offering price 
and the maximum number of securities offered; or
    (B) A bona fide estimate of the principal amount of the debt 
securities offered.
    2. If it is impracticable to state the price to the public, explain 
the method by which the price is to be determined. If the securities are 
to be offered at the market price, or if the offering price is to be 
determined by a formula related to the market price, indicate the market 
and market price of the securities as of the latest practicable date.
    3. If you file a registration statement on Form S-8, you are not 
required to comply with this paragraph (b)(3).

    (4) Market for the securities. Whether any national securities 
exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market lists the securities offered, naming 
the particular

[[Page 397]]

market(s), and identifying the trading symbol(s) for those securities;

including the page number where it appears in the prospectus. Highlight 
this cross-reference by prominent type or in another manner;
    (6) State legend. Any legend or statement required by the law of any 
state in which the securities are to be offered. You may combine this 
with any legend required by the SEC, if appropriate;
    (7) Commission legend. A legend that indicates that neither the 
Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission 
has approved or disapproved of the securities or passed upon the 
accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures in the prospectus and that any 
contrary representation is a criminal offense. You may use one of the 
following or other clear, plain language:

    Example A: Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any 
state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these 
securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. 
Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

    Example B: Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any 
state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these 
securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any 
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

    (8) Underwriting. (i) Name(s) of the lead or managing underwriter(s) 
and an identification of the nature of the underwriting arrangements;
    (ii) If the offering is not made on a firm commitment basis, a brief 
description of the underwriting arrangements. You may use any clear, 
concise, and accurate description of the underwriting arrangements. You 
may use the following descriptions of underwriting arrangements where 
appropriate:

    Example A: Best efforts offering. The underwriters are not required 
to sell any specific number or dollar amount of securities but will use 
their best efforts to sell the securities offered.

    Example B: Best efforts, minimum-maximum offering. The underwriters 
must sell the minimum number of securities offered (insert number) if 
any are sold. The underwriters are required to use only their best 
efforts to sell the maximum number of securities offered (insert 
number).

    (iii) If you offer the securities on a best efforts or best efforts 
minimum/maximum basis, the date the offering will end, any minimum 
purchase requirements, and any arrangements to place the funds in an 
escrow, trust, or similar account. If you have not made any of these 
arrangements, state this fact and describe the effect on investors;
    (9) Date of prospectus. The date of the prospectus;
    (10) Prospectus ``Subject to Completion'' legend. If you use the 
prospectus before the effective date of the registration statement, a 
prominent statement that:
    (i) The information in the prospectus will be amended or completed;
    (ii) A registration statement relating to these securities has been 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
    (iii) The securities may not be sold until the registration 
statement becomes effective; and
    (iv) The prospectus is not an offer to sell the securities and it is 
not soliciting an offer to buy the securities in any state where offers 
or sales are not permitted. The legend may be in the following or other 
clear, plain language:

    The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be 
changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration 
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is 
effective. This prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and 
it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where 
the offer or sale is not permitted.

    (11) If you use Sec. 230.430A of this chapter to omit pricing 
information and the prospectus is used before you determine the public 
offering price, the information and legend in paragraph (b)(10) of this 
section.

[63 FR 6381, Feb. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 229.502  (Item 502) Inside front and outside back cover pages of prospectus.

    The registrant must furnish this information in plain English. See

[[Page 398]]

Sec. 230.421(d) of Regulation C of this chapter.
    (a) Table of contents. On either the inside front or outside back 
cover page of the prospectus, provide a reasonably detailed table of 
contents. It must show the page number of the various sections or 
subdivisions of the prospectus. Include a specific listing of the risk 
factors section required by Item 503 of this Regulation S-K (17 CFR 
229.503). You must include the table of contents immediately following 
the cover page in any prospectus you deliver electronically.
    (b) Dealer prospectus delivery obligation. On the outside back cover 
page of the prospectus, advise dealers of their prospectus delivery 
obligation, including the expiration date specified by Section 4(3) of 
the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(3)) and Sec. 230.174 of this chapter. 
If you do not know the expiration date on the effective date of the 
registration statement, include the expiration date in the copy of the 
prospectus you file under Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter. You do not 
have to include this information if dealers are not required to deliver 
a prospectus under Sec. 230.174 of this chapter or Section 24(d) of the 
Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24). You may use the following or 
other clear, plain language:

                  Dealer Prospectus Delivery Obligation

    Until (insert date), all dealers that effect transactions in these 
securities, whether or not participating in this offering, may be 
required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealers' 
obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriters and with 
respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.

[63 FR 6383, Feb. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 229.503  (Item 503) Prospectus summary, risk factors, and ratio of earnings to fixed charges.

    The registrant must furnish this information in plain English. See 
Sec. 230.421(d) of Regulation C of this chapter.
    (a) Prospectus summary. Provide a summary of the information in the 
prospectus where the length or complexity of the prospectus makes a 
summary useful. The summary should be brief. The summary should not 
contain, and is not required to contain, all of the detailed information 
in the prospectus. If you provide summary business or financial 
information, even if you do not caption it as a summary, you still must 
provide that information in plain English.

Instruction to paragraph 503(a): The summary should not merely repeat 
the text of the prospectus but should provide a brief overview of the 
key aspects of the offering. Carefully consider and identify those 
aspects of the offering that are the most significant and determine how 
best to highlight those points in clear, plain language.

    (b) Address and telephone number. Include, either on the cover page 
or in the summary section of the prospectus, the complete mailing 
address and telephone number of your principal executive offices.
    (c) Risk factors. Where appropriate, provide under the caption 
``Risk Factors'' a discussion of the most significant factors that make 
the offering speculative or risky. This discussion must be concise and 
organized logically. Do not present risks that could apply to any issuer 
or any offering. Explain how the risk affects the issuer or the 
securities being offered. Set forth each risk factor under a subcaption 
that adequately describes the risk. The risk factor discussion must 
immediately follow the summary section. If you do not include a summary 
section, the risk factor section must immediately follow the cover page 
of the prospectus or the pricing information section that immediately 
follows the cover page. Pricing information means price and price-
related information that you may omit from the prospectus in an 
effective registration statement based on Sec. 230.430A(a) of this 
chapter. The risk factors may include, among other things, the 
following:
    (1) Your lack of an operating history;
    (2) Your lack of profitable operations in recent periods;
    (3) Your financial position;
    (4) Your business or proposed business; or
    (5) The lack of a market for your common equity securities or 
securities convertible into or exercisable for common equity securities.
    (d) Ratio of earnings to fixed charges. If you register debt 
securities, show a

[[Page 399]]

ratio of earnings to fixed charges. If you register preference equity 
securities, show the ratio of combined fixed charges and preference 
dividends to earnings. Present the ratio for each of the last five 
fiscal years and the latest interim period for which financial 
statements are presented in the document. If you will use the proceeds 
from the sale of debt or preference securities to repay any of your 
outstanding debt or to retire other securities and the change in the 
ratio would be ten percent or greater, you must include a ratio showing 
the application of the proceeds, commonly referred to as the pro forma 
ratio.

Instructions to paragraph 503(d): 1. Definitions. In calculating the 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, you must use the following 
definitions:
    (A) Fixed charges. The term ``fixed charges'' means the sum of the 
following: (a) interest expensed and capitalized, (b) amortized 
premiums, discounts and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness, 
(c) an estimate of the interest within rental expense, and (d) 
preference security dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries.
    (B) Preference security dividend. The term ``preference security 
dividend'' is the amount of pre-tax earnings that is required to pay the 
dividends on outstanding preference securities. The dividend requirement 
must be computed as the amount of the dividend divided by (1 minus the 
effective income tax rate applicable to continuing operations).
    (C) Earnings. The term ``earnings'' is the amount resulting from 
adding and subtracting the following items. Add the following: (a) Pre-
tax income from continuing operations before adjustment for minority 
interests in consolidated subsidiaries or income or loss from equity 
investees, (b) fixed charges, (c) amortization of capitalized interest, 
(d) distributed income of equity investees, and (e) your share of pre-
tax losses of equity investees for which charges arising from guarantees 
are included in fixed charges. From the total of the added items, 
subtract the following: (a) interest capitalized, (b) preference 
security dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries, and (c) the 
minority interest in pre-tax income of subsidiaries that have not 
incurred fixed charges. Equity investees are investments that you 
account for using the equity method of accounting. Public utilities 
following SFAS 71 should not add amortization of capitalized interest in 
determining earnings, nor reduce fixed charges by any allowance for 
funds used during construction.
    2. Disclosure. Disclose the following information when showing the 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges:
    (A) Deficiency. If a ratio indicates less than one-to-one coverage, 
disclose the dollar amount of the deficiency.
    (B) Pro forma ratio. You may show the pro forma ratio only for the 
most recent fiscal year and the latest interim period. Use the net 
change in interest or dividends from the refinancing to calculate the 
pro forma ratio.
    (C) Foreign private issuers. A foreign private issuer must show the 
ratio based on the figures in the primary financial statement. A foreign 
private issuer must show the ratio based on the figures resulting from 
the reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles if 
this ratio is materially different.
    (D) Summary Section. If you provide a summary or similar section in 
the prospectus, show the ratios in that section.
    3. Exhibit. File an exhibit to the registration statement to show 
the figures used to calculate the ratios. See paragraph (b)(12) of Item 
601 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.601(b)(12)).

[63 FR 6383, Feb. 6, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 229.504  (Item 504) Use of proceeds.

    State the principal purposes for which the net proceeds to the 
registrant from the securities to be offered are intended to be used and 
the approximate amount intended to be used for each such purpose. Where 
registrant has no current specific plan for the proceeds, or a 
significant portion thereof, the registrant shall so state and discuss 
the principal reasons for the offering.

Instructions to Item 504: 1. Where less than all the securities to be 
offered may be sold and more than one use is listed for the proceeds, 
indicate the order of priority of such purposes and discuss the 
registrant's plans if substantially less than the maximum proceeds are 
obtained. Such discussion need not be included if underwriting 
arrangements with respect to such securities are such that, if any 
securities are sold to the public, it reasonably can be expected that 
the actual proceeds will not be substantially less than the aggregate 
proceeds to the registrant shown pursuant to Item 501 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.501).
    2. Details of proposed expenditures need not be given; for example, 
there need be furnished only a brief outline of any program of 
construction or addition of equipment. Consideration should be given as 
to the need to include a discussion of certain matters addressed in the 
discussion and analysis of registrant's financial condition and results 
of

operations, such as liquidity and capital expenditures.
    3. If any material amounts of other funds are necessary to 
accomplish the specified purposes for which the proceeds are to be 
obtained, state the amounts and sources of such other funds needed for 
each such specified purpose and the sources thereof.
    4. If any material part of the proceeds is to be used to discharge 
indebtedness, set forth the interest rate and maturity of such 
indebtedness. If the indebtedness to be discharged was incurred within 
one year, describe the use of the proceeds of such indebtedness other 
than short-term borrowings used for working capital.
    5. If any material amount of the proceeds is to be used to acquire 
assets, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, describe 
briefly and state the cost of the assets and, where such assets are to 
be acquired from affiliates of the registrant or their associates, give 
the names of the persons from whom they are to be acquired and set forth 
the principle followed in determining the cost to the registrant.

used to finance acquisitions of other businesses, the identity of such 
businesses, if known, or, if not known, the nature of the businesses to 
be sought, the status of any negotiations with respect to the 
acquisition, and a brief description of such business shall be included. 
Where, however, pro forma financial statements reflecting such 
acquisition are not required by Regulation S-X to be included, in the 
registration statement, the possible terms of any transaction, the 
identification of the parties thereto or the nature of the business 
sought need not be disclosed, to the extent that the registrant 
reasonably determines that public disclosure of such information would 
jeopardize the acquisition. Where Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210) would 
require financial statements of the business to be acquired to be 
included, the description of the business to be acquired shall be more 
detailed.
    7. The registrant may reserve the right to change the use of 
proceeds, provided that such reservation is due to certain contingencies 
that are discussed specifically and the alternatives to such use in that 
event are indicated.

or 15(d) of the Exchange Act immediately prior to filing of the 
registration statement, there shall be included a comparison of the 
public contribution under the proposed public offering and the effective 
cash contribution of such persons. In such cases, and in other instances

shall be disclosed:
    (a) The net tangible book value per share before and after the

Instruction to Paragraph 508(a): All that is required as to the nature 
of the underwriters' obligation is whether the underwriters are or will 
be committed to take and to pay for all of the securities if any are 
taken, or whether it is merely an agency or the type of best efforts 
arrangement under which the underwriters are required to take and to pay 
for only such securities as they may sell to the public. Conditions 
precedent to the underwriters' taking the securities, including market-
outs, need not be described except in the case of an agency or best 
efforts arrangement.

    (b) New underwriters. Where securities being registered are those of 
a registrant that has not previously been required to file reports 
pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or where a 
prospectus is required to include reference on its cover page to

shall be disclosed in the prospectus together with, where applicable, 
the disclosures that the principal business function of such 
underwriter(s) will be to sell the securities to be registered, or that 
the promoters of the registrant have a material relationship with such 
underwriter(s). Sufficient details shall be given to allow full 
appreciation of such underwriter(s) experience and its relationship with 
the registrant, promoters and their controlling persons.
    (c) Other distributions. Outline briefly the plan of distribution of 
any securities to be registered that are to be offered otherwise than

interest reinvestment plan the terms of which provide for the purchase 
of some securities on the market, state whether the registrant or the 
participant pays fees, commissions, and expenses incurred in connection 
with the plan. If the participant will pay such fees, commissions and 
expenses, state the anticipated cost to participants by transaction or 
other convenient reference.
    (2) If the securities are to be offered through the selling efforts 
of brokers or dealers, describe the plan of distribution and the terms 
of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding entered into with 
broker(s) or dealer(s) prior to the effective date of the registration 
statement, including volume limitations on sales, parties to the 
agreement and the conditions under which the agreement may be 
terminated. If known, identify the broker(s) or dealer(s) which will 
participate in the offering and state the amount to be offered through 
each.
    (3) If any of the securities being registered are to be offered 
otherwise than for cash, state briefly the general purposes of the 
distribution, the basis upon which the securities are to be offered, the 
amount of compensation and other expenses of distribution, and by whom 
they are to be borne. If the distribution is to be made pursuant to a 
plan of acquisition, reorganization, readjustment or succession, 
describe briefly the general effect of the plan and state when it became 
or is to become operative. As to any material amount of assets to be 
acquired under the plan, furnish information corresponding to that 
required by Instruction 5 of Item 504 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.504).

[[Page 402]]

    (d) Offerings on exchange. If the securities are to be offered on an 
exchange, indicate the exchange. If the registered securities are to be 
offered in connection with the writing of exchange-traded call options, 
describe briefly such transactions.
    (e) Underwriter's compensation. Provide a table that sets out the 
nature of the compensation and the amount of discounts and commissions 
to be paid to the underwriter for each security and in total. The table 
must show the separate amounts to be paid by the company and the selling 
shareholders. In addition, include in the table all other items 
considered by the National Association of Securities Dealers to be 
underwriting compensation for purposes of that Association's Rules of 
Fair Practice.

Instructions to paragraph 508(e): 1. The term ``commissions'' is defined 
in paragraph (17) of Schedule A of the Securities Act. Show separately

security holders. Also show in the table commissions paid by other 
persons. Disclose any finder's fee or similar payments in the table.
    2. Disclose the offering expenses specified in Item 511 of 
Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.511).
    3. If the underwriter has any arrangement with the issuer, such as 
an over-allotment option, under which the underwriter may purchase 
additional shares in connection with the offering, indicate that this 
arrangement exists and state the amount of additional shares that the 
underwriter may purchase under the arrangement. Where the underwriter 
has such an arrangement, present maximum-minimum information in a 
separate column to the table, based on the purchase of all or none of 
the shares subject to the arrangement. Describe the key terms of the 
arrangement in the narrative.

    (f) Underwriter's representative on board of directors. Describe any 
arrangement whereby the underwriter has the right to designate or 
nominate a member or members of the board of directors of the 
registrant. The registrant shall disclose the identity of any director 
so designated or nominated, and indicate whether or not a person so 
designated or nominated, or allowed to be designated or nominated by the 
underwriter is or may be a director, officer, partner, employee or 
affiliate of the underwriter.
    (g) Indemnification of underwriters. If the underwriting agreement 
provides for indemnification by the registrant of the underwriters or 
their controlling persons against any liability arising under the 
Securities Act, furnish a brief description of such indemnification 
provisions.
    (h) Dealers' compensation. State briefly the discounts and 
commissions to be allowed or paid to dealers, including all cash, 
securities, contracts or other considerations to be received by any 
dealer in connection with the sale of the securities. If any dealers are 
to act in the capacity of sub-underwriters and are to be allowed or paid 
any additional discounts or commissions for acting in such capacity, a 
general statement to that effect will suffice without giving the 
additional amounts to be sold.
    (i) Finders. Identify any finder and, if applicable, describe the 
nature of any material relationship between such finder and the 
registrant, its officers, directors, principal stockholders, finders or 
promoters or the principal underwriter(s), or if there is a managing 
underwriter(s), the managing underwriter(s), (including, in each case, 
affiliates or associates thereof).

requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, identify any 
principal underwriter that intends to sell to any accounts over which it 
exercises discretionary authority and include an estimate of the amount 
of securities so intended to be sold. The response to this paragraph 
shall be contained in a pre-effective amendment which shall be 
circulated if the information is not available when the registration 
statement is filed.
    (k) Passive market making. If the underwriters or any selling group 
members intend to engage in passive market making transactions as 
permitted by Rule 103 of Regulation M (Sec. 242.103 of this chapter), 
indicate such intention and briefly describe passive market making.
    (l) Stabilization and other transactions. (1) Briefly describe any 
transaction that the underwriter intends to conduct during the offering 
that stabilizes,

[[Page 403]]

maintains, or otherwise affects the market price of the offered 
securities. Include information on stabilizing transactions, syndicate 
short covering transactions, penalty bids, or any other transaction that 
affects the offered security's price. Describe the nature of the 
transactions clearly and explain how the transactions affect the offered 
security's price. Identify the exchange or other market on which these 
transactions may occur. If true, disclose that the underwriter may 
discontinue these transactions at any time;
    (2) If the stabilizing began before the effective date of the 
registration statement, disclose the amount of securities bought, the 
prices at which they were bought and the period within which they were 
bought. If you use Sec. 230.430A of this chapter, the prospectus you 
file under Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter or include in a post-
effective amendment must contain information on the stabilizing 
transactions that took place before the determination of the public 
offering price; and
    (3) If you are making a warrants or rights offering of securities to 
existing security holders and any securities not purchased by existing 
security holders are to be reoffered to the public, disclose in a 
supplement to the prospectus or in the prospectus used in connection 
with the reoffering:

period by the underwriter and the price or price ranges at which the

    (v) The amount of the offered securities that will be reoffered to 
the public and the public offering price.

S-K (Sec. 229.702), if the undertaking required by paragraph (h) of Item 
512 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512) is not required to be included in

registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as 
expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable.

each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to 
section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is 
incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed 
to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered 
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be 
deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

    (c) Warrants and rights offerings. Include the following, with 
appropriate modifications to suit the particular case, if the securities

proposed to be made.

the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be 
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities 
offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall 
be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
    (h) Request for acceleration of effective date or filing of 
registration statement on Form S-8. Include the following if 
acceleration is requested of the effective date of the registration 
statement pursuant to Rule 461 under the Securities

[[Page 407]]

Act (Sec. 230.461 of this chapter), or if the registration statement is 
filed on Form S-8, and:
    (1) Any provision or arrangement exists whereby the registrant may 
indemnify a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant 
against liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or
    (2) The underwriting agreement contains a provision whereby the 
registrant indemnifies the underwriter or controlling persons of the 
underwriter against such liabilities and a director, officer or 
controlling person of the registrant is such an underwriter or 
controlling person thereof or a member of any firm which is such an 
underwriter, and
    (3) The benefits of such indemnification are not waived by such 
persons:

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities 
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling 
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or 
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against 
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities 
(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the 
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by 
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the 
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion 
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such 
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act 
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

    (i) Include the following in a registration statement permitted by 
Rule 430A under the Securities Act of 1933 (Sec. 230.430A of this 
chapter):

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:
    (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities 
Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed 
as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and 
contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to 
Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be 
deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was 
declared effective.
    (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the 
Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a 
form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement 
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such 
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide 
offering thereof.

    (j) Qualification of trust indentures under the Trust Indenture Act 
of 1939 for delayed offerings. Include the following if the registrant 
intends to rely on section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 
for determining the eligibility of the trustee under indentures for 
securities to be issued, offered, or sold on a delayed basis by or on 
behalf of the registrant:

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for 
the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under 
subsection (a) of section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act (``Act'') in 
accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission 
under section 305(b)(2) of the Act.

Sec. 229.601  (Item 601) Exhibits.

    (a) Exhibits and index required. (1) Subject to Rule 411(c) 
(Sec. 230.411(c) of this chapter) under the Securities Act and Rule 12b-
32 (Sec. 240.12b-32 of this chapter) under the Exchange Act regarding 
incorporation of exhibits by reference, the exhibits required in the 
exhibit table shall be filed as indicated, as part of the registration 
statement or report. Financial Data Schedules required by paragraph 
(b)(27) of this Item shall be submitted pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this Item. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 
(b)(27) and (c) of this Item, registered investment companies and 
business development companies filing on forms available solely to 
investment companies shall be subject to the

[[Page 408]]

provisions of rule 483 under the Securities Act of 1933 (Sec. 230.483 of 
this chapter), and any provision or instruction therein shall be 
controlling with respect to registered investment companies and business 
development companies unless otherwise specifically provided in rules or 
instructions pertaining to the submission of a specific form.
    (2) Each registration statement or report shall contain an exhibit 
index, which shall precede immediately the exhibits filed with such 
registration statement. For convenient reference, each exhibit shall be 
listed in the exhibit index according to the number assigned to it in 
the exhibit table. The exhibit index shall indicate, by handwritten, 
typed, printed, or other legible form of notation in the manually signed 
original registration statement or report, the page number in the 
sequential numbering system where such exhibit can be found. Where 
exhibits are incorporated by reference, this fact shall be noted in the 
exhibit index referred to in the preceding sentence. Further, the first 
page of the manually signed registration statement shall list the page 
in the filing where the exhibit index is located. For a description of 
each of the exhibits included in the exhibit table, see paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (3) This Item applies only to the forms specified in the exhibit 
table. With regard to forms not listed in that table, reference shall be 
made to the appropriate form for the specific exhibit filing 
requirements applicable thereto.
    (4) If a material contract or plan of acquisition, reorganization, 
arrangement, liquidation or succession is executed or becomes effective 
during the reporting period reflected by a Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB or 
Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB, it shall be filed as an exhibit to the Form 
10-Q and Form 10-QSB or Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB filed for the 
corresponding period. Any amendment or modification to a previously 
filed exhibit to a Form 10 and Form 10-SB, 10-K or 10-Q document shall 
be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB or Form 10-K and 
Form 10-KSB. Such amendment or modification need not be filed where such 
previously filed exhibit would not be currently required.

Instructions to Item 601: 1. If an exhibit to a registration statement 
(other than an opinion or consent), filed in preliminary form, has been 
changed only (A) to insert information as to interest, dividend or 
conversion rates, redemption or conversion prices, purchase or offering 
prices, underwriters' or dealers' commissions, names, addresses or 
participation of underwriters or similar matters, which information 
appears elsewhere in an amendment to the registration statement or a 
prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act 
(Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter), or (B) to correct typographical 
errors, insert signatures or make other similar immaterial changes, 
then, notwithstanding any contrary requirement of any rule or form, the 
registrant need not refile such exhibit as so amended. Any such 
incomplete exhibit may not, however, be incorporated by reference in any 
subsequent filing under any Act administered by the Commission.
    2. In any case where two or more indentures, contracts, franchises, 
or other documents required to be filed as exhibits are substantially 
identical in all material respects except as to the parties thereto, the 
dates of execution, or other details, the registrant need file a copy of 
only one of such documents, with a schedule identifying the other 
documents omitted and setting forth the material details in which such 
documents differ from the document a copy of which is filed. The 
Commission may at any time in its discretion require filing of copies of 
any documents so omitted.
    3. Only copies, rather than originals, need be filed of each exhibit 
required except as otherwise specifically noted.
    4. Electronic filings. Whenever an exhibit is filed in paper 
pursuant to a hardship exemption (Secs. 232.201 and 232.202 of this 
chapter), the letter ``P'' (paper) shall be placed next to the exhibit 
in the list of exhibits required by Item 601(a)(2) of this Rule. 
Whenever an electronic confirming copy of an exhibit is filed pursuant 
to a hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 or Sec. 232.202(d) of this 
chapter), the exhibit index should specify where the confirming 
electronic copy can be located; in addition, the designation ``CE'' 
(confirming electronic) should be placed next to the listed exhibit in 
the exhibit index.

registering such securities, the registrant may file as an exhibit to

the copy is filed, the registrant must also file the changed copy.
    (ii) By-laws. The by-laws of the registrant or instruments 
corresponding thereto as currently in effect and any amendments thereto. 
Whenever amendments to the by-laws are filed, a complete copy of the by-

instrument which defines the rights of participants (not as security 
holders) pursuant to an employee benefit plan.

of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.304 of this chapter).

certified public accountant or, in lieu thereof, a revenue ruling from 
the Internal Revenue Service, supporting the tax matters and 
consequences to the shareholders as described in the filing when such 
tax matters are material to the transaction for which the registration 
statement is being filed. This exhibit otherwise need only be filed with 
the other applicable registration forms where the tax consequences are 
material to an investor and a representation as to tax consequences is 
set forth in the filing. If a tax opinion is set forth in full in the 
filing, an indication that such is the case may be made in lieu of 
filing the otherwise required exhibit. Such tax opinions may be

qualifications are adequately described in the filing.
    (9) Voting trust agreement. Any voting trust agreements and 
amendments thereto.
    (10) Material contracts. (i) Every contract not made in the ordinary 
course of business which is material to the registrant and is to be

subsidiary of the registrant is a

[[Page 412]]

party or has succeeded to a party by assumption or assignment or in 
which the registrant or such subsidiary has a beneficial interest.
    (ii) If the contract is such as ordinarily accompanies the kind of 
business conducted by the registrant and its subsidiaries, it will be 
deemed to have been made in the ordinary course of business and need not 
be filed unless it falls within one or more of the following categories, 
in which case it shall be filed except where immaterial in amount or 
significance:
    (A) Any contract to which directors, officers, promoters, voting 
trustees, security holders named in the registration statement or 
report, or underwriters are parties other than contracts involving only 
the purchase or sale of current assets having a determinable market 
price, at such market price;
    (B) Any contract upon which the registrant's business is

property, plant or equipment for a consideration exceeding 15 percent of

the named executive officers of the registrant, as defined by Item 
402(a)(3) (Sec. 229.402(a)(3)), participates shall be deemed material 
and shall be filed; and any other management contract or any other

in amount or significance.
    (B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(10)(iii)(A) above, the following 
management contracts or compensatory plans, contracts or arrangements 
need not be filed:
    (1) Ordinary purchase and sales agency agreements.
    (2) Agreements with managers of stores in a chain organization or 
similar organization.
    (3) Contracts providing for labor or salesmen's bonuses or payments 
to a class of security holders, as such.
    (4) Any compensatory plan, contract or arrangement which pursuant to 
its terms is available to employees, officers or directors generally and 
which in operation provides for the same method of allocation of 
benefits between management and nonmanagement participants.
    (5) Any compensatory plan, contract or arrangement if the registrant 
is a foreign private issuer that furnishes compensatory information on 
an aggregate basis as permitted by General Instruction 1 to Item 402 
(Sec. 229.402) or by Item 11 of Form 20-F.
    (6) Any compensatory plan, contract, or arrangement if the

securities registered pursuant to section 12 or files reports pursuant 
to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and is filing a report on Form 10-K 
and Form 10-KSB or registering debt instruments or preferred stock which 
are not voting securities on Form S-2.

Instruction 1 to paragraph (b)(10): With the exception of management 
contracts, in order to comply with paragraph (iii) above, registrants 
need only file copies of the various compensatory plans and need not 
file each individual director's or executive officer's personal 
agreement under the plans unless there are particular provisions in such 
personal agreements whose disclosure in an exhibit is necessary to an 
investor's understanding of that individual's compensation under the 
plan.
    Instruction 2 to paragraph (b)(10): If a material contract is 
executed or becomes effective during the reporting period reflected by

[[Page 413]]

a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, it shall be filed as an exhibit to the Form 
10-Q or Form 10-K filed for the corresponding period. See paragraph 
(a)(4) of this Item. With respect to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, 
only those contracts executed or becoming effective during the most 
recent period reflected in the report shall be filed.

    (11) Statement re computation of per share earnings. A statement 
setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of per share 
earnings, unless the computation can be clearly determined from the 
material contained in the registration statement or report. The 
information with respect to the computation of per share earnings on 
both primary and fully diluted basis, presented by exhibit or otherwise, 
must be furnished even though the amounts of per share earnings on the 
fully diluted bases are not required to be presented in the income 
statement under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 
No. 15. That Opinion provides that any reduction of less than 3% need 
not be considered as dilution (see footnote to paragraph 14 of the 
Opinion) and that a computation on the fully diluted basis which results 
in improvement of earnings per share not be taken into account (see 
paragraph 40 of the Opinion).
    (12) Statements re computation of ratios. A statement setting forth 
in reasonable detail the computation of any ratio of earnings to fixed 
charges, any ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred 
stock dividends or any other ratios which appear in the registration 
statement or report. See Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.503(d)).
    (13) Annual report to security holders, Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB or 
quarterly report to security holders. (i) The registrant's annual report 
to security holders for its last fiscal year, its Form 10-Q and Form 10-
QSB (if specifically incorporated by reference in the prospectus) or its 
quarterly report to security holders, if all or a portion thereof is 
incorporated by reference in the filing. Such report, except for those 
portions thereof which are expressly incorporated by reference in the 
filing, is to be furnished for the information of the Commission and is 
not to be deemed ``filed'' as part of the filing. If the financial 
statements in the report have been incorporated by reference in the 
filing, the accountant's certificate shall be manually signed in one 
copy. See Rule 411(b) (Sec. 230.411(b) of this chapter).
    (ii) Electronic filings. If all, or any portion, of the annual or 
quarterly report to security holders is incorporated by reference into 
any electronic filing, all, or such portion of the annual or quarterly 
report to security holders so incorporated, shall be filed in electronic 
format as an exhibit to the filing.
    (14)  [Reserved]
    (15) Letter re unaudited interim financial information. A letter, 
where applicable, from the independent accountant which acknowledges 
awareness of the use in a registration statement of a report on 
unaudited interim financial information which pursuant to Rule 436(c) 
under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.436(c) of this chapter) is not 
considered a part of a registration statement prepared or certified by 
an accountant or a report prepared or certified by an accountant within 
the meaning of sections 7 and 11 of that Act. Such letter may be filed 
with the registration statement, an amendment thereto, or a report on 
Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB which is incorporated by reference into the 
registration statement.
    (16) Letter re change in certifying accountant. A letter from the 
registrant's former independent accountant regarding its concurrence or 
disagreement with the statements made by the registrant in the current 
report concerning the resignation or dismissal as the registrant's 
principal accountant.
    (17) Letter re director resignation. Any letter from a former 
director which sets forth a description of a disagreement with the 
registrant that led to the director's resignation or refusal to stand 
for re-election and which requests that the matter be disclosed.
    (18) Letter re change in accounting principles. Unless previously 
filed, a letter from the registrant's independent accountant indicating 
whether any change in accounting principles or practices followed by the 
registrant, or any change in the method of applying any such accounting 
principles or practices, which affected the financial

[[Page 414]]

statements being filed with the Commission in the report or which is 
reasonably certain to affect the financial statements of future fiscal 
years is to an alternative principle which in his judgment is preferable 
under the circumstances. No such letter need be filed when such change 
is made in response to a standard adopted by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board that creates a new accounting principle, that expresses 
a preference for an accounting principle, or that rejects a specific 
accounting principle.
    (19) Report furnished to security holders. If the registrant makes 
available to its stockholders or otherwise publishes, within the period 
prescribed for filing the report, a document or statement containing 
information meeting some or all of the requirements of Part I of Form 
10-Q and Form 10-QSB, the information called for may be incorporated by 
reference to such published document or statement provided copies 
thereof are included as an exhibit to the registration statement or to 
Part I of the Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB report.
    (20) Other documents or statements to security holders. If the 
registrant makes available to its stockholders or otherwise publishes, 
within the period prescribed for filing the report, a document or 
statement containing information meeting some or all of the requirements 
of this form the information called for may be incorporated by reference 
to such published document or statement provided copies thereof are 
filed as an exhibit to the report on this form.
    (21) Subsidiaries of the registrant. (i) List all subsidiaries of 
the registrant, the state or other jurisdiction of incorporation or 
organization of each, and the names under which such subsidiaries do 
business. This list may be incorporated by reference from a document 
which includes a complete and accurate list.
    (ii) The names of particular subsidiaries may be omitted if the 
unnamed subsidiaries, considered in the aggregate as a single 
subsidiary, would not constitute a significant subsidiary as of the end 
of the year covered by this report. (See the definition of ``significant 
subsidiary'' in Rule 1-02(w) (17 CFR 210.1-02(w)) of Regulation S-X.) 
The names of consolidated wholly-owned multiple subsidiaries carrying on 
the same line of business, such as chain stores or small loan companies, 
may be omitted, provided the name of the immediate parent, the line of 
business, the number of omitted subsidiaries operating in the United

instruction shall not apply, however, to banks, insurance companies, 
savings and loan associations or to any subsidiary subject to regulation 
by another Federal agency.

security holders. Published reports containing all of the information

of Part I of Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB which is referred to therein in 
lieu of providing disclosure in Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB or 10-K and

23(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-23(a)(3) of this chapter).
    (23) Consents of experts and counsel--(i) Securities Act filings.

the part of the registration statement or document or opinion, 
containing the consent.
    (ii) Exchange Act reports. Where the filing of a written consent is 
required with respect to material incorporated by reference in a

[[Page 415]]

of the registration statement or document containing such power of 
attorney. In addition, if the name of any officer signing on behalf of 
the registrant is signed pursuant to a power of attorney, certified 
copies of a resolution of the registrant's board of directors 
authorizing such signature shall also be filed. A power of attorney that 
is filed with the Commission shall relate to a specific filing or an 
amendment thereto, provided, however, that a power of attorney relating 
to a registration statement under the Securities Act or an amendment 
thereto also may relate to any registration statement for the same 
offering that is to be effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(b) 
under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.462(b) of this chapter). A power of 
attorney that confers general authority shall not be filed with the

trustee under an indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act

    (ii) Electronic filings. The requirement to bind separately the 
statement of eligibility and qualification of each person designated to 
act as a trustee under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 from other 
exhibits shall not apply to statements submitted in electronic format. 
Rather, such statements must be submitted as exhibits in the same 
electronic submission as the registration statement to which they 
relate, or in an amendment thereto, except that electronic filers that 
rely on Trust Indenture Act Section 305(b)(2) for determining the 
eligibility of the trustee under indentures for securities to be issued, 
offered or sold on a delayed basis by or on behalf of the registrant 
shall file such statements separately in the manner prescribed by 
Sec. 260.5b-1 through Sec. 260.5b-3 of this chapter and by the EDGAR 
Filer Manual.
    (26) Invitations for competitive bids. If the registration statement

the subject matters to which they refer.

77k(a)) an issuer makes generally available to its security holders an 
earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning 
after the effective date of the registration statement, and if such 
earnings statement is made available by ``other methods'' than those 
specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of Sec. 230.158 of this chapter, it 
must be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-Q or the Form 10-K, as 
appropriate, covering the period in which the earnings statement was 
released.
    (c) Financial data schedule--(1) General. (i) A Financial Data 
Schedule shall be submitted only by an electronic filer that is not a 
foreign private issuer or a foreign government. The schedule shall be 
submitted in the electronic format prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual, 
and shall set forth the financial information specified in the 
applicable table in the Appendices to this item.
    (ii) Any electronic filing that includes financial statements of the 
registrant for a recent fiscal year or interim year to date period, or 
both, for which financial statements have not previously been filed, 
otherwise than by incorporation by reference, shall include as an 
exhibit a Financial Data Schedule containing financial information for 
such fiscal year or interim year to date periods, or both.
    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(1)(ii): Financial Data Schedules are not 
required in connection with registration statements on Form

[[Page 416]]

S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of this chapter) or annual reports on Form 11-K 
(Sec. 249.311 of this chapter), for employee stock purchase, savings and 
similar plans.
    Note 2 to paragraph (c)(1)(ii): Issuers of asset-backed securities 
(as that term is defined in the general instructions to Form S-3 
[Sec. 239.13 of this chapter], except that they need not be investment 
grade) that are not required to file financial statements with the 
Commission in their Securities Act registration statements or their 
reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act 
are not required to submit a Financial Data Schedule in connection with 
those filings.

    (iii) The amounts reflected in the Financial Data Schedule shall 
correspond to or be calculable from amounts reflected in the 
registrant's financial statements or notes thereto.
    (iv) The schedule shall be submitted as an exhibit to the filing(s) 
to which it relates, but shall not be deemed filed for purposes of 
section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), section 18 of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r), and section 323 of the Trust Indenture Act 
(15 U.S.C. 77www), or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of such 
sections, nor shall it be deemed a part of any registration statement to 
which it relates. It shall, however, be subject to all other liability 
and anti-fraud provisions of the Acts. See Rule 402 of Regulation S-T 
(Sec. 232.402 of this chapter).
    (v) A Financial Data Schedule shall be submitted only in electronic 
format. Where a registrant submits a filing, otherwise required to 
include a Financial Data Schedule, in paper pursuant to a hardship 
exemption under Rule 201 or Rule 202(d) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.201 
or Sec. 232.202(d) of this chapter, respectively), the Financial Data 
Schedule shall not be included with the paper filing, but shall be 
included with the required confirming electronic copy.
    (vi) A Financial Data Schedule reflecting pro forma financial 
information shall not be filed.
    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(1): A registrant's failure to furnish a 
Financial Data Schedule pursuant to this paragraph will not prevent 
acceptance of the filing for which the schedule is required. However, 
inasmuch as the schedule may be used by the Commission staff in its 
review of the filing, processing of the filing may be delayed pending 
filing of the schedule. Further, registrants that have not filed a 
required Financial Data Schedule will be ineligible to use Form S-2 
(Sec. 239.12 of this chapter), Form S-3 (Sec. 239.13 of this chapter) 
and Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of this chapter). See eligibility 
requirements of those forms.
    Note 2 to paragraph (c)(1): Paper copies of the Financial Data 
Schedule are not required to be furnished with the paper copy sent to 
the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia pursuant to 
Rule 901(d) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.901(d) of this chapter), or with 
the paper copies of filings required by the Commission rules to be 
furnished to the national securities exchange or national securities 
association upon which the registrant's securities are listed. 
Similarly, no paper copy of a Financial Data Schedule is required with 
filings made in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption; however, any 
required electronic confirming copy of such filing should be accompanied 
by a Financial Data Schedule, where appropriate pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (2) Format and presentation of financial data schedule. (i) At the 
option of the registrant, the following legend may be inserted at the 
beginning of any Financial Data Schedule submitted to the Commission, in 
the manner prescribed by the EDGAR Filer Manual:

THIS SCHEDULE CONTAINS SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM 
[Identify specific financial statements] AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS 
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SUCH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    (ii) Items set forth in a Financial Data Schedule may be qualified 
by referencing a specific footnote to the Financial Data Schedule or 
cross-referencing notes to the registrant's financial statements.
    (iii) If any of the amounts reported in a previously submitted 
Financial Data Schedule are restated as a result of pooling of 
interests, an accounting principle change, a reorganization or 
recapitalization, or correction of an error or other reason, then a 
schedule, as amended or restated, shall be submitted that sets forth the 
restated information for each affected period during the latest three 
fiscal years and interim periods of the latest two fiscal years; except 
that restated or amended information need not be furnished for any 
period for which a Financial Data Schedule was not previously required 
to be furnished. The document shall specify that the Financial Data 
Schedule has been restated or amended. A schedule that is filed to 
correct an error in a previously filed Financial

[[Page 417]]

Data Schedule shall be designated as an ``Amended Financial Data 
Schedule.'' A schedule that is filed as a result of a restatement that 
is not a correction of an error shall be designated as a ``Restated 
Financial Data Schedule.''
    Note to paragraph (c)(2)(iii): A registrant is not required to 
restate prior Financial Data Schedules for a recapitalization that is in 
the form of a stock split or reverse stock split, provided that the EPS> 
tag for the period in which the stock split occurs includes a footnote 
indicating that a stock split has occurred and its effective date, and 
that prior Financial Data Schedules have not been restated for the 
recapitalization.

    (iv) Except as otherwise provided in the EDGAR Filer Manual, a 
response is required for each item called for in the schedule. If 
information required by the applicable schedule is not included in the 
underlying financial data because it is either immaterial or 
inapplicable to the registrant, the registrant shall use the value ``0'' 
(zero) in response to that item.
    (3) Contents of financial data schedule. The schedule shall set 
forth the financial information specified below that is applicable to 
the registrant. Schedules based on Articles 5, 7 and 9 of Regulation S-X 
include items that are to be understood as the same information required 
by the Item in Regulation S-X.
    (i) Article 5 registrants (commercial and industrial companies). 
Registrants that prepare financial statements in accordance with Article 
5 of Regulation S-X (Sec. 210.5-01 through Sec. 210.5-04 of this

Article 5 items listed in appendix A to this Item.

a Financial Data Schedule that contains the Article 7 financial 
statement items and the industry guide items (Securities Act Industry 
Guide 6 (Sec. 229.801(f) of this chapter) or Exchange Act Industry Guide 
4 (Sec. 229.802(d) of this chapter) listed in appendix B to this Item).

loan holding companies). Registrants that prepare their financial

through Sec. 210.9-07 of this chapter) and savings and loan holding 
companies shall prepare a Financial Data Schedule that contains the 
Article 9 financial statement items and Securities Act Industry Guide 3 
(Sec. 229.801(c) of this chapter) information and Exchange Act Industry 
Guide 3 (Sec. 229.802(c) of this chapter) listed in appendix C to this 
Item.
    (iv) Broker-dealer and broker-dealer holding companies. Registrants 
that are broker-dealers or broker-dealer holding companies may prepare a 
Financial Data Schedule that contains the items listed in appendix D to 
this Item in lieu of a Financial Data Schedule containing the items 
listed in appendix A to this Item.
    (v) Public utility companies and public utility holding companies. 
Registrants that are public utility companies or public utility holding 
companies shall prepare a Financial Data Schedule in the form required 
by appendix E to this item.
    Note: Schedule UT (appendix E) contains the same requirements found 
in Exhibit G of Form U5S (Sec. 259.5s of this chapter).

    (vi) Multi-industry registrants. A registrant that presents its 
primary financial statements in a manner in which non-homogeneous lines 
of business are grouped separately on the face of the primary financial 
statements and that does not present combined totals for all lines of 
business may submit separate Financial Data Schedules for each line of 
business. Where a registrant prepares more than one Financial Data 
Schedule, a separate schedule of consolidated totals on Schedule CT 
(appendix F to this item) shall also be furnished.

[[Page 421]]

and new securities resulting from the modification of outstanding 
securities.
    (a) Securities sold. Give the date of sale and the title and amount 
of securities sold.
    (b) Underwriters and other purchasers. Give the names of the 
principal underwriters, if any. As to any such securities not publicly 
offered, name the persons or identify the class of persons to whom the 
securities were sold.
    (c) Consideration. As to securities sold for cash, state the

Securities Act or the rule of the Commission under which exemption from

sold by the registrant are convertible or exchangeable into equity 
securities, or are warrants or options representing equity securities, 
disclose the terms of conversion or exercise of the securities.
    (f) Use of proceeds. As required by Sec. 230.463 of this chapter, 
following the effective date of the first registration statement filed 
under the Securities Act by an issuer, the issuer or successor issuer 
shall report the use of proceeds on its first periodic report filed 
pursuant to sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 
78m(a) and 78o(d)) after effectiveness of its Securities Act 
registration statement, and thereafter on each of its subsequent 
periodic reports filed pursuant to sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act through the later of disclosure of the application of all 
the offering proceeds, or disclosure of the termination of the offering. 
If a report of the use of proceeds is required with respect to the first 
effective registration statement of the predecessor issuer, the 
successor issuer shall provide such a report. The information provided 
pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(4) of this Item need only be 
provided with respect to the first periodic report filed pursuant to 
sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act after effectiveness of the 
registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Subsequent 
periodic reports filed pursuant to sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act need only provide the information required in paragraphs 
(f)(2) through (f)(4) of this Item if any of such required information 
has changed since the last periodic report filed. In disclosing the use 
of proceeds in the first periodic report filed pursuant to the Exchange 
Act, the issuer or successor issuer should include the following 
information:
    (1) The effective date of the Securities Act registration statement 
for which the use of proceeds information is being disclosed and the 
Commission file number assigned to the registration statement;
    (2) If the offering has commenced, the offering date, and if the 
offering has not commenced, an explanation why it has not;
    (3) If the offering terminated before any securities were sold, an 
explanation for such termination; and
    (4) If the offering did not terminate before any securities were 
sold, disclose:
    (i) Whether the offering has terminated and, if so, whether it 
terminated before the sale of all securities registered;
    (ii) The name(s) of the managing underwriter(s), if any;
    (iii) The title of each class of securities registered and, where a 
class of convertible securities is being registered, the title of any 
class of securities into which such securities may be converted;
    (iv) For each class of securities (other than a class of securities 
into which a class of convertible securities registered may be converted 
without additional payment to the issuer) the following information, 
provided for both the account of the issuer and the

[[Page 422]]

account(s) of any selling security holder(s): the amount registered, the 
aggregate price of the offering amount registered, the amount sold and 
the aggregate offering price of the amount sold to date;
    (v) From the effective date of the Securities Act registration 
statement to the ending date of the reporting period, the amount of 
expenses incurred for the issuer's account in connection with the 
issuance and distribution of the securities registered for underwriting 
discounts and commissions, finders' fees, expenses paid to or for 
underwriters, other expenses and total expenses. Indicate if a 
reasonable estimate for the amount of expenses incurred is provided 
instead of the actual amount of expense. Indicate whether such payments 
were:
    (A) Direct or indirect payments to directors, officers, general 
partners of the issuer or their associates; to persons owning ten (10) 
percent or more of any class of equity securities of the issuer; and to 
affiliates of the issuer; or
    (B) Direct or indirect payments to others;
    (vi) The net offering proceeds to the issuer after deducting the 
total expenses described in paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this Item;
    (vii) From the effective date of the Securities Act registration 
statement to the ending date of the reporting period, the amount of net 
offering proceeds to the issuer used for construction of plant, building 
and facilities; purchase and installation of machinery and equipment; 
purchases of real estate; acquisition of other business(es); repayment 
of indebtedness; working capital; temporary investments (which should be 
specified); and any other purposes for which at least five (5) percent 
of the issuer's total offering proceeds or $100,000 (whichever is less) 
has been used (which should be specified). Indicate if a reasonable 
estimate for the amount of net offering proceeds applied is provided 
instead of the actual amount of net offering proceeds used. Indicate 
whether such payments were:
    (A) Direct or indirect payments to directors, officers, general 
partners of the issuer or their associates; to persons owning ten (10) 
percent or more of any class of equity securities of the issuer; and to 
affiliates of the issuer; or
    (B) Direct or indirect payments to others; and
    (viii) If the use of proceeds in paragraph (f)(4)(vii) of this Item 
represents a material change in the use of proceeds described in the 
prospectus, the issuer should describe briefly the material change.
Instructions. 1. Information required by this Item 701 need not be set 
forth as to notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or bankers' acceptances 
which mature not later than one year from the date of issuance.
    2. If the sales were made in a series of transactions, the 
information may be given by such totals and periods as will reasonably 
convey the information required.

<R05>
Sec. 229.901  (Item 901) Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart 229.900:
    (a) General partner means the person or persons responsible under 
state law for managing or directing the management of the business and 
affairs of a partnership that is the subject of a roll-up transaction 
including, but not limited to, the general partner(s), board of 
directors, board of trustees, or other person(s) having a fiduciary duty 
to such partnership.
    (b)(1) Partnership means any:
    (i) Finite-life limited partnership; or
    (ii) Other finite-life entity.
    (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this Item 
(Sec. 229.901(b)(2)(ii)), a limited partnership or other entity is 
``finite-life'' if:
    (A) It operates as a conduit vehicle for investors to participate in 
the ownership of assets for a limited period of time; and
    (B) It has as a policy or purpose distributing to investors proceeds 
from the sale, financing or refinancing of assets or cash from 
operations, rather than reinvesting such proceeds or cash in the 
business (whether for the term of the entity or after an initial period 
of time following commencement of operations).
    (ii) A real estate investment trust as defined in I.R.C. section 856 
is not finite-life solely because of the distribution to investors of 
net income as provided by the I.R.C. if its policies or purposes do not 
include the distribution to investors of proceeds from the sale, 
financing or refinancing of assets, rather than the reinvestment of such 
proceeds in the business.
    (3) Partnership does not include any entity registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) or any Business 
Development Company as defined in section 2(a)(48) of that Act (15

types of assets or different investment objectives) relating to the 
fairness of the transaction.
    (c) If any offer of the type described in Instruction (2)(viii) to 
this Item (Sec. 229.910) has been received, describe such offer and 
state the reason(s) for its rejection.
    (d) Describe any factors known to the general partner that may 
affect materially the value of the consideration to be received by 
investors in the roll-up transaction, the values assigned to the 
partnerships for purposes of the comparisons to alternatives required by 
paragraph (b) of this Item (Sec. 229.910) and the fairness of the 
transaction to investors.
    (e) State whether the general partner's statements in response to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Item (Sec. 229.910) are based, in whole 
or in part, on any report, opinion or appraisal described in response to 
Item 911 of this subpart (Sec. 229.911). If so, describe any material 
uncertainties known to the general partner that relate to the 
conclusions in any such report, opinion or appraisal including, but not 
limited to, developments or trends that have affected or are reasonably 
likely to affect materially such conclusions.

Instructions to Item 910: (1) A statement that the general partner has 
no reasonable belief as to the fairness of the roll-up transaction to 
investors will not be considered sufficient disclosure in response to 
paragraph (a) of this Item (Sec. 229.910(a)).
    (2) The factors which are important in determining the fairness of a 
roll-up transaction to investors and the weight, if any, which should be 
given to them in a particular context will vary. Normally such factors 
will include, among others, those referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of 
Item 909 (Sec. 229.909(b)(1)) and whether the consideration offered to 
investors constitutes fair value in relation to:
    (i) Current market prices, if any;
    (ii) Historic market prices, if any;
    (iii) Net book value;
    (iv) Going concern value;
    (v) Liquidation value;
    (vi) Purchases of limited partnership interests by the general 
partner or sponsor or their affiliates since the commencement of the 
partnership's second full fiscal year preceding the date of filing of 
the disclosure document for the roll-up transaction;
    (vii) Any report, opinion, or appraisal described in Item 911 of 
this subpart (Sec. 229.911); and
    (viii) Offers of which the general partner or sponsor is aware made 
during the preceding eighteen months for a merger, consolidation, or 
combination of any of the partnerships; an acquisition of any of the 
partnerships or a material amount of their assets; a tender offer for or 
other acquisition of securities of any class issued by any of the 
partnerships; or a change in control of any of the partnerships.
    (3) The discussion concerning fairness should specifically address 
material terms of the transaction including whether the consideration 
offered to investors constitutes fair value in relation to:
    (i) The form and amount of consideration to be received by investors 
and the sponsor in the roll-up transaction;
    (ii) The methods used to determine such consideration; and
    (iii) The compensation to be paid to the sponsor in the future.
    (4) Conclusory statements, such as ``The roll-up transaction is fair 
to investors in relation to net book value, going concern value, 
liquidation value and future prospects of the partnership,'' will not be 
considered sufficient disclosure in response to paragraph (b) of this 
Item (Sec. 229.910(b)).
    (5) Consideration should be given to presenting the comparative 
numerical data as to the value of the consideration being received by 
investors, liquidation value and other values in a tabular format. 
Financial and other information concerning the partnerships should be 
prepared based upon the most recent available information, such as, in 
the case of financial information, the periods covered by interim 
selected financial information included in the prospectus in accordance 
with Item 914 of this subpart (Sec. 229.914).

which shall include, but not be limited to, the procedures followed; the 
findings and recommendations; the bases for and methods of arriving at 
such findings and recommendations; instructions received from the

not limited to, access to its personnel, premises, and relevant books 
and records, state the reasons therefor.
    (vii) State whether any compensation paid to such outside party is 
contingent on the approval or completion of the roll-up transaction and, 
if so, the reasons for compensating such parties on a contingent basis.
    (3) Furnish a statement to the effect that upon written request by 
an investor or his representative who has been so designated in writing,

partnership or its assets, or any other report with respect to the roll-
up transaction. No description is required, however, of contacts with 
respect to reports, opinions or appraisals filed as exhibits pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(4) of this Item (Sec. 229.911).
    (ii) The description of contacts with any outside party required by 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this Item (Sec. 229.911) shall include the 
following:
    (A) The identity of each such party;
    (B) The nature of the contact;
    (C) The actions taken by such party;
    (D) Any views, preliminary or final, expressed on the proposed 
subject matter of the report, opinion or appraisal; and
    (E) Any reasons such party did not provide a report, opinion or 
appraisal.
    (b) Fairness opinions: (1) If any report, opinion or appraisal

possible combinations are not addressed:
    (A) Identify the combinations that are addressed;
    (B) Identify the person(s) that determined which combinations would

combination of partnerships not addressed, no report, opinion or 
appraisal concerning the fairness of the roll-up transaction will have 
been obtained.

[[Page 433]]

    (2) If the sponsor or the general partner has not obtained any 
opinion on the fairness of the proposed roll-up transaction to investors 
in each of the affected partnerships, state the sponsor's or general 
partner's reasons for concluding that such an opinion is not necessary 
in order to permit the limited partners or shareholders to make an 
informed decision on the proposed transaction.
    (c) Appraisals. If the report, opinion or appraisal consists of an 
appraisal of the assets of the partnerships:
    (1) Describe the purpose(s) for which the appraisals were obtained

    (i) The appraised value of any separately appraised asset that is

preparing the appraisals of the assets identified in response to 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this Item (Sec. 229.911(c)(4)(i)), the value of 
each such asset under each valuation approach considered by the 
appraiser, identifying the valuation approach used by the appraiser in 
determining the appraised value and the reason such approach was chosen; 
and
    (iii) All material assumptions used by the appraiser in appraising 
the assets identified in response to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this Item 
(Sec. 229.911(c)(4)(i)), and, if the appraiser used different 
assumptions for any of such assets, the reasons the different 
assumptions were chosen.
    (5) For purposes of this Item and Item 902 of this subpart 
(Sec. 229.902), an asset is ``significant'' to a partnership if it 
represents more than 10% of the value of the partnership's assets as of 
the end of the most recently-completed fiscal year or recently-completed 
interim period or if 10% or more of the partnership's cash flow or net 
income for the most recently-completed fiscal year or most recently-
completed subsequent interim period was derived from such asset.

Instructions to Item 911: (1) The reports, opinions and appraisals 
required to be identified in response to paragraph (a) of this Item 
(Sec. 229.911) include any reports, opinions and appraisals which 
materially relate to the roll-up transaction whether or not relied upon, 
such as reports or opinions regarding alternatives to the roll-up 
transaction whether or not the alternatives were rejected.
    (2) The information called for by paragraph (a)(2) of this Item 
(Sec. 229.911) should be given with respect to the firm which provides 
the report, opinion or appraisal rather than the employees of such firm 
who prepared it.
    (3) With respect to appraisals, a summary prepared by the appraisers 
should not be included in lieu of the description of the appraisals 
required by paragraph (c) of this Item (Sec. 229.911). A clear and 
concise summary description of the appraisals is required.

<R05>
Sec. 230.133  Definition for purposes of section 5 of the Act, of ``sale'', ``offer'', ``offer to sell'', and ``offer for sale''.

    (a) For purposes only of section 5 of the Act, no sale, offer to 
sell, or offer for sale shall be deemed to be involved so far as the 
stockholders of a corporation are concerned where, pursuant to statutory 
provisions in the state of incorporation or provisions contained in the 
certificate of incorporation, there is submitted to the vote of such 
stockholders a plan or agreement for a statutory merger or consolidation 
or reclassification of securities, or a proposal for the transfer of 
assets of such corporation to another person in consideration of the 
issuance of securities of such other person or securities of a 
corporation which owns stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total 
combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at 
least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of 
stock of such person, under such circumstances that the vote of a 
required favorable majority (1) will operate to authorize the proposed 
transaction as far as concerns the corporation whose stockholders are 
voting (except for the taking of action by the directors of the 
corporation involved and for compliance with such statutory provisions 
as the filing of the plan or agreement with the appropriate State 
authority), and (2) will bind all

[[Page 442]]

stockholders of such corporation except to the extent that dissenting 
shareholders may be entitled, under statutory provisions or provisions 
contained in the certificate of incorporation, to receive the appraised 
or fair value of their holdings.
    (b) Any person who purchases securities of the issuer from security 
holders of a constituent corporation with a view to, or offers or sells 
such securities for such security holders in connection with, a 
distribution thereof pursuant to any contract or arrangement, made in 
connection with any transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section, with the issuer or with any affiliate of the issuer, or with 
any person who in connection with such transaction is acting as an 
underwriter of such securities, shall be deemed to an underwriter of 
such securities within the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act. This 
paragraph does not refer to arrangements limited to provision for the 
matching and combination of fractional interests in securities into 
whole interests, or the purchase and sale of such fractional interests, 
among security holders of the constituent corporation and to the sale on 
behalf of, and as agent for, such security holders of such number of 
fractional or whole interests as may be necessary to adjust for any 
remaining fractional interests after such matching.
    (c) Any constituent corporation, or any person who is an affiliate 
of a constituent corporation at the time any transaction specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, is submitted to a vote of the 
stockholders of such corporation, who acquires securities of the issuer 
in connection with such transaction with a view to the distribution 
thereof shall be deemed to be an underwriter of such securities within 
the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act. A transfer by a constituent 
corporation to its security holders of securities of the issuer upon a 
complete or partial liquidation shall not be deemed a distribution for 
the purpose of this paragraph.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, 
a person specified therein shall not be deemed to be an underwriter nor 
to be engaged in a distribution with respect to securities acquired in 
any transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section, which are 
sold by him in brokers' transactions within the meaning of section 4(4) 
of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and subject to the 
limitations specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if such person:
    (1) Does not directly or indirectly solicit or arrange for the

be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities 
laws of any such State.

No offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the 
purchase price can be received until the registration statement has 
become effective, and any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, 
without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time prior to 
notice of its acceptance given after the effective date. An indication 
of interest in response to this advertisement will involve no obligation 
or commitment of any kind.

<R05>
Sec. 230.144  Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not underwriters.

    Preliminary Note: Rule 144 is designed to implement the fundamental 
purposes of the Act, as expressed in its preamble, To provide full and 
fair disclosure of the character of the securities sold in interstate 
commerce and through the mails, and to prevent fraud in the sale thereof 
* * * The rule is designed to prohibit the creation of public markets in 
securities of issuers concerning which adequate current information is 
not available to the public. At the same time, where adequate current 
information concerning the issuer is available to the public, the rule 
permits the public sale in ordinary trading transactions of limited 
amounts of securities owned by persons controlling, controlled by or 
under common control with the issuer and by persons who have acquired 
restricted securities of the issuer.
    Certain basic principles are essential to an understanding of the 
requirement of registration in the Act:
    1. If any person utilizes the jurisdictional means to sell any 
nonexempt security to any other person, the security must be registered 
unless a statutory exemption can be found for the transaction.
    2. In addition to the exemptions found in section 3, four exemptions 
applicable to transactions in securities are contained in section 4. 
Three of these section 4 exemptions are clearly not available to anyone 
acting as an underwriter of securities. (The fourth, found in section 
4(4), is available only to those who act as brokers under certain 
limited circumstances.) An understanding of the term underwriter is 
therefore important to anyone who wishes to determine whether or not an 
exemption from registration is available for his sale of securities.
    The term underwriter is broadly defined in section 2(11) of the Act 
to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or 
offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of 
any security, or participates, or has a direct or indirect participation 
in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the 
direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking. The 
interpretation of this definition has traditionally focused on the words 
with a view to in the phrase purchased from an issuer with a view to * * 
* distribution. Thus, an investment banking firm which arranges with an 
issuer for the public sale of its securities is clearly an underwriter 
under that section. Individual investors who are not professionals in 
the securities business may also be underwriters within the meaning of 
that term as used in the Act if they act as links in a chain of 
transactions through which securities move from an issuer to the public. 
Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the purchaser at 
the time of his acquisition, subsequent acts and circumstances have been 
considered to determine whether such person took with a view to 
distribution at the time of his acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on 
factors such as the length of time the person has held the securities 
and whether there has been an unforeseeable change in circumstances of 
the holder. Experience has shown, however, that reliance upon such 
factors as the above has not assured adequate protection of investors 
through the maintenance of informed trading markets and has led to 
uncertainty in the application of the registration provisions of the 
Act.
    It should be noted that the statutory language of section 2(11) is 
in the disjunctive. Thus, it is insufficient to conclude that a person 
is not an underwriter solely because he did not purchase securities from 
an issuer with a view to their distribution. It must also be established 
that the person is not offering or selling for an issuer in connection 
with the distribution of the securities, does not participate or have a 
direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, and does not 
participate or have a participation in the direct or indirect 
underwriting of such an undertaking.

[[Page 455]]

    In determining when a person is deemed not to be engaged in a 
distribution several factors must be considered.
    First, the purpose and underlying policy of the Act to protect 
investors requires that there be adequate current information concerning 
the issuer, whether the resales of securities by persons result in a 
distribution or are effected in trading transactions. Accordingly, the 
availability of the rule is conditioned on the existence of adequate 
current public information.
    Secondly, a holding period prior to resale is essential, among other 
reasons, to assure that those persons who buy under a claim of a section 
4(2) exemption have assumed the economic risks of investment, and 
therefore are not acting as conduits for sale to the public of 
unregistered securities, directly or indirectly, on behalf of an issuer. 
It should be noted that there is nothing in section 2(11) which places a 
time limit on a person's status as an underwriter. The public has the 
same need for protection afforded by registration whether the securities 
are distributed shortly after their purchase or after a considerable 
length of time.
    A third factor, which must be considered in determining what is 
deemed not to constitute a distribution, is the impact of the particular 
transaction or transactions on the trading markets. Section 4(1) was 
intended to exempt only routine trading transactions between individual 
investors with respect to securities already issued and not to exempt 
distributions by issuers or acts of other individuals who engage in 
steps necessary to such distributions. Therefore, a person reselling 
securities under section 4(1) of the Act must sell the securities in 
such limited quantities and in such a manner as not to disrupt the 
trading markets. The larger the amount of securities involved, the more 
likely it is that such resales may involve methods of offering and 
amounts of compensation usually associated with a distribution rather 
than routine trading transactions. Thus, solicitation of buy orders or 
the payment of extra compensation are not permitted by the rule.
    In summary, if the sale in question is made in accordance with all 
of the provisions of the section as set forth below, any person who 
sells restricted securities shall be deemed not to be engaged in a 
distribution of such securities and therefore not an underwriter 
thereof. The rule also provides that any person who sells restricted or 
other securities on behalf of a person in a control relationship with 
the issuer shall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such 
securities and therefore not to be an underwriter thereof, if the sale 
is made in accordance with all the conditions of the section.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for the 
purposes of this section.
    (1) An affiliate of an issuer is a person that directly, or 
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is 
controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.
    (2) The term person when used with reference to a person for whose 
account securities are to be sold in reliance upon this section 
includes, in addition to such person, all of the following persons:
    (i) Any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of such 
spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person;
    (ii) Any trust or estate in which such person or any of the persons 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section collectively own 10 
percent or more of the total beneficial interest or of which any of such 
persons serve as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity; and
    (iii) Any corporation or other organization (other than the issuer) 
in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section are the beneficial owners collectively of 10 
percent or more of any class of equity securities or 10 percent or more 
of the equity interest.
    (3) The term restricted securities means:
    (i) Securities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or 
from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of 
transactions not involving any public offering;
    (ii) Securities acquired from the issuer that are subject to the 
resale limitations of Sec. 230.502(d) under Regulation D or 
Sec. 230.701(c);
    (iii) Securities acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 230.144A;
    (iv) Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction subject to 
the conditions of Regulation CE (Sec. 230.1001); and
    (v) Equity securities of domestic issuers acquired in a transaction 
or chain of transactions subject to the conditions of Sec. 230.901 or 
Sec. 230.903 under Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 through Sec. 230.905, and 
Preliminary Notes).

[[Page 456]]

    (b) Conditions to be met. Any affiliate or other person who sells 
restricted securities of an issuer for his own account, or any person 
who sells restricted or any other securities for the account of an 
affiliate of the issuer of such securities, shall be deemed not to be 
engaged in a distribution of such securities and therefore not to be an 
underwriter thereof within the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act if 
all of the conditions of this section are met.
    (c) Current public information. There shall be available adequate 
current public information with respect to the issuer of the securities. 
Such information shall be deemed to be available only if either of the 
following conditions is met:
    (1) Filing of reports. The issuer has securities registered pursuant 
to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, has been subject 
to the reporting requirements of section 13 of that Act for a period of 
at least 90 days immediately preceding the sale of the securities and 
has filed all the reports required to be filed thereunder during the 12 
months preceding such sale (or for such shorter period that the issuer 
was required to file such reports); or has securities registered 
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, has been subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 for a period of at least 90 days immediately preceding the sale 
of the securities and has filed all the reports required to be filed 
thereunder during the 12 months preceding such sale (or for such shorter 
period that the issuer was required to file such reports). The person 
for whose account the securities are to be sold shall be entitled to 
rely upon a statement in whichever is the most recent report, quarterly 
or annual, required to be filed and filed by the issuer that such issuer 
has filed all reports required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for 
such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports) 
and has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days, 
unless he knows or has reason to believe that the issuer has not 
complied with such requirements. Such person shall also be entitled to 
rely upon a written statement from the issuer that it has complied with 
such reporting requirements unless he knows or has reasons to believe 
that the issuer has not complied with such requirements.
    (2) Other public information. If the issuer is not subject to 
section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there is 
publicly available the information concerning the issuer specified in 
paragraphs (a)(5)(i) to (xiv), inclusive, and paragraph (a)(5)(xvi) of 
Rule 15c2-11 (Sec. 240.15c2-11 of this chapter) under that Act or, if 
the issuer is an insurance company, the information specified in section 
12(g)(2)(G)(i) of that Act.
    (d) Holding period for restricted securities. If the securities sold 
are restricted securities, the following provisions apply:
    (1) General rule. A minimum of one year must elapse between the 
later of the date of the acquisition of the securities from the issuer 
or from an affiliate of the issuer, and any resale of such securities in 
reliance on this section for the account of either the acquiror or any 
subsequent holder of those securities. If the acquiror takes the 
securities by purchase, the one-year period shall not begin until the 
full purchase price or other consideration is paid or given by the 
person acquiring the securities from the issuer or from an affiliate of 
the issuer.
    (2) Promissory notes, other obligations or installment contracts. 
Giving the issuer or affiliate of the issuer from whom the securities 
were purchased a promissory note or other obligation to pay the purchase 
price, or entering into an installment purchase contract with such 
seller, shall not be deemed full payment of the purchase price unless 
the promissory note, obligation or contract:
    (i) Provides for full recourse against the purchaser of the 
securities;
    (ii) Is secured by collateral, other than the securities purchased, 
having a fair market value at least equal to the purchase price of the 
securities purchased; and
    (iii) Shall have been discharged by payment in full prior to the 
sale of the securities.
    (3) Determination of holding period. The following provisions shall 
apply for

[[Page 457]]

the purpose of determining the period securities have been held:
    (i) Stock dividends, splits and recapitalizations. Securities 
acquired from the issuer as a dividend or pursuant to a stock split, 
reverse split or recapitalization shall be deemed to have been acquired 
at the same time as the securities on which the dividend or, if more 
than one, the initial dividend was paid, the securities involved in the 
split or reverse split, or the securities surrendered in connection with 
the recapitalization;
    (ii) Conversions. If the securities sold were acquired from the 
issuer for a consideration consisting solely of other securities of the 
same issuer surrendered for conversion, the securities so acquired shall 
be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the securities 
surrendered for conversion;
    (iii) Contingent issuance of securities. Securities acquired as a 
contingent payment of the purchase price of an equity interest in a 
business, or the assets of a business, sold to the issuer or an 
affiliate of the issuer shall be deemed to have been acquired at the 
time of such sale if the issuer or affiliate was then committed to issue 
the securities subject only to conditions other than the payment of 
further consideration for such securities. An agreement entered into in 
connection with any such purchase to remain in the employment of, or not 
to compete with, the issuer or affiliate or the rendering of services 
pursuant to such agreement shall not be deemed to be the payment of 
further consideration for such securities.
    (iv) Pledged securities. Securities which are bona-fide pledged by 
an affiliate of the issuer when sold by the pledgee, or by a purchaser, 
after a default in the obligation secured by the pledge, shall be deemed 
to have been acquired when they were acquired by the pledgor, except 
that if the securities were pledged without recourse they shall be 
deemed to have been acquired by the pledgee at the time of the pledge or 
by the purchaser at the time of purchase.
    (v) Gifts of securities. Securities acquired from an affiliate of 
the issuer by gift shall be deemed to have been acquired by the donee 
when they were acquired by the donor.
    (vi) Trusts. Where a trust settlor is an affiliate of the issuer, 
securities acquired from the settlor by the trust, or acquired from the 
trust by the beneficiaries thereof, shall be deemed to have been 
acquired when such securities were acquired by the settlor.
    (vii) Estates. Where a deceased person was an affiliate of the 
issuer, securities held by the estate of such person or acquired from 
such estate by the beneficiaries thereof shall be deemed to have been 
acquired when they were acquired by the deceased person, except that no 
holding period is required if the estate is not an affiliate of the 
issuer or if the securities are sold by a beneficiary of the estate who 
is not such an affiliate.
    Note: While there is no holding period or amount limitation for 
estates and beneficiaries thereof which are not affiliates of the 
issuer, paragraphs (c), (h) and (i) of the rule apply to securities sold 
by such persons in reliance upon the rule.

    (viii) Rule 145(a) transactions. The holding period for securities 
acquired in a transaction specified in Rule 145(a) shall be deemed to 
commence on the date the securities were acquired by the purchaser in 
such transaction. This provision shall not apply, however, to a 
transaction effected solely for the purpose of forming a holding 
company.
    (e) Limitation on amount of securities sold. Except as hereinafter 
provided, the amount of securities which may be sold in reliance upon 
this rule shall be determined as follows:
    (1) Sales by affiliates. If restricted or other securities are sold 
for the account of an affiliate of the issuer, the amount of securities 
sold, together with all sales of restricted and other securities of the 
same class for the account of such person within the preceding three 
months, shall not exceed the greater of
    (i) One percent of the shares or other units of the class 
outstanding as shown by the most recent report or statement published by 
the issuer, or
    (ii) The average weekly reported volume of trading in such 
securities on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through 
the automated

[[Page 458]]

quotation system of a registered securities association during the four 
calendar weeks preceding the filing of notice required by paragraph (h), 
or if no such notice is required the date of receipt of the order to 
execute the transaction by the broker or the date of execution of the 
transaction directly with a market maker, or
    (iii) The average weekly volume of trading in such securities 
reported through the consolidated transaction reporting system 
contemplated by Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(Sec. 240.11A3-1) during the four-week period specified in paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Sales by persons other than affiliates. The amount of restricted 
securities sold for the account of any person other than an affiliate of 
the issuer, together with all other sales of restricted securities of 
the same class for the account of such person within the preceding three 
months, shall not exceed the amount specified in paragraphs (e)(1) (i), 
(ii) or (iii) of this section, whichever is applicable, unless the 
conditions of paragraph (k) of this rule are satisfied.
    (3) Determination of amount. For the purpose of determining the 
amount of securities specified in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this 
section, the following provisions shall apply:
    (i) Where both convertible securities and securities of the class 
into which they are convertible are sold, the amount of convertible 
securities sold shall be deemed to be the amount of securities of the 
class into which they are convertible for the purpose of determining the 
aggregate amount of securities of both classes sold;
    (ii) The amount of securities sold for the account of a pledgee 
thereof, or for the account of a purchaser of the pledged securities, 
during any period of three months within one year after a default in the 
obligation secured by the pledge, and the amount of securities sold 
during the same three-month period for the account of the pledgor shall 
not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in paragraph (e) (1) 
or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable;
    (iii) The amount of securities sold for the account of a donee 
thereof during any period of three months within one year after the 
donation, and the amount of securities sold during the same three-month 
period for the account of the donor, shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 
the amount specified in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section, 
whichever is applicable;
    (iv) Where securities were acquired by a trust from the settlor of 
the trust, the amount of such securities sold for the account of the 
trust during any period of three months within one year after the 
acquisition of the securities by the trust, and the amount of securities 
sold during the same three-month period for the account of the settlor, 
shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in paragraph 
(e) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable;
    (v) The amount of securities sold for the account of the estate of a 
deceased person, or for the account of a beneficiary of such estate, 
during any period of 3 months and the amount of securities sold during 
the same period for the account of the deceased person prior to his 
death shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in 
paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable: 
Provided, That no limitation on amount shall apply if the estate or 
beneficiary thereof is not an affiliate of the issuer;
    (vi) When two or more affiliates or other persons agree to act in 
concert for the purpose of selling securities of an issuer, all 
securities of the same class sold for the account of all such persons 
during any period of 3 months shall be aggregated for the purpose of 
determining the limitation on the amount of securities sold;
    (vii) The following sales of securities need not be included in 
determining the amount of securities sold in reliance upon this section: 
securities sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under 
the Act; securities sold pursuant to an exemption provided by Regulation 
A (Sec. 230.251 through Sec. 230.263) under the Act; securities sold in 
a transaction exempt pursuant to Section 4 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d) 
and not involving any public offering; and securities sold offshore 
pursuant to Regulation S (Sec. 230.901 through Sec. 230.905, and 
Preliminary Notes) under the Act.

[[Page 459]]

    (f) Manner of sale. The securities shall be sold in brokers' 
transactions within the meaning of section 4(4) of the Act or in 
transactions directly with a market maker, as that term is defined in 
section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the person 
selling the securities shall not (1) solicit or arrange for the 
solicitation of orders to buy the securities in anticipation of or in 
connection with such transaction, or (2) make any payment in connection 
with the offer or sale of the securities to any person other than the 
broker who executes an order to sell the securities. The requirements of 
this paragraph, however, shall not apply to securities sold for the 
account of the estate of a deceased person or for the account of a 
beneficiary of such estate provided the estate or beneficiary thereof is 
not an affiliate of the issuer; nor shall they apply to securities sold 
for the account of any person other than an affiliate of the issuer 
provided the conditions of paragraph (k) of this rule are satisfied.
    (g) Brokers' transactions. The term brokers' transactions in section 
4(4) of the Act shall for the purposes of this rule be deemed to include 
transactions by a broker in which such broker:
    (1) Does not more than execute the order or orders to sell the 
securities as agent for the person for whose account the securities are 
sold; and receives no more than the usual and customary broker's 
commission;
    (2) Neither solicits nor arranges for the solicitation of customers' 
orders to buy the securities in anticipation of or in connection with 
the transaction; provided, that the foregoing shall not preclude (i) 
inquiries by the broker of other brokers or dealers who have indicated 
an interest in the securities within the preceding 60 days, (ii) 
inquiries by the broker of his customers who have indicated an 
unsolicited bona fide interest in the securities within the preceding 10 
business days; or (iii) the publication by the broker of bid and ask 
quotations for the security in an inter-dealer quotation system provided 
that such quotations are incident to the maintenance of a bona fide 
inter-dealer market for the security for the broker's own account and 
that the broker has published bona fide bid and ask quotations for the 
security in an inter-dealer quotation system on each of at least twelve 
days within the preceding thirty calendar days with no more than four 
business days in succession without such two-way quotations;
    Note to Paragraph (g)(2)(ii): The broker should obtain and retain in 
his files written evidence of indications of bona fide unsolicited 
interest by his customers in the securities at the time such indications 
are received.

    (3) After reasonable inquiry is not aware of circumstances 
indicating that the person for whose account the securities are sold is 
an underwriter with respect to the securities or that the transaction is 
a part of a distribution of securities of the issuer. Without limiting 
the foregoing, the broker shall be deemed to be aware of any facts or 
statements contained in the notice required by paragraph (h) of this 
section.
    Notes: (i) The broker, for his own protection, should obtain and 
retain in his files a copy of the notice required by paragraph (h) of 
this section.
    (ii) The reasonable inquiry required by paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section should include, but not necessarily be limited to, inquiry as to 
the following matters:
    (a) The length of time the securities have been held by the person 
for whose account they are to be sold. If practicable, the inquiry 
should include physical inspection of the securities;
    (b) The nature of the transaction in which the securities were 
acquired by such person;
    (c) The amount of securities of the same class sold during the past 
3 months by all persons whose sales are required to be taken into 
consideration pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;
    (d) Whether such person intends to sell additional securities of the 
same class through any other means;
    (e) Whether such person has solicited or made any arrangement for 
the solicitation of buy orders in connection with the proposed sale of 
securities;
    (f) Whether such person has made any payment to any other person in 
connection with the proposed sale of the securities; and
    (g) The number of shares or other units of the class outstanding, or 
the relevant trading volume.

    (h) Notice of proposed sale. If the amount of securities to be sold 
in reliance upon the rule during any period of three months exceeds 500 
shares or other units or has an aggregate sale price in excess of 
$10,000, three copies of a notice on Form 144 shall be filed

[[Page 460]]

with the Commission at its principal office in Washington, DC; and if 
such securities are admitted to trading on any national securities 
exchange, one copy of such notice shall also be transmitted to the 
principal exchange on which such securities are so admitted. The Form 
144 shall be signed by the person for whose account the securities are 
to be sold and shall be transmitted for filing concurrently with either 
the placing with a broker of an order to execute a sale of securities in 
reliance upon this rule or the execution directly with a market maker of 
such a sale. Neither the filing of such notice nor the failure of the 
Commission to comment thereon shall be deemed to preclude the Commission 
from taking any action it deems necessary or appropriate with respect to 
the sale of the securities referred to in such notice. The requirements 
of this paragraph, however, shall not apply to securities sold for the 
account of any person other than an affiliate of the issuer, provided 
the conditions of paragraph (k) of this rule are satisfied.
    (i) Bona fide intention to sell. The person filing the notice 
required by paragraph (h) of this section shall have a bona fide 
intention to sell the securities referred to therein within a reasonable 
time after the filing of such notice.
    (j) Non-exclusive rule. Although this rule provides a means for 
reselling restricted securities and securities held by affiliates 
without registration, it is not the exclusive means for reselling such 
securities in that manner. Therefore, it does not eliminate or otherwise 
affect the availability of any exemption for resales under the 
Securities Act that a person or entity may be able to rely upon.
    (k) Termination of certain restrictions on sales of restricted 
securities by persons other than affiliates. The requirements of 
paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (h) of this section shall not apply to 
restricted securities sold for the account of a person who is not an 
affiliate of the issuer at the time of the sale and has not been an 
affiliate during the preceding three months, provided a period of at 
least two years has elapsed since the later of the date the securities 
were acquired from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer. The 
two-year period shall be calculated as described in paragraph (d) of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 230.144A  Private resales of securities to institutions.

    Preliminary Notes: 1. This section relates solely to the application 
of section 5 of the Act and not to antifraud or other provisions of the 
federal securities laws.
    2. Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an 
exclusive election; any seller hereunder may also claim the availability 
of any other applicable exemption from the registration requirements of 
the Act.
    3. In view of the objective of this section and the policies 
underlying the Act, this section is not available with respect to any 
transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with this section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under 
the Act is required.
    4. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any issuer or any 
other person to comply with the securities registration or broker-dealer 
registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
Exchange Act), whenever such requirements are applicable.
    5. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any person to 
comply with any applicable state law relating to the offer or sale of 
securities.
    6. Securities acquired in a transaction made pursuant to the 
provisions of this section are deemed to be restricted securities within 
the meaning of Sec. 230.144(a)(3) of this chapter.

[[Page 461]]

    7. The fact that purchasers of securities from the issuer thereof 
may purchase such securities with a view to reselling such securities 
pursuant to this section will not affect the availability to such issuer 
of an exemption under section 4(2) of the Act, or Regulation D under the 
Act, from the registration requirements of the Act.

    (a) Definitions. (1) For purposes of this section, qualified 
institutional buyer shall mean:
    (i) Any of the following entities, acting for its own account or the 
accounts of other qualified institutional buyers, that in the aggregate 
owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $100 million in 
securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the entity:
    (A) Any insurance company as defined in section 2(13) of the Act;
    Note: A purchase by an insurance company for one or more of its 
separate accounts, as defined by section 2(a)(37) of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (the ``Investment Company Act''), which are neither

be so registered, shall be deemed to be a purchase for the account of

entity and invested on a discretionary basis, securities owned by 
subsidiaries of the entity that are consolidated with the entity in its 
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles may be included if the investments of such 
subsidiaries are managed under the direction of the entity, except that, 
unless the entity is a reporting company under section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act, securities owned by such subsidiaries may not be

be included in the consolidated financial statements of another 
enterprise.
    (5) For purposes of this section, riskless principal transaction 
means a transaction in which a dealer buys a security from any person 
and makes a simultaneous offsetting sale of such security to a qualified 
institutional buyer, including another dealer acting as riskless 
principal for a qualified institutional buyer.
    (6) For purposes of this section, effective conversion premium means

    (d) Conditions to be met. To qualify for exemption under this 
section, an offer or sale must meet the following conditions:
    (1) The securities are offered or sold only to a qualified 
institutional buyer or to an offeree or purchaser that the seller and 
any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe is a 
qualified institutional buyer. In determining whether a prospective 
purchaser is a qualified institutional buyer, the seller and any person 
acting on its behalf shall be entitled to rely upon the following non-
exclusive methods of establishing the prospective purchaser's ownership 
and discretionary investments of securities:
    (i) The prospective purchaser's most recent publicly available 
financial statements, Provided That such statements present the 
information as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of 
securities under this section in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 
18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser;
    (ii) The most recent publicly available information appearing in 
documents filed by the prospective purchaser with the Commission or 
another United States federal, state, or local governmental agency or 
self-regulatory organization, or with a foreign governmental agency or 
self-regulatory organization, Provided That any such information is as 
of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of securities 
under this section in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 18 months 
preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser;
    (iii) The most recent publicly available information appearing in a 
recognized securities manual, Provided That such information is as of a 
date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of securities under 
this section in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 18 months 
preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or
    (iv) A certification by the chief financial officer, a person 
fulfilling an equivalent function, or other executive officer of the 
purchaser, specifying the amount of securities owned and invested on a 
discretionary basis by the purchaser as of a specific date on or since 
the close of the purchaser's most recent fiscal year, or, in the case of 
a purchaser that is a member of a family of investment companies, a 
certification by an executive officer of the investment adviser 
specifying the amount of securities owned by the family of investment 
companies as of a specific date on or since the close of the purchaser's 
most recent fiscal year;
    (2) The seller and any person acting on its behalf takes reasonable 
steps to ensure that the purchaser is aware that the seller may rely on 
the exemption from the provisions of section 5 of the Act provided by 
this section;
    (3) The securities offered or sold:
    (i) Were not, when issued, of the same class as securities listed on 
a national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the 
Exchange Act or quoted in a U.S. automated inter-dealer quotation 
system; Provided, That securities that are convertible or exchangeable 
into securities so listed or quoted at the time of issuance and that had 
an effective conversion premium of less than 10 percent, shall be 
treated as securities of the class into which they are convertible or 
exchangeable; and that warrants that may be exercised for securities so 
listed or quoted at the time of issuance, for a period of less than 3 
years from the date of issuance, or that had an effective exercise 
premium of less than 10 percent, shall be treated as securities of the 
class to be issued upon exercise; and Provided further, That the 
Commission may from time to time, taking into account then-existing 
market practices, designate additional securities and classes of 
securities that will not be deemed of the same class as securities 
listed on a national securities exchange or quoted in a U.S. automated 
inter-dealer quotation system; and

[[Page 464]]

    (ii) Are not securities of an open-end investment company, unit 
investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or is 
required to be registered under section 8 of the Investment Company Act; 
and
    (4)(i) In the case of securities of an issuer that is neither 
subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor exempt from 
reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) (Sec. 240.12g3-2(b) of this 
chapter) under the Exchange Act, nor a foreign government as defined in 
Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405 of this chapter) eligible to register securities 
under Schedule B of the Act, the holder and a prospective purchaser 
designated by the holder have the right to obtain from the issuer, upon 
request of the holder, and the prospective purchaser has received from 
the issuer, the seller, or a person acting on either of their behalf, at 
or prior to the time of sale, upon such prospective purchaser's request 
to the holder or the issuer, the following information (which shall be 
reasonably current in relation to the date of resale under this 
section): a very brief statement of the nature of the business of the 
issuer and the products and services it offers; and the issuer's most 
recent balance sheet and profit and loss and retained earnings 
statements, and similar financial statements for such part of the two 
preceding fiscal years as the issuer has been in operation (the 
financial statements should be audited to the extent reasonably 
available).
    (ii) The requirement that the information be reasonably current will 
be presumed to be satisfied if:
    (A) The balance sheet is as of a date less than 16 months before the 
date of resale, the statements of profit and loss and retained earnings 
are for the 12 months preceding the date of such balance sheet, and if 
such balance sheet is not as of a date less than 6 months before the 
date of resale, it shall be accompanied by additional statements of 
profit and loss and retained earnings for the period from the date of 
such balance sheet to a date less than 6 months before the date of 
resale; and
    (B) The statement of the nature of the issuer's business and its 
products and services offered is as of a date within 12 months prior to 
the date of resale; or
    (C) With regard to foreign private issuers, the required information 
meets the timing requirements of the issuer's home country or principal 
trading markets.
    (e) Offers and sales of securities pursuant to this section shall be 
deemed not to affect the availability of any exemption or safe harbor 
relating to any previous or subsequent offer or sale of such securities 
by the issuer or any prior or subsequent holder thereof.

Sec. 230.145  Reclassification of securities, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions of assets.

    Preliminary Note: Rule 145 (Sec. 230.145 of this chapter) is 
designed to make available the protection provided by registration under 
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Act), to persons who are offered 
securities in a business combination of the type described in paragraphs 
(a) (1), (2) and (3) of the rule. The thrust of the rule is that an 
offer, offer to sell, offer for sale, or sale occurs when there is 
submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such 
holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a 
new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security 
in exchange for their existing security. Rule 145 embodies the 
Commission's determination that such transactions are subject to the 
registration requirements of the Act, and that the previously existing 
no-sale theory of Rule 133 is no longer consistent with the statutory 
purposes of the Act. See Release No. 33-5316 (October 6, 1972) [37 FR 
23631]. Securities issued in transactions described in paragraph (a) of 
Rule 145 may be registered on Form S-4 or F-4 (Sec. 239.25 or 
Sec. 239.34 of this chapter) or Form N-14 (Sec. 239.23 of this chapter) 
under the Act.
    Transactions for which statutory exemptions under the Act, including 
those contained in sections 3(a)(9), (10), (11) and 4(2), are otherwise 
available are not affected by Rule 145.
    Note 1:  Reference is made to Rule 153a (Sec. 230.153a of this 
chapter) describing the prospectus delivery required in a transaction of 
the type referred to in Rule 145.
    Note 2:  A reclassification of securities covered by Rule 145 would 
be exempt from registration pursuant to section 3(a)(9) or (11) of the 
Act if the conditions of either of these sections are satisfied.


[[Page 465]]


    (a) Transactions within this section. An offer, offer to sell, offer 
for sale, or sale shall be deemed to be involved, within the meaning of 
section 2(3) of the Act, so far as the security holders of a corporation 
or other person are concerned where, pursuant to statutory provisions of 
the jurisdiction under which such corporation or other person is 
organized, or pursuant to provisions contained in its certificate of 
incorporation or similar controlling instruments, or otherwise, there is 
submitted for the vote or consent of such security holders a plan or 
agreement for:
    (1) Reclassifications. A reclassification of securities of such 
corporation or other person, other than a stock split, reverse stock 
split, or change in par value, which involves the substitution of a 
security for another security;
    (2) Mergers of Consolidations. A statutory merger or consolidation 
or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation 
or other person held by such security holders will become or be 
exchanged for securities of any person, unless the sole purpose of the 
transaction is to change an issuer's domicile solely within the United 
States; or
    (3) Transfers of assets. A transfer of assets of such corporation or 
other person, to another person in consideration of the issuance of 
securities of such other person or any of its affiliates, if:
    (i) Such plan or agreement provides for dissolution of the 
corporation or other person whose security holders are voting or 
consenting; or
    (ii) Such plan or agreement provides for a pro rata or similar 
distribution of such securities to the security holders voting or 
consenting; or
    (iii) The board of directors or similar representatives of such 
corporation or other person, adopts resolutions relative to paragraph 
(a)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section within 1 year after the taking of 
such vote or consent; or
    (iv) The transfer of assets is a part of a preexisting plan for 
distribution of such securities, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) (i), 
(ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (b) Communications not deemed to be a Prospectus or Offer to Sell. 
For the purpose of this section, the term prospectus as defined in 
section 2(10) of the Act and the term offer to sell in section 5 of the 
Act shall not be deemed to include the following:
    (1) Any written communication or other published statement which 
contains no more than the following information: The name of the issuer 
of the securities to be offered, or the person whose assets are to be 
sold in exchange for the securities to be offered, and the names of 
other parties to any transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section; a brief description of the business of parties to such 
transaction; the date, time, and place of the meeting of security 
holders to vote on or consent to any such transaction specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section; a brief description of the transaction to 
be acted upon and the basis upon which such transaction will be made; 
and any legend or similar statement required by State or Federal law or 
administrative authority.
    (2) Any written communication subject to and meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of Sec. 240.14a-12 of this chapter and 
filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of that section.
    (c) Persons and parties deemed to be underwriters. For purposes of 
this section, any party to any transaction specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, other than the issuer, or any person who is an affiliate 
of such party at the time any such transaction is submitted for vote or 
consent, who publicly offers or sells securities of the issuer acquired 
in connection with any such transaction, shall be deemed to be engaged 
in a distribution and therefore to be an underwriter thereof within the 
meaning of section 2(11) of the Act. The term party as used in this 
paragraph (c) shall mean the corporations, business entities, or other 
persons, other than the issuer, whose assets or capital structure are 
affected by the transactions specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Resale provisions for persons and parties deemed underwriters. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), a person or party 
specified therein shall not be deemed to be engaged in a distribution 
and therefore not to be an underwriter of registered securities acquired 
in a transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section if:

[[Page 466]]

    (1) Such securities are sold by such person or party in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (g) of Sec. 230.144;
    (2) Such person or party is not an affiliate of the issuer, and a 
period of at least one year, as determined in accordance with paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 230.144, has elapsed since the date the securities were 
acquired from the issuer in such transaction, and the issuer meets the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of Sec. 230.144; or
    (3) Such person or party is not, and has not been for at least three 
months, an affiliate of the issuer, and a period of at least two years, 
as determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 230.144, has 
elapsed since the date the securities were acquired from the issuer in 
such transaction.
    (e) Definition of person. The term person as used in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, when used with reference to a person for whose 
account securities are to be sold, shall have the same meaning as the 
definition of that term in paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 230.144.

Sec. 230.146  Rules under section 18 of the Act.

    (a) Prepared by or on behalf of the issuer. An offering document (as 
defined in Section 18(d)(1) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 77r(d)(1)]) is 
``prepared by or on behalf of the issuer'' for purposes of Section 18 of 
the Act, if the issuer or an agent or representative:
    (1) Authorizes the document's production, and
    (2) Approves the document before its use.
    (b) Covered securities for purposes of Section 18. (1) For purposes 
of Section 18(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77r), the Commission finds that 
the following national securities exchanges, or segments or tiers 
thereof, have listing standards that are substantially similar to those 
of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), the American Stock Exchange 
(``Amex''), or the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market 
(``Nasdaq/NMS''), and that securities listed on such exchanges shall be 
deemed covered securities:
    (i) Tier I of the Pacific Exchange, Incorporated;
    (ii) Tier I of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Incorporated; and
    (iii) The Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated.
    (2) The designation of securities in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through 
(iii) of this section as covered securities is conditioned on such 
exchanges' listing standards (or segments or tiers thereof) continuing 
to be substantially similar to those of the NYSE, Amex, or Nasdaq/NMS.

[62 FR 24573, May 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 3035, Jan. 21, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 230.147  ``Part of an issue'', ``person resident'', and ``doing business within'' for purposes of section 3(a)(11).

    Preliminary Notes: 1. This rule shall not raise any presumption that 
the exemption provided by section 3(a)(11) of the Act is not available 
for transactions by an issuer which do not satisfy all of the provisions 
of the rule.
    2. Nothing in this rule obviates the need for compliance with any 
state law relating to the offer and sale of the securities.
    3. Section 5 of the Act requires that all securities offered by the 
use of the mails or by any means or instruments of transportation or 
communication in interstate commerce be registered with the Commission. 
Congress, however, provided certain exemptions in the Act from such 
registration provisions where there was no practical need for 
registration or where the benefits of registration were too remote. 
Among those exemptions is that provided by section 3(a)(11) of the Act 
for transactions in any security which is a part of an issue offered and 
sold only to persons resident within a single State or Territory, where 
the issuer of such security is a person resident and doing business 
within * * * such State or Territory. The legislative history of that 
Section suggests that the exemption was intended to apply only to issues 
genuinely local in character, which in reality represent local financing 
by local industries, carried out through local investment. Rule 147 is 
intended to provide more objective standards upon which responsible 
local businessmen intending to raise capital from local sources may rely 
in claiming the section 3(a)(11) exemption.
    All of the terms and conditions of the rule must be satisfied in 
order for the rule to be

[[Page 467]]

available. These are: (i) That the issuer be a resident of and doing 
business within the state or territory in which all offers and sales are 
made; and (ii) that no part of the issue be offered or sold to non-
residents within the period of time specified in the rule. For purposes 
of the rule the definition of issuer in section 2(4) of the Act shall 
apply.
    All offers, offers to sell, offers for sale, and sales which are 
part of the same issue must meet all of the conditions of Rule 147 for 
the rule to be available. The determination whether offers, offers to 
sell, offers for sale and sales of securities are part of the same issue 
(i.e., are deemed to be integrated) will continue to be a question of 
fact and will depend on the particular circumstances. See Securities Act 
of 1933 Release No. 4434 (December 6, 1961) (26 FR 9158). Securities Act 
Release No. 4434 indicated that in determining whether offers and sales 
should be regarded as part of the same issue and thus should be 
integrated any one or more of the following factors may be 
determinative:
    (i) Are the offerings part of a single plan of financing;
    (ii) Do the offerings involve issuance of the same class of 
securities;
    (iii) Are the offerings made at or about the same time;
    (iv) Is the same type of consideration to be received; and
    (v) Are the offerings made for the same general purpose.
    Subparagraph (b)(2) of the rule, however, is designed to provide 
certainty to the extent feasible by identifying certain types of offers 
and sales of securities which will be deemed not part of an issue, for 
purposes of the rule only.
    Persons claiming the availability of the rule have the burden of 
proving that they have satisfied all of its provisions. However, the 
rule does not establish exclusive standards for complying with the 
section 3(a)(11) exemption. The exemption would also be available if the 
issuer satisfied the standards set forth in relevant administrative and 
judicial interpretations at the time of the offering but the issuer 
would have the burden of proving the availability of the exemption. Rule 
147 relates to transactions exempted from the registration requirements 
of section 5 of the Act by section 3(a)(11). Neither the rule nor 
section 3(a)(11) provides an exemption from the registration 
requirements of section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the civil 
liability provisions of section 12(2) of the Act or other provisions of 
the federal securities laws.
    Finally, in view of the objectives of the rule and the purposes and 
policies underlying the Act, the rule shall not be available to any 
person with respect to any offering which, although in technical 
compliance with the rule, is part of a plan or scheme by such person to 
make interstate offers or sales of securities. In such cases 
registration pursuant to the Act is required.
    4. The rule provides an exemption for offers and sales by the issuer 
only. It is not available for offers or sales of securities by other 
persons. Section 3(a)(11) of the Act has been interpreted to permit 
offers and sales by persons controlling the issuer, if the exemption 
provided by that section would have been available to the issuer at the 
time of the offering. See Securities Act Release No. 4434. Controlling 
persons who want to offer or sell securities pursuant to section 
3(a)(11) may continue to do so in accordance with applicable judicial 
and administrative interpretations.

    (a) Transactions covered. Offers, offers to sell, offers for sale 
and sales by an issuer of its securities made in accordance with all of 
the terms and conditions of this rule shall be deemed to be part of an 
issue offered and sold only to persons resident within a single state or 
territory where the issuer is a person resident and doing business

[[Page 468]]


    (c) Nature of the issuer. The issuer of the securities shall at the 
time of any offers and the sales be a person resident and doing business 
within the state or territory in which all of the offers, offers to 
sell, offers for sale and sales are made.
    (1) The issuer shall be deemed to be a resident of the state or 
territory in which:
    (i) It is incorporated or organized, if a corporation, limited 
partnership, trust or other form of business organization that is 
organized under state or territorial law;
    (ii) Its principal office is located, if a general partnership or 
other form of business organization that is not organized under any 
state or territorial law;
    (iii) His principal residence is located if an individual.
    (2) The issuer shall be deemed to be doing business within a state 
or territory if:
    (i) The issuer derived at least 80 percent of its gross revenues and 
those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
    (A) For its most recent fiscal year, if the first offer of any part 
of the issue is made during the first six months of the issuer's current 
fiscal year; or
    (B) For the first six months of its current fiscal year or during 
the twelve-month fiscal period ending with such six-month period, if the 
first offer of any part of the issue is made during the last six months 
of the issuer's current fiscal year from the operation of a business or 
of real property located in or from the rendering of services within 
such state or territory; provided, however, that this provision does not 
apply to any issuer which has not had gross revenues in excess of $5,000 
from the sale of products or services or other conduct of its business 
for its most recent twelve-month fiscal period;
    (ii) The issuer had at the end of its most recent semi-annual fiscal 
period prior to the first offer of any part of the issue, at least 80 
percent of its assets and those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated 
basis located within such state or territory;
    (iii) The issuer intends to use and uses at least 80 percent of the 
net proceeds to the issuer from sales made pursuant to this rule in 
connection with the operation of a business or of real property, the 
purchase of real property located in, or the rendering of services 
within such state or territory; and
    (iv) The principal office of the issuer is located within such state 
or territory.
    (d) Offerees and purchasers: Person Resident. Offers, offers to 
sell, offers for sale and sales of securities that are part of an issue 
shall be made only to persons resident within the state or territory of 
which the issuer is a resident. For purposes of determining the 
residence of offerees and purchasers:
    (1) A corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business 
organization shall be deemed to be a resident of a state or territory 
if, at the time of the offer and sale to it, it has its principal office 
within such state or territory.
    (2) An individual shall be deemed to be a resident of a state or 
territory if such individual has, at the time of the offer and sale to 
him, his principal residence in the state or territory.
    (3) A corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business 
organization which is organized for the specific purpose of acquiring 
part of an issue offered pursuant to this rule shall be deemed not to be 
a resident of a state or territory unless all of the beneficial owners 
of such organization are residents of such state or territory.
    (e) Limitation of resales. During the period in which securities 
that are part of an issue are being offered and sold by the issuer, and 
for a period of nine months from the date of the last sale by the issuer 
of such securities, all resales of any part of the issue, by any person, 
shall be made only to persons resident within such state or territory.
    Notes: 1. In the case of convertible securities resales of either 
the convertible security, or if it is converted, the underlying 
security, could be made during the period described in paragraph (e) 
only to persons resident within such state or territory. For purposes of 
this rule a conversion in reliance on section 3(a)(9) of the Act does 
not begin a new period.
    2. Dealers must satisfy the requirements of Rule 15c2-11 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prior to publishing any quotation for a 
security, or submitting any quotation for publication, in any quotation 
medium.

the security stating that the securities have not been registered under 
the Act and setting forth the limitations on resale contained in 
paragraph (e) of this section;
    (ii) Issue stop transfer instructions to the issuer's transfer 
agent, if any, with respect to the securities, or, if the issuer 
transfers its own securities make a notation in the appropriate records 
of the issuer; and
    (iii) Obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his 
residence.
    (2) The issuer shall, in connection with the issuance of new 
certificates for any of the securities that are part of the same issue

paragraph (e), take the steps required by paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) 
of this section.
    (3) The issuer shall, in connection with any offers, offers to sell, 
offers for sale or sales by it pursuant to this rule, disclose, in 
writing, the limitations on resale contained in paragraph (e) and the 
provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) and paragraph (f)(2) of

Sec. 230.156  Investment company sales literature.

    (a) Under the federal securities laws, including section 17(a) of 
the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q(a)) and section 10(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j(b)) and Rule 10b-5 
thereunder (17 CFR part 240), it is unlawful for any person, directly or 
indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate 
commerce or of the mails, to use sales literature which is materially 
misleading in connection with the offer or sale of securities issued by 
an investment company. Under these provisions, sales literature is 
materially misleading if it: (1) Contains an untrue statement of a 
material fact or (2) omits to state a material fact necessary in order 
to make a statement made, in the light of the circumstances of its use, 
not misleading.

[[Page 472]]

    (b) Whether or not a particular description, representation, 
illustration, or other statement involving a material fact is misleading 
depends on evaluation of the context in which it is made. In considering 
whether a particular statement involving a material fact is or might be 
misleading, weight should be given to all pertinent factors, including, 
but not limited to, those listed below.
    (1) A Statement could be misleading because of:
    (i) Other statements being made in connection with the offer of sale 
or sale of the securities in question;
    (ii) The absence of explanations, qualifications, limitations or 
other statements necessary or appropriate to make such statement not 
misleading; or
    (iii) General economic or financial conditions or circumstances.
    (2) Representations about past or future investment performance 
could be misleading because of statements or omissions made involving a 
material fact, including situations where:
    (i) Portrayals of past income, gain, or growth of assets convey an 
impression of the net investment results achieved by an actual or 
hypothetical investment which would not be justified under the 
circumstances; and
    (ii) Representations, whether express or implied, about future 
investment performance, including:
    (A) Representations, as to security of capital, possible future 
gains or income, or expenses associated with an investment;
    (B) Representations implying that future gain or income may be 
inferred from or predicted based on past investment performance; or
    (C) Portrayals of past performance, made in a manner which would 
imply that gains or income realized in the past would be repeated in the 
future.
    (3) A statement involving a material fact about the characteristics 
or attributes of an investment company could be misleading because of:
    (i) Statements about possible benefits connected with or resulting 
from services to be provided or methods of operation which do not give 
equal prominence to discussion of any risks or limitations associated 
therewith;
    (ii) Exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about management skill or 
techniques, characteristics of the investment company or an investment 
in securities issued by such company, services, security of investment 
or funds, effects of government supervision, or other attributes; and
    (iii) Unwarranted or incompletely explained comparisons to other 
investment vehicles or to indexes.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the term sales literature shall be 
deemed to include any communication (whether in writing, by radio, or by 
television) used by any person to offer to sell or induce the sale of 
securities of any investment company. Communications between issuers, 
underwriters and dealers are included in this definition of sales 
literature if such communications, or the information contained therein, 
can be reasonably expected to be communicated to prospective investors 
in the offer or sale of securities or are designed to be employed in 
either written or oral form in the offer or sale of securities.

income statements satisfy the criteria of this paragraph and information 
respecting the subsidiary is included to the same extent as was 
presented in the registration statement. An ``earning statement'' not 
meeting the requirements of this paragraph may otherwise be sufficient 
for purposes of the last paragraph of section 11(a).
    (b) For purposes of the last paragraph of section 11(a) only, the 
``earning statement'' contemplated by paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be deemed to be ``made generally available to its

or has supplied to the Commission copies of the annual report sent to 
securityholders pursuant to rule 14a-3(c), containing such information.

A registrant may use other methods to make an earning statement 
``generally available to its securityholders'' for purposes of the last 
paragraph of section 11(a).
    (c) For purposes of the last paragraph of section 11(a) only, the 
effective date of the registration statement is deemed to be the date of 
the latest to occur of (1) the effective date of the registration 
statement: (2) the effective date of the last post-effective amendment 
to the registration statement, next preceding a particular sale by the 
registrant of registered securities to the public filed for purposes of

Sec. 230.171  Disclosure detrimental to the national defense or foreign policy.

    (a) Any requirement to the contrary notwithstanding, no registration 
statement, prospectus, or other document filed with the Commission or 
used in connection with the offering or sale of any securities shall 
contain any document or information which, pursuant to Executive order, 
has been classified by an appropriate department or agency of the United 
States for protection in the interests of national defense or foreign 
policy.
    (b) Where a document or information is omitted pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, there shall be filed, in lieu of such document or 
information, a statement from an appropriate department or agency of the

a determination of an appropriate department or agency of the United 
States that disclosure of such information would not be contrary to the

which may require classification in the interests of national defense or 
foreign policy pending determination by an appropriate department or

Sec. 230.174  Delivery of prospectus by dealers; exemptions under section 4(3) of the Act.

    The obligations of a dealer (including an underwriter no longer 
acting as an underwriter in respect of the security involved in such 
transactions) to deliver a prospectus in transactions in a security as 
to which a registration statement has been filed taking place prior to 
the expiration of the 40- or 90-day period specified in section 4(3) of 
the Act after the effective date of such registration statement or prior 
to the expiration of such period after the first date upon which the 
security was bona fide offered to the public by the issuer or by or 
through an underwriter after such effective date, whichever is later, 
shall be subject to the following provisions:
    (a) No prospectus need be delivered if the registration statement is 
on Form F-6 (Sec. 239.36 of this chapter).
    (b) No prospectus need be delivered if the issuer is subject, 
immediately prior to the time of filing the registration statement, to 
the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934.
    (c) Where a registration statement relates to offerings to be made 
from time to time no prospectus need be delivered after the expiration 
of the initial prospectus delivery period specified in section 4(3) of 
the Act following the first bona fide offering of securities under such 
registration statement.
    (d) If (1) the registration statement relates to the security of an 
issuer that is not subject, immediately prior to the time of filing the 
registration statement, to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (2) as of the offering 
date, the security is listed on a registered national securities 
exchange or authorized for inclusion in an electronic inter-dealer 
quotation system sponsored and governed by the rules of a registered 
securities association, no prospectus need be delivered after the 
expiration of twenty-five calendar days after the offering date. For 
purposes of this provision, the term offering date refers to the later 
of the effective date of the registration statement or the first date on 
which the security was bona fide offered to the public.
    (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the period during which a 
prospectus must be delivered by a dealer shall be:
    (1) As specified in section 4(3) of the Act if the registration 
statement was the subject of a stop order issued under section 8 of the 
Act; or
    (2) As the Commission may provide upon application or on its own 
motion in a particular case.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall affect the obligation to deliver a 
prospectus pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of the Act by a 
dealer who is acting as an underwriter with respect to the securities 
involved or who is engaged in a transaction as to securities 
constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or 
subscription by such dealer as a participant in the distribution of such 
securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.
    (g) If the registration statement relates to an offering of 
securities of a ``blank check company,'' as defined in Rule 419 under 
the Act (17 CFR 230.419), the statutory period for prospectus delivery 
specified in section 4(3) of the Act shall not terminate until 90 days 
after the date funds and securities are released from the escrow or 
trust account pursuant to Rule 419 under the Act.

from continuing operations in at least one of its last two fiscal years.
    Note: Where a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration is to be 
received, the aggregate offering price shall be based on the price at 
which the securities are offered for cash. Any portion of the aggregate 
offering price attributable to cash received in a foreign currency shall 
be translated into United States currency at a currency exchange rate

[[Page 480]]

in effect on or at a reasonable time prior to the date of the sale of 
the securities. If securities are not offered for cash, the aggregate 
offering price shall be based on the value of the consideration as 
established by bona fide sales of that consideration made within a 
reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair value as 
determined by an accepted standard. Valuations of non-cash consideration 
must be reasonable at the time made.

A offering.
    Note: If the issuer offers or sells securities for which the safe 
harbor rules are unavailable, such offers and sales still may not be 
integrated with the Regulation A offering, depending on the particular 
facts and circumstances. See Securities Act Release No. 4552 (November 
6, 1962) [27 FR 11316].

Sec. 230.254  Solicitation of interest document for use prior to an offering statement.

    (a) An issuer may publish or deliver to prospective purchasers a 
written document or make scripted radio or television broadcasts to 
determine whether there is any interest in a contemplated securities 
offering. Following submission of the written document or script of the 
broadcast to the Commission, as required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, oral communications with prospective investors and other 
broadcasts are permitted. The written documents, broadcasts and oral 
communications are each subject to the antifraud provisions of the 
federal securities laws. No solicitation or acceptance of money or other 
consideration, nor of any commitment, binding or otherwise, from any 
prospective investor is permitted. No sale may be made until 
qualification of the offering statement.
    (b) While not a condition to any exemption pursuant to this section:
    (1) On or before the date of its first use, the issuer shall submit 
a copy of any written document or the script of any broadcast with the 
Commission's main office in Washington, DC. (Attention: Office of Small 
Business Review).The document or broadcast script shall either contain 
or be accompanied by the name and telephone number of a person able to 
answer questions about the document or the broadcast.
    Note: Only solicitation of interest material that contains 
substantive changes from or additions to previously submitted material 
needs to be submitted.

    (2) The written document or script of the broadcast shall:
    (i) State that no money or other consideration is being solicited, 
and if sent in response, will not be accepted;
    (ii) State that no sales of the securities will be made or 
commitment to purchase accepted until delivery of an offering circular 
that includes complete information about the issuer and the offering;
    (iii) State that an indication of interest made by a prospective 
investor involves no obligation or commitment of any kind; and
    (iv) Identify the chief executive officer of the issuer and briefly 
and in general its business and products.
    (3) Solicitations of interest pursuant to this provision may not be 
made after the filing of an offering statement.
    (4) Sales may not be made until 20 calendar days after the last 
publication or delivery of the document or radio or television 
broadcast.
    (c) Any written document under this section may include a coupon, 
returnable to the issuer indicating interest in a potential offering, 
revealing the name, address and telephone number of the prospective 
investor.
    (d) Where an issuer has a bona fide change of intention and decides 
to register an offering after using the process permitted by this 
section without having filed the offering statement prescribed by 
Sec. 230.252, the Regulation A exemption for offers made in reliance 
upon this section will not be subject to integration with the registered 
offering, if at least 30 calendar days have elapsed between the last 
solicitation of interest and the filing of the registration statement 
with the Commission, and all solicitation of interest documents have 
been submitted to the

[[Page 483]]

Commission. With respect to integration with other offerings, see 
Sec. 230.251(c).
    (e) Written solicitation of interest materials submitted to the 
Commission and otherwise in compliance with this section shall not be 
deemed to be a prospectus as defined in section 2(10) of the Securities 
Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(10)).

Sec. 230.255  Preliminary Offering Circulars.

    (a) Prior to qualification of the required offering statement, but 
after its filing, a written offer of securities may be made if it meets 
the following requirements:
    (1) The outside front cover page of the material bears the caption 
``Preliminary Offering Circular,'' the date of issuance, and the 
following statement, which shall run along the left hand margin of the 
page and be printed perpendicular to the text, in boldfaced type at 
least as large as that used generally in the body of such offering 
circular:

An offering statement pursuant to Regulation A relating to these 
securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Information contained in this Preliminary Offering Circular is 
subject to completion or amendment. These securities may not be sold nor 
may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time an offering circular 
which is not designated as a Preliminary Offering Circular is delivered 
and the offering statement filed with the Commission becomes qualified. 
This Preliminary Offering Circular shall not constitute an offer to sell 
or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sales of 
these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale 
would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
of any such state.

    (2) The Preliminary Offering Circular contains substantially the 
information required in an offering circular by Form 1-A (Sec. 239.90 of 
this chapter), except that information with respect to offering price, 
underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or commissions to 
dealers, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, or other 
matters dependent upon the offering price may be omitted. The outside 
front cover page of the Preliminary Offering Circular shall include a 
bona fide estimate of the range of the maximum offering price and 
maximum number of shares or other units of securities to be offered or a 
bona fide estimate of the principal amount of debt securities to be 
offered.
    (3) The material is filed as a part of the offering statement.
    (b) If a Preliminary Offering Circular is inaccurate or inadequate 
in any material respect, a revised Preliminary Offering Circular or a 
complete Offering Circular shall be furnished to all persons to whom 
securities are to be sold at least 48 hours prior to the mailing of any 
confirmation of sale to such persons, or shall be sent to such persons 
under such circumstances that it would normally be received by them 48 
hours prior to receipt of confirmation of the sale.

Sec. 230.256  Filing of sales material.

    While not a condition to an exemption pursuant to this provision, 
seven copies of any advertisement or written communication, or the 
script of any radio or television broadcast, shall be filed with the 
main office of the Commission in Washington, DC.
    Note: Only sales material that contains substantive changes from or 
additions from previously filed material needs to be filed.

Sec. 230.257  Reports of sales and use of proceeds.

    While not a condition to an exemption pursuant to this provision, 
the issuer and/or each selling security holder shall file seven copies 
of a report concerning sales and use of proceeds on Form 2-A 
(Sec. 239.91 of this chapter), or other prescribed form with the main 
office of the Commission in Washington, DC. This report shall be filed 
at the following times:
    (a) Every six months after the qualification of the offering 
statement or any amendment until substantially all the proceeds have 
been applied; and
    (b) within 30 calendar days after the termination, completion or 
final sale

[[Page 484]]

of securities in the offering, or the application of the proceeds from 
the offering, whichever is the latest event. This report should be 
labelled the final report. For purposes of this section, the temporary 
investment of proceeds pending final application shall not constitute 
application of the proceeds.

<R05>
Sec. 230.258  Suspension of the exemption.

    (a) The Commission may at any time enter an order temporarily 
suspending a Regulation A exemption if it has reason to believe that:
    (1) No exemption is available or any of the terms, conditions or 
requirements of the Regulation have not been complied with, including 
failures to provide the Commission a copy of the document or broadcast 
script under Sec. 230.254, to file any sales material as required by 
Sec. 230.256 or report as required by Sec. 230.257;
    (2) The offering statement, any sales or solicitation of interest 
material contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to 
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in 
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
    (3) The offering is being made or would be made in violation of 
section 17 of the Securities Act;
    (4) An event has occurred after the filing of the offering statement 
which would have rendered the exemption hereunder unavailable if it had 
occurred prior to such filing;
    (5) Any person specified in paragraph (a) of Sec. 230.262 has been 
indicted for any crime or offense of the character specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of 230.262, or any proceeding has been initiated for 
the purpose of enjoining any such person from engaging in or continuing 
any conduct or practice of the character specified in paragraph (a)(4) 
of Sec. 230.262;
    (6) Any person specified in paragraph (b) of Sec. 230.262 has been 
indicted for any crime or offense of the character specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 230.262, or any proceeding has been initiated 
for the purpose of enjoining any such person from engaging in or 
continuing any conduct or practice of the character specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 230.262; or
    (7) The issuer or any promoter, officer, director or underwriter has 
failed to cooperate, or has obstructed or refused to permit the making 
of an investigation by the Commission in connection with any offering 
made or proposed to be made in reliance on Regulation A.
    (b) Upon the entry of an order under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Commission will promptly give notice to the issuer, any underwriter 
and any selling security holder:
    (1) That such order has been entered, together with a brief 
statement of the reasons for the entry of the order; and
    (2) That the Commission, upon receipt of a written request within 30 
calendar days after the entry of the order, will within 20 calendar days 
after receiving the request, order a hearing at a place to be designated 
by the Commission.
    (c) If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the 
Commission, an order entered under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
become permanent on the 30th calendar day after its entry and shall 
remain in effect unless or until it is modified or vacated by the 
Commission. Where a hearing is requested or is ordered by the 
Commission, the Commission will, after notice of and opportunity for 
such hearing, either vacate the order or enter an order permanently 
suspending the exemption.
    (d) The Commission may, at any time after notice of and opportunity 
for hearing, enter an order permanently suspending the exemption for any 
reason upon which it could have entered a temporary suspension order 
under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such order shall remain in 
effect until vacated by the Commission.
    (e) All notices required by this section shall be given by personal 
service, registered or certified mail to the addresses given by the 
issuer, any underwriter and any selling security holder in the offering 
statement.


<R05>
Sec. 230.259  Withdrawal or abandonment of offering statements.

    (a) If none of the securities which are the subject of an offering 
statement

[[Page 485]]

have been sold and such offering statement is not the subject of a 
proceeding under Sec. 230.258, the offering statement may be withdrawn 
with the Commission's consent. The application for withdrawal shall 
state the reason the offering statement is to be withdrawn, shall be 
signed by an authorized representative of the issuer and shall be 
provided to the main office of the Commission in Washington, DC.
    (b) When an offering statement has been on file with the Commission 
for nine months without amendment and has not become qualified, the 
Commission may, in its discretion, proceed in the following manner to 
determine whether such offering statement has been abandoned by the 
issuer. If the offering statement has been amended, the 9-month period 
shall be computed from the date of the latest amendment.
    (1) Notice will be sent to the issuer, and to any counsel for the 
issuer named in the offering statement, by registered or certified mail, 
return receipt requested, addressed to the most recent addresses for the 
issuer and issuer's counsel as reflected in the offering statement. Such 
notice will inform the issuer and issuer's counsel that the offering 
statement or amendments thereto is out of date and must be either 
amended to comply with applicable requirements of Regulation A or be 
withdrawn within 30 calendar days after the notice.
    (2) If the issuer or issuer's counsel fail to respond to such notice 
by filing a substantive amendment or withdrawing the offering statement 
or does not furnish a satisfactory explanation as to why the issuer has 
not done so within 30 calendar days, the Commission may declare the 
offering statement abandoned.

Sec. 230.260  Insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation A.

    (a) A failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement of 
Regulation A will not result in the loss of the exemption from the 
requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act for any offer or sale to 
a particular individual or entity, if the person relying on the 
exemption establishes:
    (1) The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or 
requirement directly intended to protect that particular individual or 
entity;
    (2) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the 
offering as a whole, provided that any failure to comply with paragraphs 
(a), (b), (d) (1) and (3) Of Sec. 230.251 shall be deemed to be 
significant to the offering as a whole; and
    (3) A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all 
applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Regulation A.
    (b) A transaction made in reliance upon Regulation A shall comply 
with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of the 
regulation. Where an exemption is established only through reliance upon 
paragraph (a) of this section, the failure to comply shall nonetheless 
be actionable by the Commission under section 20 of the Act.
    (c) This provision provides no relief or protection from a 
proceeding under Sec. 230.258.

Sec. 230.261  Definitions.

    As used in this Regulation A, all terms have the same meanings as in 
Sec. 230.405, except that all references to ``registrant'' in those

in a qualified offering statement;
    (b) Preliminary Offering Circular--The offering circular described

offer or sale of securities, if:

this section or, if no such amendment has been filed, the initial 
registration statement and prospectus.
    (d) The form and contents of a prospectus forming part of a 
registration statement which is the subject of a stop order entered

as in effect on the date such stop order ceases to be effective.
    (e) A prospectus filed as part of an amendment to an effective 
registration statement, or other amendment to such registration

photocopying. Debits in credit categories and credits in debit 
categories shall be designated so as to be clearly distinguishable as

Sec. 230.404  Preparation of registration statement.

    (a) A registration statement shall consist of the facing sheet of 
the applicable form; a prospectus containing the information called for 
by Part I of such form; the information, list of exhibits, undertakings 
and signatures required to be set forth in Part II of such form; 
financial statements and schedules; exhibits; any other information or 
documents filed as part of the registration statement; and all documents 
or information incorporated by reference in the foregoing (whether or 
not required to be filed).
    (b) All general instructions, instructions to items of the form, and 
instructions as to financial statements, exhibits, or prospectuses are 
to be omitted from the registration statement in all cases.
    (c) The prospectus shall contain the information called for by all 
of the items of Part I of the applicable form, except that unless 
otherwise specified, no reference need be made to inapplicable items, 
and negative answers to any item in Part I may be omitted. A copy of the 
prospectus may be filed as a part of the registration statement in lieu 
of furnishing the information in item-and-answer form. Wherever a copy 
of the prospectus is filed in lieu of information in item-and-answer 
form, the text of the items of the form is to be omitted from the 
registration statement, as well as from the prospectus, except to the 
extent provided in paragraph (d) of this rule.
    (d) Where any items of a form call for information not required to 
be included in the prospectus, generally Part II of such form, the text 
of such items, including the numbers and captions thereof, together with 
the answers thereto shall be filed with the prospectus under cover of 
the facing sheet of the form as a part of the registration statement. 
However, the text of such items may be omitted provided the answers are 
so prepared as to indicate the coverage of the item without the 
necessity of reference to the text of the item. If any such item is 
inapplicable, or the answer thereto is in the negative, a statement to 
that effect shall be made. Any financial statements not required to be 
included in the prospectus shall also be filed as a part of the 
registration statement proper, unless incorporated by reference pursuant 
to Rule 411 (Sec. 230.411).

the date the combination is initiated); or

percent of such income of the registrant and its subsidiaries 
consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.
    Computational note. For purposes of making the prescribed income 
test the following guidance should be applied:
    1. When a loss has been incurred by either the parent and its 
subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the 
equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded 
from the income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
purposes of the computation.
    2. If income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the 
average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average 
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss 
years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.

small business issuer.
    Provided however, that an entity is not a small business issuer if 
it has a public float (the aggregate market value of the outstanding 
voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates) of 
$25,000,000 or more.
    Note: The public float of a reporting company shall be computed by 
use of the price at which the stock was last sold, or the average of the 
bid and asked prices of such stock, on a date within 60 days prior to 
the end of its most recent fiscal year. The public float of a company 
filing an initial registration statement under the Exchange Act shall be 
determined as of a date within 60 days of the date the registration 
statement is filed.

    In the case of an initial public offering of securities, public 
float shall be computed on the basis of the number of shares outstanding 
prior to the offering and the estimated public offering price of the 
securities.
    Subsidiary. A subsidiary of a specified person is an affiliate 
controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more 
intermediaries. (See also majority owned subsidiary, significant 
subsidiary, totally held subsidiary, and wholly owned subsidiary.)
    Succession. The term succession means the direct acquisition of the 
assets comprising a going business, whether by merger, consolidation, 
purchase, or other direct transfer. The term does not include the 
acquisition of control of a business unless followed by the direct 
acquisition of its assets. The terms succeed and successor have meanings 
correlative to the foregoing.
    Totally held subsidiary. The term totally held subsidiary means a 
subsidiary (1) substantially all of whose outstanding securities are 
owned by its parent and/or the parent's other totally held subsidiaries, 
and (2) which is not indebted to any person other than its parent and/or 
the parent's other totally held subsidiaries in an amount which is 
material in relation to the particular subsidiary, excepting 
indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business which is not 
overdue and which matures within one year from the date of its creation, 
whether evidenced by securities or not.
    Voting securities. The term voting securities means securities the 
holders of which are presently entitled to vote for the election of 
directors.
    Wholly owned subsidiary. The term wholly owned subsidiary means a 
subsidiary substantially all of whose outstanding voting securities are 
owned by its parent and/or the parent's other wholly owned subsidiaries.

Sec. 230.406  Confidential treatment of information filed with the Commission.

    Preliminary Notes: (1) Confidential treatment of supplemental 
information or other information not required to be filed under the Act 
should be requested under 17 CFR 200.83 and not under this rule.
    (2) All confidential treatment requests shall be submitted in paper 
format only, whether or not the filer is an electronic filer. See Rule 
101(c)(1)(i) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.101(c)(1)(i) of this chapter).

    (a) Any person submitting any information in a document required to 
be filed under the Act may make written objection to its public 
disclosure by following the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section, 
which shall be the exclusive means of requesting confidential treatment 
of information included in any document (hereinafter referred to as the 
material filed) required to be filed under the Act, except that if the 
material filed is a registration statement on Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of 
this chapter) or on Form S-3, F-2, F-3 (Sec. 239.13, Sec. 239.32 or 
Sec. 239.33 of this chapter) relating to a dividend or interest 
reinvestment plan, or on Form S-4 (Sec. 239.25 of this chapter) 
complying with General Instruction G of that Form or if the material 
filed is a registration statement that does not contain a delaying 
amendment pursuant to Rule 473 (Sec. 230.473 of this chapter), the 
person shall comply with the procedure in paragraph (b) prior to the 
filing of a registration statement.
    (b) The person shall omit from the material filed the portion 
thereof which it desires to keep undisclosed (hereinafter called the 
confidential portion). In lieu thereof, the person shall indicate at the 
appropriate place in the material filed that the confidential portion 
has been so omitted and filed separately with the Commission. The person 
shall file with the material filed:
    (1) One copy of the confidential portion, marked ``Confidential 
Treatment,'' of the material filed with the Commission. The copy shall 
contain an appropriate identification of the item or other requirement 
involved and, notwithstanding that the confidential portion does not 
constitute the whole of the answer or required disclosure, the entire 
answer or required disclosure, except that in the case where the 
confidential portion is part of a financial statement or schedule, only 
the particular financial statement or schedule need be included. The 
copy of the confidential portion shall be in the same form as the 
remainder of the material filed;
    (2) An application making objection to the disclosure of the 
confidential portion. Such application shall be on a sheet or sheets 
separate from the confidential portion, and shall contain:
    (i) An identification of the portion;
    (ii) A statement of the grounds of the objection referring to and 
analyzing the applicable exemption(s) from disclosure under Sec. 200.80 
of this chapter, the Commission's rule adopted under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), and a justification of the period of 
time for which confidential treatment is sought;
    (iii) A detailed explanation of why, based on the facts and 
circumstances of the particular case, disclosure of the information is 
unnecessary for the protection of investors;
    (iv) A written consent to the furnishing of the confidential portion 
to other government agencies, offices, or bodies and to the Congress; 
and
    (v) The name, address and telephone number of the person to whom all 
notices and orders issued under this rule at any time should be 
directed.
    (3) The copy of the confidential portion and the application filed 
in accordance with this paragraph (b) shall be enclosed in a separate 
envelope marked ``Confidential Treatment'' and addressed to The 
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.

[[Page 496]]

    (c) Pending a determination as to the objection, the material for 
which confidential treatment has been applied will not be made available 
to the public.
    (d) If it is determined by the Division, acting pursuant to 
delegated authority, that the application should be granted, an order to 
that effect will be entered, and a notation to that effect will be made 
at the appropriate place in the material filed. Such a determination 
will not preclude reconsideration whenever appropriate, such as upon 
receipt of any subsequent request under the Freedom of Information Act 
and, if appropriate, revocation of the confidential status of all or a 
portion of the information in question.
    (e) If the Commission denies the application, or the Division, 
acting pursuant to delegated authority, denies the application and 
Commission review is not sought pursuant to Sec. 201.431 of this 
chapter, confirmed telegraphic notice of the order of denial will be 
sent to the person named in the application pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section. In such case, if the material filed may be 
withdrawn pursuant to an applicable statute, rule, or regulation, the 
registrant shall have the right to withdraw the material filed in 
accordance with the terms of the applicable statute, rule, or 
regulation, but without the necessity of stating any grounds for the 
withdrawal or of obtaining the further assent of the Commission. In the 
event of such withdrawal, the confidential portion will be returned to 
the registrant. If the material filed may not be so withdrawn, the 
confidential portion will be made available for public inspection in the 
same manner as if confidential treatment had been revoked under 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (f) If a right of withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section is not exercised, the confidential portion will be made 
available for public inspection as part of the material filed, and the 
registrant shall amend the material filed to include all information 
required to be set forth in regard to such confidential portion.
    (g) In any case where a prior grant of confidential treatment has 
been revoked, the person named in the application pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section will be so informed by registered or certified 
mail. Pursuant to Sec. 201.431 of this chapter, persons making objection 
to disclosure may petition the Commission for review of a determination 
by the Division revoking confidential treatment.
    (h) Upon revocation of confidential treatment, the confidential 
portion shall be made available to the public at the time and according 
to the conditions specified in paragraphs (h) (1)-(2):
    (1) Upon the lapse of five days after the dispatch of notice by 
registered or certified mail of a determination disallowing an 
objection, if prior to the lapse of such five days the person shall not 
have communicated to the Secretary of the Commission his intention to 
seek review by the Commission under Sec. 201.431 of this chapter of the 
determination made by the Division; or
    (2) If such a petition for review shall have been filed under 
Sec. 201.431 of this chapter, upon final disposition adverse to the 
petitioner.
    (i) If the confidential portion is made available to the public, one 
copy thereof shall be attached to each copy of the material filed with 
the Commission.

    Information required need be given only insofar as it is known or 
reasonably available to the registrant. If any required information is 
unknown and not reasonably available to the registrant, either because

conditions:

Sec. 230.411  Incorporation by reference.

    (a) Prospectus. Except as provided by this section or unless 
otherwise provided in the appropriate form, information shall not be 
incorporated by reference in a prospectus. Where a summary or outline of 
the provisions of any document is required in the prospectus, the 
summary or outline may incorporate by reference particular items, 
sections or paragraphs of any exhibit and may be qualified in its 
entirety by such reference.
    (b) Information not required in a prospectus. Except for exhibits 
covered by paragraph (c) of this section, information may be 
incorporated by reference in answer, or partial answer, to any item that 
calls for information not required to be included in a prospectus 
subject to the following provisions:
    (1) Non-financial information may be incorporated by reference to 
any document;
    (2) Financial information may be incorporated by reference to any 
document, provided any financial statement so incorporated meets the 
requirements of the forms on which the statement is filed. Financial 
statements or other financial data required to be given in comparative 
form for two or more fiscal years or periods shall not be incorporated 
by reference unless the information incorporated by reference includes 
the entire period for which the comparative data is given;
    (3) Information contained in any part of the registration statement, 
including the prospectus, may be incorporated by reference in answer, or 
partial answer, to any item that calls for information not required to 
be included in the prospectus; and
    (4) Unless the information is incorporated by reference to a 
document which complies with the time limitations of Sec. 228.10(f) and 
Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter, then the document, or part thereof, 
containing the incorporated information is required to be filed as an 
exhibit.
    (c) Exhibits. Any document or part thereof filed with the Commission 
pursuant to any Act administered by the Commission may, subject to the 
limitations of Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.11(d) of this chapter, be 
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to any registration statement. 
If any modification has occurred in the text of any document 
incorporated by reference since the filing thereof, the registrant shall 
file with the reference a statement containing the text of such 
modification and the date thereof.
    (d) General. Any incorporation by reference of information pursuant 
to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 24 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice restricting incorporation by reference of 
documents which incorporate by reference other information. Information 
incorporated by reference shall be clearly identified in the reference 
by page, paragraph, caption or otherwise. If the information is 
incorporated by reference to a previously filed document, the file 
number of such document shall be included. Where only certain pages of a 
document are incorporated by reference and filed with the statement, the 
document from which the information is taken shall be clearly identified 
in the reference. An express statement that the

[[Page 498]]

specified matter is incorporated by reference shall be made at the 
particular place in the registration statement where the information is 
required. Information shall not be incorporated by reference in any case 
where such incorporation would render the statement incomplete, unclear 
or confusing.

Sec. 230.412  Modified or superseded documents.

    (a) Any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to 
be incorporated by reference shall be deemed to be modified or 
superseded for purposes of the registration statement or the prospectus 
to the extent that a statement contained in the prospectus or in any 
other subsequently filed document which also is or is deemed to be

    (b) The modifying or superseding statement may, but need not, state 
that it has modified or superseded a prior statement or include any 
other information set forth in the document which is not so modified or 
superseded. The making of a modifying or superseding statement shall not 
be deemed an admission that the modified or superseded statement, when 
made, constituted an untrue statement of a material fact, an omission to 
state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading, or 
the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device, 
contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business or 
artifice to defraud, as those terms are used in the Act, the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the rules and regulations 
thereunder.
    (c) Any statement so modified shall not be deemed in its unmodified

Sec. 230.414  Registration by certain successor issuers.

    If any issuer, except a foreign issuer exempted by Rule 3a12-3 (17 
CFR 240.3a12-3), incorporated under the laws of any State or foreign 
government and having securities registered under the Act has been 
succeeded by an issuer incorporated under the laws of another State or 
foreign government for the purpose of changing the State or country of 
incorporation of the enterprises, or if any issuer has been succeeded by 
an issuer for the purpose of changing its form of organization, the 
registration statement of the predecessor issuer shall be deemed the 
registration statement of the successor issuer for the purpose of 
continuing the offering provided:
    (a) Immediately prior to the succession the successor issuer had no 
assets or liabilities other than nominal assets or liabilities;
    (b) The succession was effected by a merger or similar succession 
pursuant to statutory provisions or the terms of the organic instruments 
under which the successor issuer acquired all of the assets and assumed 
all of the liabilities and obligations of the predecessor issuer;
    (c) The succession was approved by security holders of the 
predecessor issuer at a meeting for which proxies were solicited 
pursuant to section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or 
section 20(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or information was 
furnished to security holders pursuant to section 14(c) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and
    (d) The successor issuer has filed an amendment to the registration 
statement of the predecessor issuer expressly adopting such statements 
as its own registration statement for all purposes of the Act and the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and setting forth any additional 
information necessary to reflect any material changes made in connection 
with or resulting from the succession, or necessary to keep the 
registration statement from being misleading in any material respect, 
and such amendment has become effective.

    (3) The registrant furnishes the undertakings required by Item 
512(a) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512 of this chapter).

          employee benefit plans.

    (a) If a registration statement purports to register securities to 
be offered pursuant to terms which provide for a change in the amount of 
securities being offered or issued to prevent dilution resulting from 
stock splits, stock dividends, or similar transactions, such 
registration statement shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, be 
deemed to cover the additional securities to be offered or issued in 
connection with any such provision.
    (b) If prior to completion of the distribution of the securities 
covered by a registration statement, additional securities of the same 
class are issued or issuable as a result of a stock split or stock 
dividend, the registration statement shall, unless otherwise expressly 
provided therein, be deemed to cover such additional securities 
resulting from the split of, or the stock dividend on, the registered 
securities. If prior to completion of the distribution of the securities 
covered by a registration statement, all the securities of a class which 
includes the registered securities are combined by a reverse split into 
a lesser amount of securities of the same class, the amount of 
undistributed securities of such class deemed to be covered by the 
registration statement shall be proportionately reduced. If paragraph

relating to an offering by a blank check company.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``blank check company''

plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in 
a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or

    (ii) Is issuing ``penny stock,'' as defined in Rule 3a51-1 (17 CFR 
240.3a51-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange 
Act'').
    (3) For purposes of this section, the term ``purchaser'' shall mean 
any person acquiring securities directly or indirectly in the offering, 
for cash or otherwise, including promoters or others receiving 
securities as compensation in connection with the offering.
    (b) Deposit of securities and proceeds in escrow or trust account--
(1) General. (i) Except as otherwise provided in this section or 
prohibited by other applicable law, all securities issued in connection 
with an offering by a blank check company and the gross proceeds from 
the offering shall be deposited promptly into:
    (A) An escrow account maintained by an ``insured depository 
institution,'' as that term is defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(C)(2)); or
    (B) A separate bank account established by a broker or dealer 
registered under the Exchange Act maintaining net capital equal to or 
exceeding $25,000 (as calculated pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 
(17 CFR 240.15c3-1), in which the broker or dealer acts as trustee for 
persons having the beneficial interests in the account.
    (ii) If funds and securities are deposited into an escrow account 
maintained

[[Page 503]]

by an insured depository institution, the deposit account records of the 
insured depository institution must provide that funds in the escrow 
account are held for the benefit of the purchasers named and identified 
in accordance with 12 CFR 330.1 of the regulations of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the records of the escrow agent, 
maintained in good faith and in the regular course of business, must 
show the name and interest of each party to the account. If funds and 
securities are deposited in a separate bank account established by a 
broker or dealer acting as a trustee, the books and records of the 
broker-dealer must indicate the name, address, and interest of each 
person for whom the account is held.
    (2) Deposit and investment of proceeds. (i) All offering proceeds, 
after deduction of cash paid for underwriting commissions, underwriting 
expenses and dealer allowances, and amounts permitted to be released to 
the registrant pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, shall

however, that no deduction may be made for underwriting commissions, 
underwriting expenses or dealer allowances payable to an affiliate of 
the registrant.
    (ii) Deposited proceeds shall be in the form of checks, drafts, or 
money orders payable to the order of the escrow agent or trustee.
    (iii) Deposited proceeds and interest or dividends thereon, if any, 
shall be held for the sole benefit of the purchasers of the securities.
    (iv) Deposited proceeds shall be invested in one of the following:
    (A) An obligation that constitutes a ``deposit,'' as that term is 
defined in section 3(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.

    (B) Securities of any open-end investment company registered under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) that holds 
itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of paragraphs 
(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of 17 CFR 270.2a-7 (Rule 2a-7) under the 
Investment Company Act; or
    (C) Securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations 
guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States.
    Note to Sec. 230.419(b)(2)(iv): Issuers are cautioned that 
investments in government securities are inappropriate unless such 
securities can be readily sold or otherwise disposed of for cash at the 
time required without any dissipation of offering proceeds invested.

    (v) Interest or dividends earned on the funds, if any, shall be held 
in the escrow or trust account until the funds are released in 
accordance with the provisions of this section. If funds held in the 
escrow or trust account are released to a purchaser of the securities, 
the purchasers shall receive interest or dividends earned, if any, on 
such funds up to the date of release. If funds held in the escrow or 
trust account are released to the registrant, interest or dividends 
earned on such funds up to the date of release may be released to the 
registrant.
    (vi) The registrant may receive up to 10 percent of the proceeds 
remaining after payment of underwriting commissions, underwriting 
expenses and dealer allowances permitted by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section, exclusive of interest or dividends, as those proceeds are 
deposited into the escrow or trust account.
    (3) Deposit of securities. (i) All securities issued in connection 
with the offering, whether or not for cash consideration, and any other 
securities issued with respect to such securities, including securities 
issued with respect to stock splits, stock dividends, or similar rights, 
shall be deposited directly into the escrow or trust account promptly 
upon issuance. The identity of the purchaser of the securities shall be 
included on the stock certificates or other documents evidencing such 
securities. See also 17 CFR 240.15g-8 regarding restrictions on sales 
of, or offers to sell, securities deposited in the escrow or trust 
account.
    (ii) Securities held in the escrow or trust account are to remain as 
issued and deposited and shall be held for the sole benefit of the 
purchasers, who shall have voting rights, if any, with respect to 
securities held in their names, as provided by applicable state law. No 
transfer or other disposition of securities held in the escrow or trust 
account or any interest related to such

[[Page 504]]

securities shall be permitted other than by will or the laws of descent 
and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as 
defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et 
seq.), or Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 
U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or the rules thereunder.
    (iii) Warrants, convertible securities or other derivative 
securities relating to securities held in the escrow or trust account 
may be exercised or converted in accordance with their terms; provided, 
however, that securities received upon exercise or conversion, together 
with any cash or other consideration paid in connection with the 
exercise or conversion, are promptly deposited into the escrow or trust 
account.
    (4) Escrow or trust agreement. A copy of the executed escrow or 
trust agreement shall be filed as an exhibit to the registration 
statement and shall contain the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), 
and (e)(3) of this section.
    (5) Request for supplemental information. Upon request by the 
Commission or the staff, the registrant shall furnish as supplemental 
information the names and addresses of persons for whom securities are 
held in the escrow or trust account.
    Note to Sec. 230.419(b): With respect to a blank check offering 
subject to both Rule 419 and Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 (17 CFR 240.15c2-
4, the requirements of Rule 15c2-4 are applicable only until the 
conditions of the offering governed by that Rule are met (e.g., reaching 
the minimum in a ``part-or-none'' offering). When those conditions are 
satisfied, Rule 419 continues to govern the use of offering proceeds.

    (c) Disclosure of offering terms. The initial registration statement 
shall disclose the specific terms of the offering, including, but not 
limited to:
    (1) The terms and provisions of the escrow or trust agreement and 
the effect thereof upon the registrant's right to receive funds and the 
effect of the escrow or trust agreement upon the purchaser's funds and 
securities required to be deposited into the escrow or trust account, 
including, if applicable, any material risk of non-insurance of 
purchasers' funds resulting from deposits in excess of the insured 
amounts; and
    (2) The obligation of the registrant to provide, and the right of 
the purchaser to receive, information regarding an acquisition, 
including the requirement that pursuant to this section, purchasers 
confirm in writing their investment in the registrant's securities as 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Probable acquisition post-effective amendment requirement. If, 
during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a significant 
acquisition becomes probable, the registrant shall file promptly a post-
effective amendment disclosing the information specified by the 
applicable registration statement form and Industry Guides, including 
financial statements of the registrant and the company to be acquired as 
well as pro forma financial information required by the form and 
applicable rules and regulations. Where warrants, rights or other 
derivative securities issued in the initial offering are exercisable, 
there is a continuous offering of the underlying security.
    (e) Release of deposited and funds securities--(1) Post-effective 
amendment for acquisition agreement. Upon execution of an agreement(s) 
for the acquisition(s) of a business(es) or assets that will constitute 
the business (or a line of business) of the registrant and for which the 
fair value of the business(es) or net assets to be acquired represents 
at least 80 percent of the maximum offering proceeds, including proceeds 
received or to be received upon the exercise or conversion of any 
securities offered, but excluding amounts payable to non-affiliates for 
underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses, and dealer allowances, 
the registrant shall file a post-effective amendment that:
    (i) Discloses the information specified by the applicable 
registration statement form and Industry Guides, including financial 
statements of the registrant and the company acquired or to be acquired 
and pro forma financial information required by the form and applicable 
rules and regulations;
    (ii) Discloses the results of the initial offering, including but 
not limited to:
    (A) The gross offering proceeds received to date, specifying the 
amounts

[[Page 505]]

paid for underwriter commissions, underwriting expenses and dealer 
allowances, amounts disbursed to the registrant, and amounts remaining 
in the escrow or trust account; and
    (B) The specific amount, use and application of funds disbursed to 
the registrant to date, including, but not limited to, the amounts paid 
to officers, directors, promoters, controlling shareholders or 
affiliates, either directly or indirectly, specifying the amounts and 
purposes of such payments; and
    (iii) Discloses the terms of the offering as described pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) Terms of the offering. The terms of the offering must provide, 
and the registrant must satisfy, the following conditions.
    (i) Within five business days after the effective date of the post-
effective amendment(s), the registrant shall send by first class mail or 
other equally prompt means, to each purchaser of securities held in 
escrow or trust, a copy of the prospectus contained in the post-
effective amendment and any amendment or supplement thereto;
    (ii) Each purchaser shall have no fewer than 20 business days and no 
more than 45 business days from the effective date of the post-effective 
amendment to notify the registrant in writing that the purchaser elects 
to remain an investor. If the registrant has not received such written 
notification by the 45th business day following the effective date of 
the post-effective amendment, funds and interest or dividends, if any, 
held in the escrow or trust account shall be sent by first class mail or 
other equally prompt means to the purchaser within five business days;
    (iii) The acquisition(s) meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section will be consummated if a sufficient number of 
purchasers confirm their investments; and
    (iv) If a consummated acquisition(s) meeting the requirements of 
this section has not occurred by a date 18 months after the effective 
date of the initial registration statement, funds held in the escrow or 
trust account shall be returned by first class mail or equally prompt 
means to the purchaser within five business days following that date.
    (3) Conditions for release of deposited securities and funds. Funds 
held in the escrow or trust account may be released to the registrant 
and securities may be delivered to the purchaser or other registered 
holder identified on the deposited securities only at the same time as 
or after:
    (i) The escrow agent or trustee has received a signed representation 
from the registrant, together with other evidence acceptable to the 
escrow agent or trustee, that the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and 
(e)(2) of this section have been met; and
    (ii) Consummation of an acquisition(s) meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (4) Prospectus supplement. If funds and securities are released from 
the escrow or trust account to the registrant pursuant to this 
paragraph, the prospectus shall be supplemented to indicate the amount 
of funds and securities released and the date of release.
    Notes to Sec. 230.419(e): 1. With respect to a blank check offering 
subject to both Rule 419 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 (17 CFR 240.10b-9), 
the requirements of Rule 10b-9 are applicable only until the conditions 
of the offering governed by that Rule are met (e.g., reaching the 
minimum in a ``part-or-none'' offering). When those conditions are 
satisfied, Rule 419 continues to govern the use of offering proceeds.
    2. If the business(es) or assets are acquired for cash, the fair 
value shall be presumed to be equal to the cash paid. If all or part of 
the consideration paid consists of securities or other non-cash 
consideration, the fair value shall be determined by an accepted 
standard, such as bona fide sales of the assets or similar assets made 
within a reasonable time, forecasts of expected cash flows, independent 
appraisals, etc. Such valuation must be reasonable at the time made.

    (f) Financial statements. The registrant shall:
    (1) Furnish to security holders audited financial statements for the 
first full fiscal year of operations following consummation of an 
acquisition pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, together with the 
information required by Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 
229.303(a)), no later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal year; 
and

[[Page 506]]

    (2) File the financial statements and additional information with 
the Commission under cover of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308); provided, 
however, that such financial statements and related information need not 
be filed separately if the registrant is filing reports pursuant to 
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Sec. 230.420  Legibility of prospectus.

    (a) The body of all printed prospectuses and all notes to financial 
statements and other tabular data included therein shall be in roman 
type at least as large and as legible as 10-point modern type. However, 
(a) to the extent necessary for convenient presentation, financial

point modern type. All such type shall be leaded at least 2 points.
    (b) Where a prospectus is distributed through an electronic medium, 
issuers may satisfy legibility requirements applicable to printed 
documents, such as paper size, type size and font, bold-face type, 
italics and red ink, by presenting all required information in a format 
readily communicated to investors, and where indicated, in a manner 
reasonably calculated to draw investor attention to specific 
information.

<R05>
Sec. 230.421  Presentation of information in prospectuses.

    (a) The information required in a prospectus need not follow the 
order of the items or other requirements in the form. Such information 
shall not, however, be set forth in such fashion as to obscure any of 
the required information or any information necessary to keep the 
required information from being incomplete or misleading. Where an item 
requires information to be given in a prospectus in tabular form it 
shall be given in substantially the tabular form specified in the item.
    (b) You must present the information in a prospectus in a clear, 
concise and understandable manner. You must prepare the prospectus using 
the following standards:
    (1) Present information in clear, concise sections, paragraphs, and 
sentences. Whenever possible, use short, explanatory sentences and 
bullet lists;
    (2) Use descriptive headings and subheadings;
    (3) Avoid frequent reliance on glossaries or defined terms as the 
primary means of explaining information in the prospectus. Define terms 
in a glossary or other section of the document only if the meaning is 
unclear from the context. Use a glossary only if it facilitates 
understanding of the disclosure; and
    (4) Avoid legal and highly technical business terminology.
    Note to Sec. 230.421(b): In drafting the disclosure to comply with 
this section, you should avoid the following:
    1. Legalistic or overly complex presentations that make the 
substance of the disclosure difficult to understand;
    2. Vague ``boilerplate'' explanations that are imprecise and readily 
subject to different interpretations;
    3. Complex information copied directly from legal documents without 
any clear and concise explanation of the provision(s); and
    4. Disclosure repeated in different sections of the document that 
increases the size of the document but does not enhance the quality of 
the information.

    (c) All information required to be included in a prospectus shall be 
clearly understandable without the necessity of referring to the 
particular form or to the general rules and regulations. Except as to 
financial statements and information required in a tabular form, the 
information set forth in a prospectus may be expressed in condensed or 
summarized form. In lieu of repeating information in the form of notes 
to financial statements, references may be made to other parts of the 
prospectus where such information is set forth.
    (d)(1) To enhance the readability of the prospectus, you must use 
plain English principles in the organization, language, and design of 
the front and back cover pages, the summary, and the risk factors 
section.
    (2) You must draft the language in these sections so that at a 
minimum it

[[Page 507]]

substantially complies with each of the following plain English writing 
principles:
    (i) Short sentences;
    (ii) Definite, concrete, everyday words;
    (iii) Active voice;
    (iv) Tabular presentation or bullet lists for complex material, 
whenever possible;
    (v) No legal jargon or highly technical business terms; and
    (vi) No multiple negatives.
    (3) In designing these sections or other sections of the prospectus, 
you may include pictures, logos, charts, graphs, or other design 
elements so long as the design is not misleading and the required 
information is clear. You are encouraged to use tables, schedules, 
charts and graphic illustrations of the results of operations, balance 
sheet, or other financial data that present the data in an 
understandable manner. Any presentation must be consistent with the 
financial statements and non-financial information in the prospectus. 
You must draw the graphs and charts to scale. Any information you 
provide must not be misleading.

Instruction to Sec. 230.421: You should read Securities Act Release No. 
33-7497 (January 28, 1998) for information on plain English principles.

Sec. 230.428  Documents constituting a section 10(a) prospectus for Form S-8 registration statement; requirements relating to offerings of securities registered 
          on Form S-8.

    (a)(1) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to a registration 
statement on Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of this chapter), the following, 
taken together, shall constitute a prospectus that meets the 
requirements of section 10(a) of the Act:
    (i) The document(s), or portions thereof as permitted by paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, containing the employee benefit plan 
information required by Item 1 of the Form;
    (ii) The statement of availability of registrant information, 
employee benefit plan annual reports and other information required by 
Item 2; and
    (iii) The documents containing registrant information and employee 
benefit plan annual reports that are incorporated by reference in the 
registration statement pursuant to Item 3.
    (2) The registrant shall maintain a file of the documents that, 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, at any time are part of the 
section 10(a) prospectus, except for documents required to be 
incorporated by reference in the registration statement pursuant to Item 
3 of Form S-8. Each such document shall be included in the file until 
five years after it is last used as part of the Section 10(a) prospectus 
to offer or sell securities pursuant to the plan. With respect to 
documents containing specifically designated portions that constitute 
part of the section 10(a) prospectus pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the entire document shall be maintained in the file. Upon 
request, the registrant shall furnish to the Commission or its staff a 
copy of any or all of the documents included in the file.
    (b) Where securities are offered pursuant to a registration 
statement on Form S-8:
    (1)(i) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered, to 
each employee who is eligible to participate (or selected by the 
registrant to participate, in the case of a stock option or other plan 
with selective participation) in an employee benefit plan to which the 
registration statement relates, the information required by Part I of 
Form S-8. The information shall be in written form and shall be updated 
in writing in a timely manner to reflect any material changes during any 
period in which offers or sales are being made. When updating 
information is furnished, documents previously furnished need not be re-
delivered, but the registrant shall furnish promptly without charge to 
each employee, upon written or oral request, a copy of all documents 
containing the plan information required by Part I that then constitute 
part of the section 10(a) prospectus.
    (ii) The registrant may designate an entire document or only 
portions of a document as constituting part of the section 10(a) 
prospectus. If the registrant designates only portions of a document as 
constituting part of the prospectus, rather than the entire document, a 
statement clearly identifying such portions, for example, by reference 
to section headings, section numbers, paragraphs or page numbers within 
the document must be included in a conspicuous place in the forepart of 
the document, or such portions must be specifically designated 
throughout the text of the document. Registrants shall not designate 
only words or sentences within a paragraph as part of a prospectus. 
Unless the portions of a document constituting part of the section 10(a) 
prospectus are clearly identified, the entire document shall constitute 
part of the prospectus.
    (iii) The registrant shall date any document constituting part of 
the section 10(a) prospectus or containing portions constituting part of 
the prospectus and shall include the following printed, stamped or typed 
legend in a conspicuous place in the forepart of the document, 
substituting the bracketed language as appropriate: ``This document 
[Specifically designated portions of this document] constitutes 
[constitute] part of a prospectus covering securities that have been 
registered under the Securities Act of 1933.''
    (iv) The registrant shall revise the document(s) containing the plan 
information sent or given to newly eligible participants pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if documents containing updating 
information would

[[Page 511]]

obscure the readability of the plan information.
    (2) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered with the 
document(s) containing the information required by Part I of Form S-8, 
to each employee to whom such information is sent or given, a copy of 
any one of the following:
    (i) The registrant's annual report to security holders containing 
the information required by Rule 14a-3(b) (Sec. 240.14a-3(b) of this 
chapter) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) for 
its latest fiscal year;
    (ii) The registrant's annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB 
(Sec. 249.310 of this chapter), U5S (Sec. 259.5s of this chapter), 20-F 
(Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) or, in the case of registrants described 
in General Instruction A.(2) of Form 40-F, 40-F (Sec. 249.240f of this 
chapter) for its latest fiscal year;
    (iii) The latest prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) 
(Sec. 230.424(b) of this chapter) under the Act that contains audited 
financial statements for the registrant's latest fiscal year, Provided 
that the financial statements are not incorporated by reference from 
another filing, and Provided further that such prospectus contains 
substantially the information required by Rule 14a-3(b) or the 
registration statement was on Form SB-2 (Sec. 239.28 of this chapter) or 
F-1 (Sec. 239.31 of this chapter); or
    (iv) The registrant's effective Exchange Act registration statement 
on Form 10 and Form 10-SB (Sec. 249.210 of this chapter), 20-F or, in 
the case of registrants described in General Instruction A.(2) of Form 
40-F, 40-F containing audited financial statements for the registrant's 
latest fiscal year.

Instructions. 1. If a registrant has previously sent or given an 
employee a copy of any document specified in clauses (i)-(iv) of 
paragraph (b)(2) for the latest fiscal year, it need not be re-
delivered, but the registrant shall furnish promptly, without charge, a 
copy of such document upon written or oral request of the employee.
    2. If the latest fiscal year of the registrant has ended within 120 
days (or 190 days with respect to foreign private issuers) prior to the 
delivery of the documents containing the information specified by Part I 
of Form S-8, the registrant may deliver a document containing financial 
statements for the fiscal year preceding the last fiscal year, Provided 
that within the 120 or 190 day period a document containing financial 
statements for the latest fiscal year is furnished to each employee.

    (3) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered promptly, 
without charge, to each employee to whom information is required to be 
delivered, upon written or oral request, a copy of the information that 
has been incorporated by reference pursuant to Item 3 of Form S-8 (not 
including exhibits to the information that is incorporated by reference 
unless such exhibits are specifically incorporated by reference into the 
information that the registration statement incorporates).
    (4) Where interests in a plan are registered, the registrant shall 
deliver or cause to be delivered promptly, without charge, to each 
employee to whom information is required to be delivered, upon written 
or oral request, a copy of the then latest annual report of the plan 
filed pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, whether on Form 11-
K (Sec. 249.311 of this chapter) or included as part of the registrant's 
annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB.
    (5) The registrant shall deliver or cause to be delivered to all 
employees participating in a stock option plan or plan fund that invests 
in registrant securities (and other plan participants who request such 
information orally or in writing) who do not otherwise receive such 
material, copies of all reports, proxy statements and other 
communications distributed to its security holders generally, provided 
that such material is sent or delivered no later than the time it is 
sent to security holders.
    (c) As used in this Rule, the term employee benefit plan is defined 
in Rule 405 of Regulation C (Sec. 230.405 of this chapter) and the term 
employee is defined in General Instruction A.1 of Form S-8.

same registrant, a prospectus which meets the requirements of the act 
and the rules and regulations thereunder for use in connection with the

Sec. 230.430A  Prospectus in a registration statement at the time of effectiveness.

    (a) The form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement 
that is declared effective may omit information with respect to the 
public offering price, underwriting syndicate (including any material 
relationships between the registrant and underwriters not named 
therein), underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or 
commissions to dealers, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call 
prices and other items dependent upon the offering price, delivery 
dates, and terms of the securities dependent upon the offering date; and 
such form of prospectus need not contain such information in order for 
the registration statement to meet the requirements of Section 7 of the 
Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77g) for the purposes of Section 5 thereof (15 
U.S.C. 77e), Provided, That:
    (1) The securities to be registered are offered for cash;
    (2) The registrant furnishes the undertakings required by Item 
512(i) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512(i) of this chapter); and
    (3) The information ommitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) from the 
form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement that is 
declared effective is contained in a form of prospectus filed with the 
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 497(h) under the Securities 
Act (Secs. 230.424(b) or 230.497(h) of this chapter); except that if 
such form of prospectus is not so filed by the later of fifteen business 
days after the effective date of the registration statement or fifteen 
business days after the effectiveness of a post-effective amendment 
thereto that contains a form of prospectus, or transmitted by a means 
reasonably calculated to result in filing with the Commission by that 
date, the information omitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) must be 
contained in an effective post-effective amendment to the registration 
statement.

Instruction to Paragraph (a): A decrease in the volume of securities 
offered or change in the bona fide estimate of the maximum offering 
price range from that indicated in the form of prospectus filed as part 
of a registration statement that is declared effective may be disclosed 
in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 230.424(b) or Sec. 230.497(h) under the Securities Act so long as 
the decrease in the volume or change in the price range would not 
materially change the disclosure contained in the registration statement 
at effectiveness. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or 
decrease in volume (if the total dollar value of securities offered 
would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the 
low or high end of the range may be reflected in the form of prospectus 
filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) 
(Sec. 230.424(b)(1)) or Rule 497(h) (Sec. 230.497(h)) if, in the 
aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% 
change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the 
``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table in the effective registration 
statement.

    (b) The information omitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) from the 
form of prospectus filed as part of an effective registration statement, 
and contained in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 497(h) under the Securities Act 
(Secs. 230.424(b) or 230.497(h) of this chapter), shall be deemed to be 
a part of the registration statement as of the time it was declared 
effective.
    (c) When used prior to determination of the offering price of the 
securities, a form of prospectus relating to the securities offered 
pursuant to a registration statement that is declared effective with 
information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of such 
effective registration statement in reliance upon this Rule 430A need 
not contain information omitted pursuant to paragraph (a), in order to 
meet the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 
77j) for the purpose of section 5(b)(1) (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1)) thereof. 
This provision shall not limit the information required to be contained 
in a form of prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the 
Act for the purposes of section 5(b)(2) thereof or exception (a) of 
Section 2(10) (15 U.S.C. 77b(10)) thereof.
    (d) This rule shall not apply to registration statements for 
securities to be offered by competitive bidding.
    (e) In the case of a registration statement filed on Form N-1A 
(Sec. 239.15A and Sec. 274.11A of this chapter), Form N-2 (Sec. 239.14 
and Sec. 274.11a-1 of this chapter), Form N-3 (Sec. 239.17a and 
Sec. 274.11b of this chapter), or Form N-4 (Sec. 239.17b and

[[Page 514]]

Sec. 274.11c of this chapter), the references to ``form of prospectus'' 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the accompanying Note 
shall be deemed also to refer to the form of Statement of Additional 
Information filed as part of such a registration statement.
    Note: If information is omitted in reliance upon paragraph (a) from 
the form of prospectus filed as part of an effective registration 
statement, or effective post-effective amendment thereto, the registrant 
must ascertain promptly whether a form of prospectus transmitted for 
filing under Rule 424(b) of Rule 497(h) under the Securities Act 
actually was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event 
that it was not, promptly file such prospectus.

<R05>
Sec. 230.436  Consents required in special cases.

    (a) If any portion of the report or opinion of an expert or counsel 
is quoted or summarized as such in the registration statement or in a 
prospectus, the written consent of the expert or counsel shall be filed 
as an exhibit to the registration statement and shall expressly state 
that the expert or counsel consents to such quotation or summarization.

[[Page 518]]

    (b) If it is stated that any information contained in the 
registration statement has been reviewed or passed upon by any persons 
and that such information is set forth in the registration statement 
upon the authority of or in reliance upon such persons as experts, the 
written consents of such persons shall be filed as exhibits to the 
registration statement.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
a report on unaudited interim financial information (as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section) by an independent accountant who has 
conducted a review of such interim financial information shall not be 
considered a part of a registration statement prepared or certified by 
an accountant or a report prepared or certified by an accountant within

    (3) A description of the procedures for a review of interim 
financial information;

whole, and, accordingly, no such opinion is expressed; and
    (5) A statement about whether the accountant is aware of any 
material modifications that should be made to the accompanying financial 
information so that it conforms with generally accepted accounting

another counsel, the consent of the counsel whose prepared opinion is 
relied upon need not be furnished.

Sec. 230.457  Computation of fee.

    (a) If a filing fee based on a bona fide estimate of the maximum 
offering price, computed in accordance with this rule where applicable, 
has been paid, no additional filing fee shall be required as a result of 
changes in the proposed offering price. If the number of shares or other 
units of securities, or the principal amount of debt securities

[[Page 520]]

to be offered is increased by an amendment filed prior to the effective 
date of the registration statement, an additional filing fee, computed 
on the basis of the offering price of the additional securities, shall 
be paid. There will be no refund once the statement is filed.
    (b) A required fee shall be reduced in an amount equal to any fee 
paid with respect to such transaction pursuant to sections 13(e) and 
14(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any applicable provision 
of this section; the fee requirements under sections 13(e) and 14(g) 
shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fee paid the Commission with 
respect to a transaction under this section. No part of a filing fee is 
refundable.
    (c) Where securities are to be offered at prices computed upon the 
basis of fluctuating market prices, the registration fee is to be 
calculated upon the basis of the price of securities of the same class, 
as follows: either the average of the high and low prices reported in 
the consolidated reporting system (for exchange traded securities and 
last sale reported over-the-counter securities) or the average of the 
bid and asked price (for other over-the-counter securities) as of a 
specified date within 5 business days prior to the date of filing the 
registration statement.
    (d) Where securities are to be offered at varying prices based upon 
fluctuating values of underlying assets, the registration fee is to be 
calculated upon the basis of the market value of such assets as of a 
specified date within fifteen days prior to the date of filing, in 
accordance with the method to be used in calculating the daily offering 
price.
    (e) Where securities are to be offered to existing security holders 
and the portion, if any, not taken by such security holders is to be 
reoffered to the general public, the registration fee is to be 
calculated upon the basis of the proposed offering price to such 
security holders or the proposed reoffering price to the general public, 
whichever is higher.
    (f) Where securities are to be offered in exchange for other 
securities (except where such exchange results from the exercise of a 
conversion privilege) or in a reclassification or recapitalization which 
involves the substitution of a security for another security, a merger, 
a consolidation, or a similar plan of acquisition, the registration fee 
is to be calculated as follows:
    (1) Upon the basis of the market value of the securities to be 
received by the registrant or canceled in the exchange or transaction as 
established by the price of securities of the same class, as determined 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If there is no market for the securities to be received by the 
registrant or cancelled in the exchange or transaction, the book value 
of such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to 
the date of filing the registration statement shall be used, unless the 
issuer of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership, or has an 
accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal 
amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.
    (3) If any cash is to be received by the registrant in connection 
with the exchange or transaction, the amount thereof shall be added to 
the value of the securities to be received by the registrant or 
cancelled as computed in accordance with (e) (1) or (2) of this section. 
If any cash is to be paid by the registrant in connection with the 
exchange or transaction, the amount thereof shall be deducted from the 
value of the securities to be received by the registrant in exchange as 
computed in accordance with (e) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (4) Securities to be offered directly or indirectly for certificates 
of deposit shall be deemed to be offered for the securities represented 
by the certificates of deposit.
    (g) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to warrants or other 
rights to purchase such securities and the holders of such warrants or 
rights may be deemed to be underwriters, as defined in section 2(11) of 
the Act, with respect to the warrants or rights or the securities 
subject thereto, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis 
of the price at which the warrants or rights or securities subject 
thereto are to be offered to the public. If such offering price cannot 
be determined at the time of filing the registration

[[Page 521]]

statement, the registration fee is to be calculated upon the basis of 
the highest of the following: (1) the price at which the warrants or 
rights may be exercised, if known at the time of filing the registration 
statement; (2) the offering price of securities of the same class 
included in the registration statement; or (3) the price of securities 
of the same class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section. If the fee is to be calculated upon the basis of the price 
at which the warrants or rights may be exercised and they are 
exercisable over a period of time at progressively higher prices, the 
fee shall be calculated on the basis of the highest price at which they 
may be exercised. If the warrants or rights are to be registered for 
distribution in the same registration statement as the securities to be 
offered pursuant thereto, no separate registration fee shall be 
required.
    (h)(1) Where securities are to be offered pursuant to an employee 
benefit plan, the aggregate offering price and the amount of the 
registration fee shall be computed with respect to the maximum number of 
the registrant's securities issuable under the plan that are covered by 
the registration statement. If the offering price is not known, the fee 
shall be computed upon the basis of the price of securities of the same 
class, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. 
In the case of an employee stock option plan, the aggregate offering 
price and the fee shall be computed upon the basis of the price at which 
the options may be exercised, or, if such price is not known, upon the 
basis of the price of securities of the same class, as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If there is no market for 
the securities to be offered, the book value of such securities computed 
as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of filing the 
registration statement shall be used.
    (2) If the registration statement registers securities of the 
registrant and also registers interests in the plan constituting 
separate securities, no separate fee is required with respect to the 
plan interests.
    (3) Where a registration statement includes securities to be offered 
pursuant to an employee benefit plan and covers the resale of the same 
securities, no additional filing fee shall be paid with respect to the 
securities to be offered for resale. A filing fee determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall be paid with respect 
to any additional securities to be offered for resale.
    (i) Where convertible securities and the securities into which 
conversion is offered are registered at the same time, the registration 
fee is to be calculated on the basis of the proposed offering price of 
the convertible securities alone, except that if any additional 
consideration is to be received in connection with the exercise of the 
conversion privilege the maximum amount which may be received shall be 
added to the proposed offering price of the convertible securities.
    (j) Where securities are sold prior to the registration thereof and 
are subsequently registered for the purpose of making an offer of 
rescission of such sale or sales, the registration fee is to be 
calculated on the basis of the amount at which such securities were 
sold, except that where securities repurchased pursuant to such offer of 
rescission are to be reoffered to the general public at a price in 
excess of such amount the registration fee is to be calculated on the 
basis of the proposed reoffering price.
    (k) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, the proposed 
maximum aggregate offering price of Depositary Shares evidenced by 
American Depositary Receipts shall, only for the purpose of calculating 
the registration fee, be computed upon the basis of the maximum 
aggregate fees or charges to be imposed in connection with the issuance 
of such receipts.
    (l) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, the proposed 
maximum aggregate offering price of any put or call option which is 
traded on an exchange and registered by such exchange or a facility 
thereof or which is traded over the counter shall, for the purpose of 
calculating the registration fee, be computed upon the basis of the 
maximum aggregate fees or charges to be imposed by such registrant in 
connection with the issuance of such option.

[[Page 522]]

    (m) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule, where the 
securities to be registered include (1) any note, draft, bill of 
exchange, or bankers' acceptance which meets all the conditions of 
section 3(a)(3) hereof, and (2) any note, draft, bill of exchange or 
bankers' acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not 
exceeding nine months exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof 
the maturity date of which is likewise limited, but which otherwise does 
not meet the conditions of section 3(a)(3), the registration fee shall 
be calculated by taking one-fiftieth of 1 per centum of the maximum 
principal amount of only those securities not meeting the conditions of 
section 3(a)(3).
    (n) Where the securities to be offered are guarantees of other 
securities which are being registered concurrently, no separate fee for 
the guarantees shall be payable.
    (o) Where an issuer is offering securities, the registration fee may 
be calculated on the basis of the maximum aggregate offering price of 
all the securities listed in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' 
Table. The number of shares or units of securities need not be included 
in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' Table. If the maximum 
aggregate offering price increases prior to the effective date of the 
registration statement, a pre-effective amendment must be filed to 
increase the maximum dollar value being registered and the additional 
filing fee shall be paid.

Sec. 230.460  Distribution of preliminary prospectus.

    (a) Pursuant to the statutory requirement that the Commission in 
ruling upon requests for acceleration of the effective date of a 
registration statement shall have due regard to the adequacy of the 
information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, 
the Commission may consider whether the persons making the offering have 
taken reasonable steps to make the information contained in the 
registration statement conveniently available to underwriters and 
dealers who it is reasonably anticipated will be invited to participate 
in the distribution of the security to be offered or sold.
    (b)(1) As a minimum, reasonable steps to make the information 
conveniently available would involve the distribution, to each 
underwriter and dealer who it is reasonably anticipated will be invited 
to participate in the distribution of the security, a reasonable time in 
advance of the anticipated effective date of the registration statement, 
of as many copies of the proposed form of preliminary prospectus 
permitted by Rule 430 (Sec. 230.430) as appears to be reasonable to 
secure adequate distribution of the preliminary prospectus.
    (2) In the case of a registration statement filed by a closed-end 
investment company on Form N-2 (Sec. 239.14 and Sec. 274.11a-1 of this 
chapter), reasonable steps to make information conveniently available 
would involve distribution of a sufficient number of copies of the 
Statement of Additional Information required by Sec. 230.430(b) as it 
appears to be reasonable to secure their adequate distribution either to 
each underwriter or dealer who it is reasonably anticipated will be 
invited to participate in the distribution of the security, or to the 
underwriter, dealer or other source named on the cover page of the 
preliminary prospectus as being the person investors should contact in 
order to obtain the Statement of Additional Information.

[[Page 523]]

    (c) The granting of acceleration will not be conditioned upon
    (1) The distribution of a preliminary prospectus in any state where 
such distribution would be illegal; or
    (2) The distribution of a preliminary prospectus (i) in the case of 
a registration statement relating solely to securities to be offered at 
competitive bidding, provided the undertaking in Item 512(d)(1) of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.512(d)(2) of this chapter) is included in the 
registration statement and distribution of prospectuses pursuant to such 
undertaking is made prior to the publication or distribution of the 
invitation for bids, or
    (ii) In the case of a registration statement relating to a security 
issued by a face-amount certificate company or a redeemable security 
issued by an open-end management company or unit investment trust if any 
other security of the same class is currently being offered or sold, 
pursuant to an effective registration statement by the issuer or by or 
through an underwriter, or
    (iii) In the case of an offering of subscription rights unless it is 
contemplated that the distribution will be made through dealers and the 
underwriters intend to make the offering during the stockholders' 
subscription period, in which case copies of the preliminary prospectus 
must be distributed to dealers prior to the effective date of the 
registration statement in the same fashion as is required in the case of 
other offerings through underwriters, or
    (iv) In the case of a registration statement pertaining to a 
security to be offered pursuant to an exchange offer or transaction 
described in Rule 145 (Sec. 230.145).

<R05>
Sec. 230.461  Acceleration of effective date.

    (a) Requests for acceleration of the effective date of a 
registration statement shall be made by the registrant and the managing 
underwriters of the proposed issue, or, if there are no managing 
underwriters, by the principal underwriters of the proposed issue, and 
shall state the date upon which it is desired that the registration 
statement shall become effective. Such requests may be made in writing 
or orally, provided that, if an oral request is to be made, a letter 
indicating that fact and stating that the registrant and the managing or 
principal underwriters are aware of their obligations under the Act must 
accompany the registration statement for a pre-effective amendment 
thereto) at the time of filing with the Commission. Written requests may 
be sent to the Commission by facsimile transmission. If, by reason of 
the expected arrangement in connection with the offering, it is to be 
requested that the registration statement shall become effective at a 
particular hour of the day, the Commission must be advised to that 
effect not later than the second business day before the day which it is 
desired that the registration statement shall become effective. A 
person's request for acceleration will

[[Page 524]]

be considered confirmation of such person's awareness of the person's 
obligations under the Act. Not later than the time of filing the last 
amendment prior to the effective date of the registration statement, the 
registrant shall inform the Commission as to whether or not the amount 
of compensation to be allowed or paid to the underwriters and any other 
arrangements among the registrant, the underwriters and other broker 
dealers participating in the distribution, as described in the 
registration statement, have been reviewed to the extent required by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and such Association 
has issued a statement expressing no objections to the compensation and 
other arrangements.
    (b) Having due regard to the adequacy of information respecting the 
registrant theretofore available to the public, to the facility with 
which the nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship 
to the capital structure of the registrant issuer and the rights of 
holders thereof can be understood, and to the public interest and the 
protection of investors, as provided in section 8(a) of the Act, it is 
the general policy of the Commission, upon request, as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section, to permit acceleration of the effective 
date of the registration statement as soon as possible after the filing 
of appropriate amendments, if any. In determining the date on which a 
registration statement shall become effective, the following are 
included in the situations in which the Commission considers that the 
statutory standards of section 8(a) may not be met and may refuse to 
accelerate the effective date:
    (1) Where there has not been a bona fide effort to make the 
prospectus reasonably concise, readable, and in compliance with the 
plain English requirements of Rule 421(d) of Regulation C (17 CFR 
230.421(d)) in order to facilitate an understanding of the information 
in the prospectus.
    (2) Where the form of preliminary prospectus, which has been 
distributed by the issuer or underwriter, is found to be inaccurate or 
inadequate in any material respect, until the Commission has received 
satisfactory assurance that appropriate correcting material has been 
sent to all underwriters and dealers who received such preliminary 
prospectus or prospectuses in quantity sufficient for their information 
and the information of others to whom the inaccurate or inadequate 
material was sent.
    (3) Where the Commission is currently making an investigation of the 
issuer, a person controlling the issuer, or one of the underwriters, if 
any, of the securities to be offered, pursuant to any of the Acts 
administered by the Commission.
    (4) Where one or more of the underwriters, although firmly committed 
to purchase securities covered by the registration statement, is subject 
to and does not meet the financial responsibility requirements of Rule 
15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Sec. 240.15c3-1 of 
this chapter). For the purposes of this paragraph underwriters will be 
deemed to be firmly committed even though the obligation to purchase is 
subject to the usual conditions as to receipt of opinions of counsel, 
accountants, etc., the accuracy of warranties or representations, the 
happening of calamities or the occurrence of other events the 
determination of which is not expressed to be in the sole or absolute 
discretion of the underwriters.
    (5) Where there have been transactions in securities of the 
registrant by persons connected with or proposed to be connected with 
the offering which may have artificially affected or may artificially 
affect the market price of the security being offered.
    (6) Where the amount of compensation to be allowed or paid to the 
underwriters and any other arrangements among the registrant, the 
underwriters and other broker dealers participating in the distribution, 
as described in the registration statement, if required to be reviewed 
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), have 
been reviewed by the NASD and the NASD has not issued a statement 
expressing no objections to the compensation and other arrangements.
    (7) Where, in the case of a significant secondary offering at the 
market, the registrant, selling security holders and underwriters have 
not taken sufficient

[[Page 525]]

measures to insure compliance with Regulation M (Sec. Sec. 242.100 
through 242.105 of this chapter.
    (c) Insurance against liabilities arising under the Act, whether the 
cost of insurance is borne by the registrant, the insured or some other 
person, will not be considered a bar to acceleration, unless the 
registrant is a registered investment company or a business development 
company and the cost of such insurance is borne by other than an insured 
officer or director of the registrant. In the case of such a registrant, 
the Commission may refuse to accelerate the effective date of the 
registration statement when the registrant is organized or administered 
pursuant to any instrument (including a contract for insurance against 
liabilities arising under the Act) that protects or purports to protect 
any director or officer of the company against any liability to the 
company or its security holders to which he or she would otherwise be 
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or 
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her 
office.

Commission.
    (b) A registration statement and any post-effective amendment 
thereto shall become effective upon filing with the Commission if:
    (1) The registration statement is for registering additional 
securities of the same class(es) as were included in an earlier 
registration statement for the same offering and declared effective by 
the Commission;
    (2) The new registration statement is filed prior to the time 
confirmations are sent or given; and
    (3) The new registration statement registers additional securities 
in an amount and at a price that together represent no more than 20% of 
the maximum aggregate offering price set forth for each class of 
securities in the ``Calculation of Registration Fee'' table contained in 
such earlier registration statement.
    (c) If the prospectus contained in a post-effective amendment filed 
prior to the time confirmations are sent or given contains no 
substantive changes from or additions to the prospectus previously filed 
as part of the effective registration statement, other than price-
related information omitted from the registration statement in reliance 
on Rule 430A of the Act (Sec. 230.430A), such post-effective amendment 
shall become effective upon filing with the Commission.

Act of 1934 after effectiveness, and thereafter on each of its 
subsequent periodic reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 through the later of disclosure 
of the application of all the offering proceeds or disclosure of the 
termination of the offering.
    (b) A successor issuer shall comply with paragraph (a) of this 
section only if a report of the use of proceeds is required with respect 
to the first effective registration statement of the predecessor issuer.
    (c) For purposes of this section:

    (1) The term offering proceeds shall not include any amount(s) 
received for the account(s) of any selling security holder(s).
    (2) The term application shall not include the temporary investment 
of proceeds by the issuer pending final application.

statement shall become effective in accordance with such designation if 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) The depositary previously has filed a registration statement on 
Form F-6 (Sec. 239.36 of this chapter), which the Commission has 
declared effective, with identical terms of deposit, except for the 
number of foreign securities a Depositary Share represents, and the 
depositary so certifies; and
    (2) The designation of the effective date and time is set forth on 
the facing-page of the registration statement, or in any pre-effective 
amendment thereto. A pre-effective amendment containing such a 
designation properly made shall be deemed to have been filed with the 
consent of the Commission.
    (b)(1) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, suspend the ability of a 
depositary to designate the date and time of effectiveness of a 
registration statement, and such suspension shall remain in effect until 
the Commission furnishes written notice to the depositary that the 
suspension has been terminated. Any suspension, so long as it is in 
effect, shall apply to any registration statement that has been filed 
but has not, at the time of such suspension, become effective and to any 
registration statement the depositary files after such suspension. Any 
such suspension applies only to the ability to designate the date and 
time of effectiveness under paragraph (a) of this section and does not 
otherwise affect the registration statement.
    (2) Any suspension under paragraph (b)(1) of this section becomes 
effective when the Commission furnishes written notice thereof to the 
depositary. The Commission may issue a suspension if it appears to the 
Commission:
    (i) That any registration statement containing a designation under 
this section is incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, 
whether or not such registration has become effective, or
    (ii) That the depositary has not complied with any of the conditions 
of this section. The depositary may petition the Commission to review 
the suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a 
request for such a hearing is included in the petition.

Sec. 230.479  Procedure with respect to abandoned registration statements and post-effective amendments.

    When a registration statement, or a post-effective amendment to such 
a statement, has been on file with the Commission for a period of nine 
months and has not become effective the Commission may, in its 
discretion, proceed in the following manner to determine whether such 
registration statement or amendment has been abandoned by the 
registrant. If the registration statement has been amended, otherwise 
than for the purpose of delaying the effective date thereof, or if the 
post-effective amendment has been amended, the nine-month period shall 
be computed from the date of the latest such amendment.
    (a) A notice will be sent to the registrant, and to the agent for 
service named in the registration statement, by registered or certified 
mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the most recent addresses 
for the registrant and the agent for service reflected in the 
registration statement. Such notice will inform the registrant and the 
agent for service that the registration statement or amendment is out of 
date and must be either amended to comply with the applicable 
requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or be 
withdrawn within 30 days after the date of such notice.
    (b) If the registrant or the agent for service fails to respond to 
such notice by filing a substantive amendment or withdrawing the 
registration statement and does not furnish a satisfactory explanation 
as to why it has not done so within such 30 days, the Commission may, 
where consistent with the public interest and the protection of 
investors, enter an order declaring the registration statement or 
amendment abandoned.
    (c) When such an order is entered by the Commission the papers 
comprising the registration statement or amendment will not be removed 
from the files of the Commission but an order shall be included in the 
file for the registration statement in the following

[[Page 532]]

manner: ``Declared abandoned by order dated ______.''

Sec. 230.481  Information required in prospectuses.

    Disclose the following in registration statements prepared on a form 
available solely to investment companies registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 or in registration statements filed under the Act 
for a company that has elected to be regulated as a business development 
company under Sections 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act (15 
U.S.C. 80a-54--80a-64):
    (a) Facing page. Indicate the approximate date of the proposed sale 
of the securities to the public.
    (b) Outside front cover page. If applicable, include the following 
in plain English as required by Sec. 230.421(d):
    (1) Commission legend. Provide a legend that indicates that the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of 
the securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosure 
in the prospectus and that any contrary representation is a criminal 
offense. The legend may be in one of the following or other clear and 
concise language:


[[Page 533]]


    Example A: The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved 
or disapproved these securities or passed upon the adequacy of this 
prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
    Example B: The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved 
or disapproved these securities or determined if this prospectus is 
truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal 
offense.

    (2) ``Subject to Completion'' legend. (i) If a prospectus or 
Statement of Additional Information will be used before the effective 
date of the registration statement, include on the outside front cover 
page of the prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, a 
prominent statement that:
    (A) The information in the prospectus or Statement of Additional 
Information will be amended or completed;
    (B) A registration statement relating to these securities has been 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
    (C) The securities may not be sold until the registration statement 
becomes effective; and
    (D) In a prospectus, that the prospectus is not an offer to sell the 
securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy the securities in 
any state where offers or sales are not permitted, or in a Statement of 
Additional Information, that the Statement of Additional Information is 
not a prospectus.
    (ii) The legend may be in the following language or other clear and 
understandable language:

    The information in this prospectus (or Statement of Additional 
Information) is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these 
securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission is effective. This prospectus (or Statement of 
Additional Information) is not an offer to sell these securities and is 
not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the 
offer or sale is not permitted.

    (iii) In the case of a prospectus that omits pricing information 
under Sec. 230.430A, provide the information and legend in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section if the prospectus or Statement of Additional 
Information is used before the initial public offering price is 
determined.
    (c) Table of contents. Include on either the outside front, inside 
front, or outside back cover page of the prospectus, a reasonably 
detailed table of contents. It must show the page number of the various 
sections or subdivisions of the prospectus. Include this table of 
contents immediately following the cover page in any prospectus 
delivered electronically.
    (d) Stabilization and other transactions. (1) Indicate on the front 
cover page of the prospectus if the underwriter has any arrangement with 
the issuer, such as an over-allotment option, under which the 
underwriter may purchase additional shares in connection with the 
offering, and state the amount of additional shares the underwriter may 
purchase under the arrangement. Provide disclosure in the prospectus 
that briefly describes any transaction that the underwriter intends to 
conduct during the offering that stabilizes, maintains, or otherwise 
affects the market price of the offered securities. Include information 
on stabilizing transactions, syndicate short covering transactions, 
penalty bids, or any other transactions that affect the offered 
security's price. Describe the nature of the transactions clearly and 
explain how the transactions affect the offered security's price. 
Identify the exchange or other market on which these transactions may 
occur. If true, disclose that the underwriter may discontinue these 
transactions at any time;
    (2) If the stabilizing began before the effective date of the 
registration statement, disclose in the prospectus the amount of 
securities bought, the prices at which they were bought and the period 
within which they were bought. In the event that Sec. 230.430A of this 
chapter is used, the prospectus filed under Sec. 230.497(h) or included 
in a post-effective amendment must contain information on the 
stabilizing transactions that took place before the determination of the 
public offering price shown in the prospectus; and
    (3) If you are making a warrant or rights offering of securities to 
existing security holders and the securities not purchased by existing 
security holders

[[Page 534]]

are to be reoffered to the public, disclose in the prospectus used in 
connection with the reoffering:
    (i) The amount of securities bought in stabilization activities 
during the offering period and the price or range of prices at which the 
securities were bought;
    (ii) The amount of the offered securities subscribed for during the 
offering period;
    (iii) The amount of the offered securities subscribed for by the 
underwriters during the offering period;
    (iv) The amount of the offered securities sold during the offering 
period by the underwriters and the price or range of prices at which the 
securities were sold; and
    (v) The amount of the offered securities to be reoffered to the 
public and the public offering price.
    (e) Dealer prospectus delivery obligations. On the outside back 
cover page of the prospectus, advise dealers of their prospectus 
delivery obligation, including the expiration date specified by Section 
4(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(3)) and Sec. 230.174. If the expiration 
date is not known on the effective date of the registration statement, 
include the expiration date in the copy of the prospectus filed under 
Sec. 230.497. This information need not be included if dealers are not 
required to deliver a prospectus under Sec. 230.174 or Section 24(d) of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24). Use the following 
or other clear, plain language:

                  Dealer Prospectus Delivery Obligation

    Until (insert date), all dealers that effect transactions in these 
securities, whether or not participating in this offering, may be 
required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealers' 
obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriters and with 
respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.

    (f) Electronic distribution. Where a prospectus is distributed 
through an electronic medium, issuers may satisfy legibility 
requirements applicable to printed documents, such as paper size, type 
size and font, bold-face type, italics and red ink, by presenting all 
required information in a format readily communicated to investors, and 
where indicated, in a manner reasonably calculated to draw investor 
attention to specific information.

Sec. 230.482  Advertising by an investment company as satisfying requirements of section 10.

    (a) An advertisement or other sales material that is not a 
prospectus, or an advertisement or sales material excluded from the 
definition of prospectus by section 2(10) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(10)) 
and related Sec. 230.134, will be deemed to be a prospectus under 
section 10(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(b)) for the purpose of section 
5(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1)), if:
    (1) It is with respect to an investment company registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), or a business development 
company which is selling or proposing to sell its securities pursuant to 
a registration statement which has been filed under the Act,
    (2) It contains only information the substance of which is included 
in the section 10(a) prospectus,
    (3) It includes a conspicuous statement that:
    (i) Identifies a source from which an investor may obtain a 
prospectus containing more complete information about the investment 
company, which should be read carefully before investing; or
    (ii) If used with a profile under Sec. 230.498 (``Profile''), 
indicates that information is available in the Profile about the 
investment company, the procedures for investing in the investment 
company, and the availability of the investment company's prospectus.
    Note to Paragraph (a)(3): The fact that the statements included in 
the advertisement are included in the section 10(a) prospectus does not 
relieve the issuer, underwriter, or dealer of the obligation to ensure 
that the advertisement is not false or misleading.
    (4) It contains the statement required by Rule 481(b)(2) under the 
Securities Act (Sec. 230.481(b)(2) of this chapter) when used prior to 
effectiveness of the company's registration statement or, in the case of 
a registration statement that becomes effective omitting certain 
information from the prospectus contained in the registration statement 
in reliance upon Rule 430A under

[[Page 535]]

the Securities Act (Sec. 230.430A of this chapter), when used prior to 
the determination of the public offering price,
    (5) It does not contain and is not accompanied by any application by 
which a prospective investor may invest in the investment company, 
except that:
    (i) A prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the 
Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(a)) by which a unit investment trust offers periodic 
payment plan certificates may contain a contract application although 
the prospectus includes another prospectus that, pursuant to this 
section, omits certain information required by section 10(a) of the Act, 
regarding investment companies in which the unit investment trusts 
invests; and
    (ii) It may be used with a Profile that includes, or is accompanied 
by, an application to purchase shares of the investment company as 
permitted under Sec. 230.498.
    (6) In the case of an advertisement containing performance data of 
an open-end management investment company or a separate account 
registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust offering 
variable annuity contracts (trust account), it includes a legend 
disclosing that the performance data quoted represents past performance 
and that the investment return and principal value of an investment will 
fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more 
or less than their original cost; Provided, however, That an 
advertisement may omit legend disclosure pertaining to the fluctuation 
of the principal value of an investment in a money market fund. In 
addition, if a sales load or any other nonrecurring fee is charged, the 
advertisement must disclose the maximum amount of the load or fee; if 
the sales load or fee is not reflected, the advertisement must also 
disclose that the performance data does not reflect its deduction, and 
that, if reflected, the load or fees would reduce the performance 
quoted;
    Note to paragraph (a)(6): All advertisements made pursuant to this 
rule are subject to Rule 420 [17 CFR 230.420].
    (7)(i) In the case of an investment company that holds itself out to 
be a money market fund, it includes the following statement:

An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although 
the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per 
share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund.

    (ii) A money market fund that does not hold itself out as 
maintaining a stable net asset value may omit the second sentence of the 
statement in (a)(7)(i) of this section.
    (b) An advertisement made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
need not contain the statement required by Rule 481(b)(1) 
(Sec. 230.481(b)(1)).
    (c) An advertisement made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
need not be filed as part of the registration statement filed under the 
Act.
    Note: These advertisements, unless filed with the NASD, are required 
to be filed in accordance with the requirements of Rule 497 (17 CFR 
230.497).
    (d) In the case of a money market fund:
    (1) Any quotation of the money market fund's yield in an 
advertisement shall be based on the methods of computation prescribed in 
Form N-1A (Secs. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter), Form N-3 
(Secs. 239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), or Form N-4 (Secs. 239.17b 
and 274.11c of this chapter) and may include:
    (i) A quotation of current yield that identifies the length of and 
the date of the last day in the base period used in computing that 
quotation; or
    (ii) A quotation of effective yield if it appears in the same 
advertisement as a quotation of current yield and each quotation relates 
to an identical base period and is presented with equal prominence; or
    (iii) A quotation or quotations of tax equivalent yield or tax 
equivalent effective yield if it appears in the same advertisement as a 
quotation of current yield and each quotation relates to the same base 
period as the quotation of current yield, is presented with equal 
prominence, and states the income tax rate used in the calculation.
    (2) Accompany any quotation of the money market fund's total return 
in an advertisement with a quotation of the money market fund's current 
yield

[[Page 536]]

under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. Place the quotations of total 
return and current yield next to each other, in the same size print, and 
if there is a material difference between the quoted total return and 
the quoted current yield, include a statement that the yield quotation 
more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than 
the total return quotation.
    (e) In the case of an open-end management investment company or a 
trust account (other than a money market fund referred to in paragraph 
(d) of this section), any quotation of the company's performance 
contained in an advertisement shall be limited to quotations of:
    (1) A current yield that--
    (i) Is based on the methods of computation prescribed in Form N-1A, 
N-3, or N-4;
    (ii) Is accompanied by quotations of total return as provided for in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
    (iii) Is set out in no greater prominence than the required 
quotations of total return; and
    (iv) Identifies the length of and the date of the last day in the 
base period used in computing the quotation.
    (2) A tax equivalent yield that--
    (i) Is based on the methods of computation prescribed in Form N-1A, 
N-3, or N-4;
    (ii) Is accompanied by quotations of yield as provided for in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and total return as provided for in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
    (iii) Is set out in no greater prominence than the required 
quotations of yield and total return;
    (iv) Relates to the same base period as the required quotation of 
yield; and
    (v) Identifies the length of and the date of the last day in the 
base period used in computing the quotation.
    (3) Average annual total return for one, five, and ten year periods; 
Provided, That if the company's registration statement under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77A et seq.) has been in effect for 
less than one, five, or ten years, the time period during which the 
registration statement was in effect is substituted for the period(s) 
otherwise prescribed; and Provided further, That such quotations--
    (i) Are based on the methods of computation prescribed in Form N-1A, 
N-3, or N-4;
    (ii) Are current to the most recent calendar quarter ended prior to 
the submission of the advertisement for publication;
    (iii) Are set out with equal prominence; and
    (iv) Identify the length of and the last day of the one, five, and 
ten year periods; and
    (4) Any other historical measure of company performance (not subject 
to any prescribed method of computation) if such measurement--
    (i) Reflects all elements of return;
    (ii) Is accompanied by quotations of total return as provided for in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
    (iii) Is set out in no greater prominence than the required 
quotations of total return; and
    (iv) Identifies the length of and the last day of the period for 
which performance is measured.
    (f) All performance data contained in any advertisement must be as 
of the most recent practicable date considering the type of investment 
company and the media through which the data will be conveyed; Provided, 
however, That any advertisement containing total return quotations shall 
be considered to have complied with this provision if the total return 
quotations are current to the most recent calendar quarter ended prior 
to the submission of the advertisement for publication.

Sec. 230.483  Exhibits for certain registration statements, financial data schedule.

    If a registration statement is prepared on a form available solely 
to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, or a business development company which is selling or proposing to 
sell its securities pursuant to a registration statement which has been 
filed under the Act, the following provisions apply:

[[Page 537]]

    (a) Such registration statement shall contain an exhibit index, 
which should immediately precede the exhibits filed with such 
registration statement. The exhibit index shall indicate by handwritten, 
typed, printed or other legible form of notation in the manually signed 
original registration statement the page number in the sequential 
numbering system where such exhibit can be found. Where exhibits are 
incorporated by reference, this fact shall be noted in the exhibit index 
referred to in the preceding sentence. Further, the first page of the 
manually signed registration statement shall list the page in the filing 
where the exhibit index is located.
    (b) If any name is signed to the registration statement pursuant to 
a power of attorney, copies of such powers of attorney shall be filed as 
an exhibit to the registration statement. In addition, if the name of 
any officer signing on behalf of the registrant, or attesting the 
registrant's seal, is signed pursuant to a power of attorney, certified 
copies of a resolution of the registrant's board of directors 
authorizing such signature shall also be filed as an exhibit to the 
registration statement. A power of attorney that is filed with the 
Commission shall relate to a specific filing, an amendment thereto, or a 
related registration statement that is to be effective upon filing 
pursuant to Rule 462(b) (Sec. 230.462(b)) under the Act.
    (c)(1) All written consents are required to be filed as an exhibit 
to the registration statement, together with a list thereof. Such 
consents shall be dated and manually signed. Where the consent of an 
expert or counsel is contained in his report or opinion, a reference 
shall be made in the list to the report or opinion containing the 
consent.
    (2) In a registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) 
(Sec. 230.462(b)) by a closed-end company, any required consent may be 
incorporated by reference into the registration statement from a 
previously filed registration statement related to the offering, 
provided that the consent contained in the previously filed registration 
statement expressly provides for such incorporation. Any consent filed 
in a Rule 462(b) (Sec. 230.462(b)) registration statement may contain 
duplicated or facsimile versions of required signatures, and such 
signatures shall be considered manually filed for the purposes of the 
Act and the rules thereunder.
    (d) The registrant:
    (1) May file such exhibits as it may desire in addition to those 
required by the appropriate form. Such exhibits shall be so marked as to 
indicate clearly the subject matters to which they refer;
    (2) In any case where two or more indentures, contracts, frachises, 
or other documents required to be filed as exhibits are substantially 
identical in all material respects except as to the parties thereto, the 
dates of execution, or other details, need file a copy of only one of 
such documents, with a schedule identifying the other documents omitted 
and setting forth the material details in which such documents differ 
from the document of which a copy is filed. The Commission may at any 
time in its discretion require filing of copies of any documents so 
omitted; and
    (3) If an exhibit to a registration statement (other than an opinion 
or consent), filed in preliminary form, has been changed only (i) to 
insert information as to interest, dividend or conversion rates, 
redemption or conversion prices, purchase or offering prices, 
underwriters' or dealers' commission, names, addresses or participation 
of underwriters or similar matters, which information appears elsewhere 
in an amendment to the registration statement, or (ii) to correct 
typographical errors, insert signatures or make other similar immaterial 
changes, then, notwithstanding any contrary requirement of any rule or 
form, need not refile such exhibit as so amended; provided the 
registrant states in the amendment to the registration statement the 
basis provided by this rule for not refiling such exhibit. Any such 
incomplete exhibit may not, however, be incorporated by reference in any 
subsequent filing under any Act administered by the Commission.
    (e) Financial Data Schedule--(1) General. (i) A Financial Data 
Schedule (``Schedule'') shall be filed only by an electronic filer and 
shall set forth the financial information specified in the

[[Page 538]]

applicable table in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Where required by 
the applicable form, an electronic filer that is a registered investment 
company or a business development company shall file a Schedule as an 
exhibit to the form in accordance with the following instructions. The 
Schedule shall be prepared in the format prescribed in the EDGAR Filer 
Manual.
    (ii) The amounts reflected in the Schedule shall correspond to 
amounts reflected in the registrant's financial statements or notes 
thereto, financial schedules, registration statements, or reports 
(collectively, ``source documents''). Amounts aggregated or combined in 
the financial statements should be shown as separate line items as 
indicated in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (iii) The Schedule shall be submitted as an exhibit to the filing(s) 
to which it relates but shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of 
section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), section 18 of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r), section 323 of the Trust Indenture Act (15 
U.S.C. 77www), or section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 
80a-33(b)) or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of such sections, 
nor will it be deemed a part of any registration statement to which it 
relates. It shall, however, be subject to all other liability and anti-
fraud provisions of the aforementioned Acts. See rule 402 of Regulation 
S-T (Sec. 232.402 of this chapter). A registrant that accurately 
extracts the Schedule information from the source document in which it 
appears shall not be liable, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, 
or the Investment Company Act, for such extracted information, provided 
that the extracted data were not materially false or misleading in the 
underlying source document.
    (iv) Where a registrant has taken advantage of a temporary hardship 
exemption with regard to a document that is required to include a 
Financial Data Schedule, the Financial Data Schedule shall not be 
included with the paper filing, but shall be included with the 
confirming electronic copy required by rule 201 of Regulation S-T 
(Sec. 232.201 of this chapter).
    Note 1 to paragraph (e)(1)(iv): A registrant's failure to furnish a 
Schedule under this paragraph (e) will not prevent acceptance of the 
filing for which the Schedule is required. However, because the Schedule 
may be used by the Commission staff in its review of the filing, 
processing of the filing may be delayed pending filing of the Schedule.
    Note 2 to paragraph (e)(1)(iv): Paper copies of the Financial Data 
Schedule are not required to be furnished with the paper copy sent to 
the Commission's Operations Center in Alexandria, Virginia pursuant to 
Rule 902(g) of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.902(g) of this chapter), or with 
the paper copies of filings required by the Commission rules to be 
furnished to the national securities exchange or national securities 
association upon which the registrant's securities are listed. 
Similarly, no paper copy of a Financial Data Schedule is required with

Sec. 230.484  Undertaking required in certain registration statements.

    If a registration statement is prepared on a form available solely 
to investment companies registered under the investment Company Act of 
1940, or a business development company which is selling or proposing to 
sell its securities pursuant to a registration statement which has been 
filed under the Act, if
    (a) Any acceleration is requested of the effective date of the 
registration statement pursuant to Rule 461 (Sec. 230.461), and
    (b)(1) Any provision or arrangement exists whereby the registrant 
may indemnify a director, officer or controlling person of the 
registrant against liabilities arising under the Act, or
    (2) The underwriting agreement contains provisions by which 
indemnification against such liabilities is given by the registrant to 
the underwriter or controlling persons of the underwriter and the 
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant is such an 
underwriter or controlling person thereof or a member of any firm which 
is an underwriter, and
    (3) The benefits of such indemnification are not waived by such 
persons; the registration statement shall include a brief description of 
the indemnification provisions and an undertaking in substantially the 
following form:


[[Page 540]]


Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities 
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling 
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or 
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against 
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities 
(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the 
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by 
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the 
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion 
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such 
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act 
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


<R05>
Sec. 230.485  Effective date of post-effective amendments filed by certain registered investment companies.

    (a) Automatic Effectiveness. (1) Except as otherwise provided in 
this section, a post-effective amendment to a registration statement 
filed by a registered open-end management investment company, unit 
investment trust or separate account as defined in section 2(a)(37) of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 USC 80a-2(a)(37)] shall become 
effective on the sixtieth day after the filing thereof, or a later date 
designated by the registrant on the facing sheet of the amendment, which 
date shall be no later than eighty days after the date on which the 
amendment is filed.
    (2) A post-effective amendment filed by a registered open-end 
management investment company for the purpose of adding a series shall 
become effective on the seventy-fifth day after the filing thereof or a 
later date designated by the registrant on the facing sheet of the 
amendment, which date shall be no later than ninety-five days after the 
date on which the amendment is filed.
    (3) The Commission, having due regard to the public interest and the 
protection of investors, may declare an amendment filed under this 
paragraph (a) effective on an earlier date.
    (b) Immediate Effectiveness. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, a post-effective amendment to a registration statement filed by 
a registered open-end management investment company, unit investment 
trust or separate account as defined in section 2(a)(37) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 USC 80a-2(a)(37)] shall become 
effective on the date upon which it is filed with the Commission, or a 
later date designated by the registrant on the facing sheet of the 
amendment, which date shall be not later than thirty days after the date 
on which the amendment is filed, except that a post-effective amendment 
including a designation of a new effective date pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section shall become effective on the new effective 
date designated therein, Provided, that the following conditions are 
met:
    (1) It is filed for no purpose other than one or more of the 
following:
    (i) Bringing the financial statements up to date under section 
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)] or Rules 3-
12 or 3-18 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-12 and 210.3-18];
    (ii) Complying with an undertaking to file an amendment containing 
financial statements, which may be unaudited, within four to six months 
after the effective date of the registrant's registration statement 
under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.];
    (iii) Designating a new effective date for a previously filed post-
effective amendment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, which has 
not yet become effective, Provided, that the new effective date shall be 
no earlier than the effective date designated in the previously filed 
amendment under paragraph (a) of this section and no later than thirty 
days after that date;
    (iv) Disclosing or updating the information required by Items 5 or 
6(a)(2) of Form N-1A [17 CFR 239.15A and 274.11A];
    (v) Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems 
appropriate;
    (vi) In the case of a separate account registered as a unit 
investment trust, to make changes in the disclosure in the unit 
investment trust's registration statement to reflect changes to

[[Page 541]]

disclosure in the registration statement of the investment company in 
which the unit investment trust invests all of its assets; and
    (vii) Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.
    (2) The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for 
one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the 
prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or 
one for which the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii) of this section, has occurred since the latest of the 
following three dates:
    (i) the effective date of the registrant's registration statement;
    (ii) the effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment 
to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or
    (iii) the filing date of a post-effective amendment filed under 
paragraph (a) of this section which has not become effective.
    (3) The amendment recites on its facing sheet that the registrant 
proposes that the amendment will become effective under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (4) The representations of the registrant referred to in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature 
page of the post-effective amendment that the amendment meets all the 
requirements for effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section. If 
counsel prepared or reviewed the post-effective amendment filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the Commission 
at the time the amendment is filed a written representation that the 
amendment does not contain disclosures that would render it ineligible 
to become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) Incomplete or Inaccurate Amendments; Suspension of Use of 
Paragraph (b) of this section. (1) No amendment shall become effective 
under paragraph (a) of this section if, prior to the effective date of 
the amendment, it should appear to the Commission that the amendment may 
be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, and the Commission 
furnishes to the registrant written notice that the effective date of 
the amendment is to be suspended. Following such action by the 
Commission, the registrant may file with the Commission at any time a 
petition for review of the suspension. The Commission will order a 
hearing on the matter if a request for such a hearing is included in the 
petition. If the Commission has suspended the effective date of an 
amendment, the amendment shall become effective on such date as the 
Commission may determine, having due regard to the public interest and 
the protection of investors.
    (2) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in this paragraph (c)(2), suspend the ability of registrant to 
file a post-effective amendment under paragraph (b) of this section. The 
notice of such suspension shall be in writing and shall specify the 
period for which such suspension shall remain in effect. The Commission 
may issue a suspension if it appears to the Commission that a registrant 
which files a post-effective amendment under paragraph (b) of this 
section has not complied with the conditions of that paragraph. Any 
suspension under this paragraph (c)(2) shall become effective at such 
time as the Commission furnishes written notice thereof to the 
registrant. Any such suspension, so long as it is in effect, shall apply 
to any post-effective amendment that has been filed but has not, at the 
time of such suspension, become effective, and to any post-effective 
amendment that may be filed after the suspension. Any suspension shall 
apply only to the ability to file a post-effective amendment pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section and shall not otherwise affect any post-
effective amendment. Following this action by the Commission the 
registrant may file with the Commission at any time a petition for 
review of the suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the 
matter if a request for a hearing is included in the petition.
    (d) Subsequent Amendments. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, a post-effective amendment that includes a 
prospectus shall not become effective under paragraph (a) of

[[Page 542]]

this section if a subsequent post-effective amendment relating to the 
prospectus is filed before such amendment becomes effective.
    (2) A post-effective amendment that includes a prospectus shall 
become effective under paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding the 
filing of a subsequent post-effective amendment relating to the 
prospectus, Provided, that the following conditions are met:
    (i) the subsequent amendment is filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section; and
    (ii) the subsequent amendment designates as its effective date 
either:
    (A) the date on which the prior post-effective amendment was to 
become effective under paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (B) a new effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section.

In this case the prior post-effective amendment filed under paragraph 
(a) of this section and any prior post-effective amendment filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section shall also become effective on the new 
effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, if 
another post-effective amendment relating to the same prospectus is 
filed under paragraph (a) of this section before the prior amendments 
filed pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have become 
effective, none of such prior amendments shall become effective under 
this section.
    (e) Certain Separate Accounts. For purposes of this section, a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement for an offering of 
securities by a registered open-end management investment company or 
unit investment trust as those terms are used in paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (e) of this section and as such amendments are referred to in 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, shall include a post-effective 
amendment to an offering of securities by an insurance company funded 
through a separate account, as defined in section 2(a)(37) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(37)], where the 
separate account need not register under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 under section 3(c)(11) thereof [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(11)].
    (f) Electronic Filers. (1) When ascertaining the date of filing, 
electronic filers should not presume a registration statement has been 
accepted until notice of acceptance has been received from the 
Commission.
    (2) Attention is directed to the requirements of the relevant 
registration statement form and Sec. 230.483 concerning certain items of 
financial information (the Financial Data Schedule) that may be 
required.
    Note: To determine the date of automatic effectiveness, the day 
following the filing date is the first day of the time period. For 
example, a post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (a) of this 
section on November 1 would become effective on December 31.

[59 FR 43464, Aug. 24, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 47938, Sept. 12, 1997; 
63 FR 13943, Mar. 23, 1998]

day after the filing thereof, or a later date designated by the 
registrant on the facing sheet of the amendment or registration 
statement, which date shall not be later than eighty days after the date 
on which the amendment or registration statement is filed, Provided, 
that the Commission, having due regard to the public interest and the 
protection of investors, may declare an amendment or registration 
statement filed under this paragraph (a) effective on an earlier date.

section, a

chapter, shall become effective on the date on which it is filed with 
the Commission, or a later date designated by the registrant on the 
facing sheet of the amendment or registration statement, which date 
shall be not later than thirty days after the date on which the 
amendment or registration statement is filed, except that a post-
effective amendment including a designation of a new effective date 
under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section shall become effective on 
the new effective date designated therein, Provided, that the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) It is filed for no purpose other than one or more of the 
following:
    (i) Registering additional shares of common stock for which a 
registration statement filed on Form N-2 (Secs. 239.14 and 274.11a-1 of 
this chapter) is effective;
    (ii) Bringing the financial statements up to date under section 
10(a)(3) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)] or rule 3-18 of Regulation S-X 
[17 CFR 210.3-18];
    (iii) Designating a new effective date for a previously filed post-
effective amendment or registration statement for additional shares 
under paragraph (a) of this section, which has not yet become effective, 
Provided, that the new effective date shall be no earlier than the 
effective date designated in the previously filed amendment or 
registration statement under paragraph (a) of this section and no later 
than thirty days after that date;
    (iv) Disclosing or updating the information required by Item 9c of 
Form N-2 [17 CFR 239.14 and 274.11a-1];
    (v) Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems 
appropriate; and
    (vi) Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.
    (2) The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for 
one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the 
prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) or one for which 
the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this 
section, has occurred since the latest of the following three dates:
    (i) the effective date of the registrant's registration statement;
    (ii) the effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment 
to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or
    (iii) the filing date of a post-effective amendment or registration

    (3) The amendment or registration statement recites on the facing

(b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature 
page of the post-effective amendment or registration statement that the 
amendment or registration statement meets all of the requirements for 
effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section. If counsel prepared 
or reviewed the post-effective amendment or registration statement filed 
under paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the 
Commission at the time the amendment or registration statement is filed 
a written representation that the amendment or registration statement 
does not contain disclosure which would render it ineligible to become 
effective under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) Incomplete or Inaccurate Amendments; Suspension of Use of 
Paragraph (b) of this section. (1) No amendment or registration 
statement shall become effective under paragraph (a) of this section if, 
prior to the effective date of the amendment or registration statement, 
it should appear to the Commission that the amendment or registration 
statement may be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, and 
the Commission furnishes to the registrant written notice that the 
effective date of the amendment or registration statement is to be 
suspended. Following such action by the Commission,

[[Page 544]]

the registrant may file with the Commission at any time a petition for 
review of the suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the 
matter if a request for such a hearing is included in the petition. If 
the Commission has suspended the effective date of an amendment or 
registration statement, the amendment or registration statement shall 
become effective on such date as the Commission may determine, having 
due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.
    (2) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in this paragraph (c)(2), suspend the ability of a registrant 
to file a post-effective amendment or registration statement under 
paragraph (b) of this section. The notice of such suspension shall be in 
writing and shall specify the period for which such suspension shall 
remain in effect. The Commission may issue a suspension if it appears to 
the Commission that a registrant which files a post-effective amendment 
under paragraph (b) of this section has not complied with the conditions 
of that paragraph. Any suspension under this paragraph shall become 
effective at such time as the Commission furnishes written notice 
thereof to the company. Any such suspension, so long as it is in effect, 
shall apply to any post-effective amendment or registration statement 
that has been filed but has not, at the time of such suspension, become 
effective, and to any post-effective amendment or registration statement 
that may be filed after the suspension. Any suspension shall apply only 
to the ability to file a post-effective amendment or registration 
statement under paragraph (b) of this section and shall not otherwise 
affect any post-effective amendment or registration statement. Following 
this action by the Commission, the registrant may file with the 
Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The 
Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for a hearing 
is included in the petition.
    (d) Subsequent Amendments. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, a post-effective amendment or registration 
statement which includes a prospectus shall not become effective under 
paragraph (a) of this section if a subsequent post-effective amendment 
or registration statement relating to the prospectus is filed before 
such amendment or registration statement becomes effective.
    (2) A post-effective amendment or registration statement which 
includes a prospectus shall become effective under paragraph (a) of this 
section notwithstanding the filing of a subsequent post-effective 
amendment or registration statement relating to the prospectus, 
Provided, that the following conditions are met:
    (i) The subsequent amendment or registration statement is filed 
under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (ii) The subsequent amendment or registration statement designates 
as its effective date either:
    (A) The date on which the prior post-effective amendment or 
registration statement was to become effective under paragraph (a) of 
this section or
    (B) A new effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section.

In this case the prior post-effective amendment or registration 
statement filed under paragraph (a) of this section and any prior post-
effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (b) 
of this section shall also become effective on the new effective date 
designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, if 
another post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to 
the same prospectus is filed under paragraph (a) of this section before 
the prior amendments or registration statements filed under paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section have become effective, none of such prior 
amendments or registration statements shall become effective under this 
section.
    (e) Condition to Use of Paragraphs (a) or (b). A post-effective 
amendment or new registration statement shall not become effective under 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section unless within two years prior to

    (f) Electronic Filers. (1) When ascertaining the date of filing, 
electronic filers should not presume a registration statement has been 
accepted until notice of acceptance has been received from the

financial information (the Financial Data Schedule) that may be 
required.
    Note: To determine the date of automatic effectiveness, the day 
following the filing date is the first day of the time period. For 
example, a post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (a) of this 
section on November 1 would become effective on December 31.

Sec. 230.487  Effectiveness of registration statements filed by certain unit investment trusts.

    (a)(1) A unit investment trust registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 that files a registration statement pursuant to the 
Act in connection with the offering of the securities of a series of the 
unit investment trust, except the first series of such trust, may 
designate a date and time for such registration statement to become 
effective. If the registrant complies with the conditions set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the registration statement shall become 
effective in accordance with such designation.
    (2) The registrant may designate the date and time of effectiveness 
in the registration statement or in any pre-effective amendment thereto. 
A pre-effective amendment to a registration statement with respect to 
which such a designation is properly made shall be deemed to have been 
filed with the consent of the Commission and shall accordingly be 
treated as part of the registration statement.
    (b) Availability of effectiveness of a registration statement in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section is conditioned upon 
compliance with the following:
    (1) The registrant is not engaged in the business of investing in 
securities issued by one or more open-end management investment 
companies;
    (2) The designation provided for in paragraph (a) of this section is 
set forth on the facing sheet of such registration statement or a pre-
effective amendment thereto;
    (3) The registrant identifies one or more previous series of the 
trust for which the effective date of the registration statement was 
determined by the Commission or its staff, and makes the following 
representations:
    (i) That the portfolio securities deposited in the series with 
respect to which the registration statement or pre-effective amendment 
is being filed do not differ materially in type or quality from those 
deposited in such previous series identified by the registrant; and
    (ii) That, except to the extent necessary to identify the specific 
portfolio securities deposited in, and to provide essential financial 
information for, the series with respect to which the registration 
statement or pre-effective amendment thereto is being filed, the 
registration statement or pre-effective amendment thereto does not 
contain disclosures that differ in any material respect from those 
contained in the registration statement of such previous series 
identified by the registrant;
    (4) The registrant represents that it has complied with rule 460 
under the Act (17 CFR 230.460);
    (5) The identification and representations provided for in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section are made on the signature 
page of the registration statement or a pre-effective amendment thereto; 
and
    (6) If counsel prepared or reviewed such registration statement or a 
pre-effective amendment thereto, such counsel shall furnish to the 
Commission at the time the registration statement or pre-effective 
amendment thereto is filed a written representation that such 
registration statement or pre-effective amendment does not contain 
disclosures which would render such registration statement ineligible to 
become effective pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c)(1) The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances 
set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, suspend the ability of a 
unit investment trust to designate the date

[[Page 546]]

and time of effectiveness of a series of such trust. Any such 
suspension, so long as it is in effect, shall apply to any registration 
statement that has been filed but has not, at the time of such 
suspension, become effective, and to any registration statement with 
respect to any series of such trust that may be filed after such 
suspension. Any suspension shall apply only to the ability to designate 
the date and time of effectiveness pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section and shall not otherwise affect any registration statement.
    (2) Any suspension pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall become effective at such time as the Commission furnishes written 
notice thereof to the company or the sponsor of the unit investment 
trust. The notice of such suspension shall be in writing and shall 
specify the period for which such suspension shall remain in effect. The 
Commission may issue such suspension if it appears to the Commission 
that any registration statement containing a designation pursuant to 
this section is incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, 
whether or not such registration statement has become effective, or that 
the registrant has not complied with the conditions of this section. 
Following such action by the Commission, the registrant may file with 
the Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The 
Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for a hearing 
is included in the petition.
    (d)(1) When ascertaining the date of filing, electronic filers 
should not presume a registration statement has been accepted until 
notice of acceptance has been received from the Commission.
    (2) Attention is directed to the requirements of the relevant 
registration statement form and rule 483 under the Securities Act of 
1933 (Sec. 230.483 of this chapter) concerning certain items of 
financial information (the Financial Data Schedule) that may be 
required.

written notice that the effective date is to be suspended. Following 
such action by the Commission, the registrant may file with the 
Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The 
Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for such a 
hearing is included in the petition. If the Commission has suspended the 
effective date of the registration statement, it shall become effective 
on such date as the Commission may determine, having due regard to the

Further information, particularly financial information, is contained in 
the registration statement filed with the Commission and in a more 
complete prospectus which must be furnished to each purchaser and is 
obtainable from the following persons:
    (Insert names.)

    (e) If the registrant or any of the underwriters knows or has 
reasonable grounds to believe that it is intended to stablize the price 
of any security to facilitate the offering of the registered security, 
there shall be placed in the newspaper prospectus, in capital letters, 
the statement required by Item 502(d) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.502(d) 
of this chapter) to be included in the full prospectus.

sources, the amounts and the sources thereof:
    (5) A brief statement as to the amount of funded and floating debt

    (9) Underwriting discounts and commissions per unit and in the 
aggregate.
    (g) A newspaper prospectus may also include, in condensed, 
summarized or graphic form, additional information the substance of 
which is contained in the registration statement. A newspaper prospectus 
shall not contain any information the substance of which is not set 
forth in the registration statement.
    (h) All information included in a newspaper prospectus shall be set 
forth in type at least as large as seven-point modern type: Provided, 
however, That such information shall not be so arranged as to be 
misleading or obscure the information required to be included in such a 
prospectus.
    (i) Five copies of every proposed newspaper prospectus, in the size 
and form in which it is intended to be published shall be filed with the 
Commission at least three business days before definitive copies thereof 
are submitted to the newspaper, magazine or other periodical for

such item is inapplicable, or the answer thereto is in the negative, a

required to be included in Parts A and B shall also be filed as part of 
the registration statement proper, unless incorporated by reference

<R05>
Sec. 230.498   Profiles for certain open-end management investment companies.

    (a) Definitions. (1) A Fund means an open-end management investment 
company, or any series of such a company, that has, or is included in, 
an effective registration statement on Form N-1A (Secs. 274.11A and 
239.15A of this chapter) and that has a current prospectus under section 
10(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(a)).
    (2) A Profile means a summary prospectus that is authorized under 
section 10(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(b)) and section 24(g) of the 
Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(g) for the purpose of section 
5(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1)).
    (b) General requirements. A Fund may provide a Profile to investors, 
which may include, or be accompanied by, an application that investors 
may use to purchase the Fund's shares, if the Profile contains the 
information required or not precluded by paragraph (c) of this section 
and does not incorporate any information by reference to another 
document.

Instructions to paragraph (b): 1. The Profile is intended to be a 
standardized summary of key information in the Fund's prospectus

[[Page 553]]

under section 10(b) of the Act. Additional information is available in 
the Fund's prospectus under section 10(a) of the Act, in the Fund's 
Statement of Additional Information under Form N-1A, and in the Fund's 
annual and semi-annual shareholder reports prepared in accordance with 
Sec. 270.30d-1. Funds may not use cross-references in the Profile to 
other Fund disclosure documents unless required or permitted by this 
rule. Funds should minimize cross-references and the use of footnotes 
within the Profile; cross-references and footnotes should generally be 
used only to promote a better understanding of the information about the 
Fund contained in the Profile.
    2. Provide clear and concise information in the Profile in a format 
designed to communicate the information effectively. Avoid excessive 
detail, technical or legal terms, and long sentences and paragraphs. 
Provide the information in the Profile using the plain English writing 
principles in Sec. 230.421(d).
    3. A Fund may use document design techniques intended to promote 
effective communication of the information in the Profile unless 
inconsistent with the requirements of this section.
    4. A Profile may describe more than one Fund or class of a Fund. A 
Profile that offers the securities of more than one Fund or class of a 
Fund does not need to repeat information that is the same for each Fund 
or class of Fund described in the Profile.
    5. File the Profile with the Commission as required by 
Sec. 230.497(k).

    (c) Specific requirements. (1) Include on the cover page of the 
Profile or at the beginning of the Profile:
    (i) The Fund's name and, at the Fund's option, the Fund's investment 
objective or the type of fund or class offered, or both;
    (ii) A statement identifying the document as a ``Profile,'' without 
using the term ``prospectus'';
    (iii) The approximate date of the Profile's first use;
    (iv) The following legend:

    This Profile summarizes key information about the Fund that is 
included in the Fund's prospectus. The Fund's prospectus includes 
additional information about the Fund, including a more detailed 
description of the risks associated with investing in the Fund that you 
may want to consider before you invest. You may obtain the prospectus 
and other information about the Fund at no cost by calling __________.

    (v) Provide a toll-free (or collect) telephone number that investors 
can use to obtain the prospectus and other information. The Fund may 
indicate, as applicable, that the prospectus and other information is 
available on the Fund's Internet site or by E-mail request. The Fund 
also may indicate, if applicable, that the prospectus and other 
information is available from a financial intermediary (such as a 
broker-dealer or bank) through which shares of the Fund may be purchased 
or sold.

    Instruction to Paragraph (c)(1)(v): When the Fund (or financial 
intermediary through which shares of the Fund may be purchased or sold) 
receives a request for the Fund's prospectus, the Fund's Statement of 
Additional Information, or the Fund's annual or semi-annual report, the 
Fund (or financial intermediary) must send the requested document within 
three business days of receipt of the request, by first-class mail or 
other means designed to ensure equally prompt delivery. Funds are 
encouraged to send other information requested by shareholders within 
the same period.

    (2) Provide the information required by paragraphs (c)(2) (i) 
through (ix) of this section in the order indicated:
    (i) Fund objectives/goals. Provide the information about the Fund's 
investment objectives or goals required by Item 2(a) of Form N-1A.
    (ii) Principal investment strategies of the Fund. Provide the 
information about the Fund's principal investment strategies required by 
Item 2(b) of Form N-1A. In addition, a Fund (other than a Fund that has 
not yet been required to deliver a semi-annual or annual report under 
Sec. 270.30d-1 of this chapter) must provide disclosure to the following 
effect:

    Additional information about the Fund's investments is available in 
the Fund's annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders. In the Fund's 
annual report you will find a discussion of the market conditions and 
investment strategies that significantly affected the Fund's performance 
during the last fiscal year. You may obtain either or both of these 
reports at no cost by calling ______________.

    (iii) Principal risks of investing in the Fund. Provide the 
narrative disclosure, bar chart, and table required by Item 2(c) of Form 
N-1A. Provide in the table the Fund's average annual total returns and, 
if applicable, yield as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter 
prior to the Profile's first use. Update the return information as of 
the

[[Page 554]]

end of each succeeding calendar quarter as soon as practicable after the 
completion of the quarter. Disclose the date of the return information 
adjacent to the table.

    Instruction to Paragraph (c)(2)(iii): A Fund may reflect the updated 
performance information in this section of the profile by affixing a 
label or sticker, or by other reasonable means.

    (iv) Fees and expenses of the Fund. Include the fee table required 
by Item 3 of Form N-1A.
    (v) Investment adviser, sub-adviser(s) and portfolio manager(s) of 
the Fund. (A) Identify the Fund's investment adviser.
    (B) Identify the Fund's sub-adviser(s) (if any) except that:
    (1) A Fund need not identify a sub-adviser(s) whose sole 
responsibility for the Fund is limited to day-to-day management of the 
Fund's holdings of cash and cash equivalent instruments, unless the Fund 
is a money market fund or other Fund with a principal investment 
strategy of regularly holding cash and cash equivalent instruments.
    (2) A Fund having three or more sub-advisers, each of which manages 
a portion of the Fund's portfolio, need not identify each such sub-
adviser, except that the Fund must identify any sub-adviser that is (or 
is reasonably expected to be) responsible for the management of a 
significant portion of the Fund's net assets. For purposes of this 
paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B)(2), a significant portion of a Fund's net assets 
generally will be deemed to be 30% or more of the fund's net assets.
    (C) State the name and length of service of the person or persons 
employed by or associated with the Fund's investment adviser (or the 
Fund) who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the 
Fund's portfolio and summarize each person's business experience for the 
last five years in accordance with the Instructions to Item 6(a)(2) of 
Form N-1A. A Fund with three or more such persons, each of whom is (or 
is reasonably expected to be) responsible for the management of a 
portion of the Fund's portfolio, need not identify each person, except 
that a Fund must identify and summarize the business experience for the 
last five years of each person who is (or is reasonably expected to be) 
responsible for the management of a significant portion of the Fund's 
net assets. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C), a significant 
portion of a Fund's net assets generally will be deemed to be 30% or 
more of the Fund's net assets.
    (vi) Purchase of Fund shares. Disclose the Fund's minimum initial or 
subsequent investment requirements, the initial sales load (or other 
loads) to which the Fund's shares are subject, and, if applicable, the 
initial sales load breakpoints or waivers.
    (vii) Sale of Fund shares. Disclose that the Fund's shares are 
redeemable, identify the procedures for redeeming shares (e.g., on any 
business day by written request, telephone, or wire transfer), and 
identify any charges or sales loads that may be assessed upon redemption 
(including, if applicable, the existence of waivers of these charges).
    (viii) Fund distributions and tax information. Describe how 
frequently the Fund intends to make distributions and what options for 
reinvestment of distributions (if any) are available to investors. 
State, as applicable, that the Fund intends to make distributions that 
may be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains (which may be taxable 
at different rates depending on the length of time that the Fund holds 
its assets) or that the Fund intends to distribute tax-exempt income. If 
a Fund expects that its distributions, as a result of its investment 
objectives or strategies, primarily will consist of ordinary income or 
capital gains, provide disclosure to that effect. For a Fund that holds 
itself out as investing in securities generating tax-exempt income, 
provide, as applicable, a general statement to the effect that a portion 
of the Fund's distributions may be subject to federal income tax.
    (ix) Other services are available from the Fund. Provide a brief 
summary of services available to the Fund's shareholders (e.g., any 
exchange privileges or automated information services), unless otherwise 
disclosed in response to paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) through (viii) of this 
section.


[[Page 555]]


    Instruction to Paragraph (c)(2)(ix): A Fund should disclose only 
those services that generally are available to typical investors in the 
Fund.

    (3) The Profile may include an application that a prospective 
investor can use to purchase the Fund's shares as long as the 
application explains with equal prominence that an investor has the 
option of purchasing shares of the Fund after reviewing the information 
in the Profile or after requesting and reviewing the Fund's prospectus 
(and other information) before making a decision about investing in the 
Fund.

    Instruction to Paragraph (c)(3): A Fund may include the application 
in a Profile or otherwise provide an application together with a Profile 
in any manner reasonably designed to alert investors that the 
application is to be considered along with the information about the 
Fund disclosed in the Profile.

    (d) Modified Profile for certain funds. (1) A Fund may modify or 
omit the information required by paragraphs (c)(2) (vi) through (ix) of 
this section for a Profile to be used for a Fund that is offered as an 
investment option for:
    (i) A defined contribution plan that meets the requirements for 
qualification under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 
U.S.C. 401(k));
    (ii) A tax-deferred arrangement under section 403(b) or 457 of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 403(b) and 457); and
    (iii) Variable contracts as defined in section 817(d) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 817(d)).
    (2) A Fund that uses a Profile permitted under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section may:
    (i) Alter the legend required by paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this 
section to include a statement to the effect that the Profile is 
intended for use in connection with a defined contribution plan, another 
tax-deferred arrangement, or a variable contract, as applicable, and is 
not intended for use by other investors; and
    (ii) Modify other disclosure in a Profile consistent with offering 
the Fund as a specific investment option for a defined contribution 
plan, tax-deferred arrangement, or variable contract.
    (3) A Profile used under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii), but not 
paragraph (d)(1)(iii), of this section may include, or be accompanied 
by, an enrollment form for the plan or arrangement. The enrollment form 
does not need to be filed with the Profile under Sec. 230.497.

 Regulation D--Rules Governing the Limited Offer and Sale of Securities 
          Without Registration Under the Securities Act of 1933

    Authority: Sections 230.501 to 230.506 issued under secs. 3(b), 
4(2), 19(a), 19(c), 48 Stat. 75, 77, 85; sec. 209, 48 Stat. 908; c.122, 
59 Stat. 167; sec. 12, 78 Stat. 580; 84 Stat. 1480; sec. 308(a)(2), 90 
Stat. 57; sec. 18, 92 Stat. 275; sec. 2, 92 Stat. 962; secs. 505, 622, 
701, 94 Stat. 2291, 2292, 2294 15 U.S.C. 77c(b), 77d(2), 77s(a), 77s(c).

    Source: Sections 230.501 to 230.506 appear at 47 FR 11262, Mar. 16, 
1982, unless otherwise noted.
    Preliminary Notes: 1. The following rules relate to transactions 
exempted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq., as amended). 
Such transactions are not exempt from the antifraud, civil liability, or 
other provisions of the federal securities laws. Issuers are reminded of 
their obligation to provide such further material information, if any, 
as may be necessary to make the information required under this 
regulation, in light of the circumstances under which it is furnished, 
not misleading.
    2. Nothing in these rules obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of securities. 
Regulation D is intended to be a basic element in a uniform system of 
Federal-State limited offering exemptions consistent with the provisions 
of sections 18 and 19(c) of the Act. In those states that have adopted 
Regulation D, or any version of Regulation D, special attention should 
be directed to the applicable state laws and regulations, including 
those relating to registration of person who receive remuneration in 
connection with the offer and sale of securities, to disqualification of 
issuers and other persons associated with offerings based on state 
administrative orders or judgments, and to requirements for filings of 
notices of sales.
    3. Attempted compliance with any rule in Regulation D does not act 
as an exclusive election; the issuer can also claim the availability of 
any other applicable exemption. For instance, an issuer's failure to 
satisfy all the terms and conditions of Rule 506 shall not raise any 
presumption that the exemption provided by section 4(2) of the Act is 
not available.

[[Page 556]]

    4. These rules are available only to the issuer of the securities 
and not to any affiliate of that issuer or to any other person for 
resales of the issuer's securities. The rules provide an exemption only 
for the transactions in which the securities are offered or sold by the 
issuer, not for the securities themselves.
    5. These rules may be used for business combinations that involve 
sales by virtue of rule 145(a) (17 CFR 230.145(a)) or otherwise.
    6. In view of the objectives of these rules and the policies 
underlying the Act, regulation D is not available to any issuer for any 
transaction or chain of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with these rules, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under 
the Act is required.
    7. Securities offered and sold outside the United States in 
accordance with Regulation S need not be registered under the Act. See 
Release No. 33-6863. Regulation S may be relied upon for such offers and 
sales even if coincident offers and sales are made in accordance with 
Regulation D inside the United States. Thus, for example, persons who 
are offered and sold securities in accordance with Regulation S would 
not be counted in the calculation of the number of purchasers under 
Regulation D. Similarly, proceeds from such sales would not be included 
in the aggregate offering price. The provisions of this note, however, 
do not apply if the issuer elects to rely solely on Regulation D for 
offers or sales to persons made outside the United States.

the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 if the investment

    (6) Any natural person who had an individual income in excess of 
$200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that

the sum of all cash, services, property, notes, cancellation of debt, or 
other consideration to be received by an issuer for issuance of its

price at which the securities are offered for cash. Any portion of the 
aggregate offering price attributable to cash received in a foreign 
currency shall be translated into United States currency at the currency 
exchange rate in effect at a reasonable time prior to or on the date of 
the sale of the securities. If securities are not offered for cash, the 
aggregate offering price shall be based on the value of the 
consideration as established by bona fide sales of that consideration 
made within a reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair 
value as determined by an accepted standard. Such valuations of non-cash 
consideration must be reasonable at the time made.
    (d) Business combination. Business combination shall mean any 
transaction of the type specified in paragraph (a) of Rule 145 under the 
Act (17 CFR 230.145) and any transaction involving the acquisition by 
one issuer, in exchange for all or a part of its own or its parent's 
stock, of stock of another issuer if, immediately after the acquisition, 
the acquiring issuer has control of the other issuer (whether or not it 
had control before the acquisition).
    (e) Calculation of number of purchasers. For purposes of calculating 
the number of purchasers under Secs. 230.505(b) and 230.506(b) only, the 
following shall apply:

this section collectively have more than 50 percent of the beneficial 
interest (excluding contingent interests);
    (iii) Any corporation or other organization of which a purchaser and 
any of the persons related to him as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section collectively are beneficial owners of more 
than 50 percent of the equity securities (excluding directors' 
qualifying shares) or equity interests; and
    (iv) Any accredited investor.
    (2) A corporation, partnership or other entity shall be counted as 
one purchaser. If, however, that entity is organized for the specific 
purpose of acquiring the securities offered and is not an accredited 
investor under paragraph (a)(8) of this section, then each beneficial 
owner of equity securities or equity interests in the entity shall count 
as a separate purchaser for all provisions of Regulation D 
(Secs. 230.501-230.508), except to the extent provided in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (3) A non-contributory employee benefit plan within the meaning of 
Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be 
counted as one purchaser where the trustee makes all investment 
decisions for the plan.
    (f) Executive officer. Executive officer shall mean the president, 
any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division or 
function (such as sales, administration orfinance), any other officer 
who performs a policy making function, or any other person who performs 
similar policy making functions for the issuer. Executive officers of 
subsidiaries may be deemed executive officers of the issuer if they 
perform such policy making functions for the issuer.
    (g) Issuer. The definition of the term issuer in section 2(4) of the 
Act shall apply, except that in the case of a proceeding under the 
Federal Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 101 et seq.), the trustee

[[Page 558]]

or debtor in possession shall be considered the issuer in an offering 
under a plan or reorganization, if the securities are to be issued under 
the plan.
    (h) Purchaser representative. Purchaser representative shall mean 
any person who satisfies all of the following conditions or who the 
issuer reasonably believes satisfies all of the following conditions:
    (1) Is not an affiliate, director, officer or other employee of the 
issuer, or beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of any class of the 
equity securities or 10 percent or more of the equity interest in the 
issuer, except where the purchaser is:
    (i) A relative of the purchaser representative by blood, marriage or 
adoption and not more remote than a first cousin;
    (ii) A trust or estate in which the purchaser representative and any 
persons related to him as specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or 
(h)(1)(iii) of this section collectively have more than 50 percent of 
the beneficial interest (excluding contingent interest) or of which the 
purchaser representative serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar 
capacity; or
    (iii) A corporation or other organization of which the purchaser 
representative and any persons related to him as specified in paragraph 
(h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this section collectively are the beneficial 
owners of more than 50 percent of the equity securities (excluding 
directors' qualifying shares) or equity interests;
    (2) Has such knowledge and experience in financial and business 
matters that he is capable of evaluating, alone, or together with other 
purchaser representatives of the purchaser, or together with the 
purchaser, the merits and risks of the prospective investment;
    (3) Is acknowledged by the purchaser in writing, during the course 
of the transaction, to be his purchaser representative in connection 
with evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment; and
    (4) Discloses to the purchaser in writing a reasonable time prior to 
the sale of securities to that purchaser any material relationship 
between himself or his affiliates and the issuer or its affiliates that 
then exists, that is mutually understood to be contemplated, or that has 
existed at any time during the previous two years, and any compensation 
received or to be received as a result of such relationship.
    Note 1: A person acting as a purchaser representative should 
consider the applicability of the registration and antifraud provisions 
relating to brokers and dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (Exchange Act) (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., as amended) and relating to 
investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
    Note 2: The acknowledgment required by paragraph (h)(3) and the 
disclosure required by paragraph (h)(4) of this section must be made 
with specific reference to each prospective investment. Advance blanket 
acknowledgment, such as for all securities transactions or all private 
placements, is not sufficient.
    Note 3: Disclosure of any material relationships between the 
purchaser representative or his affiliates and the issuer or its 
affiliates does not relieve the purchaser representative of his 
obligation to act in the interest of the purchaser.

<R05>
Sec. 230.502  General conditions to be met.

    The following conditions shall be applicable to offers and sales 
made under Regulation D (Secs. 230.501-230.508):
    (a) Integration. All sales that are part of the same Regulation D 
offering must meet all of the terms and conditions of Regulation D. 
Offers and sales that are made more than six months before the start of 
a Regulation D offering or are made more than six months after 
completion of a Regulation D offering will not be considered part of 
that Regulation D offering, so long as during those six month periods 
there are no offers or sales of securities by or for the issuer that are 
of the same or a similar class as those offered or sold under Regulation 
D, other than those offers or sales of securities under an employee 
benefit plan as defined in rule 405 under the Act (17 CFR 230.405).
    Note: The term offering is not defined in the Act or in Regulation 
D. If the issuer offers or sells securities for which the safe harbor 
rule in paragraph (a) of this Sec. 230.502 is unavailable, the 
determination as to whether separate sales of securities are part of the 
same offering (i.e. are considered integrated)

[[Page 559]]

depends on the particular facts and circumstances. Generally, 
transactions otherwise meeting the requirements of an exemption will not 
be integrated with simultaneous offerings being made outside the United 
States in compliance with Regulation S. See Release No. 33-6863.
    The following factors should be considered in determining whether 
offers and sales should be integrated for purposes of the exemptions 
under Regulation D:
    (a) Whether the sales are part of a single plan of financing;
    (b) Whether the sales involve issuance of the same class of 
securities;
    (c) Whether the sales have been made at or about the same time;
    (d) Whether the same type of consideration is being received; and
    (e) Whether the sales are made for the same general purpose.

See Release 33-4552 (November 6, 1962) [27 FR 11316].

    (b) Information requirements--(1) When information must be 
furnished. If the issuer sells securities under Sec. 230.505 or 
Sec. 230.506 to any purchaser that is not an accredited investor, the 
issuer shall furnish the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section to such purchaser a reasonable time prior to sale. The 
issuer is not required to furnish the specified information to 
purchasers when it sells securities under Sec. 230.504, or to any 
accredited investor.
    Note: When an issuer provides information to investors pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1), it should consider providing such information to 
accredited investors as well, in view of the anti-fraud provisions of 
the federal securities laws.

    (2) Type of information to be furnished. (i) If the issuer is not 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities the 
issuer shall furnish to the purchaser, to the extent material to an 
understanding of the issuer, its business and the securities being 
offered:
    (A) Non-financial statement information. If the issuer is eligible 
to use Regulation A (Sec. 230.251-263), the same kind of information as 
would be required in Part II of Form 1-A (Sec. 239.90 of this chapter). 
If the issuer is not eligible to use Regulation A, the same kind of 
information as required in Part I of a registration statement filed 
under the Securities Act on the form that the issuer would be entitled 
to use.
    (B) Financial statement information. (1) Offerings up to $2,000,000. 
The information required in Item 310 of Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.310 of 
this chapter), except that only the issuer's balance sheet, which shall 
be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must be audited.
    (2) Offerings up to $7,500,000. The financial statement information 
required in Form SB-2 (Sec. 239.10 of this chapter). If an issuer, other 
than a limited partnership, cannot obtain audited financial statements 
without unreasonable effort or expense, then only the issuer's balance 
sheet, which shall be dated within 120 days of the start of the 
offering, must be audited. If the issuer is a limited partnership and 
cannot obtain the required financial statements without unreasonable 
effort or expense, it may furnish financial statements that have been 
prepared on the basis of Federal income tax requirements and examined 
and reported on in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards 
by an independent public or certified accountant.
    (3) Offerings over $7,500,000. The financial statement as would be 
required in a registration statement filed under the Act on the form 
that the issuer would be entitled to use. If an issuer, other than a 
limited partnership, cannot obtain audited financial statements without 
unreasonable effort or expense, then only the issuer's balance sheet, 
which shall be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must 
be audited. If the issuer is a limited partnership and cannot obtain the 
required financial statements without unreasonable effort or expense, it 
may furnish financial statements that have been prepared on the basis of 
Federal income tax requirements and examined and reported on in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent 
public or certified accountant.
    (C) If the issuer is a foreign private issuer eligible to use Form 
20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter), the issuer shall disclose the same 
kind of information required to be included in a registration statement 
filed under the Act on the form that the issuer would

[[Page 560]]

be entitled to use. The financial statements need be certified only to 
the extent required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) (B) (1), (2) or (3) of this 
section, as appropriate.
    (ii) If the issuer is subject to the reporting requirements of 
section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, at a reasonable time prior to 
the sale of securities the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser the 
information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, 
and in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) 
of this section:
    (A) The issuer's annual report to shareholders for the most recent 
fiscal year, if such annual report meets the requirements of 
Sec. 240.14a-3 or 240.14c-3 under the Exchange Act, the definitive proxy 
statement filed in connection with that annual report, and, if requested 
by the purchaser in writing, a copy of the issuer's most recent Form 10-
K and Form 10-KSB (17 CFR 249.310) under the Exchange Act.
    (B) The information contained in an annual report on Form 10-K 
(Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) or 10-KSB (Sec. 249.310b of this chapter) 
under the Exchange Act or in a registration statement on Form S-1 
(Sec. 239.11 of this chapter), SB-1 (Sec. 239.9 of this chapter), SB-2 
(Sec. 239.10 of this chapter) or S-11 (Sec. 239.18 of this chapter) 
under the Act or on Form 10 (Sec. 249.210 of this chapter) or Form 10-SB 
(Sec. 249.210b of this chapter) under the Exchange Act, whichever filing 
is the most recent required to be filed.
    (C) The information contained in any reports or documents required 
to be filed by the issuer under sections 13(a), 14(a), 14(c), and 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act since the distribution or filing of the report or 
registration statement specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) or (B), 
and a brief description of the securities being offered, the use of the 
proceeds from the offering, and any material changes in the issuer's 
affairs that are not disclosed in the documents furnished.
    (D) If the issuer is a foreign private issuer, the issuer may 
provide in lieu of the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (A) 
or (B) of this section, the information contained in its most recent 
filing on Form 20-F or Form F-1 (Sec. 239.31 of the chapter).
    (iii) Exhibits required to be filed with the Commission as part of a 
registration statement or report, other than an annual report to 
shareholders or parts of that report incorporated by reference in a Form 
10-K and Form 10-KSB report, need not be furnished to each purchaser 
that is not an accredited investor if the contents of material exhibits 
are identified and such exhibits are made available to a purchaser, upon 
his written request, a reasonable time prior to his purchase.
    (iv) At a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities to any 
purchaser that is not an accredited investor in a transaction under 
Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506, the issuer shall furnish to the purchaser 
a brief description in writing of any material written information 
concerning the offering that has been provided by the issuer to any 
accredited investor but not previously delivered to such unaccredited 
purchaser. The issuer shall furnish any portion or all of this 
information to the purchaser, upon his written request a reasonable time 
prior to his purchase.
    (v) The issuer shall also make available to each purchaser at a 
reasonable time prior to his purchase of securities in a transaction 
under Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506 the opportunity to ask questions and 
receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and 
to obtain any additional information which the issuer possesses or can 
acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to 
verify the accuracy of information furnished under paragraph (b)(2) (i) 
or (ii) of this section.
    (vi) For business combinations or exchange offers, in addition to 
information required by Form S-4 (17 CFR 239.25), the issuer shall 
provide to each purchaser at the time the plan is submitted to security 
holders, or, with an exchange, during the course of the transaction and 
prior to sale, written information about any terms or arrangements of 
the proposed transactions that are materially different from those for 
all other security holders. For purposes of this subsection, an issuer 
which is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act may satisfy the requirements of Part I.B. or 
C. of

[[Page 561]]

Form S-4 by compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this Sec. 230.502.
    (vii) At a reasonable time prior to the sale of securities to any 
purchaser that is not an accredited investor in a transaction under 
Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506, the issuer shall advise the purchaser of 
the limitations on resale in the manner contained in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section. Such disclosure may be contained in other materials 
required to be provided by this paragraph.
    (c) Limitation on manner of offering. Except as provided in 
Sec. 230.504(b)(1), neither the issuer nor any person acting on its 
behalf shall offer or sell the securities by any form of general 
solicitation or general advertising, including, but not limited to, the 
following:
    (1) Any advertisement, article, notice or other communication 
published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over 
television or radio; and
    (2) Any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any 
general solicitation or general advertising;

Provided, however, that publication by an issuer of a notice in 
accordance with Sec. 230.135c shall not be deemed to constitute general 
solicitation or general advertising for purposes of this section; 
Provided further, that, if the requirements of Sec. 230.135e are 
satisfied, providing any journalist with access to press conferences 
held outside of the United States, to meetings with issuer or selling 
security holder representatives conducted outside of the United States, 
or to written press-related materials released outside the United 
States, at or in which a present or proposed offering of securities is 
discussed, will not be deemed to constitute general solicitation or 
general advertising for purposes of this section.
    (d) Limitations on resale. Except as provided in Sec. 230.504(b)(1), 
securities acquired in a transaction under Regulation D shall have the 
status of securities acquired in a transaction under section 4(2) of the 
Act and cannot be resold without registration under the Act or an 
exemption therefrom. The issuer shall exercise reasonable care to assure 
that the purchasers of the securities are not underwriters within the 
meaning of section 2(11) of the Act, which reasonable care may be 
demonstrated by the following:
    (1) Reasonable inquiry to determine if the purchaser is acquiring 
the securities for himself or for other persons;
    (2) Written disclosure to each purchaser prior to sale that the 
securities have not been registered under the Act and, therefore, cannot 
be resold unless they are registered under the Act or unless an 
exemption from registration is available; and
    (3) Placement of a legend on the certificate or other document that 
evidences the securities stating that the securities have not been 
registered under the Act and setting forth or referring to the 
restrictions on transferability and sale of the securities.

While taking these actions will establish the requisite reasonable care, 
it is not the exclusive method to demonstrate such care. Other actions 
by the issuer may satisfy this provision. In addition, 
Sec. 230.502(b)(2)(vii) requires the delivery of written disclosure of 
the limitations on resale to investors in certain instances.

    (a) An issuer offering or selling securities in reliance on 
Sec. 230.504, Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506 shall file with the 
Commission five copies of a notice on Form D (17 CFR 239.500) no later

    (b) One copy of every notice on Form D shall be manually signed by a

written request of its staff, the information furnished by the issuer 
under Sec. 230.502(b)(2) to any purchaser that is not an accredited 
investor.
    (d) Amendments to notices filed under paragraph (a) of this section 
need only report the issuer's name and the information required by Part 
C and

any material change in the facts from those set forth in Parts A and B.
    (e) A notice on Form D shall be considered filed with the Commission 
under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) As of the date on which it is received at the Commission's 
principal office in Washington, DC; or
    (2) As of the date on which the notice is mailed by means of United 
States registered or certified mail to the Commission's principal office 
in Washington, DC, if the notice is delivered to such office after the 
date on which it is required to be filed.

Sec. 230.504  Exemption for limited offerings and sales of securities not exceeding $1,000,000.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
conditions in paragraph (b) of this Sec. 230.504 by an issuer that is 
not:
    (1) Subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act,;
    (2) An investment company; or
    (3) A development stage company that either has no specific business 
plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in 
a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or 
other entity or person, shall be exempt from the provision of section 5 
of the Act under section 3(b) of the Act.
    (b) Conditions to be met. (1) General conditions. To qualify for 
exemption under this Sec. 230.504, offers and sales must satisfy the 
terms and conditions of Secs. 230.501 and 230.502 (a), (c) and (d), 
except that the provisions of Sec. 230.502 (c) and (d) will not apply to 
offers and sales of securities under this Sec. 230.504 that are made:
    (i) Exclusively in one or more states that provide for the 
registration of the securities, and require the public filing and 
delivery to investors of a substantive disclosure document before sale, 
and are made in accordance with those state provisions;
    (ii) In one or more states that have no provision for the 
registration of the securities or the public filing or delivery of a 
disclosure document before sale, if the securities have been registered 
in at least one state that provides for such registration, public filing 
and delivery before sale, offers and sales are made in that state in 
accordance with such provisions, and the disclosure document is 
delivered before sale to all purchasers (including those in the states 
that have no such procedure); or
    (iii) Exclusively according to state law exemptions from 
registration that permit general solicitation and general advertising so 
long as sales are made only to ``accredited investors'' as defined in 
Sec. 230.501(a).
    (2) The aggregate offering price for an offering of securities under 
this Sec. 230.504, as defined in Sec. 230.501(c), shall not exceed 
$1,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all securities sold 
within the twelve months before the start of and during the offering of 
securities under this Sec. 230.504, in reliance on any exemption under 
section 3(b), or in violation of section 5(a) of the Securities Act.
    Note 1: The calculation of the aggregate offering price is 
illustrated as follows:
    If an issuer sold $900,000 on June 1, 1987 under this Sec. 230.504 
and an additional $4,100,000 on December 1, 1987 under Sec. 230.505, the 
issuer could not sell any of its securities under this Sec. 230.504 
until December 1, 1988. Until then the issuer must count the December 1, 
1987 sale towards the $1,000,000 limit within the preceding twelve 
months.
    Note 2: If a transaction under Sec. 230.504 fails to meet the 
limitation on the aggregate offering price, it does not affect the 
availability of this Sec. 230.504 for the other transactions considered 
in applying such limitation. For example, if an issuer sold $1,000,000 
worth of its securities on January 1, 1988 under this Sec. 230.504 and 
an additional $500,000 worth on July 1, 1988, this Sec. 230.504 would 
not be available for the later sale, but would still be applicable to 
the January 1, 1988 sale.

<R05>
Sec. 230.505  Exemption for limited offers and sales of securities not exceeding $5,000,000.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
conditions in paragraph (b) of this section by an issuer that is not an 
investment company shall be exempt from the provisions of section 5 of 
the Act under section 3(b) of the Act.
    (b) Conditions to be met--(1) General conditions. To qualify for 
exemption under this section, offers and sales must satisfy the terms 
and conditions of Secs. 230.501 and 230.502.
    (2) Specific conditions--(i) Limitation on aggregate offering price. 
The aggregate offering price for an offering of securities under this 
Sec. 230.505, as defined in Sec. 203.501(c), shall not exceed 
$5,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all securities sold 
within the twelve months before the start of and during the offering of 
securities under this section in reliance on any exemption under section 
3(b) of the Act or in violation of section 5(a) of the Act.
    Note: The calculation of the aggregate offering price is illustrated 
as follows:
    Example 1: If an issuer sold $2,000,000 of its securities on June 1, 
1982 under this Sec. 230.505 and an additional $1,000,000 on September 
1, 1982, the issuer would be permitted to sell only $2,000,000 more 
under this Sec. 230.505 until June 1, 1983. Until that date the issuer 
must count both prior sales towards the $5,000,000 limit. However, if 
the issuer made its third sale on June 1, 1983, the issuer could then 
sell $4,000,000 of its securities because the June 1, 1982 sale would 
not be within the preceding twelve months.
    Example 2: If an issuer sold $500,000 of its securities on June 1, 
1982 under Sec. 230.504 and an additional $4,500,000 on December 1, 1982 
under this section, then the issuer could not sell any of its securities 
under this section until June 1, 1983. At that time it could sell an 
additional $500,000 of its securities.
    (ii) Limitation on number of purchasers. There are no more than or 
the issuer reasonably believes that there are no more than 35 purchasers 
of securities from the issuer in any offering under this section.
    (iii) Disqualifications. No exemption under this section shall be 
available for the securities of any issuer described in Sec. 230.262 of 
Regulation A, except that for purposes of this section only:
    (A) The term ``filing of the offering statement required by 
Sec. 230.252'' as used in Sec. 230.262(a), (b) and (c) shall mean the

to be transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning 
of section 4(2) of the Act.
    (b) Conditions to be met--(1) General conditions. To qualify for an 
exemption under this section, offers and sales must satisfy all the 
terms and conditions of Secs. 230.501 and 230.502.
    (2) Specific Conditions--(i) Limitation on number of purchasers. 
There are no more than or the issuer reasonably believes that there are

investor either alone or with his purchaser representative(s) has such 
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is 
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective 
investment, or the issuer reasonably believes immediately prior to 
making any sale that such purchaser comes within this description.

    (a) No exemption under Sec. 230.505, Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506 
shall be available for an issuer if such issuer, any of its predecessors 
or affiliates have been subject to any order, judgment, or decree of any 
court of competent jurisdiction temporarily, preliminary or permanently 
enjoining such person for failure to comply with Sec. 230.503.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if the Commission 
determines, upon a showing of good cause, that it is not necessary under 
the circumstances that the exemption be denied.

Sec. 230.508  Insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation D.

    (a) A failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement of 
Sec. 230.504, Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506 will not result in the loss 
of the exemption from the requirements of section 5 of the Act for any 
offer or sale to a particular individual or entity, if the person 
relying on the exemption shows:
    (1) The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or 
requirement directly intended to protect that particular individual or 
entity; and
    (2) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the 
offering as a whole, provided that any failure to comply with paragraph 
(c) of Sec. 230.502, paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 230.504, paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of Sec. 230.505 and paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
Sec. 230.506 shall be deemed to be significant to the offering as a 
whole; and
    (3) A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all 
applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Sec. 230.504, 
Sec. 230.505 or Sec. 230.506.
    (b) A transaction made in reliance on Sec. 230.504, Sec. 230.505 or 
Sec. 230.506 shall comply with all applicable terms, conditions and 
requirements of Regulation D. Where an exemption is established only 
through reliance upon paragraph (a) of this section, the failure to 
comply shall nonetheless be actionable by the Commission under section 
20 of the Act.

circumstances that it would normally have been received by him at or 
prior to the time of such written offer; and
    (2) No securities of such issuer shall be sold under Secs. 230.601 
to 230.610a unless such an offering circular is given to the person to 
whom the securities were sold, or is sent to such person under such 
circumstances that it would normally be received by him, with or prior 
to any confirmation of the sale, or prior to the payment by him of all 
or any part of the purchase price of the securities, whichever first 
occurs.
    (b) Any written advertisement or other written communication, or any 
radio or television broadcast, which states from whom an offering 
circular may be obtained and in addition contains no more than the

medium, issuers may satisfy legibility requirements applicable to 
printed documents by presenting all required information in a format 
readily communicated to investors.
    (d) If the offering is not completed within nine months from the 
date of the offering circular, a revised offering circular shall be 
prepared, filed and used in accordance with Secs. 230.601 to 230.610a as

circumstances then existing.
    (e) Four copies of the offering circular required by this section, 
which is to be used at the commencement of the offering, shall be filed

revised Preliminary Offering Circular or an offering circular of the 
type referred to in paragraph (f)(4) shall be furnished to all persons

by them 48 hours prior to their receipt of confirmation of the sale.

information required by this section to be included in an offering 
circular, or contains substantially that information except for the

investment advisers nor changed

[[Page 573]]

the basis on which the adviser was compensated during the most recent 
fiscal year. If the fee is paid in some manner other than on the basis 
of average net assets, briefly describe the basis of payment. If the 
registrant has not been in operation for a full fiscal year, state 
generally what the investment adviser's fee will be as a percentage of 
average net assets, including any breakpoints, but it is not necessary 
to include precise details as to how the fee is computed or paid.)

dilution makes it appropriate, the following shall be given: (1) the net 
tangible book value per share before and after the distribution; (2) the 
amount of the increase in such net tangible book value per share

Sec. Sec. 230.651--230.656  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 230.701  Exemption for offers and sales of securities pursuant to certain compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation.

    Preliminary Notes: 1. This section relates to transactions exempted 
from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
77e). These transactions are not exempt from the antifraud, civil 
liability, or other provisions of the federal securities laws. Issuers 
and persons acting on their behalf have an obligation to provide 
investors with disclosure adequate to satisfy the antifraud provisions 
of the federal securities laws.
    2. In addition to complying with this section, the issuer also must 
comply with any applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of 
securities.
    3. An issuer that attempts to comply with this section, but fails to 
do so, may claim any other exemption that is available.
    4. This section is available only to the issuer of the securities. 
Affiliates of the

[[Page 575]]

issuer may not use this section to offer or sell securities. This 
section also does not cover resales of securities by any person. This 
section provides an exemption only for the transactions in which the 
securities are offered or sold by the issuer, not for the securities 
themselves.
    5. The purpose of this section is to provide an exemption from the 
registration requirements of the Act for securities issued in 
compensatory circumstances. This section is not available for plans or 
schemes to circumvent this purpose, such as to raise capital. This 
section also is not available to exempt any transaction that is in 
technical compliance with this section but is part of a plan or scheme 
to evade the registration provisions of the Act. In any of these cases, 
registration under the Act is required unless another exemption is 
available.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales made in compliance with all of the 
conditions of this section are exempt from section 5 of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 77e).
    (b) Issuers eligible to use this section. (1) General. This section 
is available to any issuer that is not subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) and is not an 
investment company registered or required to be registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.).
    (2) Issuers that become subject to reporting. If an issuer becomes 
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) after it has made offers 
complying with this section, the issuer may nevertheless rely on this 
section to sell the securities previously offered to the persons to whom 
those offers were made.
    (3) Guarantees by reporting companies. An issuer subject to the 
reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 
U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d)) may rely on this section if it is merely 
guaranteeing the payment of a subsidiary's securities that are sold 
under this section.
    (c) Transactions exempted by this section. This section exempts 
offers and sales of securities (including plan interests and guarantees 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) under a written 
compensatory benefit plan (or written compensation contract) established 
by the issuer, its parents, its majority-owned subsidiaries or majority-
owned subsidiaries of the issuer's parent, for the participation of 
their employees, directors, general partners, trustees (where the issuer 
is a business trust), officers, or consultants and advisors, and their 
family members who acquire such securities from such persons through 
gifts or domestic relations orders. This section exempts offers and 
sales to former employees, directors, general partners, trustees, 
officers, consultants and advisors only if such persons were employed by 
or providing services to the issuer at the time the securities were 
offered. In addition, the term ``employee'' includes insurance agents 
who are exclusive agents of the issuer, its subsidiaries or parents, are 
or derive more than 50% of their annual income from those entities.
    (1) Special requirements for consultants and advisors. This section 
is available to consultants and advisors only if:
    (i) They are natural persons;
    (ii) They provide bona fide services to the issuer, its parents, its 
majority-owned subsidiaries or majority-owned subsidiaries of the 
issuer's parent; and
    (iii) The services are not in connection with the offer or sale of 
securities in a capital-raising transaction, and do not directly or 
indirectly promote or maintain a market for the issuer's securities.
    (2) Definition of ``Compensatory Benefit Plan.'' For purposes of 
this section, a compensatory benefit plan is any purchase, savings, 
option, bonus, stock appreciation, profit sharing, thrift, incentive, 
deferred compensation, pension or similar plan.
    (3) Definition of ``Family Member.'' For purposes of this section, 
family member includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, 
stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, 
mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-
law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person 
sharing the employee's household (other than a tenant or employee), a 
trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent of the 
beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the 
employee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in 
which these persons (or the employee) own

[[Page 576]]

more than fifty percent of the voting interests.
    (d) Amounts that may be sold. (1) Offers. Any amount of securities 
may be offered in reliance on this section. However, for purposes of 
this section, sales of securities underlying options must be counted as 
sales on the date of the option grant.
    (2) Sales. The aggregate sales price or amount of securities sold in 
reliance on this section during any consecutive 12-month period must not 
exceed the greatest of the following:
    (i) $1,000,000;
    (ii) 15% of the total assets of the issuer (or of the issuer's 
parent if the issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the securities 
represent obligations that the parent fully and unconditionally 
guarantees), measured at the issuer's most recent annual balance sheet 
date (if no older than its last fiscal year end); or
    (iii) 15% of the outstanding amount of the class of securities being 
offered and sold in reliance on this section, measured at the issuer's 
most recent annual balance sheet date (if no older than its last fiscal 
year end).
    (3) Rules for calculating prices and amounts. (i) Aggregate sales 
price. The term aggregate sales price means the sum of all cash, 
property, notes, cancellation of debt or other consideration received or 
to be received by the issuer for the sale of the securities. Non-cash 
consideration must be valued by reference to bona fide sales of that 
consideration made within a reasonable time or, in the absence of such 
sales, on the fair value as determined by an accepted standard. The 
value of services exchanged for securities issued must be measured by 
reference to the value of the securities issued. Options must be valued 
based on the exercise price of the option.
    (ii) Time of the calculation. With respect to options to purchase 
securities, the aggregate sales price is determined when an option grant 
is made (without regard to when the option becomes exercisable). With 
respect to other securities, the calculation is made on the date of 
sale. With respect to deferred compensation or similar plans, the 
calculation is made when the irrevocable election to defer is made.
    (iii) Derivative securities. In calculating outstanding securities 
for purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, treat the 
securities underlying all currently exercisable or convertible options, 
warrants, rights or other securities, other than those issued under this 
exemption, as outstanding. In calculating the amount of securities sold 
for other purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, count the amount 
of securities that would be acquired upon exercise or conversion in 
connection with sales of options, warrants, rights or other exercisable 
or convertible securities, including those to be issued under this 
exemption.
    (iv) Other exemptions. Amounts of securities sold in reliance on 
this section do not affect ``aggregate offering prices'' in other 
exemptions, and amounts of securities sold in reliance on other 
exemptions do not affect the amount that may be sold in reliance on this 
section.
    (e) Disclosure that must be provided. The issuer must deliver to 
investors a copy of the compensatory benefit plan or the contract, as 
applicable. In addition, if the aggregate sales price or amount of 
securities sold during any consecutive 12-month period exceeds $5 
million, the issuer must deliver the following disclosure to investors a 
reasonable period of time before the date of sale:
    (1) If the plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1104-1107), a copy of the 
summary plan description required by ERISA;
    (2) If the plan is not subject to ERISA, a summary of the material 
terms of the plan;
    (3) Information about the risks associated with investment in the 
securities sold pursuant to the compensatory benefit plan or 
compensation contract; and
    (4) Financial statements required to be furnished by Part F/S of 
Form 1-A (Regulation A Offering Statement) (Sec. 239.90 of this chapter) 
under Regulation A (Secs. 230.251 through 230.263). Foreign private 
issuers as defined in Sec. 230.405 must provide a reconciliation to 
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. 
GAAP) if their financial statements

[[Page 577]]

are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Item 17 of Form 20-F 
(Sec. 249.220f of this chapter)). The financial statements required by 
this section must be as of a date no more than 180 days before the sale 
of securities in reliance on this exemption.
    (5) If the issuer is relying on paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section 
to use its parent's total assets to determine the amount of securities 
that may be sold, the parent's financial statements must be delivered. 
If the parent is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)), the financial 
statements of the parent required by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X 
(Sec. 210.10-01 of this chapter) and Item 310 of Regulation S-B 
(Sec. 228.310 of this chapter), as applicable, must be delivered.
    (6) If the sale involves a stock option or other derivative 
security, the issuer must deliver disclosure a reasonable period of time 
before the date of exercise or conversion. For deferred compensation or 
similar plans, the issuer must deliver disclosure to investors a 
reasonable period of time before the date the irrevocable election to 
defer is made.
    (f) No integration with other offerings. Offers and sales exempt 
under this section are deemed to be a part of a single, discrete 
offering and are not subject to integration with any other offers or 
sales, whether registered under the Act or otherwise exempt from the 
registration requirements of the Act.
    (g) Resale limitations. (1) Securities issued under this section are 
deemed to be ``restricted securities'' as defined in Sec. 230.144.
    (2) Resales of securities issued pursuant to this section must be in 
compliance with the registration requirements of the Act or an exemption 
from those requirements.
    (3) Ninety days after the issuer becomes subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m 
or 78o(d)), securities issued under this section may be resold by 
persons who are not affiliates (as defined in Sec. 230.144) in reliance 
on Sec. 230.144, without compliance with paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and 
(h) of Sec. 230.144, and by affiliates without compliance with paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 230.144.

[64 FR 11101, Mar. 8, 1999]

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 11101, Mar. 8, 1999, Sec. 230.701 was 
revised, effective Apr. 7, 1999. For the convenience of the user, the 
superseded text is set forth as follows:

Sec. 230.701  Exemption for offers and sales of securities pursuant to 
          certain compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to 
          compensation.

    Preliminary Notes: (1) Nothing in this rule is intended to be or 
should be construed as in any way relieving issuers or persons acting on 
behalf of issuers from providing disclosure to employees or other 
persons within the scope of the rule adequate to satisfy the antifraud 
provisions of the federal securities laws. The rule only provides an 
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 
1933 (the Act) [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.].
    (2) Nothing in the rule obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of securities.
    (3) Attempted compliance with the rule does not act as an exclusive 
election; the issuer can also claim the availability of any other 
applicable exemption.
    (4) The rule is only available to the issuer of the securities and 
not to any affiliate of the issuer or to any other person for reselling 
the securities. The rule provides an exemption only for the transactions 
in which the securities are offered or sold by the issuer, not for the 
securities themselves.
    (5) In view of the primary purpose of the rule, which is to provide 
an exemption from the registration requirements of the Act for 
securities issued in compensatory circumstances, the rule is not 
available for plans or schemes to circumvent this purpose, such as to 
raise capital. In such cases, registration or some other exemption from 
registration under the Act is required.
    (6) The exemption provided by the rule is not available to any 
issuer for any transaction which, while in technical compliance with 
such rule, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration 
provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under the Act is 
required.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Sec. 230.701 by an issuer 
that is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) [15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.] and is not an investment company registered or required to be 
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et 
seq.] shall be exempt from the provisions of section 5 of the Act by 
virtue of section 3(b) of the Act. Issuers may rely on

[[Page 578]]

this rule with respect to offers made prior to the adoption of this 
Sec. 230.701 if in accordance with this section had it been in effect, 
or offers made pursuant to this Sec. 230.701 prior to the issuer 
becoming subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act, and sales consummating such offers may be made 
thereafter in reliance upon this provision.
    (b) Conditions to be met. (1) An exemption under this Sec. 230.701 
applies only to offers and sales of an issuer's securities (i) pursuant 
to a written compensatory benefit plan and interests in such a plan 
established by that issuer, its parents or majority-owned subsidiaries 
for the participation of their employees, directors, general partners, 
trustees (where the issuer is a business trust), officers, or 
consultants or advisers, provided that bona fide services shall be 
rendered by consultants or advisers and such services must not be in 
connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising 
transaction, or (ii) pursuant to a written contract relating to the 
compensation of such persons.
    (2) For purposes of Sec. 230.701 and 702, a compensatory benefit 
plan means any purchase, savings, option, bonus, stock appreciation, 
profit sharing, thrift, incentive, pension or similar plan.
    (3) The issuer, its parent or majority-owned subsidiary shall 
provide each participant in a compensatory benefit plan with a copy of 
such plan. A copy of a written contract relating to compensation shall 
be provided to the parties.
    (4)(i) Aggregate offering price means the sum of all cash, property, 
notes, cancellation of debt or other consideration to be received by the 
issuer for the issuance of the securities. Non-cash consideration should 
be valued in reference to bona fide sales of that consideration made 
within a reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair value 
as determined by an accepted standard.
    (ii) No adjustment to the aggregate offering price in this section 
shall be made for other offerings made in reliance upon other rules or 
regulations adopted pursuant to section 3(b) of the Act. The aggregate 
offering price under other rules and regulations adopted pursuant to 
section 3(b) shall not be reduced by offerings made under this 
Sec. 230.701.
    (iii) The number of shares permitted to be offered and sold under 
Sec. 230.701(b)(5)(ii) shall not be reduced by the number of shares 
offered or sold in reliance upon other rules or regulations adopted 
pursuant to section 3(b) of the Act, or vice versa.
    (5) The amount of securities offered and sold in reliance on 
Sec. 230.701 shall not exceed the greater of $500,000 or the amount 
determined by (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section; provided, however, that 
the aggregate offering price of securities of the issuer subject to 
outstanding offers made in reliance on Sec. 230.701 plus securities of 
the issuer sold in the preceding 12 months in reliance on Sec. 230.701 
shall in no event exceed $5,000,000.
    (i) The aggregate offering price of securities of the issuer subject 
to outstanding offers in reliance on Sec. 230.701 plus securities of the 
issuer sold in the preceding 12 months in reliance on Sec. 230.701 shall 
not exceed 15% of the total assets of the issuer, measured at the end of 
its last fiscal year; or
    (ii) The number of securities of the issuer subject to outstanding 
offers in reliance on Sec. 230.701 plus securities of the issuer sold in 
the preceding 12 months in reliance on Sec. 230.701 shall not exceed 15% 
of the outstanding securities of that class. The outstanding securities 
of a class shall include securities of that class issuable pursuant to 
the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, rights or conversion of 
convertible securities, unless such options, warrants, rights or 
convertible securities were issued under Sec. 230.701. If the securities 
offered or sold under Sec. 230.701 are convertible securities, the 
number of securities subject to outstanding offers and sold under this 
subsection shall be deemed to be the shares of the securities into which 
such securities may be converted.
    (6) Offers and sales exempt pursuant to this Sec. 230.701 are deemed 
to be a part of a single, discrete offering and are not subject to 
integration with any other offering or sale whether registered under the 
Act or otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Act.
    (c) Resale limitations. (1) Securities issued pursuant to this 
Sec. 230.701 are deemed to be restricted securities as defined in 
Sec. 230.144.
    (2) Resales of such securities must be in compliance with the 
registration requirements of the Act or an exemption therefrom.
    (3) Ninety days after the issuer becomes subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, securities 
issued in a Sec. 230.701 transaction may be resold by persons other than 
affiliates in reliance on Sec. 230.144 without compliance with 
paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (h) thereof, and by affiliates without 
compliance with paragraph (d) thereof.

Sec. Sec. 230.702(T)-230.703(T)  [Reserved]

 Regulation S--Rules Governing Offers and Sales Made Outside the United 
      States Without Registration Under the Securities Act of 1933

    Source: Sections 230.901 to 230.904 appear at 55 FR 18322, May 2, 
1990, unless otherwise noted.

[[Page 579]]

    Preliminary Notes: 1. The following rules relate solely to the 
application of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) [15 
U.S.C. 77e] and not to antifraud or other provisions of the federal 
securities laws.
    2. In view of the objective of these rules and the policies 
underlying the Act, Regulation S is not available with respect to any 
transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical 
compliance with these rules, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under 
the Act is required.
    3. Nothing in these rules obviates the need for any issuer or any 
other person to comply with the securities registration or broker-dealer 
registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act (the Exchange 
Act), whenever such requirements are applicable.
    4. Nothing in these rules obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of securities.
    5. Attempted compliance with any rule in Regulation S does not act 
as an exclusive election; a person making an offer or sale of securities 
may also claim the availability of any applicable exemption from the 
registration requirements of the Act. The availability of the Regulation 
S safe harbor to offers and sales that occur outside of the United 
States will not be affected by the subsequent offer and sale of these 
securities into the United States or to U.S. persons during the 
distribution compliance period, as long as the subsequent offer and sale 
are made pursuant to registration or an exemption therefrom under the 
Act.
    6. Regulation S is available only for offers and sales of securities 
outside the United States. Securities acquired overseas, whether or not 
pursuant to Regulation S, may be resold in the United States only if 
they are registered under the Act or an exemption from registration is 
available.
    7. Nothing in these rules precludes access by journalists for 
publications with a general circulation in the United States to offshore 
press conferences, press releases and meetings with company press 
spokespersons in which an offshore offering or tender offer is 
discussed, provided that the information is made available to the 
foreign and United States press generally and is not intended to induce 
purchases of securities by persons in the United States or tenders of 
securities by United States holders in the case of exchange offers. 
Where applicable, issuers and bidders may also look to Sec. 230.135e and 
Sec. 240.14d-1(c) of this chapter.
    8. The provisions of this Regulation S shall not apply to offers and 
sales of securities issued by open-end investment companies or unit 
investment trusts registered or required to be registered or closed-end 
investment companies required to be registered, but not registered, 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.] (the 
1940 Act).

subject to the conditions of Sec. 230.901 or Sec. 230.903 are deemed to

<R05>
Sec. 230.1001  Exemption for transactions exempt from qualification under Sec. 25102(n) of the California Corporations Code.

    Preliminary Notes: (1) Nothing in this section is intended to be or 
should be construed as in any way relieving issuers or persons acting on 
behalf of issuers from providing disclosure to prospective investors 
necessary to satisfy the antifraud provisions of the federal securities 
laws. This section only provides an exemption from the registration 
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (``the Act'') [15 U.S.C. 77a 
et seq.].
    (2) Nothing in this section obviates the need to comply with any 
applicable state law relating to the offer and sales of securities.
    (3) Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an 
exclusive election; the issuer also can claim the availability of any 
other applicable exemption.
    (4) This exemption is not available to any issuer for any 
transaction which, while in technical compliance with the provision of 
this section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration 
provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under the Act is 
required.

    (a) Exemption. Offers and sales of securities that satisfy the 
conditions of paragraph (n) of Sec. 25102 of the California Corporations 
Code, and paragraph (b) of this section, shall be exempt from the 
provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of 
Section 3(b) of that Act.
    (b) Limitation on and computation of offering price. The sum of all 
cash and other consideration to be received for the securities shall not 
exceed $5,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all other 
securities sold in the same offering of securities, whether pursuant to 
this or another exemption.
    (c) Resale limitations. Securities issued pursuant to this 
Sec. 230.1001 are deemed to be ``restricted securities'' as defined in 
Securities Act Rule 144 [Sec. 230.144]. Resales of such securities must 
be made in compliance with the registration requirements of the Act or

<R05>
Sec. 232.13  Date of filing; adjustment of filing date.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the business day on which a filing is received by the 
Commission shall be the date of filing thereof, if:
    (i) All requirements of the Acts and rules applicable to such filing 
have been complied with;
    (ii) The filing conforms to the applicable technical standards 
regarding electronic format in the EDGAR Filer Manual; and
    (iii) With respect to Securities Act filings, including filings 
under section 24(f) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(f)), 
the required fee payment has been confirmed, provided that the failure 
to pay an insignificant amount of the fee at the time of the filing, as 
a result of a bona fide error, shall not affect the date of filing.
    (2) If the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are 
otherwise satisfied, all filings submitted by direct transmission 
commencing on or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern 
Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect, shall be deemed 
filed on the same business day, and all filings submitted by direct 
transmission commencing after 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern

[[Page 598]]

currently in effect, shall be deemed filed as of the next business day.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any

pursuant to Rule 462(b) (Sec. 230.462(b) of this chapter) by direct 
transmission commending on or before 10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or

    Note: Electronic filings that have an automatic or immediate 
effective date must be deemed filed, as provided in paragraph (a) of

commences or before the filing becomes immediately effective, whichever 
applies.

    (b) Adjustment of the filing date. If an electronic filer in good 
faith attempts to file a document with the Commission in a timely manner 
but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the 
electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request an 
adjustment of the filing date of such document. The Commission, or the 
staff acting pursuant to delegated authority, may grant the request if 
it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the 
public interest and the protection of investors.
    (c) Payment of fees. Fees required with respect to a filing that is 
submitted electronically shall be paid in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in Instructions for Filing Fees--Rule 3a of the Commission's

    (d) Where the Commission's rules, schedules and forms provide that a 
document may be ``mailed for filing with the Commission'' at the same 
time it is published, furnished, sent or given to security holders or 
others, an electronic filer may file the document with the Commission 
electronically before or on the date the document is published, 
furnished, sent or given, or if such publication or distribution does 
not occur on a business day of the Commission, as soon as practicable on 
the next business day. Any associated time periods shall be calculated 
on the basis of the publication or distribution date (as applicable),

<R05>
Sec. 232.101  Mandated electronic submissions and exceptions.

including any related correspondence and supplemental information, 
except as otherwise provided, shall be submitted in electronic format:
    (i) Registration statements and prospectuses filed pursuant to the 
Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77a, et seq.) or

[[Page 599]]

registration statements filed pursuant to Sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l(b) or (g));
    (ii) Statements and applications filed with the Commission pursuant 
to the Trust Indenture Act (15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq.), other than 
applications for exemptive relief filed pursuant to section 304 (15 
U.S.C. 77ddd) and section 310 (15 U.S.C. 77jjj) of that Act;
    (iii) Statements, reports and schedules filed with the Commission 
pursuant to section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 
78n, and 78o(d)), and proxy materials required to be furnished for the 
information of the Commission in connection with annual reports on Form 
10-K (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) or Form 10-KSB (Sec. 249.310b of 
this chapter) filed pursuant to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
    Note to Paragraph (a)(1)(iii). Electronic filers are restricted from 
filing Schedules 13D and 13G with respect to foreign private issuers 
because EDGAR requires an IRS tax identification number to be inserted 
for the subject company as a prerequisite to acceptance of the filing. 
Such filings should be made in paper pending future system enhancements.

    (iv) Documents filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 8, 17, 
20, 23(c), 24(e), 24(f), and 30 of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 
80a-8, 80a-17, 80a-20, 80a-23(c), 80a-24(e), 80a-24(f) and 80a-29); 
provided, however, that submissions under section 6(c), 8(f) or 17(g) of 
that Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-6(c), 80a-8(f) or 80a-17(g), or documents 
related to applications for exemptive relief under any section of that 
Act, shall not be made in electronic format; and
    (v) Documents filed with the Commission pursuant to the Public 
Utility Act (15 U.S.C. 79a et seq.).
    (2) The following amendments to filings, including any related 
correspondence and supplemental information except as otherwise 
provided, shall be submitted as follows:
    (i) Any amendment to a filing by or relating to a registrant 
required to file electronically, including any amendment to a paper 
filing, shall be submitted in electronic format;
    (ii) The first electronic amendment to a paper format Schedule 13D 
(Sec. 240.13d-101 of this chapter) or Schedule 13G (Sec. 240.13d-102 of 
this chapter), shall restate the entire text of the Schedule 13D or 13G, 
but previously filed paper exhibits to such Schedules are not required 
to be restated electronically. See Rule 102 (Sec. 232.102) regarding 
amendments to exhibits previously filed in paper format. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, if the sole purpose of filing the first electronic 
Schedule 13D or 13G amendment is to report a change in beneficial 
ownership that would terminate the filer's obligation to report, the 
amendment need not include a restatement of the entire text of the 
Schedule being amended.
    (3) Supplemental information shall be submitted in electronic format 
except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The information 
shall be stored in the non-public EDGAR data storage area as 
correspondence. Supplemental information that is submitted in electronic 
format shall not be returned.

this paragraph (a), as well as any required confirming electronic copy 
of a paper filing made in reliance on a hardship exemption, as provided 
in Rules 201 and 202 of Regulation S-T (Secs. 232.201 and 232.202), will 
result in ineligibility to use Forms S-2, S-3, S-8, F-2 and F-3 (see 
Secs. 239.12, 239.13, 239.16b, 239.32 and 239.33 of this chapter, 
respectively), restrict incorporation by reference of the document 
submitted in paper (see Rule 303 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.303)), or 
toll certain time periods associated with tender offers (see Rule 13e-
4(f)(12) (Sec. 240.13e-4(f)(12) of this chapter) and Rule 14e-1(e) 
(Sec. 240.14e-1(e) of this chapter)).

submitted to the Commission in electronic format, at the option of the

Sec. 232.102  Exhibits.

    (a) Exhibits to an electronic filing that have not previously been 
filed with the Commission shall be filed in electronic format, absent a 
hardship exemption. Previously filed exhibits, whether in paper or 
electronic format, may be incorporated by reference into an electronic 
filing to the extent permitted by Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.10(d) of 
this chapter, Rule 411 under the Securities Act (Sec. 230.411 of this 
chapter), Rule 12b-23 or 12b-32 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-23 
or Sec. 240.12b-32 of this chapter), Rule 22 under the Public Utility 
Holding Company Act (Sec. 250.22 of this chapter), Rules 0-4, 8b-23, and 
8b-32 under the Investment Company Act (Sec. 270.0-4, Sec. 270.8b-23 and 
Sec. 270.8b-32 of this chapter) and Rule 303 of Regulation S-T 
(Sec. 232.303). An electronic filer may, at its option, restate in 
electronic format an exhibit incorporated by reference that originally 
was filed in paper format.
    Note to Paragraph a: Exhibits to a Commission schedule filed 
pursuant to Section 13 or 14(d) of the Exchange Act may be filed in 
paper under cover of Form SE where such exhibits previously were filed 
in paper (prior to a registrant's becoming subject to mandated 
electronic filing or pursuant to a hardship exemption) and are required 
to be refiled pursuant to the schedule's general instructions. See Rule 
311(b) of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.311(b)).

    (b) Amendments to all exhibits shall be filed in electronic format, 
absent a hardship exemption.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an 
electronic filer shall, upon amendment, restate in electronic format its 
articles of incorporation, by-laws or investment advisory agreement (in 
the case of a registered investment company or a business development 
company).
    (d) Each electronic filing requiring exhibits shall contain an 
exhibit index, which should immediately precede the exhibits filed with 
the document. The index shall list each exhibit filed. Whenever an 
exhibit is filed in paper pursuant to a temporary or continuing hardship 
exemption, the letter ``P'' shall be placed next to the listed exhibit 
in the exhibit index to reflect that the exhibit was filed in paper 
pursuant to such exemption. Whenever an

[[Page 602]]

electronic confirming copy of an exhibit is filed pursuant to a hardship 
exemption (Sec. 232.201 or Sec. 232.202(d)), the exhibit index should 
specify where the confirming electronic copy can be located; in

technical formatting requirements for electronic submissions. The June 
1998 edition of the EDGAR Filer Manual: Guide for Electronic Filing with 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Release 5.50) is 
incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations by reference, which 
action was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Compliance with the 
requirements found therein is essential to the timely receipt and 
acceptance of documents filed with or otherwise submitted to the 
Commission in electronic format. Paper copies of the EDGAR Filer Manual 
may be obtained at the following address: Public Reference Room, U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, Mail Stop 1-2, 450 5th Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20549. They also may be obtained from Disclosure 
Incorporated by calling (800) 638-8241. Electronic format copies are 
available through the EDGAR electronic bulletin board and posted to the 
SEC's Web Site. The SEC's Web site address for the Manual is http://

compilation of any letter or series of letters comprising a name, 
executed, adopted or authorized as a signature.
    (b) Each signatory to an electronic filing shall manually sign a 
signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging or 
otherwise adopting his or her signature that appears in typed form 
within the electronic filing. Such document shall be executed before or 
at the time the electronic filing is made and shall be retained by the 
filer for a period of five years. Upon request, an electronic filer 
shall furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all 
documents retained pursuant to this section.
    (c) Where the Commission's rules require a registrant to furnish to 
a national securities exchange or national securities association paper 
copies of a document filed with the Commission in electronic format, 
signatures to such paper copies may be in typed form.

portion of the annual or quarterly report to security holders shall be 
filed in electronic format as an exhibit to the filing, as required by 
Item 601(b)(13) of Regulation S-K and Item 601(b)(13) of Regulation S-B.

document delivered to investors and others that cannot be reproduced in 
an electronic filing, the electronically filed version of that document 
shall include a fair and accurate narrative description, tabular 
representation or transcript of the omitted material. Such descriptions, 
representations or transcripts may be included in the text of the 
electronic filing at the point where the graphic, image or audio 
material is presented in the delivered version, or they may be listed in 
an appendix to the electronic filing. Immaterial differences between the 
delivered and electronically filed versions, such as pagination, color, 
type size or style, or corporate logo need not be described.
    (b)(1) The graphic, image and audio material in the version of a 
document delivered to investors and others shall be deemed part of the 
electronic filing and subject to the liability and anti-fraud provisions 
of the federal securities laws.
    (2) Narrative descriptions, tabular representations or transcripts 
of graphic, image and audio material included in an electronic filing or 
appendix thereto also shall be deemed part of the filing. However, to 
the extent such descriptions, representations or transcripts represent a 
good faith effort to fairly and accurately describe omitted graphic, 
image or audio material, they shall not be subject to the liability and 
anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.
    (c) An electronic filer shall retain for a period of five years a 
copy of each publicly distributed document, in the format used, that 
contains graphic, image or audio material where such material is not 
included in the version filed with the Commission. The five-year period

document, whichever is later. Upon request, an electronic filer shall 
furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all of the 
documents contained in the file.

that is to appear in registrant annual reports to security holders or 
prospectuses, as required by paragraph (b) of Item 5 of Form N-1A 
(Sec. 274.11A of this chapter), shall be furnished to the Commission in

(Sec. 230.483(e) of this chapter).
    Note: An electronic filer's failure to furnish a Financial Data 
Schedule will not prevent acceptance of the filing for which the 
Schedule is required. However, inasmuch as the Schedule may be used by 
the Commission staff in its review of the filing, processing of the 
filing may be delayed pending filing of the Schedule. Further, 
electronic filers that have not filed a required Financial Data Schedule 
will be ineligible to use Form S-2, Form S-3 and Form S-8 (Secs. 239.12,

otherwise be subject to the liabilities of such sections, and shall not 
be deemed a part of a registration statement to which it relates. The

that accurately extracts the Financial Data Schedule information from 
its financial statements, financial statement schedules, or disclosures 
prepared in response to

[[Page 608]]

applicable industry guides, shall not be liable, under the Securities 
Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act for such extracted 
information, provided that the extracted data was not materially false 
or misleading in the underlying financial statements, financial 
statement schedules, or disclosures prepared in response to applicable 
industry guides.

Sec. 232.501  Modular submissions and segmented filings.

    An electronic filer that subscribes to the optional EDGAR electronic

    (a) Modular submissions. (1) One or more electronic format documents 
may be submitted for storage in the non-public EDGAR data storage area 
as a modular submission for subsequent inclusion in one or more 
electronic submissions.
    (2) An electronic filer shall be permitted a maximum of ten modular 
submissions in the non-public EDGAR data storage area at any time, not 
to exceed a total of one megabyte of digital information. If an 
electronic filer attempts to submit a modular filing which would cause 
either of these limits to be exceeded, EDGAR will suspend the modular 
submission and notify the electronic filer by electronic mail. After six 
business days, the modular submission held in suspense will be deleted 
from the system.
    (3) A modular submission may be corrected or amended only by 
resubmitting the entire modular submission.
    (b) Segmented filings. (1) Segments of a document intended to become 
an electronic filing may be submitted to the non-public EDGAR data 
storage area for assembly as a segmented filing.
    (2) Segments shall be submitted no more than six business days in 
advance of the anticipated filing date and are not limited in number or 
size. They may be submitted from several geographic locations by more 
than one filing entity. Segments may be included in only one electronic 
filing. Once used, segments will be removed from the non-public EDGAR 
data storage area. The assembly of segments into a segmented filing 
shall be effected pursuant to the applicable provisions of the EDGAR 
Filer Manual. If segments are not prepared in accordance with the EDGAR 
Filer Manual, the filing will not be constructed. The filing date of a 
segmented filing shall be the date upon which the filing is assembled 
and satisfies the requirements of Rule 13(a) of Regulation S-T 
(Sec. 232.13(a)).
    (3) Segments may be corrected or amended only by resubmitting the 
entire segment.
    (c) A modular submission or segment shall not:
    (1) be publicly available;
    (2) Be deemed filed with the Commission for purposes of Securities 
Act section 11 (15 U.S.C. 77k), Exchange Act section 18 (15 U.S.C. 78r), 
Public Utility Act section 16 (15 U.S.C. 79p), Trust Indenture Act 
section 323 (15 U.S.C. 77www), or Investment Company Act section 34(b) 
(15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)) prior to its inclusion in a filing; or
    (3) Be deemed to constitute an official filing prior to its 
inclusion in a filing under the federal securities laws. Once a modular 
submission or segment has been included in an electronic filing, the 
liability and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange 
Act, the Trust Indenture Act, the Public Utility Act and the Investment 
Company Act shall apply to the electronic filing.

Sec. 239.12  Form S-2, for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of securities of certain issuers.

    This form may be used for registration of securities under the 
Securities Act of 1933 which are offered or to be offered in any 
transaction other than an exchange offer for securities of another 
person by any registrant which meets the following conditions:
    (a) The registrant is organized under the laws of the United States 
or any State or Territory or the District of Columbia and has its 
principal business operations in the United States or its territories;
    (b) The registrant has a class of securities registered pursuant to 
section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) or 
has a class of equity securities registered pursuant to section 12(g) of 
the Exchange Act or is required to file reports pursuant to section 
15(d) of the Exchange Act;
    (c) The registrant:
    (1) Has been subject to the requirements of section 12 of 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act and has filed all the material required to be filed 
pursuant to section 13, 14 or 15(d) for a period of at least thirty-six 
calendar months immediately preceding the filing of the registration 
statement on this Form; and
    (2) Has filed in a timely manner all reports required to be filed 
during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately 
preceding the filing of the registration statement and, if the 
registrant has used (during the twelve calendar months and any portion 
of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration 
statement) Rule 12b-25(b) (Sec. 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter) under the 
Exchange Act with respect to a report or a portion of a report, that 
report or portion thereof has actually been filed within the time period 
prescribed by that rule; and
    (d) Neither the registrant nor any of its consolidated or 
unconsolidated subsidiaries have, since the end of their last fiscal 
year for which certified financial statements of the registrant and its 
consolidated subsidiaries were included in a report filed pursuant to 
section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act:
    (1) Failed to pay any dividend or sinking fund installment on 
preferred stock; or
    (2) Defaulted (i) on any installment or installments on indebtedness 
for borrowed money, or (ii) on any rental on one or more long term

[[Page 612]]

to the financial position of the registrant and its consolidated and 
unconsolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
    (e) A foreign issuer, other than a foreign government, which 
satisfies all of the above provisions of these registrant eligibility 
requirements except the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section 
relating to organization and principal business shall be deemed to have 
met these registration eligibility requirements provided that such 
foreign issuer files the same reports with the Commission under section 
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as a domestic registrant pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) If a registrant is a successor registrant it shall be deemed to 
have met conditions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section 
if:
    (1) Its predecessor and it, taken together, do so, provided that the 
succession was primarily for the purpose of changing the state of 
incorporation of the predecessor of forming a holding company and that 
the assets and liabilities of the successor at the time of succession 
were substantially the same as those of the predecessor; or
    (2) All predecessors met the conditions at the time of succession 
and the registrant has continued to do so since the succession.
    (g) If a registrant is a majority-owned subsidiary which does not 
itself meet the conditions of the eligibility requirements, it shall 
nevertheless be deemed to have met such conditions if its parent meets 
the conditions and if the parent fully guarantees the securities being 
registered as to principal and interest. Note: In such an instance the 
parent-guarantor is the issuer of a separate security consisting of the 
guarantee which must be concurrently registered but may be registered on 
the same registration statement as are the guaranteed securities.
    (h) Electronic filings. In addition to satisfying the foregoing 
conditions of this section, a registrant subject to the electronic 
filing requirements of Rule 101 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.101 of this 
chapter) shall have filed with the Commission:
    (1) all required electronic filings, including confirming electronic 
copies of documents submitted in paper pursuant to a temporary hardship 
exemption as provided in Rule 201 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.201 of 
this chapter); and

Item 601(c) of Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.601(c) of this chapter).

    (i) its predecessor and it, taken together, do so, provided that the 
succession was primarily for the purpose of changing the state of 
incorporation of the predecessor or forming a holding company and that 
the assets and liabilities of the successor at the time of succession 
were substantially the same as those of the predecessor; or
    (ii) If all predecessors met the conditions at the time of 
succession and the registrant has continued to do so since the 
succession.
    (8) Electronic filings. In addition to satisfying the foregoing 
conditions, a registrant subject to the electronic filing requirements 
of Rule 101 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.101 of this chapter) shall have 
filed with the Commission:
    (i) All required electronic filings, including confirming electronic 
copies of documents submitted in paper pursuant to a temporary hardship 
exemption as provided in Rule 201 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.201 of 
this chapter); and
    (ii) All Financial Data Schedules required to be submitted pursuant

Item 601(c) of Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.601(c) of this chapter).
    (b) Transaction requirements. Security offerings meeting any of the 
following conditions and made by registrants meeting the Registrant 
Requirements above may be registered on this Form:
    (1) Primary and secondary offerings by certain registrants. 
Securities to be offered for cash by or on behalf of a registrant, or 
outstanding securities to be offered for cash for the account of any 
person other than the registrant, including securities acquired by 
standby underwriters in connection with the call or redemption by the 
registrant of warrants or a class of convertible securities; provided 
that the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common 
equity held by non-affiliates of the registrant is $75 million or more.

    Instruction: The aggregate market value of the registrant's 
outstanding voting stock shall be computed by use of the price at

[[Page 614]]

which the stock was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked 
prices of such stock, as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of 
filing. See the definition of affiliate in Securities Act Rule 405 
(Sec. 230.405 of this chapter).

    (2) Primary offerings of non-convertible investment grade 
securities. Non-convertible securities to be offered for cash by or on 
behalf of a registrant, provided such securities at the time of sale are 
investment grade securities, as defined below. A non-convertible 
security is an investment grade security if, at the time of sale, at 
least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as that 
term is used in Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) of this chapter)) has rated 
the security in one of its generic rating categories which signifies 
investment grade; typically, the four highest rating categories (within 
which there may be sub-categories or gradations indicating relative 
standing) signify investment grade.
    (3) Transactions involving secondary offerings. Outstanding 
securities to be offered for the account of any person other than the 
issuer, including securities acquired by standby underwriters in 
connection with the call or redemption by the issuer of warrants or a 
class of convertible securities, if securities of the same class are 
listed and registered on a national securities exchange or are quoted on 
the automated quotation system of a national securities association. In 
addition, Form S-3 may be used by affiliates to register securities for 
resale pursuant to the conditions specified in General Instruction C to 
Form S-8 (Sec. 239.16b of this chapter).
    (4) Rights offerings, dividend or interest reinvestment plans, and 
conversions, warrants and options. (i) Securities to be offered:
    (A) Upon the exercise of outstanding rights granted by the issuer of 
the securities to be offered, if such rights are granted on a pro rata 
basis to all existing security holders of the class of securities to 
which the rights attach;
    (B) Under a dividend or interest reinvestment plan; or
    (C) Upon the conversion of outstanding convertible securities or the 
exercise of outstanding warrants or options issued by the issuer of the 
securities to be offered, or an affiliate of that issuer.
    (ii) However, Form S-3 is available for registering these securities 
only if the issuer has sent, within the twelve calendar months 
immediately before the registration statement is filed, material 
containing the information required by Sec. 240.14a-3(b) of this chapter 
under the Exchange Act to:
    (A) All record holders of the rights;
    (B) All participants in the plans; or
    (C) All record holders of the convertible securities, warrants or 
options, respectively.
    (iii) The issuer also must have provided, within the twelve calendar 
months immediately before the Form   S-3 registration statement is 
filed, the information required by Items 401, 402 and 403 of Regulation 
S-K (Secs. 229.401 through 229.403 of this chapter) to:
    (A) Holders of rights exercisable for common stock;
    (B) Holders of securities convertible into common stock; and
    (C) Participants in plans that may invest in common stock, 
securities convertible into common stock, or warrants or options 
exercisable for common stock, respectively.
    (5) Offerings of investment grade asset-backed securities. Asset-
backed securities to be offered for cash, provided the securities are 
investment grade securities, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section (Primary offerings of non-convertible investment grade 
securities). For purposes of this Form, the term ``asset-backed 
security'' means a security that is primarily serviced by the cashflows 
of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets, either 
fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a 
finite time period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure 
the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the security 
holders.
    (c) Majority-owned subsidiaries. If a registrant is a majority-owned 
subsidiary, security offerings may be registered on this Form if:
    (1) The registrant-subsidiary itself meets the Registrant 
Requirements and the applicable Transaction Requirement;

[[Page 615]]

    (2) The parent of the registrant-subsidiary meets the Registrant 
Requirements and the conditions of Transaction Requirement in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section (Primary offerings of non-convertible investment 
grade securities) are met; or
    (3) The parent of the registrant-subsidiary meets the Registrant 
Requirements and the applicable Transaction Requirement, and fully and 
unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations on the securities 
being registered, and the securities being registered are non-
convertible securities. Note: In such an instance, the parent-guarantor 
is the issuer of a separate security consisting of the guarantee which 
must be concurrently registered but may be registered on the same 
registration statement as are the guaranteed securities.
    (d) Rights offerings by foreign private issuers. A Foreign private 
issuer meeting eligibility requirements in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and 
(a)(4) of this section may use Form S-3 to register securities to be 
offered upon the exercise of outstanding rights granted by the issuer of 
the securities to be offered if such rights are granted pro rata to all 
existing security holders of the class of securities to which the rights 
attach. In complying with Item 11 of this Form, the registrant shall 
describe those material changes that have occurred since the end of the 
latest fiscal year for which certified financial statements were 
included in the registrant's latest filing on Form 20-F (17 CFR 
249.220f). In complying with Item 12 of this Form, the registrant shall 
incorporate by reference its latest filing on Form 20-F. The registrant 
also shall:
    (1) Furnish with the prospectus (or have furnished previously) to 
all its shareholders resident in the United States, including those 
holding under American Depository Receipts or similar arrangements, a 
copy of its latest annual report to security holders, if in the English 
language. Such annual reports or prospectus shall contain the 
registrant's undertaking to send promptly to any such United States 
holder, upon written request, a copy of the registrant's latest filing 
on Form 20-F; or
    (2) Furnish with the prospectus a copy of its latest filing on Form 
20-F.

    Any foreign private issuer, as defined in Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405 of 
this chapter), which meets the following conditions may use this form 
for the registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 
(Securities Act) which are offered or to be offered in any transaction 
other than an exchange offer for securities of another person:
    (a) The registrant has a class of securities registered pursuant to 
section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange 
Act'') or has a class of equity securities registered pursuant to 
section 12(g) of the Exchange Act or is required to file reports 
pursuant to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has filed annual 
reports on Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter), on Form 10-K and

registrants described in General Instruction A. (2) of Form 40-F, on 
Form 40-F (Sec. 249.240f of this chapter) under the Exchange Act.
    (b)(1) The Registrant (i) has been subject to the requirements of 
section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has filed all the 
information required to be filed pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) for 
a period of at least thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding 
the filing of the registration statement on this form; (ii) has filed in 
a timely manner all reports required to be filed during the twelve 
calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the 
filing of the registration statement and, if the issuer has used (during 
the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately 
preceding the filing of the registration statement) Rule 12b-25(b) 
(Sec. 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter) under the Exchange Act with respect 
to a report or portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has 
actually been filed within the time period prescribed by the Rule.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section do not 
apply to any registrant if:
    (i) The aggregate market value worldwide of the voting and non-
voting common equity of the registrant held

[[Page 620]]

by non-affiliates is the equivalent of $75 million or more, or if non-
convertible securities that are ``investment grade securities,'' as 
defined in Instructions to paragraph (b) of this section, are being 
registered; and
    (ii) The registrant has filed at least one Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f 
of this chapter), Form 40-F (Sec. 249.240f of this chapter) or Form 10-K 
(Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) that is the latest required to have been 
filed.

Instructions to Paragraph (b): 1. The aggregate market value of the 
registrant's outstanding voting stock shall be computed by use of the 
price at which the stock was last sold, or the average of the bid and 
asked prices of such stock in the principal market for such stock, as of 
a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing [See the definition of 
affiliate in Securities Act Rule 405 (Sec. 230.405 of this chapter)].
    2. A non-convertible security is an investment grade security if, at 
the time of sale, at least one nationally recognized statistical rating 
organization (as that term is used in Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) of 
this chapter) has rated the security in one of its generic rating 
categories that signifies investment grade; typically, the four highest 
rating categories (within which there may be sub-categories or 
gradations indicating relative standing) signify investment grade.

    (c) Neither the registrant nor any of its consolidated or 
unconsolidated subsidiaries have, since the end of their last fiscal 
year for which certified financial statements of the registrant and its 
consolidated subsidiaries were included in a report filed pursuant to 
section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act: (1) Failed to pay any 
dividend or sinking fund installment on preferred stock; or (2) 
defaulted (A) on any installment or installments on indebtedness for 
borrowed money, or (B) on any rental on one or more long term leases, 
which defaults in the aggregate are material to the financial position 
of the registrant and its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, 
taken as a whole.
    (d) The financial statements included in this registration statement 
comply with Item 18 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter); 
provided, however, that if the securities being registered are non-
convertible securities that are ``investment grade securities,'' as 
defined in Instructions to paragraph (b) of this section, such financial 
statements comply with either Item 17 or Item 18 of Form 20-F 
(Sec. 249.220f of this chapter).
    (e) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (d) of this section 
do not apply if the Registrant has filed at least one Form 20-F, Form 
40-F or Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB that is the latest required to have 
been filed and if the only securities being registered are to be 
offered:
    (1) Upon the exercise of outstanding rights granted by the issuer of 
the securities to be offered, if such rights are granted pro rata to all 
existing securityholders of the class of securities to which the rights 
attach;
    (2) Pursuant to a dividend or interest reinvestment plan; or
    (3) Upon the conversion of outstanding convertible securities or 
upon the exercise of outstanding transferable warrants issued by the 
issuer of the securities to be offered, or by an affiliate of such 
issuer. The exemptions in this paragraph (e) are unavailable if 
securities are to be offered or sold in a standby underwriting in the 
United States or similar arrangement.
    (f) If a registrant is a successor registrant it shall be deemed to 
have met conditions, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this 
section if: (1) Its predecessor and it, taken together, do so, provided 
that the succession was primarily for the purpose of changing the state 
or other jurisdiction of incorporation of the predecessor of forming a 
holding company and that the assets and liabilities of the successor at 
the time of succession were substantially the same as those of the 
predecessor; or (2) all predecessors met the conditions at the time of 
succession and the registrant has continued to do so since the 
succession.
    (g) If a registrant is a majority-owned subsidiary that does not 
meet the conditions of these eligibility requirements, it nevertheless 
shall be deemed to have met such conditions if its parent meets the 
conditions and if the parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the 
payment obligations on the securities being registered, and the 
securities being registered are non-convertible securities.
    Note: In such an instance the parent-guarantor is the issuer of a 
separate security consisting of the guarantee which must be concurrently 
registered but may be registered

[[Page 621]]

on the same registration statement as are the guaranteed securities. 
Both the parent-guarantor and the subsidiary shall each disclose the 
information required by this Form as if each were the only registrant 
except that if the subsidiary will not be eligible to file annual 
reports on Form 20-F or Form 40-F after the effective date of the 
registration statement, then it shall disclose the information specified 
in Form S-2 (Sec. 239.12 of this chapter). Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X 
(Sec. 210.3-10 of this chapter) specifies the financial statements 
required.

    (h) Electronic filings. In addition to satisfying the foregoing 
conditions, a registrant subject to the electronic filing requirements 
of Rule 101 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.101 of this chapter) shall have 
filed with the Commission all required electronic filings, including 
confirming electronic copies of documents submitted in paper pursuant to 
a temporary hardship exemption as provided in Rule 201 of Regulation S-T 
(Sec. 232.201 of this chapter).

report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has 
actually been filed within the time period prescribed by Sec. 240.12b-

    (5) Majority-Owned Subsidiaries. If a registrant is a majority-owned 
subsidiary, security offerings may be registered on this form if:

shall each disclose the information required by this Form as if each 
were the only registrant except that if the subsidiary will not be

the underlying securities to which they relate are issued by the 
registrant, its parent or an affiliate of either; and
    (2) Convertible securities, provided that such securities are 
convertible only into securities of the registrant, its parent or an 
affiliate of either.

Instruction: For purposes of this Form, an ``affiliate'' of a person is 
anyone who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises 
control or direction over, more than 10 percent of the outstanding 
equity shares of such person. The determination of a person's affiliates 
shall be made as of the end of such person's most recently completed 
fiscal year.

    (d) In the case of an exchange offer, Form F-80 is available to any 
registrant that:
    (1) Is incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any 
Canadian province or territory;
    (2) Is a foreign private issuer;
    (3) Has had a class of its securities listed on The Montreal 
Exchange, The Toronto Stock Exchange or the Senior Board of the 
Vancouver Stock Exchange for the 12 calendar months immediately 
preceding the filing of this Form, has been subject to the continuous 
disclosure requirements of any securities commission or equivalent 
regulatory authority in Canada for a period of at least 36 calendar 
months immediately preceding the filing of this Form, and is currently 
in compliance with obligations arising from such listing and reporting; 
and
    (4) Has an aggregate market value of the public float of its 
outstanding equity shares of (CN) $75 million or more; provided, 
however, that such public float requirement need not be satisfied if the 
issuer of the securities to be exchanged is also the registrant on this 
Form.

Instructions: 1. For purposes of this Form, ``foreign private issuer'' 
shall be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
    2. For purposes of this Form, ``equity shares'' shall mean common 
shares, non-voting equity shares and subordinate or restricted voting 
equity shares, but shall not include preferred shares.
    3. For purposes of this Form, the ``public float'' of specified 
securities shall mean only such securities held by persons other than 
affiliates of the issuer.
    4. For purposes of this Form, the market value of the public float 
of outstanding equity shares shall be computed by use of the price at 
which such shares were last sold, or the average of the bid and asked 
prices of such shares, in the principal market for such shares as of a 
date within 60 days prior to the date of filing. If there is no market 
for any of such securities, the book value of such securities computed 
as of the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this Form shall 
be used for purposes of calculating the market value, unless the issuer 
of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an 
accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal 
amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.

    (e) In the case of an exchange offer, the securities to be 
registered on this Form shall be offered to U. S. holders upon terms and 
conditions not less favorable than those offered to any other holder of 
the same class of the securities to be exchanged (the ``subject 
securities'') for the securities of the registrant.
    (f) In the case of an exchange offer, if the registrant is a 
successor registrant subsisting after a business combination, the 
registrant shall be deemed to meet the 36-month reporting requirement 
and the 12-month listing requirement of paragraph (d) (3) of this 
section if:
    (1) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the 
continuous disclosure requirements of any securities commission or 
equivalent regulatory authority in Canada, when added separately to the 
time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at the time 
of the business combination, in each case equals at least 36 calendar 
months, provided, however, that any predecessor need not be considered 
for purposes of the reporting history calculation if the reporting 
histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues, respectively, 
would contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets and gross 
revenues from continuing operations of the successor registrant, as 
measured based on pro

[[Page 634]]

forma combination of such participating companies' most recently 
completed fiscal years immediately prior to the business combination, 
when combined with the reporting history of the successor registrant in 
each case satisfy such 36-month reporting requirement;
    (2) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the 
listing requirements of the specified exchanges, when added separately 
to the time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at 
the time of the business combination, in each case equals at least 12 
calendar months, provided, however, that any predecessor need not be 
considered for purposes of the listing history calculation if the 
listing histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues, 
respectively, would contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets 
and gross revenues from continuing operations of the successor 
registrant, as measured based on pro forma combination of such 
participating companies' most recently completed fiscal years 
immediately prior to the business combination, when combined with the 
listing history of the successor registrant in each case satisfy such 
12-month listing requirement; and
    (3) The successor registrant has been subject to such continuous 
disclosure requirements and listing requirements since the business 
combination, and is currently in compliance with its obligations 
thereunder.
    (g) In the case of an exchange offer, the issuer of the subject 
securities shall be incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada 
or any Canadian province or territory and be a foreign private issuer, 
and less than 40 percent of the class of subject securities outstanding 
shall be held by U.S. holders.

Instructions: 1. For purposes of exchange offers, the term ``U.S. 
holder'' shall mean any person whose address appears on the records of 
the issuer of the subject securities, any voting trustee, any 
depositary, any share transfer agent or any person acting in a similar 
capacity on behalf of the issuer of the subject securities as being 
located in the United States.
    2. With respect to any tender offer, including any exchange offer, 
otherwise eligible to proceed in accordance with Rule 14d-1(b) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), the issuer of 
the subject securities will be presumed to be a foreign private issuer 
and U.S. holders will be presumed to hold less than 40 percent of such 
outstanding securities, unless (a) the aggregate trading volume of that 
class on national securities exchanges in the United States and on 
NASDAQ exceeded its aggregate trading volume on securities exchanges in 
Canada and on the Canadian Dealing Network, Inc. (``CDN'') over the 12 
calendar month period prior to commencement of this offer, or if 
commenced in response to a prior offer, over the 12 calendar month 
period prior to commencement of the initial offer (based on volume 
figures published by such exchanges and NASDAQ and CDN); (b) the most 
recent annual report or annual information form filed or submitted by 
the issuer with securities regulators of Ontario, Quebec, British 
Columbia or Alberta (or, if the issuer of the subject securities is not 
a reporting issuer in any of such provinces, with any other Canadian 
securities regulator) or with the Commission indicates that U.S. holders 
hold 40 percent or more of the outstanding subject class of securities; 
or (c) the offeror has actual knowledge that the level of U.S. ownership 
equals or exceeds 40 percent of such securities.
    3. For purposes of this Form, if this Form is filed during the 
pendency of one or more ongoing cash tender or exchange offers for 
securities of the class subject to the offer that was commenced or was 
eligible to be commenced on Schedule 13E-4F, Schedule 14D-1F, and/or 
Form F-8 or Form F-80, the date for calculation of U.S. ownership shall 
be the same as that date used by the initial bidder or issuer.
    4. For purposes of this Form, the class of subject securities shall 
not include any securities that may be converted into or are 
exchangeable for the subject securities.
    5. For purposes of exchange offers, the calculation of U.S. holders 
shall be made as of the end of the subject issuer's last quarter or, if 
such quarter terminated within 60 days of the filing date, as of the end 
of such issuer's preceding quarter.

    (h) In the case of a business combination, Form F-80 is available 
if:
    (1) Each company participating in the business combination, 
including the successor registrant, is incorporated or organized under 
the laws of Canada or any Canadian province or territory and is a 
foreign private issuer;
    (2) Each company participating in the business combination other 
than the successor registrant has had a class of its securities listed 
on The Montreal

[[Page 635]]

Exchange, The Toronto Stock Exchange or the Senior Board of the 
Vancouver Stock Exchange for the 12 calendar months immediately 
preceding the filing of this Form, has been subject to the continuous 
disclosure requirements of any securities commission or equivalent 
regulatory authority in Canada for a period of at least 36 calendar 
months immediately preceding the filing of this Form, and is currently 
in compliance with obligations arising from such listing and reporting; 
provided, however, that any such participating company shall not be 
required to meet such 36-month reporting requirement or 12-month listing 
requirement if other participating companies whose assets and gross 
revenues, respectively, would contribute at least 80 percent of the 
total assets and gross revenues from continuing operations of the 
successor registrant, as measured based on pro forma combination of the 
participating companies' most recently completed fiscal years, each meet 
such reporting and listing requirements; and
    (3) The aggregate market value of the public float of the 
outstanding equity shares of each company participating in the business 
combination other than the successor registrant is (CN) $75 million or 
more; provided, however, that any such participating company shall not 
be required to meet such public float requirement if other participating 
companies whose assets and gross revenues, respectively, would 
contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets and gross revenues 
from continuing operations of the successor registrant, as measured 
based on pro forma combination of the participating companies' most 
recently completed fiscal years, each meet such public float 
requirement; and, provided further, that such public float requirement 
shall be deemed satisfied in the case of a participating company whose 
equity shares were the subject of an exchange offer that was registered 
or would have been eligible for registration on Form F-8, Form F-9, Form 
F-10 or Form F-80, or a tender offer in connection with which Schedule 
13E-4F or 14D-1F was filed or could have been filed, that terminated 
within the last twelve months, if the participating company would have 
satisfied such public float requirement immediately prior to 
commencement of such exchange or tender offer.
    (i) In the case of a business combination, less than 40 percent of 
the class of securities to be offered by the successor registrant shall 
be held by U.S. holders, as if measured immediately after completion of 
the business combination.

Instructions: 1. For purposes of business combinations, the term ``U.S. 
holder'' shall mean any person whose address appears on the records of a 
participating company, any voting trustee, any depositary, any share 
transfer agent or any person acting in a similar capacity on behalf of a 
participating company as being located in the United States.
    2. For purposes of business combinations, the calculation of U.S. 
holders shall be made by a participant as of the end of such 
participant's last quarter or, if such quarter terminated within 60 days 
of the filing date, as of the end of such participant's preceding 
quarter.

    (j) In the case of a business combination, the securities to be 
registered on this Form shall be offered to U.S. holders upon terms and 
conditions not less favorable than those offered to any other holder of 
the same class of such securities of the participating company.
    (k) This Form shall not be used if the registrant or, in the case of 
an exchange offer, the issuer of the subject securities is an investment 
company registered or required to be registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940.
    (l) Registrants and any non-U.S. person acting as trustee with 
respect to the securities being registered shall each file a Form F-X 
(Sec. 239.42 of this chapter) with the Commission at the time of filing 
this Form.

    (a) Except as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, this form 
shall be filed in triplicate with the Commission at its principal office 
in Washington, DC, by each person who intends to sell securities in 
reliance upon Sec. 230.144 of this chapter and shall be transmitted for

maker of a sale of securities.
    (b) This form need not be filed if the amount of securities to be

securities by persons deemed not to be engaged in the distribution of

referral to other governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory 
organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection with 
litigation involving the Federal securities laws or other civil, 
criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Social security account 
numbers, if furnished, will assist the Commission in identifying persons 
desiring to sell

unregistered securities and, therefore, in promptly processing notices 
of proposed sale of securities. Failure to disclose the information 
requested by Form 144 would make an exception under Sec. 230.144 of this 
chapter unavailable and may result in civil or criminal action for 
violations of the Federal securities laws.
