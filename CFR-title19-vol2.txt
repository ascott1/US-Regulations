                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

  Subpart A--Liability for Duties and Requirement To Enter Merchandise


<R05>
Sec. 141.1   Liability of importer for duties.

    (a) Time duties accrue. Duties and the liability for their payment 
accrue upon imported merchandise on arrival of the importing vessel 
within a Customs port with the intent then and there to unlade, or at 
the time of arrival within the Customs territory of the United States if 
the merchandise arrives otherwise than by vessel, unless otherwise 
specially provided for by law.
    (b) Payment of duties--(1) Personal debt of importer. The liability 
for duties, both regular and additional, attaching on importation, 
constitutes a personal debt due from the importer to the United States 
which can be discharged only by payment in full of all duties legally 
accruing, unless relieved by law or regulation. Payment to a broker 
covering duties does not relieve the importer of liability if the duties 
are not paid by the broker. The liability may be enforced 
notwithstanding the fact that an erroneous construction of law or 
regulation may have enabled the importer to pass his goods through the 
customhouse without payment. Delivery of a Customs bond with an entry is 
solely to protect the revenue of the United States and does not relieve 
the importer of liabilities incurred from the importation of merchandise 
into the United States.
    (2) Means of payment. An importer or his agent may pay Customs by 
using any of the applicable means provided in Sec. 24.1(a).
    (3) Methods of payment. An importer may pay duties either:
    (i) Directly to Customs whether or not a licensed customhouse broker 
is used; or
    (ii) Through a licensed customhouse broker. When an importer uses a 
broker and elects to pay by check or bank draft, the importer may issue 
the broker either:
    (A) One check or bank draft payable to the broker covering both 
duties and the broker's fees and charges, in which case the broker shall 
pay the duties to Customs on behalf of the importer, or
    (B) Separate checks or bank drafts, one covering duties payable to 
the ``U.S. Customs Service,'' for transmittal by the broker to Customs, 
and the other covering the broker's fees and charges. The importer's 
check or bank draft for duties shall be delivered to Customs by the 
broker.
    (c) Claim against estate of importer. The claim of the Government 
for unpaid duties against the estate of a deceased or insolvent importer 
has priority over obligations to creditors other than the United States. 
To the extent that a broker or a surety pays duties on behalf of an 
importer which files for bankruptcy protection, the broker or surety 
shall be entitled to assume the priority status of Customs under section 
507(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code for that portion of Customs claim which 
the surety or broker has paid.
    (d) Lien against merchandise. The liability for duties also 
constitutes a lien upon the merchandise imported which may be enforced 
while such merchandise is in the custody or subject to the control of 
the United States.
    (e) States and their instrumentalities. Neither the States nor their 
instrumentalities are entitled to any constitutional exemption from the 
payment of Customs duties.
    (f) Unordered merchandise. There shall be no liability for the 
payment of duties on the part of anyone to whom merchandise is consigned 
without his authority, if he refuses it. Such merchandise shall be 
treated as unclaimed (see part 20 of this chapter).

<R05>
Sec. 141.2   Liability for duties on reimportation.

    Dutiable merchandise imported and afterwards exported, even though 
duty thereon may have been paid on the first importation, is liable to 
duty on every subsequent importation into the

[[Page 8]]

Customs territory of the United States, but this does not apply to the 
following:
    (a) Personal and household effects taken abroad by a resident of the 
United States and brought back on his return to this country (see 
Sec. 148.31 of this chapter);
    (b) Professional books, implements, instruments, and tools of trade, 
occupation, or employment taken abroad by an individual and brought back 
on his return to this country (see Sec. 148.53 of this chapter);
    (c) Automobiles and other vehicles taken abroad for noncommercial 
use (see Sec. 148.32 of this chapter);
    (d) Metal boxes, casks, barrels, carboys, bags, quicksilver flasks 
or bottles, metal drums, or other substantial outer containers exported 
from the United States empty and returned as usual containers or 
coverings of merchandise, or exported filled with products of the United 
States and returned empty or as the usual containers or coverings of 
merchandise (see Sec. 10.7(b), (c), (d), and (e) of this chapter);
    (e) Articles exported from the United States for repairs or 
alterations, which may be returned upon the payment of duty on the value 
of repairs or alterations at the rate or rates which would otherwise 
apply to the articles in their repaired or altered conditions (see 
Sec. 10.8 of this chapter);
    (f) Articles exported for exhibition under certain conditions (see 
Secs. 10.66 and 10.67 of this chapter);
    (g) Domestic animals taken abroad for temporary pasturage purposes 
and returned within 8 months (see Sec. 10.74 of this chapter);
    (h) Articles exported under lease to a foreign manufacturer (see 
Sec. 10.108 of this chapter); or
    (i) Any other reimported articles for which free entry is 
specifically provided.


<R05>
Sec. 141.3   Liability for duties includes liability for taxes.

    The importer's liability for duties includes a liability for any 
internal revenue taxes which attach upon the importation of merchandise, 
unless otherwise provided by law or regulation.


<R05>

        Subpart B--Right To Make Entry and Declarations on Entry


<R05>
Sec. 141.11   Evidence of right to make entry for importations by common carrier.

    (a) Merchandise not released directly to carrier. Except where 
merchandise is released directly to the carrier in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section, one of the following types of evidence of 
the right to make entry shall be filed in connection with the entry of 
merchandise imported by common carrier:
    (1) A bill of lading or air waybill, presented by the holder 
thereof, properly endorsed when endorsement is required under the law. A 
nonnegotiable bill of lading, or air waybill, may not be endorsed by the 
named consignee to give someone else the right to make entry. If the 
person making entry intends to use the original bill of lading or air 
waybill to obtain a duplicate bill of lading, duplicate air waybill, or 
carrier's certificate from the carrier, the exchange shall be made 
before the entry is filed, and the duplicate bill of lading, duplicate 
air waybill, or carrier's certificate shall be used to make entry in 
accordance with paragraph (a) (3) or (4) of this section. For purposes 
of this part, the rights of the consignor relating to an air waybill as 
prescribed by the Warsaw Convention (49 Stat. 3017) shall be protected.
    (2) An extract from a bill of lading or air waybill certified to be 
genuine by the carrier bringing the merchandise to

[[Page 10]]

the port of entry. Customs officers shall not certify extracts from 
bills of lading or air waybills.
    (3) A certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, with the 
carrier's certificate being in substantially the following form:

           Duplicate Bill Of Lading or Air Waybill Certificate

                                                      ------------, 19--

    The undersigned carrier, bringing the within-described merchandise 
to this port, hereby certifies that this signed copy of the bill of 
lading or air waybill is genuine and may be used for the purpose of 
making Customs entry as provided for in section 484(i), Tariff Act of 
1930.

    (4) A carrier's certificate, which may be executed on the official 
entry form, or, in appropriate cases, by means of a rubber-stamped or 
typewritten combined carrier's certificate and release order with one 
signature on a copy of the bill of lading, airway bill, shipping 
receipt, or other comparable document. The rubber-stamped or typewritten 
certificate shall be in substantially the following form, which may be 
varied to include any of the qualifications on release shown in 
Sec. 141.111(d):

                                                       Date ------------
    The undersigned carrier, to whom or upon whose order the articles 
described herein or in the attached document must be released, hereby 
certifies that the consignee named in this document is the owner or 
consignee of such articles within the purview of section 484(h), Tariff 
Act of 1930. In accordance with the provisions of section 484(j), Tariff 
Act of 1930, authority is hereby given to release the articles covered 
by the aforementioned statement to such consignee.

_______________________________________________________________________

    (5) A blanket carrier's release order on an appropriately modified 
bill of lading or air waybill covering any or all shipments which will 
arrive at the port on the carrier's conveyance during the period 
specified in the release order.
    (6) A shipping receipt or other document presented in lieu of a bill 
of lading or air waybill shall be accepted as authority for making entry 
only if it bears a carrier's certificate in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, or if entry is made by the actual consignee in 
person or in his name by a duly authorized agent.
    (b) Merchandise released directly to carrier. Where, in accordance 
with subsection (j) of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1484), merchandise is released from Customs custody (either under 
immediate delivery procedures in accordance with the provisions of 
subpart C of part 142 of this chapter, or after an entry has been filed 
in accordance with subpart A of part 142 of this chapter, or after an 
entry summary, which shall serve as both the entry and entry summary has 
been filed with estimated duties attached where appropriate in 
accordance with subpart B of this chapter), to the carrier by whom the 
merchandise was brought to the port, the delivery of the merchandise by 
the carrier to the person filing the entry summary with estimated duties 
attached shall be deemed to be the certification required by subsection 
(h), section 484, Tariff Act of 1930. Customs responsibility under this 
optional entry procedure is limited to the collection of duties, and 
constitutes no representation whatsoever regarding the right of any 
person to obtain possession of the merchandise from the carrier. 
Consequently, no Customs official shall be liable to any person in 
respect to the delivery of merchandise released from Customs custody in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.

Sec. 141.13  Right to make entry of abandoned or salvaged merchandise.

    Underwriters of abandoned merchandise or salvors of merchandise 
saved from a wreck who are unable to produce a bill of lading, air 
waybill, certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, or carrier's 
certificate, shall produce evidence satisfactory to the port director of 
their right to act.

    The executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased consignee, 
the receiver or other legal representative of an insolvent consignee, or 
the representative appointed in any action or proceeding at law to act 
for a consignee shall not be permitted to make entry unless he produces 
a duly endorsed bill of lading or air waybill, a carrier's certificate, 
or a duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, executed in accordance 
with subsections (h) or (i) of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as

purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 141.15  Bond for production of bill of lading or air waybill.

    (a) When appropriate. If the person desiring to make entry is unable 
to present a bill of lading, air waybill, or other evidence of right to 
make entry in accordance with Sec. 141.11, the port director may accept 
a bond for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill under the 
provisions of section 484(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1484(c)). The bond shall be for the production of a bill of lading or 
air waybill, unless the person making entry intends to produce a 
carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air 
waybill. In that case, no bond is required because section 484(c) does 
not apply to entries made on a carrier's certificate or certified 
duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. If the port director is in 
doubt as to the propriety of accepting entry on a bond for the 
production of a bill of lading or air waybill, he shall request 
authority to do so from the Commissioner of Customs.
    (b) Form. The bond shall be on Customs Form 301 and contain the bond 
conditions set forth in Sec. 113.69 of this chapter.
    (c) Documents acceptable to satisfy bond. A bond given for the 
production of a bill of lading or air waybill shall be considered as 
canceled upon production of a bill of lading or air waybill, and may be 
considered as satisfied but shall not be canceled upon the production of 
a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air 
waybill.

lading or air waybill to the person making entry is requested in 
accordance with section 484(j), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1484(j)), the port director shall obtain a receipt showing 
sufficient data from the bill of lading or air waybill to completely 
identify it and enable the auditor to verify the production of proper 
evidence of the right to make entry. The receipt shall also show any 
freight charges and weights that appear on the bill of lading or air 
waybill. The port director shall then return the bill of lading or air 
waybill to the person making entry with a notation thereon to the effect 
that entry has been made for the merchandise.
    (b) Other documents. When any of the other documents specified in 
Sec. 141.11(a) (2) through (6) is used in making entry, it shall be 
retained by the port director as evidence that the person making entry 
is authorized to do so.

    A nonresident corporation (i.e., one which is not incorporated 
within the Customs territory of the United States or in the Virgin 
Islands of the United States) shall not enter merchandise for 
consumption unless it:
    (a) Has a resident agent in the State where the port of entry is 
located who is authorized to accept service of process against such 
corporation; and
    (b) Files a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions 
set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter having a resident corporate 
surety to secure the payment of any increased and additional duties

Sec. 141.19  Declaration of entry.

    (a) Declaration by consignee. The consignee in whose name an entry 
is made under the provisions of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1484), shall execute the declaration specified in 
section 485(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(a)) on:
    (1) The entry summary for merchandise entered for consumption, for 
warehouse, or for temporary importation under bond, or
    (2) The rewarehouse or the bonded manufacturing warehouse entry.

The declaration need not be under oath. When the consignee is a 
partnership, any partner may execute the declaration, and when the 
consignee is a corporation any officer of the corporation may execute 
the declaration.
    (b) Declaration by agent of consignee--(1) Authorized agent with 
knowledge of the facts. When entry is made in a consignee's name by an 
agent who has knowledge of the facts and who is authorized under a 
proper power of attorney by that consignee to make declarations in 
accordance with section 485(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1485(f)), a declaration on the entry or entry summary executed by 
that agent is sufficient and no bond to produce a declaration of the 
consignee is required.
    (2) Other agents. When entry is made in a consignee's name by an 
agent who does not meet the qualifications in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section either:
    (i) A declaration of the consignee on Customs Form 3347-A shall be 
filed with the entry documentation or entry summary or
    (ii) A charge for the production of the declaration shall be made 
against the bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set 
forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter. No separate bond of the agent 
shall be required, since a charge against the bond on Customs Form 301, 
containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter 
satisfies the requirements of section 485(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(c)).
    (3) Nominal consignee. A nominal consignee who makes entry in his 
own name is not considered an agent within the purview of section 
485(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(c)), and he shall 
execute a declaration in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Books, newspapers, and periodicals. In the case of successive 
importations of books, magazines, newspapers, and periodicals within the 
scope of section 485(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1485(b)), one declaration filed at the time of arrival of the first

entry summary for consumption, warehouse, or temporary importation under 
bond is filed, or in whose name a rewarehouse entry or a manufacturing 
warehouse entry is made, and who desires, under the provisions of 
section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)), to

the time of the filing of the entry summary or entry documentation, as 
provided in Sec. 141.19(a), that he is not the actual owner of the 
merchandise, furnish the name and address of the owner, and file with 
the port director within 90 days from the time of entry (see 
Sec. 141.68) a declaration of the actual owner of the merchandise 
acknowledging that the actual owner will pay all additional and 
increased duties. The declaration of owner shall be filed on Customs 
Form 3347.
    (2) Bond of actual owner. If the consignee desires to be relieved 
from contractual liability for the payment of increased and additional 
duties voluntarily assumed by him under the single-entry bond which he 
filed in connection with the entry documentation and/or entry summary, 
or under his continuous bond against which the entry and/or entry 
summary is charged, he shall file a bond of the actual owner on Customs 
Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of 
this chapter, with the port director within 90 days from the time of 
entry.
    (b) Appropriate party to execute and file. Neither the declaration 
of the actual owner nor the bond of the actual owner shall be accepted 
unless executed by the actual owner or his duly authorized agent, and 
filed by the nominal consignee or his duly authorized agent.
    (c) Nonresident actual owner. If the actual owner is a nonresident, 
the actual owner's declaration shall not be accepted as compliance with 
section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)), 
unless there is filed therewith the owner's bond on Customs Form 301, 
containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter, 
with a resident corporate surety.
    (d) Filing of declaration of owner for purposes other than relief 
from liability. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent 
the nominal consignee from filing the actual owner's declaration without 
the superseding bond for purposes other than relief from statutory 
liability for the payment of increased and additional duties under the 
provisions of section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1485(d)).

    (4) Broker No. If a broker is used, the broker's number shall be 
reported in the appropriate location on Customs Form 7501.
    (e) Statistical information--(1) Information required on entry

invoice. For each class or kind of merchandise subject to a separate 
statistical reporting number, the applicable information required by the 
General Statistical Notes, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTSUS), shall be shown on the entry summary, Customs Form 7501; 
the transportation entry and manifest of goods, Customs Form 7512, when 
used to document an incoming vessel shipment proceeding to a third 
country by means of an entry for transportation and exportation, or 
immediate exportation.
    (B) Multiple invoices. If a class or kind of merchandise from the 
same country of origin subject to the same statistical reporting number 
is included in more than one invoice, the importer may, at his option 
(1) list each invoice separately on the appropriate form listed under 
paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section and for each class or kind of 
merchandise within each invoice subject to a separate statistical 
reporting number, report the applicable information required by the 
General Statistical Notes, HTSUS; or (2) combine the information for 
each class or kind of merchandise and report it under one statistical 
reporting number for all invoices. When consolidating information from 
several invoices under one reporting number, a worksheet itemizing the

providing the information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 
If the information required by subparagraph General Statistical Note 
1(a)(xiv)(xvii), HTSUS, cannot be obtained readily, the person filing 
the form shall provide reasonable estimates of the required information. 
The acceptance of an estimate for a particular transaction does not 
relieve the person filing the form from obtaining the necessary 
information for similar future transactions. The port director may 
require additional documentation to substantiate the statistical 
information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The importer 
shall give an appropriate bond for the production of the required 
documentation, as follows:
    (i) Except for merchandise entered for warehouse, the documentation 
shall be produced within 50 days after the entry summary (or the entry, 
if there is no entry summary) is required to be filed.
    (ii) If merchandise is entered for warehouse, the documentation 
shall be produced within 2 months after the date of withdrawal, except 
that if an invoice is part of the documentation, the invoice shall be 
produced within 50 days after the entry summary for warehouse is 
required to be filed.

The port director may grant a reasonable extension of time to produce 
the required documentation for good cause shown. (See Sec. 141.91(d) for 
bond requirements relating to failure to produce an invoice.)

[[Page 20]]

    (3) Estimates of statistical information. When the person filing the 
form estimates any of the values or charges, as provided for in General 
Statistical Note 1(b)(V), HTSUS, except Canadian rail and truck charges, 
he shall place either ``(estimate)'', ``(est)'', or (``E'') after the 
amount of each value or charge.
    (4) Rejection of form. The port director shall reject a form for 
failure to provide required statistical information if the information 
is omitted or if the information provided clearly appears on its face, 
or is known to the Customs officer, to be erroneous.
    (5) Penalty procedures; when not invoked. Penalty procedures 
relating to erroneous statistical information shall not be invoked 
against any person who in good faith attempts to comply with the 
statistical requirements of the General Statistical Note, HTSUS.
    (f) Value of each invoice--(1) Single invoice. If the entry, entry 
summary, or withdrawal documentation, as specified in paragraph 
(e)(1)(i) of this section, covers a single invoice, the invoice 
information shall be restated to show:
    (i) Gross amount of the invoice;
    (ii) Deduction of the aggregate amount of any non-dutiable charges 
involved in the amount;
    (iii) Further deduction of the aggregate of any deductions from the 
invoice values to make entered values; and
    (iv) Addition of the aggregate of any dutiable charges not included 
in the gross amount of the invoice and of any other additions to the 
invoice values to make entered values. The final amount in the summary 
computations shall represent the aggregate of the entered values of all 
the merchandise covered by the invoice. The required information shall 
be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 
and 31 on Customs Form 7501 and in the same general location on Customs 
Forms 7505, 7506.
    (2) Multiple invoices. (i) If the importer or his agent elects the 
first option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the 
information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section 
for a single invoice shall be restated for each invoice. The required 
information shall be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed 
across columns 30 and 31 on Customs Form 7501.
    (ii) If the importer or his agent elects the second option specified 
in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to 
be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice 
shall be restated for each invoice. The final amount in the summary 
computation shall represent the aggregate of the entered values of all 
the merchandise on each of the multiple invoices. The required 
information shall be shown on an attached worksheet.
    (iii) The worksheet also shall contain:
    (A) A statistical reporting number restatement for the merchandise 
from each invoice subject to the same statistical reporting number from 
the same country of origin, and
    (B) An aggregate total value which represents the entered value.
    (iv) To permit the identification of the merchandise entered under 
each reporting number, each class or kind of merchandise, from one 
country reported under a single statistical reporting number shall be 
coded identically on each invoice and on the worksheet.

    The information requested above may be furnished on CF 5523 or other 
appropriate format by the exporter, manufacturer or shipper.
    Also, the following information must be furnished by the importer or 
his authorized agent if classification is claimed under one of the 
subheadings below:
    If subheading 6401.99.80, 6402.19.10, 6402.30.30, 6402.91.40, 
6402.99.15, 6402.99.30, 6406.11.40, 6404.11.60, 6404.19.35, 6404.19.40, 
or 6404.19.60 is claimed:
    Does the shoe have a foxing or foxing-like band? If so, state its 
materials(s).
    Does the sole overlap the upper other than just at the front of the 
toe and/or at the back of the heel?
    Definitions for some of the terms used in questions A to Z above: 
For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the 
approximate definitions below. If either a more complete definition or a 
decision as to its application to a particular article is needed, the 
maker or importer of record (or the agent of either) should contact 
Customs prior to entry of the article.
    a. In an exclusively adhesive construction, all of the piece(s) of 
the bottom would separate from the upper or from each other if all 
adhesives, cements, and glues were dissolved. It includes shoes in which 
the pieces of the upper are stitched to each other, but not to any part 
of the bottom. Examples include:
    1. Vulcanized construction footwear;

[[Page 31]]

    2. Simultaneous molded construction footwear;
    3. Molded footwear in which the upper and the bottom are one piece 
of molded rubber or plastic, and
    4. Footwear in which staples, rivets, stitching, or any of the 
methods above are either primary or just extra or auxiliary, even though 
adhesive is a major part of the reason the bottom will not separate from 
the upper.
    b. Composition leather is made by binding together leather fibers or 
small pieces of natural leather. It does not include imitation leathers 
not based on natural leather.
    c. Leather is the tanned skin of any animal from which the fur or 
hair has been removed. Tanned skins coated or laminated with rubber and/
or plastics are ``leather'' only if the leather gives the material its 
essential character.
    d. A line of demarcation exists if one can indicate where the sole 
ends and the upper begins. For example, knit booties do not normally 
have a line of demarcation.
    e. Men's, boys' and youths' sizes cover footwear of American youths 
sizes 11\1/2\ and larger for males, and do not include footwear commonly 
worn by both sexes. If more than 4% of the shoes sold in a given size 
will be worn by females, that size is ``commonly worn by both sexes.''
    f. Footwear is designed to protect against water, oil or cold or 
inclement weather only if it is substantially more of a protection 
against those items than the usual shoes of that type. For example, 
leather oxfords will clearly keep one's feet warmer and drier than going 
barefoot, but they are not a protection in this sense. On the other hand 
the snow-jobber is the protective version of the nonprotective jogging 
shoe.
    g. Rubber and/or plastics includes any textile material visibly 
coated (or covered) externally with one or both of those materials.
    h. Slip-on includes:
    1. A boot which must be pulled on.
    2. Footwear with elastic cores which must be stretched to get it on, 
but not bootwear having a separate piece of elasticized fabric which 
forms a full circle around the foot or ankle.
    i. Sports footwear includes only:
    (1) Footwear which is designed for a sporting activity and has, or 
has provision for, the attachment of spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops, 
clips, bars or the like;
    (2) Skating boots (without skates attached), ski boots and cross-
country ski footwear, wrestling boots, boxing boots and cycling shoes.
    j. Tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the 
like covers athletic footwear other than sports footwear, whether or not 
principally used for such athletic games or purposes.
    k. Textile materials are made from cotton, other vegetable fibers, 
wool, hair, silk or man-made fibers. Note: Cork, wood carboard and 
leather are not textile materials.
    l. In turned construction, the upper is stitched to the leather sole 
wrong side out and the shoe is then turned right side out.
    m. Vegetable fibers include cotton, flax and ramie, but do not 
include either rayon or plaiting materials such as rattan or wood 
strips.
    n. Waterproof footwear includes footwear designed to protect against 
penetration by water or other liquids, whether or not such footwear is 
primarily designed for such purposes.
    o. Welt footwear means footwear constructed with a welt, which 
extends around the edge of the outer sole, and in which the welt and 
shoe upper are sewed to a lip on the surface of the insole, and the 
outer sole is sewed or cemented to the welt.
    p. A zori has an upper consisting only of straps or thongs of molded 
rubber or plastic. This upper is assembled to a foamed rubber or plastic 
sole by means of plugs.

Sec. 141.111   Carrier's release order.

    (a) When required. Except where release is made directly to the 
carrier in accordance with Sec. 141.11(b), no merchandise shall be 
released from Customs custody until a release order has been executed by 
the carrier, or, in the case of merchandise in a bonded warehouse, by 
the warehouse proprietor.
    (b) Form of release. The release order may be executed on any of the 
following documents:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The official entry form;
    (3) A combined carrier's certificate and release order issued in 
accordance with Sec. 141.11(a)(4); or

    (c) Blanket release order. Merchandise may be released to the person 
named in the bill of lading or air waybill in the absence of a specific 
release order from the carrier, if the carrier concerned has filed a 
blanket order authorizing release to the owner or consignee in such 
cases. A carrier's certificate in the form shown in Sec. 141.11(a)(4),

Sec. 141.112   Liens for freight, charges, or contribution in general average.

    (a) Definitions. The following are general definitions for the 
purposes of this section:
    (1) Freight. ``Freight'' means the charges for the transportation of 
the goods from the place of shipment in the foreign country to the final 
destination in the United States.
    (2) Charges. ``Charges'' means the charges due to or assumed by the 
claimant of the lien which are incident to the shipment and forwarding 
of the goods to the destination in the United States, but does not 
include the purchase price, whether advanced or to be collected, nor 
other claims not connected with the transportation of the goods.
    (3) General average. ``General average'' means the liability to 
contribution of the owners of a cargo which arises when a sacrifice of a 
part of such cargo has been made for the preservation of the residue or 
when money is expended to preserve the whole. It only arises from 
actions impelled by necessity.
    (4) Claimant. ``Claimant'' means a carrier, customs broker or the 
successors or assigns of either.
    (b) Notice of lien. A notice of lien for freight, charges, or 
contribution in general average pursuant to section 564, Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1564), shall be filed with the port director 
on Customs Form 3485, signed

[[Page 39]]

by the authorized agent of the claimant and certified by him.
    (c) Preliminary notice of lien for contribution in general average. 
When the cargo of a vessel is subject to contribution in general 
average, a preliminary notice thereof may be filed with the port 
director and individual notices of lien filed thereafter. Upon receipt 
of a preliminary notice, the port director shall withhold release of any 
merchandise imported in the vessel for 2 days (exclusive of Sunday and 
holidays) after such merchandise is taken into Customs custody, unless 
proof is submitted that the claim for contribution in general average 
has been paid or secured.
    (d) Merchandise entered for immediate transportation. A notice of 
lien upon merchandise entered for immediate transportation shall be 
filed by the claimant with the port director at the destination.
    (e) Limitations on acceptance of notice of lien. A notice of lien 
shall be rejected and returned with the reason for rejection noted 
thereon if it is filed after any of the following actions have been 
taken concerning the merchandise:
    (1) Release from Customs custody;
    (2) Forfeiture under any provision of law;
    (3) Sale as unclaimed or abandoned merchandise under section 491 or 
559, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1491 or 1559); or
    (4) Receipt and acceptance of a notice of abandonment to the 
Government under section 506(1) or 563(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1506(1) or 1563(b)).
    (f) Forfeited or abandoned merchandise. The acceptance of a notice 
of lien shall not in any manner affect the order of disposition and 
accounting for the proceeds of sales of forfeited and abandoned property 
provided for in Subpart D of part 127 and Secs. 158.10 and 162.51 of 
this chapter.
    (g) Bond may be required. When any doubt exists as to the validity 
of a lien filed with the port director, he may require a bond on Customs 
Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of 
this chapter, to hold him harmless from any liability which may result 
from withholding the release of the merchandise.
    (h) Satisfaction of lien. The port director shall not adjudicate any 
dispute respecting the validity of any lien, but when the amount of such 
lien depends upon the quantity or weight of merchandise actually landed, 
the port director shall hold the lien satisfied upon the payment of an 
amount computed upon the basis of the official Customs report of 
quantity and weight. In all other cases, proof that the lien has been 
satisfied or discharged shall consist of a written release or receipt 
signed by the claimant and filed with the port director, showing payment 
of the claim in full.

    (a) Merchandise not legally marked. Certain merchandise is required 
to be marked or labeled pursuant to the following provisions:
    (1) Section 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), 
pertaining to marking with country of origin;
    (2) Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (15 U.S.C. 70);
    (3) Wool Products Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 68);
    (4) Fur Products Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 69); and
    (5) Chapter 91, Additional U.S. Note 4, Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States (HTSUS), pertaining to special marking for watch 
and clock movements, cases, and dials.

If such merchandise is found after release to be not legally marked, the 
port director may demand its return to Customs custody for the purpose 
of requiring it to be properly marked or labeled. The demand for marking 
or labeling shall be made not later than 30 days after the date of entry 
in the case of merchandise examined in public stores, and places of 
arrival, such as docks, wharfs, or piers. Demand may be made no later 
than 30 days after the date of examination in the case of merchandise 
examined at the importer's premises or such other appropriate places as 
determined by the port director.
    (b) Textiles and textile products. For purposes of determining 
whether the

[[Page 40]]

country of origin of textiles and textile products subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 12.130 of this chapter has been accurately 
represented to Customs, the release from Customs custody of any such 
textile or textile product shall be deemed conditional during the 180-
day period following the date of release. If the port director finds 
during the conditional release period that a textile or textile product 
is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States 
because the country of origin of the textile or textile product was not 
accurately represented to Customs, he shall promptly demand its return 
to Customs custody. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h) of 
this section and Sec. 113.62(k)(1) of this chapter, a failure to comply 
with a demand for return to Customs custody made under this paragraph 
shall result in the assessment of liquidated damages equal to the value 
of the merchandise involved.
    (c) Other merchandise not entitled to admission. If at any time 
after entry the port director finds that any merchandise contained in an 
importation is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United 
States for any reason not enumerated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, he shall promptly demand the return to Customs custody of any 
such merchandise which has been released.
    (d) Request for samples or additional examination packages not 
complied with by importer. If the importer has not promptly complied 
with a request for samples or additional examination packages made by 
the port director pursuant to Sec. 151.11 of this chapter, the port 
director may demand the return of the necessary merchandise to Customs 
custody.
    (e) Demand to importer of record or actual owner. A demand for the 
return of merchandise to Customs custody shall be made on the importer 
of record, except that it shall be made on the actual owner if an actual 
owner's declaration and superseding bond have been filed in accordance 
with Sec. 141.20 before the date of the demand.
    (f) Form of demand. A demand for the return of merchandise to 
Customs custody shall be made on Customs Form 4647 or other appropriate 
form, or by letter. One copy, with the date of mailing or delivery noted 
thereon, shall be retained by the port director and made part of the 
entry record.
    (g) Time limitation. A demand for the return of merchandise to 
Customs custody shall not be made after the liquidation of the entry 
covering such merchandise has become final.
    (h) Demand not complied with. When the demand of the port director 
for return of merchandise to Customs custody is not complied with, 
liquidated damages shall be assessed, except in the case of merchandise 
entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), in an 
amount equal to the value of the merchandise not returned or three times 
the value of the merchandise not returned if the merchandise is 
restricted merchandise or alcoholic beverages, as determined at the time 
of entry. The amount of liquidated damages to be assessed on merchandise 
entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS is set forth in 
Sec. 10.39(d)(3) of this chapter.

Sec. 142.3a  Entry numbers.

    (a) Placement on Customs Forms. The importer or broker shall place 
an 11 character entry number on the entry and corresponding entry 
summary documentation. For documentation prepared on data processing 
equipment, the number shall be printed directly on the form. For 
manually prepared documentation, the number shall be pre-printed in a 
machine readable format specified by Customs. The same number shall not 
be used for more than one entry transaction.
    (b) Format. The following format, including hyphens, must be used 
when showing the entry number:

                              XXX-NNNNNNN-N

XXX represents an entry filer code assigned by Customs, NNNNNNN is a 
unique number which is assigned by the broker or importer, and N is a 
check digit computed from the first 10 characters based on a formula 
provided by Customs.
    (1) Assignment of Entry Filer Code. Customs will assign a unique 3 
character (alphabetic, numeric, or alpha numeric) entry filer code to 
all licensed brokers filing Customs entries. Customs will assign an 
entry filer code to certain importers filing Customs entries based on 
importer entry volume, frequency of entry filing, and other 
considerations. The broker or importer shall use this assigned code as 
the beginning three characters of the number for all Customs entries, 
regardless of where the entries are filed.
    (2) Entry Filer Assigned Number. For each entry, the broker or 
importer

[[Page 43]]

shall assign a unique 7 digit number. This number shall not be assigned 
to more than one transaction.
    (3) Check Digit. The broker or importer is responsible for ensuring 
that the check digit is computed by data processing equipment.
    (c) Misuse of the Entry Filer Code. The port director may refuse to 
allow use of an assigned entry filer code if it is misused by the 
importer or broker.
    (d) Alternative Procedure. If an importer does not have an assigned 
entry filer code, or if the port director, in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section refuses to allow use of an assigned entry filer 
code, the importer or broker shall obtain forms with a Customs assigned 
pre-printed machine readable entry number with a computed check digit. 
These forms will be available for sale by Customs and must be obtained 
and used before the merchandise may be released from Customs custody.

Sec. 142.4  Bond requirements.

    (a) At the time of entry. Except as provided in Sec. 10.101(d) of 
this chapter, or paragraph (c) of this section, merchandise shall not be 
released from Customs custody at the time Customs receives the entry 
documentation or the entry summary documentation which serves as both 
the entry and the entry summary, as required by Sec. 142.3 unless a 
single entry or continuous bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond 
conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter, executed by an 
approved corporate surety, or secured by cash deposits or obligations of 
the United States, as provided for in Sec. 113.40 of this chapter, has 
been filed. When any of the imported merchandise is subject to a tariff-
rate quota and is to be released at a time when the applicable quota is 
filled, the full rates shall be used in computing the estimated duties 
to determine the amount of the bond.
    (b) If entry summary is filed after entry. (1) Except as provided in 
Sec. 141.102(d) of this chapter, if the entry summary is filed after the 
entry, the bond filed at the time of entry, as required by paragraph (a) 
of this section or by Sec. 142.19, shall continue to be obligated unless 
a superseding bond is filed, as provided in Sec. 141.20 of this chapter, 
or unless a bond of the type described in paragraph (a) of this section 
is filed under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. If a superseding bond is filed, or if a bond is filed under the 
circumstances described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
obligations of the initial bond shall be terminated as to any liability 
which may accrue after the superseding or other bond becomes effective.
    (2) If entry is made in the name of an agent, supported by the 
agent's bond, or in the name of a principal, supported by the 
principal's bond, and the entry summary thereafter is filed in the name 
of the other party, the party named in the entry summary shall file a 
bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in 
Sec. 113.62 of this chapter. In this circumstance, the bond obligation 
of the party in whose name entry was made shall be terminated, as to 
liability which may accrue after the bond filed by the party named in 
the entry summary becomes effective, and the party filing the entry 
summary need not file the separate declaration of the actual owner and 
the superseding bond otherwise required under Sec. 141.20 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Waiver of surety or cash deposit. (1) The port director may 
waive the requirement for surety or cash deposit on the bond required by 
this section when (i) the value of the merchandise which the bond 
secures does not exceed $2,500, (ii) the entry summary documentation is 
filed and estimated duties, if any, are deposited prior to release of 
the merchandise and (iii) the importer has not been delinquent or 
otherwise remiss in any transaction with Customs.
    (2) This authority to waive surety or cash deposit does not apply to 
(i) quota merchandise, (ii) any type of merchandise which, in the 
opinion of the port director, cannot be easily appraised or classified, 
or (iii) any type of merchandise where there may be, in the opinion of 
the port director based on past experience, a question of redelivery.

his merchandise may be released from Customs custody at that port. The 
notice shall state the reason for the action and advise the importer 
that if payment of all his delinquent Customs bills is not made within 
10 working days from the date of the notice, he shall be required to 
file the entry summary document with estimated duties attached, before 
his merchandise may be released. In either case, the entry summary shall 
serve as both the entry and the entry summary.
    (b) Removal of requirement by port. If the importer pays all his 
delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after the date of the 
notice, the requirement shall be removed, and the importer need file 
only the entry documentation specified in Sec. 142.3 to secure release 
of his merchandise.

amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)), in the following circumstances:
    (a) Contiguous countries. At the discretion of the port director, 
merchandise arriving by land from Canada or Mexico may be released under

file a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set 
forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter. An entry summary shall be filed in 
accordance with Sec. 142.22(b)(1), and estimated duties, if any, shall

merchandise from contiguous countries released under a special permit 
except for fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption released 
under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Fresh fruits and vegetables. (1) An application for a special

Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in 
Sec. 113.62 of this chapter.

[[Page 49]]

importer's premises in the vehicles in which they crossed the border or, 
if transshipment is necessary in vehicles provided by the importer. The 
fresh fruits and vegetables may be examined at the importer's premises. 
Those portions without commercial value may be disposed of in accordance

properly presented pursuant to Sec. 132.1 of this chapter. A proper 
entry summary must be presented for merchandise so released within the 
time specified in Sec. 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever

properly presented an entry summary, he may either present an entry 
summary for warehouse or, under Customs supervision, export or destroy 
the merchandise.
    (f) Release from warehouse followed by warehouse withdrawal for 
consumption. Merchandise may be released from warehouse under a special

substantially or habitually delinquent in the payment of Customs bills:
    (a) Notice. The importer shall be advised in writing by the director 
of the port in which he is substantially or habitually delinquent that 
his immediate delivery privileges have been suspended. The notice shall 
state the reason for the action and advise the importer that if payment 
of all his delinquent Customs bills is not made within 10 working days 
from the date of the notice, the importer's immediate delivery 
privileges also shall be suspended at all Customs ports.
    (b) Reinstatement of privileges by port. If the importer pays all 
his delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after the date of 
the notice, the suspension shall be removed, and the importer's 
immediate delivery privileges shall be reinstated.
    (c) Reinstatement of privileges by Headquarters. If the importer has 
not paid all his delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after 
the date of the notice, his immediate delivery privileges shall be 
suspended at all Customs ports. This suspension shall remain in effect 
in each port of entry until notification is received from Headquarters

Sec. 142.28  Withdrawal or entry summary not required for prohibited merchandise.

    (a) Exportation or destruction of prohibited merchandise. If 
merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery later

of merchandise released from Customs custody), and withdrawal or entry 
summary documentation and the deposit of estimated duties, if any, shall 
not be required provided:

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 142.41  Line Release.

    Line Release is an automated system designed to release and tract 
repetitive shipments. It is a method of entry or immediate delivery 
extended to importers of merchandise which Customs deems to be 
repetitive and high volume. Line Release may be used only at locations 
approved by Customs for handling Line Release.


<R05>
Sec. 142.42  Application for Line Release processing.

    In order to obtain approval for processing import transactions 
through Line Release, a broker or importer filing its own entries (entry 
filer) must submit an application to the port director, signed by the 
entry filer, in a format described as a Line Release Data Loading Sheet. 
The application must be accompanied by a representative sample of an 
actual commercial invoice for the products sought to be processed under 
Line Release. The Line Release Data Loading Sheet must contain the 
following information with each information element appearing on a 
separate line.
    (a) Port where application is being made.
    (b) Initiating Company Information: name, address, city, state, 
contact person, phone number of contact person, and signature.
    (c) Listing of all ports in which the initiating company has filed a 
similar application for Line Release.
    (d) Country of origin codes (ISO codes from Annex B of HTSUS) for 
the merchandise.
    (e) Shipper or manufacturer information: Name, address, city, 
province/state, country, postal code, indication by noting ``M'' or 
``S'' whether this information relates to a manufacturer (M) or a 
shipper (S), and manufacturer identification number of the shipper or 
manufacturer.
    (f) Importer information (if importer is different than filer): 
Name, address, city, state and country, zip code, importer number, bond 
number, and surety code.
    (g) Entry filer information: Name, importer number, filer code, bond 
number, and surety code.
    (h) Product information: Product description, manifest unit of 
measure, HTSUS number described to sub-heading level for particular 
product or range of HTSUS numbers at sub-heading levels for multiple 
products for which Line Release is sought.
    (i) Election of whether the Line Release transaction is to be 
considered an entry or an immediate delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 142.43  Line Release application approval process.

    (a) Port review. The port director shall review each Line Release 
application to determine whether the shipments qualify for Line Release 
processing. The port director may contact the applicant for further 
information, if necessary. An application that fails to elect whether 
the Line Release transaction is to be considered an entry or an 
immediate delivery will be returned to the applicant. If all required 
information is submitted, the application will be forwarded to 
Headquarters for final processing.
    (b) Assignment of C-4 Codes. A C-4 Code (Common Commodity 
Classification Code), which is a unique code identifying the shipper or 
manufacturer,

[[Page 53]]

importer, entry filer, and the product for each Line Release shipment, 
shall be assigned by Headquarters to each application approved for Line 
Release. Headquarters shall annotate each approved application with a C-
4 Code and return the application to the port director who shall return 
the approved application to the entry filer.
    (c) Denial of Line Release application. If the port director is 
considering the denial of a Line Release application, consideration 
shall be given to whether an application by the same filer for the same 
transaction has been approved at another port. If there is not an 
approved application at another port and the port director determines 
that the application shall be denied, the application shall be noted 
denied and returned to the entry filer without a C-4 Code annotation by 
the port director. If an application has been approved at another port, 
but the port director still questions whether the application should be 
approved at his port, the port director shall forward the application to 
the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Information Management. The Office 
of Information and Technology will review the application and will 
notify the port director of the final determination.


<R05>
Sec. 142.44  Entry number range.

    After an application for Line Release has received final approval, 
filers must provide the port director, in writing, with a range of entry 
numbers for use in the system so that an entry number can be assigned 
automatically to each Line Release transaction. For the purposes of this 
subpart, ``entry number'', when the release is an immediate delivery, 
merely refers to the Line Release transaction number; this number does 
not become the actual entry number until an entry for the merchandise 
released under the immediate delivery procedure is filed. A separate 
range must be provided for each Line Release site at the port. These 
entry numbers shall be used for assignment within the Line Release 
system. Entry filers shall not assign these numbers to other entry 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 142.45  Use of bar code by entry filer.

    (a) Printing of C-4 Code. Upon receipt of an approved Line Release 
application, the entry filer, in accordance with instructions from the 
port director, shall preprint invoices with the C-4 Code in bar code and 
alpha-numeric format or print labels with the necessary information. Bar 
codes shall be printed in accordance with the specifications stated in 
Customs Publication 561 (Line Release Overview). Labels or preprinted 
invoices also shall state the name of the shipper or manufacturer of the 
product and the name of the importer of record, if other than the entry 
filer, above the bar code and the name of the entry filer and a product 
description below the bar code.
    (b) Multiple commodity processing. Multiple commodity processing 
allows more than one product to be released under one entry number. The 
shipper/manufacturer, importer of record and the entry filer must be the 
same. The product description is the only variable allowed. The 
commodities should be listed on one invoice with C-4 Code labels for 
each commodity attached to the invoice.
    (c) Distribution of labels. If labels are used, the labels shall be 
affixed to the invoices in accordance with instructions from the port 
director. The entry filer may either affix the labels or distribute the 
labels to the shippers/manufacturers and instruct them in the use and 
placement of the labels.


<R05>
Sec. 142.46  Presentation of invoice and assignment of entry number.

    (a) Presentation of invoice. When merchandise that has been approved 
for Line Release is imported at a Line Release site, the carrier, 
importer or filer shall present Customs with an invoice with the bar 
code or codes printed or affixed and, according to the method of 
transportation, the appropriate manifest document.
    (b) Verification of data. If after scanning the bar code at the Line 
Release site, the Customs officer verifies the data on the bar code with 
the information on the invoice, he will key the quantity on the invoice 
and an entry number will be automatically assigned to the transaction. 
If there are any differences between the system data and

[[Page 54]]

the invoice and bar code, including any differences in entry filer, the 
Customs officer shall order an examination.
    (c) Other agency documentation. If the Line Release shipment 
requires other agency documentation, the Customs officer at the Line 
Release site will be alerted to that requirement electronically when he 
verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice. 
If the required form is presented to the officer with the documentation 
package, the shipment may be released.


<R05>
Sec. 142.47  Examinations of Line Release transactions.

    (a) General. Merchandise imported under Line Release generally may 
be released without further Customs processing. Customs, however, may 
choose to inspect any Line Release shipment. Examinations may be either 
specifically ordered by the Customs officer or random.
    (b) Voiding of Line Release Transaction. Customs may void a Line 
Release transaction because of an examination. If this occurs, Customs 
will return the invoice to the carrier, and the entry filer, in order to 
enter merchandise, shall prepare and submit either a CF 3461 or 3461 
Alternate.


<R05>
Sec. 142.48  Release procedure.

    (a) General. When the Customs officer at the Line Release site 
determines that a shipment is ready for release, release data, 
consisting of the entry number, the date and time of release, the 
inspector's badge number, the quantity and unit of measure, and the C-4 
Code will be printed on the invoice and the manifest document and, when 
other agency documentation is presented, may be printed on that 
documentation. The invoice shall be returned to the entry filer and the 
manifest document shall be retained by Customs.
    (b) Notification to non-ABI participants. The returned invoice with 
the release data shall be the release notification to non-ABI 
participants.
    (c) Notification to ABI participants. If the Line Release entry 
filer is an operational ABI participant, the filer shall receive an 
electronic notification of the release consisting of the importer of 
record number, the port of entry, the filer code, the entry number, the 
date and time of release, the manufacturer code, the quantity and unit 
of measure, the release site, the HTSUS number(s), the C-4 Code and the 
country or countries of origin.


<R05>
Sec. 142.49  Deletion of C-4 Code.

    (a) By Customs. A port director may temporarily or permanently 
delete an entry filer's C-4 Code without providing the participant with 
any justification and without prior notification in cases of willfulness 
or when public health, interest, or safety so requires, thereby revoking 
the filer's use of Line Release.
    (b) By entry filer. Entry filers may delete C-4 Codes from Line 
Release by notifying the port director in writing on a Deletion Data 
Loading Sheet. Such notification shall state the C-4 Code which is to be 
deleted, the port where the C-4 Code is to be deleted and the reason for 
the requested deletion. A copy of the originally approved Data Loading 
Sheet must be submitted with the Deletion Data Loading Sheet. If only a 
temporary deletion is desired, the filer shall state the requested 
effective date for the deletion and the date the C-4 Code is requested 
to be returned to Line Release processing.


<R05>
Sec. 142.50  Line Release data base corrections or changes.

    The applicant shall notify the port director of any changes in 
names, importer or filer numbers or bond information on a Line Release 
Data Loading Sheet as soon as possible. Notification shall be 
accomplished by the submission of a copy of the original loading sheet 
with a Correction Data Loading Sheet.


<R05>
Sec. 142.51  Changing election of entry or immediate delivery.

    An applicant who has already received a C-4 Code and wishes to 
change the election chosen on his Line Release application as to whether 
the release should be considered an entry or an immediate delivery must 
submit a letter requesting such change to the port director where the C-
4 Code is used. This letter must include the C-4 Code to be changed and 
the date the change is to

[[Page 55]]

be effective. If the requested change is for a temporary time period, 
the letter shall include the date the releases are to return to the 
release type originally requested. Applications that fail to state the 
effective dates of the changes requested will be returned to the 
applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 142.52  Port-wide and multiple port acceptance of Line Release.

    (a) Port-wide processing. If a C-4 Code has been approved by the 
port director, the C-4 Code may be used at any Line Release site at the 
port.
    (b) Multiple port processing. In order for a C-4 Code approved at 
one port to be used at another port, the entry filer must submit an 
application to the port director of the other port. While uniform 
criteria shall be applied to approving similar shipments for Line 
Release at all ports, a port director may exercise his discretion to 
deny Line Release at his port even though a similar shipment may be 
approved at another port.

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 143.1  Eligibility.

    The Automated Broker Interface (ABI) is a module of the Customs 
Automated Commercial System (ACS)

[[Page 56]]

which allows participants to transmit data electronically to Customs 
through ABI and to receive transmissions through ACS. Its purposes are 
to improve administrative efficiency, enhance enforcement of Customs and 
related laws, lower costs and expedite the release of cargo. 
Participants in ABI may be:
    (a) Customs brokers as defined in Sec. 111.1(b) of this chapter;
    (b) Importers as defined in Sec. 101.1(1) of this chapter; and
    (c) ABI service bureaus, that is, an individual, partnership, 
association or corporation which provides communications facilities and 
data processing services for brokers and importers, but which does not 
engage in the conduct of customs business as defined in Sec. 111.1(c) of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 143.2  Application.

    A prospective participant in ABI shall submit a letter of intent to 
the port director closest to his principal office, with a copy to the 
Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, or designee. The 
letter of intent shall set forth a commitment to develop, maintain and 
adhere to the performance requirements and operational standards of the 
ABI system in order to ensure the validity, integrity and 
confidentiality of the data transmitted. The letter of intent must also 
contain the following, as applicable:
    (a) A description of the computer hardware, communications and entry 
processing systems to be used and the estimated completion date of the 
programming;
    (b) If the participant has offices in more than one location, the 
location of each office and the estimated start-up date for each office 
listed;
    (c) The name(s) of the participant's principal management and 
contact person(s) regarding the system;
    (d) If the system is being developed or supported by a data 
processing company, the data processing company's name and the contact 
person;
    (e) The software vendor's name and the contact person; and
    (f) The participant's entry filer code and average monthly volume.


<R05>
Sec. 143.3  Action on application.

    (a) Approval. Permission to use ABI will be granted by the Assistant 
Commissioner, Information and Technology, or his designee, only to those 
applicants who are not delinquent or otherwise remiss in their 
transactions with Customs and are in compliance with the ABI system 
performance procedures and standards as described in Sec. 143.5 of this 
subpart. If there is any cause to question the qualifications or fitness 
of the applicant to participate in ABI, the application may be referred 
for investigation and report. The investigation may include, but need 
not be limited to:
    (1) The accuracy of the information provided in the letter of 
intent;
    (2) The business integrity of the applicant;
    (3) The character and reputation of an individual applicant or a 
member of a partnership or an officer of an association or corporation; 
and
    (4) The character and reputation of the software vendor.
    (b) Denial. If permission to use ABI is denied to an applicant by 
the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, or his designee, 
written notice, including the grounds for the denial, will be given to 
him and to the port director. The applicant may appeal the denial in the 
manner prescribed in Sec. 143.8 of this subpart and those procedures for 
handling an appeal shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 143.4  Confidentiality of data.

    The electronic data received and exchanged by a service bureau shall 
be considered confidential, and the service bureau shall maintain the 
accuracy of data received in the process of formatting and transmitting 
such data on behalf of a filer, and shall not disclose this data or any 
information connected therewith to any persons other than the filer or 
Customs (see Sec. 111.24 of this chapter).


<R05>
Sec. 143.5  System performance requirements.

    The performance requirements and operational standards for 
electronic data filing are detailed in Customs Publication 552, Customs 
And Trade Automated Interface Requirements

[[Page 57]]

(CATAIR), which is updated periodically. The User Support Services 
Division, Customs Headquarters, upon request, shall provide each 
prospective participant with a copy of this publication. Each 
prospective participant must demonstrate that his system can interface 
directly with the Customs computer and ensure accurate submission of 
required data. Such demonstration will include intensive testing of the 
participant's system and monitoring of its performance in accordance 
with Publication 552.


<R05>
Sec. 143.6  Failure to maintain performance standards.

    ABI participants must adhere to the performance requirements and 
operational standards of the ABI system and maintain a high level of 
quality in the transmission of data, as defined in Customs Publication 
552 (CATAIR) and Customs directives and policy statements, in order to 
participate in ABI.
    (a) Probational status. A participant who does not adhere to the 
requirements and standards of the ABI system or maintain a high level of 
quality as described above may be placed on probational status. The 
participant will be notified, electronically and in writing, by the 
Director, User Support Services Division, of any action to place the 
participant on probation. The notice will specifically set forth the 
grounds for the proposed probation, and advise the participant that he 
will have 15 days from the date of the notice to show cause why the 
probationary period should not take effect. If the participant fails to 
respond within the allotted time, or fails to show to the satisfaction 
of the Director, User Support Services Division, that the probationary 
period should not take effect, the Director will notify the participant 
of the effective date of the probationary period. The length of the 
probationary period may, in the discretion of the Director, User Support 
Services Division, be extended up to a maximum of 90 days, if the 
participant's performance remains below standard, but, except for 
immediate revocation under Sec. 143.7, participation will not be 
suspended or revoked until the probationary period has lasted a minimum 
of 30 days. The participant's performance will be closely monitored 
during this time, which will include working with the participant and 
providing any necessary guidance to assist the participant in bringing 
his performance back to standard.
    (b) Suspension following probationary period. If deficiencies are 
not corrected within the probationary period, the participant will be 
suspended from operational status. The participant will be notified, 
electronically and in writing, by the Director, User Support Services 
Division, of any action to suspend participation. The notice will 
specifically set forth the grounds and effective date for the 
suspension, and the right to appeal the suspension to the Assistant 
Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the 
date of the written notice of suspension (see Sec. 143.8).
    (c) Reinstatement following suspension. To obtain reinstatement to 
operational status, a suspended participant must submit a letter to the 
Director, User Support Services Division, stating that the deficiencies 
for which the suspension was invoked have been corrected. If, after the 
participant has demonstrated compliance with the system performance 
requirements and operational standards specified in Sec. 143.5 of this 
part, if required, the Director is satisfied that the deficiencies have 
been corrected, the participant will be reinstated.


<R05>
Sec. 143.7  Revocation of ABI participation.

    (a) Fraud or misstatement of material fact. If it is determined at 
any time that participation in the system was obtained through fraud or 
the misstatement of a material fact, the Director, Trade Compliance, 
will immediately revoke ABI participation.
    (b) Risk of significant harm to system. If the participant's 
continued use of ABI would pose a potential risk of significant harm to 
the integrity and functioning of the system, the Director, User Support 
Services Division, will immediately revoke ABI participation.
    (c) Notification to participant. The participant will be notified, 
electronically and in writing, by the applicable Director, of the 
revocation. The notice will specifically set forth the grounds and

[[Page 58]]

effective date of revocation, and the right to appeal the revocation to 
the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days 
following the date of the written notice of revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 143.8  Appeal of suspension or revocation.

    If the participant files a written appeal with the Assistant 
Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the 
date of the written notice of action to suspend or revoke participation 
as provided in Secs. 143.6 and 143.7, the suspension or revocation of 
participation shall not take effect until the appeal is decided, except 
in those cases where the Director, Trade Compliance, or the Director, 
User Support Services Division, respectively, determines that 
participation was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a 
material fact, or that continued participation would pose a potential 
risk of significant harm to the integrity and functioning of the system. 
The Customs officer who receives the appeal shall stamp the date of 
receipt of the appeal and the stamped date is the date of receipt for 
purposes of the appeal. The Assistant Commissioner shall inform the 
participant of the date of receipt and the date that a response is due 
under this paragraph. The Assistant Commissioner shall render his 
decision to the participant, in writing, stating his reasons therefor, 
by letter mailed within 30 working days following receipt of the appeal, 
unless this period is extended with due notification to the participant.

subject to the documentation, document retention and document 
retrievability requirements of this chapter as well as the general entry 
requirements of parts 141 and 142. Use of this system is voluntary and 
optional on behalf of the filer. Customs does not contemplate that 
processing of non-electronic filings shall be delayed.


<R05>
Sec. 143.32  Definitions.

    The following are definitions for purposes of this subpart D:
    (a) ACS. ``ACS'' means the Automated Commercial System and refers to

of transmitting detailed invoice data through ABI.
    (d) Broker. ``Broker'' means a Customs broker licensed under part 
111 of this chapter.
    (e) Certification. ``Certification'' means the electronic equivalent 
of a signature for data transmitted through ABI. This electronic 
(facsimile) signature must be transmitted as part of the immediate 
delivery, entry or entry summary data. Such data is referred to as 
``certified''.
    (f) Data. ``Data'' when used in conjunction with immediate delivery, 
entry and/or entry summary means the information required to be 
submitted with the immediate delivery, entry and/or entry summary, 
respectively, in accordance with the CATAIR and/or Customs Headquarters 
directives. It does not mean the actual paper documents, but includes 
all of the information required to be in such documents.
    (g) Documentation. ``Documentation'' when used in conjunction with 
immediate delivery, entry and/or entry summary means the documents set 
forth in Sec. 142.3 of this chapter, required to be submitted as part of

approved and assigned a unique identifying number. This number may be 
transmitted as part of the ABI data.
    (n) Records. ``Records'' means the records as defined in 
Sec. 162.1a(a) of this chapter, which are required to be maintained 
pursuant to this chapter.
    (o) Selectivity criteria. ``Selectivity criteria'' means the

under statement processing (see Sec. 24.25 of this chapter).


<R05>
Sec. 143.36  Form of immediate delivery, entry and entry summary.

    (a) Electronic form of data. If Customs determines that the 
immediate delivery, entry or entry summary data, in its electronic state 
including invoice data as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, is 
satisfactory under Secs. 143.34 and 143.35, the electronic form of the 
immediate delivery, entry or entry summary through ABI shall be deemed 
to satisfy all filing requirements under this part. Further, the filer 
will not be required to produce or physically submit any official 
Customs forms of immediate delivery, entry or entry summary. The filer 
is responsible for the accuracy of the data submitted electronically to 
the same extent as if the documents were produced, signed and physically 
submitted by the filer (see Sec. 111.32 of this chapter).
    (b) Accuracy of data. Participation constitutes declaration by the 
electronic filer that, to the best of his knowledge, all transactions 
filed electronically fully disclose prices, values, quantities, rebates, 
drawbacks, fees, commissions, and royalties, which are true and correct, 
and that all goods or services provided either free or at a reduced cost 
to the seller of the merchandise are fully disclosed (see Sec. 111.32 of 
this chapter).
    (c) Submission of invoice. In order to satisfy the statutory 
requirement for presentation of invoice, invoice data must be submitted 
in one of the following forms:

preclassification/binding ruling number covering the merchandise being 
entered, or is a participant in a pre-approval program, and information 
is electronically transmitted which is adequate for the examination of 
the merchandise and the determination of duties, and for verifying the 
information required for statistical purposes by Sec. 141.61(e) of this 
chapter, such information will satisfy the invoice requirement of this 
part and part 141 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 143.37  Retention of records.

    (a) Period of retention--(1) Brokers. Pursuant to Sec. 111.23(a)(2)

of records is required for another time period (see Sec. 143.4 of this 
part).

discharged by the importer, he shall retain the documentation for those 
deliveries, entries or entry summaries filed by him prior to such 
discharge. Documentation in possession of a broker at the time of 
permanent termination of the brokerage business shall be accounted for 
pursuant to Sec. 111.30(e) of this chapter.
    (c) Location of records. Filers may store records and electronic 
data in centralized locations. If a centralized storage is desired by 
the filer, he must submit a written notice addressed to the Assistant 
Commissioner, Field Operations, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, DC, 
stating the location of the immediate delivery, entry or entry summary 
records.
    (d) Condition of records received. Documentation supporting 
electronic immediate delivery, entry and entry summary must be retained 
in the condition as received by the filer or importer, unless the 
Assistant Commissioner, Field Operations, grants written permission to 
store such documentation by other means (including optical disk 
storage), in which case the originals need not be retained. If the 
supporting documentation is received electronically, unless the 
Assistant Commissioner, Field Operations, grants permission to store 
such documentation by other means, it must also be retained in the 
condition as received and stored, with the ability to generate paper 
reproductions of the documentation.

<R05>
Sec. 143.38  Retrievability of records.

    Pursuant to Secs. 111.25 and 162.1a-162.1i of this chapter, Customs

extracts in duplicate from the manifest on file in the customhouse shall 
be made on Customs Form 7512 for each portion, one copy to be sent to 
the discharging inspector and the other to the lading inspector to be 
used as report of exportation. The splitting up for exportation of 
shipments arriving under warehouse withdrawals for indirect exportation 
shall be permitted only when various portions of a shipment are destined 
to different destinations, when the export vessel cannot properly 
accommodate the entire quantity, or in other similar circumstances. In 
the case of merchandise moving under cover of a TIR carnet, if the 
merchandise is not to be

[[Page 72]]

exported or if the shipment is to be divided, appropriate entry shall be 
required and the carnet discharged. The provisions of Secs. 18.23 and

port director may require a special report of weight, gauge, or measure 
of the merchandise being exported if he deems it necessary.
    (f) Merchandise not laden. Merchandise withdrawn for exportation but 
not laden shall be sent to general order unless other disposition is 
prescribed by the port director.
    (g) Exportation at a foreign trade zone. Merchandise may be 
withdrawn for exportation at a foreign trade zone in the same or at a 
different port. The merchandise will be considered exported upon 
admission to a zone in zone-restricted status, as provided in

warehouse intended for exportation or for delivery to persons and 
organizations set forth in subpart I, part 148, of this chapter, will be

liters or less and cigarettes in quantities of 3 cartons or less; and
    (vi) A statement on the original copy (purchaser's copy) of the 
effect that goods purchased in a duty-free store will be subject to duty 
and/or tax without personal exemption if returned to the United States. 
At the time of purchase, the sales ticket, in triplicate, shall be made 
out in the name of the purchaser. One copy shall be retained by the 
proprietor. A permit file copy will be attached to the parcel containing 
the articles, and the original given to the purchaser. Additional copies 
may be retained by the proprietor.
    (3) Sales ticket register. In addition to the records required in 
Sec. 19.12(a) of this chapter, Class 9 warehouse proprietors shall 
maintain a sales ticket register or similar accounting record for each 
warehouse entry. The sales ticket register of the proprietor shall 
include the following information:

to account for all merchandise so withdrawn and certify on the register 
that all the goods have been exported or sold to qualifying persons and 
organizations under part 148 of this chapter. The sales ticket register 
shall be included in the permit file folder with or in lieu of the 
blanket permit summary, as provided in Sec. 19.6(d)(4) of this chapter.

the warehouse proprietor may keep all sales tickets in a separate file 
in numerical sequence by warehouse entry number.

otherwise disposed of as unclaimed until the expiration of the original 
5-year period during which the merchandise may remain in warehouse under 
bond.
    (h) Protest. A protest may be filed at the port where the 
rewarehouse entry is made against a liquidation made at that port under 
Sec. 159.7 (a) or (b) of this chapter, or against a refusal of the 
director of that port to liquidate pursuant to said sections. In all 
other cases, any protest shall be filed against the original warehouse

subject to part 275 of the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service 
(26 CFR part 275) and tax is payable to Customs; and
    (3) Deposit of duties. Estimated Customs duties, taxes, and other

duty or tax, and the mail article is not accompanied by an appropriate 
Customs declaration and invoice or statement of value required by

imported contrary to law, the merchandise is subject to seizure and 
forfeiture.

section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), any 
forfeiture of merchandise subject to duty or tax (other than material

equal to 10 percent of the loss of revenue which was or might have been 
sustained, provided there is no evidence indicating to the Fines, 
Penalties, and Forfeiture Officer that failure to properly declare the 
merchandise was due to willful negligence or an intent to defraud the

a dutiable shipment not exceeding $1,250 in value is addressed to a U.S.

merchandise prior to the payment of duties under an entry on Customs 
Form 368 or 368A (serially numbered) or Customs Form 7501, upon the 
receipt of a stipulation in the form set forth in Sec. 141.102(d) of 
this chapter. If the stipulation does not accompany the shipment, the

officer shall require compliance with the marking law and regulations. 
If it is to be delivered from another post office, the Customs officer 
shall place in the envelope containing the mail entry a copy of Customs 
Form 3475, containing instructions to the postmaster concerning the 
marking to be required before delivery.
    (b) Other marking requirements. Certain types of merchandise are 
subject to special marking requirements, such as those contained in the 
Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, the Wool Products Labeling 
Act, and the Trademark Act. Since there is no provision for post office 
supervision of these types of marking, the port director shall require 
compliance with the law and regulations (see parts 11 and 133 of this 
chapter).

    Requests for adjustment of the amount of duty assessed under mail 
entries shall be handled as requests for administrative review in 
accordance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 145.22   Procedures for obtaining administrative review.

    If an addressee is dissatisfied with the amount of duty assessed 
under a mail entry, he may obtain administrative review in the following 
ways:
    (a) He may pay the assessed duty, take delivery of the merchandise, 
and send a copy of the mail entry to the issuing Customs office 
indicated on the mail entry, together with a statement of the reason it 
is believed the duty assessed is incorrect. Any invoices, bills of sale, 
or other evidence should be submitted with the statement. The addressee 
may show the mail entry number and date on his statement instead of 
sending a copy of the mail entry, but this may result in delay.
    (b) He may postpone acceptance of the shipment, and within the time 
allowed by the Postal regulations provide the postmaster with a written 
statement of his objections. The postmaster will forward the mail entry 
together with the addressee's statement and any invoices, bills of sale, 
or other evidence submitted by the addressee to the port director who 
issued the entry, and retain custody of the shipment until advice is 
received from the port director as to the disposition to be made. If the 
addressee is located near one of the ports at which Customs officers are 
authorized to review mail entries (see 39 CFR 10.5), the postmaster may 
send the mail entry to that port, together with the addressee's 
statement and evidence, for reconsideration by the port director.
    (c) He may pay the assessed duty and take delivery of the 
merchandise, and file a protest under section 514, Tariff

    A mail entry may be amended under section 520(c), Tariff Act of

such amendment within the time limits prescribed therein (see 
Secs. 173.4 and 173.5 of this chapter), and the claim is allowable under 
section 520(c). Requests for adjustment in the amount of duty assessed 
under mail entries made under Sec. 145.22(a) shall be made in such time 
that the request can be acted upon by the port director within 90 days 
after receipt of the mail article and payment of the duties by the 
addressee. Protests under Sec. 145.22(c) must be filed not later than 90 
days after payment of the duties by the addressee, but may be acted upon 
after the expiration of that 90-day period.

<R05>
Sec. 145.25   Entry correct.

    If the port director believes the duty originally assessed was 
correct, he shall send the addressee a notice in writing that the 
request for refund of duty has been denied. If the duty has not been 
paid, the mail entry shall be returned to the postmaster concerned, 
together with a copy of the notice sent to the addressee. The postmaster 
will then collect the duty and deliver the shipment, or, if the 
addressee refuses to pay the duty, will treat the shipment as 
undeliverable.


<R05>
Sec. 145.26   Rates of duty not binding.

    Rates of duty assessed on a mail entry, whether assessed on the

future importations. A binding ruling on tariff classification may be 
obtained in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 177 of this

  Policy Statement to Part 145--Examination of Sealed Letter Class Mail

    A. Customs officers and employees shall not open first class mail 
arriving in the U.S. Virgin Islands for delivery there, if it originated 
in the Customs territory of the United States, unless a search warrant 
or written authorization of the sender or addressee is obtained. Customs 
officers or employees may open and examine all other sealed letter class 
mail which is subject to the Customs mail regulations (see 19 CFR part 
145) and which appears to contain matter in addition to, or other than, 
correspondence, provided they have ``reasonable cause to suspect'' the 
presence of merchandise or contraband.
    B. Customs officers and employees shall not open any sealed letter 
class mail which appears to contain only correspondence unless a search 
warrant or written authorization of the sender or addressee is obtained 
in advance of the opening.
    C. Customs officers and employees are prohibited from reading, or 
authorizing or allowing others to read, any correspondence contained in 
any letter class mail unless there has been obtained in advance either a 
search warrant or written authorization of the sender or addressee. This 
prohibition, which will continue to be strictly enforced, also applies 
to correspondence between school children and correspondence of the 
blind which are authorized to be mailed at other than the letter rate of 
postage in international mail.
    D. If a violation of law is discovered upon opening any mail article 
referred to in paragraph C, and it is believed that the correspondence 
may provide additional information concerning the violation and is 
therefore needed for further investigation or use in court, a search 
warrant shall be obtained before any correspondence is seized, read, or 
referred to another agency. Search warrants shall be promptly sought. 
Correspondence may be detained while a search warrant is being sought.
    E. If no controlled delivery is arranged and correspondence is not 
to be otherwise seized pursuant to a search warrant (see ``F'' below), 
the item which constitutes the violation shall be removed and any 
correspondence shall be replaced in the wrapper, or in a new wrapper if 
the original wrapper has been seized pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a. The 
wrapper shall then be resealed, marked to indicate it was opened by 
Customs, and returned to postal channels. Appropriate seizure notices 
shall be sent in accordance with 19 CFR 145.59(b).
    F. No mail article may be referred to another agency without a 
search warrant unless--
    (1) Any correspondence has been removed and the mail article is 
being referred for examination and clearance under 19 CFR 145.57,
    (2) Any correspondence has been removed and the mail article has 
been lawfully seized by Customs,
    (3) The mail article is being referred to Postal Service channels to 
effect a controlled delivery in cooperation with other law enforcement 
agencies, or
    (4) The mail article is being returned to Postal Service channels 
for normal processing.
    G. Whenever sealed letter class mail is opened, the factors giving 
the Customs officer or employee ``reasonable cause to suspect'' the 
presence of merchandise or contraband shall be recorded on the 
appropriate form and on the opened envelope or other container by means 
of appropriate coded symbols. Should a seizure result, these factors 
shall also be recorded on the seizure report.
    H. Sealed letter class mail with the green Customs label on a 
Customs declaration may be opened without additional cause. 
Correspondence in such mail is subject to the restrictions regarding the 
detention, reading, and referral of mail to other agencies found in 
paragraphs C through F.
    I. Whenever any sealed letter class mail is opened for any of the 
reasons set forth in the above paragraphs, a Postal Service employee

[[Page 87]]

shall be present and shall observe the opening.
    J. Any violation of the Customs mail regulations or any of these 
policies will lead to appropriate administrative sanctions, as well as 
possible criminal prosecution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1702.

[T.D. 73-135, 38 FR 13369, May 21, 1973, as amended by T.D. 84-213, 49 
FR 41185, Oct. 19, 1984]

                          Appendix to Part 145

    A. Scope. The Customs Service is authorized to examine, with certain 
exceptions for diplomatic and governmental mail, all mail arriving from 
outside the Customs territory of the United States (CTUS) which is to be 
delivered within the CTUS, and all mail arriving from outside the U.S. 
Virgin Islands which is to be delivered within the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The term ``Customs territory of the United States'' is limited to the 
States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Consequently, mail 
arriving from other U.S. territories and possessions is subject to 
Customs examination even though it is designated ``domestic'' mail for 
Postal Service purposes. Likewise, mail in the APO/FPO military postal 
system is subject to Customs examination, even though it also is 
designated ``domestic'' mail for Postal Service purposes. The Customs 
Service therefor is responsible for examining all international mail to 
be delivered in the CTUS and certain limited categories of so-called 
``domestic mail''.
    B. Definitions. Under various international conventions and 
bilateral agreements, international mail falls within two main classes, 
Parcel Post and Postal Union mail.
    Parcel Post is not permitted to contain correspondence but is to be 
used for the transmission of merchandise and is fully subject to Customs 
examination in the same manner as other merchandise shipments (e.g., 
luggage, cargo, containers, etc.). Postal Union mail is divided into 
``LC'' mail (Lettres et Cartes) and ``AO'' mail (Aures Objets).
    ``LC mail consists of letters, packages paid at the letter rate of 
postage, post cards, and aerogrammes. The term ``letter class mail'' as 
used in the Customs Regulations and in this policy statement means 
``LC'' mail as well as equivalent articles in ``domestic'' mail subject 
to Customs examination. Equivalent articles in ``domestic'' mail would 
include articles mailed at the letter rate, or equivalent class or 
category, in the APO/FPO military system or from a U.S. territory or 
possession outside the CTUS. Since the term ``letter class mail'' thus 
includes packages and bulky envelopes as long as they are mailed at the 
letter rate, or equivalent class or category, the restrictions relating 
to opening and reading of correspondence apply equally to such packages 
or bulky envelopes.
    ``AO'' mail is to be treated in the same manner as Parcel Post mail 
since the Universal Postal Union Convention requires that they ``be made 
up in such a manner that they may be easily examined'' and generally are 
not permitted to ``contain any document having the character of current 
and personal correspondence.'' Exceptions to the latter requirement 
exist for matter for the blind and certain correspondence between school 
children. Because of these exceptions, the prohibition against reading 
correspondence without a search warrant or authorization of the sender 
or addressee applies to correspondence of the blind and correspondence 
between school children contained in ``AO'' mail. ``AO'' mail can 
usually be identified by the following words: ``Imprime'' or ``Printed 
Matter'', ``Cecogramme'' or ``Literature for the Blind'', ``Petit 
Paquet'' or ``Small Packet'' or similar terms or their equivalents.
    C. Reasonable Cause to Suspect. Determining whether there is 
``reasonable cause to suspect'' that merchandise or contraband is 
contained in sealed letter class mail is ultimately a matter of judgment 
for each Customs official, based on all relevant facts and 
circumstances. This judgment should be exercised within the framework of 
the Customs regulation that sealed letter class mail which appears to 
contain only correspondence is not to be opened unless a search warrant 
or written authorization from either the sender or the addressee has 
been obtained in advance of the opening.
    Past practice indicates that the following circumstances (which are 
illustrative and not exhaustive) provide ``reasonable cause to suspect'' 
and permit the opening of sealed letter class mail without a search 
warrant or authorization of the sender or addressee.
    1. A detector dog has alerted to the presence of narcotics or 
explosives in a specific mail article.
    2. X-ray of fluoroscope examination indicates the presence of 
merchandise or contraband.
    3. The weight, shape, feel, or sound of the mail article or its 
contents may indicate that merchandise or contraband (e.g., a hard 
object which may be jewelry, a stack of paper which may be counterfeit 
money, or coins) could be in the mail article. Contents of a mail 
article which feel lumpy, powdery, or spongy may, for example, indicate 
the presence of narcotics.
    4. Information from a source previously shown to be reliable 
indicates that an identifiable mail article contains merchandise or 
contraband.
    5. The mail article is insured.
    6. The mail article is a box, carton, or wrapper other than a thin 
envelope.
    7. The sender or addressee of the mail article is known to be 
fictitious.

[[Page 88]]

     On the other hand, certain facts standing alone generally will not 
provide ``reasonable cause to suspect'' the presence of merchandise or 
contraband and therefore do not permit the opening of sealed letter 
class mail. For example, sealed letter class mail may not be opened 
merely because:
    1. The mail article is registered.
    2. The feel of a letter-size envelope suggests that it contains one 
or a limited number of photographs.
    3. The mail article appears to be part of a mass mailing.
    4. The mail article is from a particular country, whether or not a 
known source country of contraband.
    5. A detector dog has alerted to the presence of narcotics or 
explosives somewhere within a tray of mail ( the individual articles of 
mail must then be examined individually).
    6. The sender of addressee of the mail article is known to have 
mailed or received contraband or merchandise in violation of law in the 
past.
    7. The wrapper contains writing or typing similar to that previously 
found on articles of mail which contained contraband or merchandise in 
violation of law.
     In case where any one of the above facts is present, additional 
evidence must exist which in conjunction with that fact provides 
reasonable cause to suspect the presence of merchandise or contraband.

Sec. 146.0  Scope.

    Foreign trade zones are established under the Foreign Trade Zones 
Act and the general regulations and rules of procedure of the Foreign 
Trade Zones Board contained in 15 CFR part 400. This part 146 of the 
Customs Regulations governs the admission of merchandise into a foreign 
trade zone, manipulation, manufacture, or exhibition in a zone; 
exportation of the merchandise from a zone; and transfer of merchandise 
from a zone into Customs territory.


<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 146.1  Definitions.

    (a) The following words, defined in section 1 of the Foreign-Trade 
Zones Act of 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a), are given the same 
meaning when used in this part, unless otherwise stated: ``Board'', 
``Grantee'', and ``Zones''.
    (b) The following are general definitions for the purpose of this 
part:
    (1) Act. ``Act'' means the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, 
as amended (48 Stat. 998-1003; 19 U.S.C. 81a-u).
    (2) Activation. ``Activation'' means approval by the grantee and 
port director for operations and for the admission and handling of 
merchandise in zone status.
    (3) Admit. ``Admit'' means to bring merchandise into a zone with 
zone status.
    (4) Alteration. ``Alteration'' means a change in the boundaries of 
an activated zone or subzone; activation of a separate site of an 
already-activated zone or subzone with the same operator at the same 
port; or the relocation of an already-activated site with the same 
operator.
    (5) Customs territory. ``Customs territory'' is the territory of the 
U.S. in which the general tariff laws of the U.S. apply. ``Customs 
territory of the United States'' includes only the States, the District 
of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. (General Note 2, Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)).
    (6) Constructive transfer. ``Constructive transfer'' is a legal 
fiction which permits acceptance of a Customs entry for merchandise in a 
zone before its physical transfer to the Customs territory.
    (7) Deactivation. ``Deactivation'' means voluntary discontinuation 
of the activation of an entire zone or subzone by the grantee or 
operator. Discontinuance of the activated status of only a part of a 
zone site is an alteration.
    (8) Default. ``Default'' means an action or omission that will 
result in a claim for duties, taxes, charges, or liquidated damages 
under the Foreign Trade Zone Operator Bond.
    (9) Merchandise. ``Merchandise'' includes goods, wares and chattels 
of every description, except prohibited merchandise. Building materials, 
production equipment, and supplies for use in operation of a zone are 
not ``merchandise'' for the purpose of this part.
    (10) Domestic merchandise. ``Domestic merchandise'' is merchandise 
which has been (i) produced in the U.S. and not exported therefrom, or 
(ii) previously imported into Customs territory and properly released 
from Customs custody.
    (11) Foreign merchandise. ``Foreign merchandise'' is imported 
merchandise which has not been properly released from Customs custody in 
Customs territory.

[[Page 90]]

    (12) Conditionally admissible merchandise. ``Conditionally 
admissible merchandise'' is merchandise which may be imported into the 
U.S. under certain conditions. Merchandise which is subject to permits 
or licenses, or which may be reconditioned to bring it into compliance 
with the laws administered by various Federal agencies, is an example of 
conditionally admissible merchandise.
    (13) Prohibited merchandise. ``Prohibited merchandise'' is 
merchandise the importation of which is prohibited by law on grounds of 
public policy or morals, or any merchandise which is excluded from a 
zone by order of the Board. Books urging treason or insurrection against 
the U.S., obscene pictures, and lottery tickets are examples of 
prohibited merchandise.
    (14) Fungible merchandise. ``Fungible merchandise'' means 
merchandise which for commercial purposes is identical and 
interchangeable in all situations.
    (15) Operator. ``Operator'' is a corporation, partnership, or person 
that operates a zone or subzone under the terms of an agreement with the 
zone grantee. Where used in this part, the term ``operator'' also 
applies to a ``grantee'' that operates its own zone.
    (16) Reactivation. ``Reactivation'' means a resumption of the 
activated status of an entire area that was previously deactivated 
without any change in the operator or the area boundaries. If the 
boundaries are different, the action is an alteration. If the operator 
is different, it is an activation.
    (17) Subzone. ``Subzone'' is a special-purpose zone established as 
part of a zone project for a limited purpose, that cannot be 
accommodated within an existing zone. The term ``zone'' also applies to 
a subzone, unless specified otherwise.
    (18) Transfer. ``Transfer'' means to take merchandise with zone 
status from a zone for consumption, transportation, exportation, 
warehousing, cartage or lighterage, vessel supplies and equipment, 
admission to another zone, and like purposes.
    (19) Unique identifier. ``Unique identifier'' means the numbers, 
letters, or combination of numbers and letters that identify merchandise 
admitted to a zone with zone status.
    (20) User. ``User'' means a person or firm using a zone or subzone 
for storage, handling, or processing of merchandise.
    (21) Zone lot. ``Zone lot'' means a collection of merchandise 
maintained under an inventory control method based on specific 
identification of merchandise admitted to a zone by lot.
    (22) Zone site. ``Zone site'' means the physical location of a zone 
or subzone.
    (23) Zone status. ``Zone status'' means the status of merchandise 
admitted to a zone, i.e., nonprivileged foreign, privileged foreign, 
zone restricted, or domestic.

Sec. 146.2  Port director as Board representative.

    The port director where the zone is located shall be in charge of 
the zone as the representative of the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 146.3  Customs supervision.

    (a) Assignment of Customs officers. Customs officers will be 
assigned or detailed to a zone as necessary to maintain appropriate 
Customs supervision of merchandise and records pertaining thereto in the 
zone, and to protect the revenue.
    (b) Supervision. Customs supervision over any zone or transaction 
provided for in this part will be in accordance with Sec. 161.1 of this 
chapter. The port director may direct a Customs officer to supervise any 
transaction or procedure at a zone. Supervision may be performed through 
a periodic audit of the operator's records, quantity count of goods in a 
zone inventory, spot check of selected transactions or procedures, or 
review of recordkeeping, security, or conditions of storage in a zone.


<R05>
Sec. 146.4  Operator responsibility and supervision.

    (a) Supervision. The operator shall supervise all admissions, 
transfers, removals, recordkeeping, manipulations, manufacturing, 
destruction, exhibition, physical and procedural security, and 
conditions of storage in the

[[Page 91]]

zone as required by law and regulations. Supervision by the operator 
shall be that which a prudent manager of a storage, manipulation, or 
manufacturing facility would be expected to exercise, and may take into 
account the degree of supervision exercised by the zone user having 
physical possession of zone merchandise.
    (b) Customs access. The operator shall permit any Customs officer 
access to a zone.
    (c) Safekeeping of merchandise and records. The operator is 
responsible for safekeeping of merchandise and records concerning 
merchandise admitted to a zone. The operator, at its liability, may 
allow the zone importer or owner of the goods to store, safeguard, and 
otherwise maintain or handle the goods and the inventory records 
pertaining to them.
    (d) Records maintenance. The operator shall (1) maintain the 
inventory control and recordkeeping system in accordance with the 
provisions of subpart B, (2) retain all records required in this part 
and defined in Sec. 162.1(a) of this chapter, pertaining to zone 
merchandise for 5 years after the merchandise is removed from the zone, 
and (3) protect proprietary information in its custody from unauthorized 
disclosure. Records shall be readily available for Customs review at the 
zone.
    (e) Merchandise security. The operator shall maintain the zone and 
establish procedures adequate to ensure the security of merchandise 
located in the zone in accordance with applicable Customs security 
standards and specifications.
    (f) Storage and handling. The operator shall store and handle 
merchandise in a zone in a safe and sanitary manner to minimize damage 
to the merchandise, avoid hazard to persons, and meet local, state, and 
Federal requirements applicable to a specific kind of goods. All trash 
and waste will be promptly removed from a zone. Aisles will be 
established and maintained, and doors and entrances left unblocked for 
access by Customs officers and other persons in the performance of their 
official duties.
    (g) Guard service. The operator is authorized to provide guards or 
contract for guard service to safeguard the merchandise and ensure the 
security of the zone. This authorization does not limit the authority of 
the port director to assign Customs guards to protect the revenue under 
section 4 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81d).
    (h) Miscellaneous responsibilities. The operator is responsible for 
complying with requirements for admission, manipulation, manufacture, 
exhibition, or destruction, shortage, or overage; inventory control and 
recordkeeping systems, transfer to Customs territory, and other 
requirements as specified in this part. If the operator elects to 
transfer merchandise from within the port limits (see definition of 
``district'' at Sec. 112.1) to his zone, he shall receipt for the 
merchandise at the time he picks it up for transportation to his 
facility. He becomes liable for the merchandise at that time.

Sec. 146.6  Procedure for activation.

    (a) Application. A zone operator, or where there is no operator, a 
grantee, shall make written application to the port director 
geographically nearest to where the zone is located to obtain approval 
of activation of a zone or zone site. The area to be activated may be 
all or any portion of the zone approved by the Board. The application 
must include a description of all the zone sites covered by the 
application, any operation to be conducted therein, and a statement of 
the general character of the merchandise to be admitted. The port 
director may also require the operator or grantee to submit fingerprints 
on Standard Form 87 at the time of filing the application. If the 
operator is an individual, that individual's fingerprints may be 
required. If the operator or grantee is a business entity, fingerprints 
of all officers and managing officials may be required.
    (b) Supporting documents. The application must be accompanied by the 
following:

outlets, inlets, and pipelines to any tank for the storage of liquid or 
similar product, that portion of the blueprint certified to be correct 
by the operator of the tank;

    (1) The qualifications, character, and experience of an operator 
and/or grantee and their principal officers; and
    (2) The security, suitability, and fitness of the facility to 
receive merchandise in a zone status.
    (d) Decision of the port director. The port director shall promptly 
notify the applicant in writing of his decision to approve or deny the 
application to activate the zone. If the application is denied, the 
notification will state the grounds for denial which need not be limited 
to those listed in Sec. 146.82. The decision of the port director will 
be the final Customs administrative determination in the matter. On 
approval of the application, a Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond shall 
be executed on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions of 
Sec. 113.73 of this chapter.
    (e) Activation. Upon the port director's approval of the application

considered activated; and merchandise may be admitted to the zone. 
Execution of the bond by an operator does not lessen the liability of 
the grantee to comply with the Act and implementing regulations.

    (a) Alteration of an activated area. An operator shall make written 
application to the port director for approval of an alteration of an 
activated area, including an alteration resulting from a zone boundary 
modification. The application must be accompanied by the supporting 
document requirements specified in Sec. 146.6, as applicable. The port 
director may review the security, suitability, and fitness of the area, 
and shall reply to the applicant as provided for in Sec. 146.6.
    (b) Deactivation or reactivation. A grantee, or an operator with the 
concurrence of a grantee, shall make written application to the port 
director for deactivation of a zone site, indicating by layout or

expense of the operator. The port director may require an accounting of 
all merchandise in a zone as a condition of approving the deactivation. 
A zone may be reactivated using the above procedure if a sufficient bond 
is on file under Sec. 146.6(d).
    (c) Suspension of activated site. When approval of an activated 
status has been suspended through the procedure in subpart G, the port

domestic status) to be transferred to another zone, a bonded warehouse, 
or other location where they may lawfully be stored, if the port 
director considers that transfer advisable to protect the revenue or 
administer any Federal law or regulation.
    (d) New bond. The port director may require an operator to furnish, 
on 10 days notice, a new Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond on Customs 
Form 301. If the operator fails to furnish the new bond, no more 
merchandise will be received in the zone in zone status. Merchandise in 
zone status (other than domestic status) will be removed at the risk and 
expense of the operator. A new bond may be required if (1) the activated 
zone area is substantially altered; (2) the character of merchandise 
admitted to the zone or operations performed in the zone are 
substantially

[[Page 93]]

changed; (3) the existing bond lacks good and sufficient surety; or (4) 
for any other reason that substantially affects the liability of the 
operator under the bond. Although a new bond may not be required, the 
operator shall obtain the consent of the surety to any material 
alteration in the boundaries of the zone.
    (e) New operator. A grantee of an activated zone site shall make 
written application to the port director for approval of a new operator, 
submitting with the application a certification by the new operator that 
the inventory control and recordkeeping system meets the requirements of 
subpart B, and a copy of the system procedures manual if different from 
the previous operator's manual. The port director may order an inquiry 
into the qualifications, character, and experience of the operator and 
its principal officers.
    (f) The bond in Sec. 146.6 shall be submitted by the operator before 
the operating agreement may become effective in respect to merchandise 
in zone status. The port director shall promptly notify the grantee, in 
writing, of the approval or disapproval of the application.
    (g) List of officers, employees, and other persons. The port 
director may make a written demand upon the operator to submit, within 
30 days after the date of the demand, a written list of the names, 
addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of 
officers and persons having a direct or indirect financial interest in 
the operator, and of persons employed in the carriage, receipt or 
delivery of merchandise in zone status, whether employed by the zone 
operator or a zone user. If a list was previously furnished, the port 
director may make a written demand for the same information in respect 
to new persons employed in the carriage, receipt, or delivery of zone 
status merchandise within 10 days after such employment. The list need 
not include employees of common or contract carriers transporting goods 
to or from the zone.

bond seal affixed under Sec. 18.4 of this chapter, or under any Customs 
order or directive, on any vehicle or intermodal container containing 
merchandise approved for admission to the zone upon its arrival at the 
zone; or to affix a Customs in-bond seal to any vehicle or intermodal 
container of merchandise for which an entry, withdrawal, or other 
approval document has been obtained for movement in-bond from the zone. 
The authorized affixing or breaking of that seal will be considered to 
have been done under Customs supervision. The operator shall report to 
the port director, upon arrival of the vehicle or container at the zone, 
any seal found to be broken, missing, or improperly affixed, and hold 
the vehicle or container and its contents intact pending instructions 
from the port director. If the operator does not obtain the written 
concurrence of the carrier as to the condition of the seal or delivering 
conveyance, the port director shall deem the seal or delivering 
conveyance to be intact.

merchandise (Sec. 146.34), or domestic merchandise admitted without 
permit (Sec. 146.43). The applicant for admission shall present the 
application to the port director and shall include a statistical copy on 
Customs Form 214-A for

that agency.
    (b) Supporting documents--(1) Commercial documentation. The 
applicant shall submit with the application two copies of an examination 
invoice meeting the requirements of subpart F, part 141, of this 
chapter, for any merchandise, other than that excepted in paragraph (a)

shall submit with the application a document similar to that which would 
be required as evidence of the right to make entry for merchandise in 
Customs territory under Sec. 141.11 or Sec. 141.12 of this chapter.
    (3) Release order. Merchandise will not be authorized for delivery 
by Customs to a zone until a release order has been executed by the 
carrier which brought the merchandise to the port, unless the 
merchandise is released back to that same carrier for delivery to the 
zone (see Sec. 141.11 of this chapter). When a release order is 
required, it will be made on any of the forms specified in Sec. 141.111 
of this chapter, or by the following statement attached to Customs Form 
214:

    Authority is hereby given to release the merchandise described in 
this

directly from the importing carrier, the application on Customs Form 214 
will be supported by an application to unlade on Customs Form 3171.
    (5) Other documentation. The port director may require additional 
information or documentation as needed to conduct an examination of 
merchandise under Customs selective entry processing criteria, or to 
determine whether the merchandise is admissible to the zone.
    (c) Conditions for issuance of a permit. The port director will 
issue a permit for admission of merchandise to a zone when:
    (1) The application is properly executed and includes the zone

unlading, the zone, or other location designated by the port director, 
except for merchandise for direct delivery to a zone under Secs. 146.39 
and 146.40. The merchandise may be examined as if it were to be entered 
for consumption or warehouse; and
    (4) All requirements have been fulfilled.
    (d) Blanket application for admission of merchandise.  Merchandise 
may be admitted to a zone under blanket application upon presentation of 
a Customs Form 214 covering more than one shipment of merchandise. A 
blanket application for admission is for:
    (1) Shipments which arrive under one transportation entry as 
described in Sec. 141.55 of this chapter, or
    (2) Shipments which are destined to the same zone applicant on a

zone for manipulation and return to Customs territory under Customs 
supervision, pursuant to section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1562), and Sec. 19.11 of this chapter. That merchandise will not 
be considered within the purview of the Act but will be treated as

considered applicable, but the merchandise will remain subject to any 
requirements necessary for the enforcement of section 562 and other 
Customs laws while in the zone.


<R05>
Sec. 146.34  Merchandise transiting a zone.

    The following procedure is applicable when merchandise is to be

has reason to believe that the merchandise will not be moved promptly 
from the zone or will be made the subject of an application for 
admission in accordance with Sec. 146.32(a).
    (c) Treatment of merchandise. Upon the issuance of a permit to lade, 
or unlade, the merchandise will be treated as though the lading or 
unlading were in the Customs territory.

zone must be made the subject of an application for admission in 
accordance with Sec. 146.32, or it must be removed from the zone.


<R05>
Sec. 146.35  Temporary deposit in a zone; incomplete documentation.

    (a) General. Temporary deposit of merchandise in a zone is allowed 
in circumstances where the information or documentation necessary to 
complete the Customs Form 214 is not available at the time of arrival of 
merchandise within the jurisdiction of the port. The merchandise will be 
subject to examination as provided in Sec. 146.36.
    (b) Application. An application for temporary deposit will be made 
to the port director on a properly signed and uniquely numbered Customs 
Form 214, annotated clearly ``Temporary Deposit in a Zone''.
    (c) Conditions. Merchandise temporarily deposited under the 
provisions of this section has no zone status and is considered to be in

    (1) Be physically segregated from all other zone merchandise;
    (2) Be held under the bond and at the risk of the operator; and
    (3) Be manipulated only to the extent necessary to obtain sufficient 
information about the merchandise to file the appropriate admission or 
entry documentation.
    (d) Approval. The port director shall approve the application for 
temporary deposit of merchandise in a zone if the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met.
    (e) Submission of Customs Form 214. A complete and accurate Customs

thereafter; or
    (2) Submitted on Customs Form 5931 under the provisions of subpart 
A, part 158, of this chapter within 20 days after admission of the 
merchandise. The operator may file a Customs Form 5931 on behalf of the 
person who applied for admission of merchandise to the zone.
    (d) Supervision of merchandise. The port director may authorize the 
receipt of zone status merchandise at a zone without physical 
supervision by a Customs officer (see Sec. 146.3). In that case, the 
operator shall supervise the receipt of merchandise into the zone, 
report the receipt and condition of the merchandise, and mark packages 
with the unique Customs Form 214 number so that the merchandise can be 
traced to a particular Customs Form 214. Packages that are accounted for 
under a Customs-authorized inventory method other than specific 
identification, need not be marked with a unique Customs Form 214 number 
but must be adequately identified so Customs can conduct an inventory 
count. The operator shall submit the Custom Form 214 to Customs at the 
location specified by the port director.


<R05>
Sec. 146.38  Certificate of arrival of merchandise.

    Whenever a certificate prepared by Customs as to the arrival of any 
merchandise in a zone is required by a Federal agency, the port director 
shall issue the document certifying only that authorization to deliver 
the merchandise to a zone has been made. The operator shall issue a 
certificate of arrival of merchandise at a zone.


<R05>
Sec. 146.39  Direct delivery procedures.

    (a) General. This procedure is for delivery of merchandise to a zone 
without prior application and approval on Customs Form 214.
    (b) Application. An operator, meeting the criteria of paragraph (c) 
of this section, shall file a written application with the port director 
at least 30 days before the special procedure is to become effective. 
The application will describe the merchandise to be handled or 
processed, and the kind of operation which it will undergo in the zone.
    (c) Criteria. The port director shall approve the application if the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The merchandise is not restricted or of a type which requires 
Customs examination or documentation review before or upon its arrival 
at the zone;
    (2) The merchandise to be admitted to the zone, and the operations 
to be conducted therein, are known well in advance, are predictable and 
stable over the long term, and are relatively fixed in variety by the 
nature of the business conducted at the site; and
    (3) The operator is the owner or purchaser of the goods.
    (d) Application decision. The port director shall promptly notify 
the operator, in writing, of Customs decision on

[[Page 100]]

the application. If the application is denied, the port director shall 
specify the reason for denial in his reply. The port director's decision 
will constitute the final Customs administrative determination 
concerning the application.
    (e) Revocation of approval. The port director may revoke the 
approval given under this section if it becomes necessary for Customs 
routinely to examine the merchandise or documentation before or upon 
admission to the zone.


<R05>
Sec. 146.40  Operator responsibilities for direct delivery.

    (a) Arrival of conveyance. Upon arrival at a subzone or zone site of 
a conveyance containing foreign merchandise, the operator shall:
    (1) Collect in-bond or cartage documentation from the carrier;
    (2) Check the condition of any seal affixed to the conveyance, and 
if broken, missing or improperly affixed, notify the port director and 
receive instructions before unloading the merchandise;
    (3) Check each incoming in-bond and cartage shipment to determine if 
the manifested quantity or the quantity on the cartage document agrees 
with the quantity actually received;
    (4) Sign and date the in-bond or cartage documentation to accept 
responsibility for the merchandise under the Foreign Trade Zone 
Operator's Bond and to relieve the carrier of responsibility.
    (5) Forward the in-bond or cartage documentation so as to reach the 
port director within 2 working days after the date of arrival of the 
conveyance at the subzone or zone site;
    (6) Maintain a file of open in-bond manifests in chronological order 
of date of conveyance arrival to identify shipments that have arrived 
but the entire contents of which have not been admitted to the subzone 
or zone site; and
    (7) Notify the port director, by annotation on the Customs Form 214, 
when the entire contents of a shipment have been admitted.
    (b) Transportation by operator. If merchandise is transported to a 
subzone or zone site by the foreign trade zone operator from a location 
in the district (see definition of ``district'' at Sec. 112.1) in which 
the subzone or zone site is situated, the merchandise is deemed admitted 
at the time the foreign trade zone operator picks it up. At the time of 
pick-up, the operator is responsible for:
    (1) Receipting for the merchandise and recording on the appropriate 
document any discrepancies regarding quantity, condition or the status 
of the seals;
    (2) Transporting the merchandise to the zone or subzone; and
    (3) Ensuring that the zone records reflect that the merchandise is 
received in the zone.
    (c) Admission of merchandise: alternative procedures--(1) Cumulative 
Customs Form 214. If the operator has an agreement with the Bureau of 
Census for direct transmittal of statistical information, he shall 
submit to the port director each business day a properly signed and 
uniquely numbered Customs Form 214 listing all merchandise except for 
domestic status merchandise admitted under Sec. 146.43 recorded into the 
inventory control and recordkeeping system during the previous business 
day. The Customs Form 214 must contain a list of all in-bond (I.T.) 
numbers or the unique number of any cartage document, as well as the 
number of invoices for each I.T. or cartage document, pertaining to 
merchandise which has been entered into the system.
    (2) Individual Customs Form 214. If a cumulative Customs Form 214 is 
not submitted as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
operator shall file with the port director each business day an 
individual Customs Form 214 and 214-A covering each shipment recorded 
into the inventory control and recordkeeping system during the previous 
business day. The forms shall be submitted within 10 days after the end 
of the month in which the merchandise was received in the zone, and no 
extension beyond that time will be approved by the port director.
    (3) General order. Merchandise which is not admitted into a subzone 
or zone site as provided in this section within 5 working days after its 
arrival there may be sent to general order unless:

[[Page 101]]

    (i) The port director grants the operator's request for an extension 
of the 5 working day period; or
    (ii) The importer of record files an appropriate Customs entry for 
the mechandise and removes it from the zone premises.
    (4) Inventory control and recordkeeping system. The operator shall 
establish and maintain a continuing input quality control program to 
ensure that information concerning merchandise in admission documents, 
verified or corrected by counts and checks, is accurately recorded in 
the inventory control and recordkeeping system. Quantities recorded in 
the system, after allowance by the port director for any discrepancies, 
will be the quantities of merchandise for which the operator shall be 
held liable under its bond for admission to the subzone or zone site. A 
discrepancy involving a within-case shortage (or overage) need not be 
reported on Customs Form 5931, if the operator is able to report that 
information in another manner so that the port director can determine 
whether there is liability for the discrepancy under the bond of any 
party to the importation.

<R05>
Sec. 146.41  Privileged foreign status.

    (a) General. Foreign merchandise which has not been manipulated or 
manufactured so as to effect a change in tariff classification will be 
given status as privileged foreign merchandise on proper application to 
the port director.
    (b) Application. Each application for this status will be made on 
Customs Form 214 at the time of filing the application for admission of 
the merchandise into a zone or at any time thereafter before the 
merchandise has been manipulated or manufactured in the zone in a manner 
which has effected a change in tariff classification.
    (c) Supporting documentation. Each applicant for this status shall 
submit to the port director, with the application, an invoice notated as 
provided for in Sec. 141.90 of this chapter.
    (d) Determination of duties and taxes. Upon receipt of the 
application and accompanying invoice, the port director may examine the 
merchandise to determine whether to approve the application. The 
merchandise will be subject to classification and valuation as provided 
in Sec. 146.65.
    (e) Status as privileged foreign merchandise binding. A status as 
privileged foreign merchandise cannot be abandoned and remains 
applicable to the merchandise even if changed in form by manipulation or 
manufacture, except in the case of recoverable waste (see 
Sec. 146.42(b)), as long as the merchandise remains within the purview 
of the Act. However, privileged foreign merchandise may be exported or 
withdrawn for supplies, equipment, or repair material of vessels or 
aircraft without the payment of taxes and duties, in accordance with 
Secs. 146.67 and 146.69.


<R05>
Sec. 146.42  Nonprivileged foreign status.

    All of the following will have the status of nonprivileged foreign 
merchandise:
    (a) Foreign merchandise. Foreign merchandise properly in a zone 
which does not have the status of privileged foreign merchandise or of 
zone-restricted merchandise;
    (b) Waste. Waste recovered from any manipulation or manufacture of 
privileged foreign merchandise in a zone; and
    (c) Certain domestic merchandise. Domestic merchandise in a zone, 
which by reason of noncompliance with the regulations in this part has 
lost its identity as domestic merchandise, will be treated as foreign 
merchandise. Any domestic merchandise will be considered to have lost 
its identity if the port director determines that it cannot be 
identified positively by a Customs officer as domestic merchandise on 
the basis of an examination of the articles or consideration of any 
proof that may be submitted promptly by a party-in-interest.


<R05>
Sec. 146.43  Domestic status.

    (a) General. Domestic status may be granted to merchandise:

[[Page 102]]

    (1) The growth, product, or manufacture of the U.S. on which all 
internal-revenue taxes, if applicable, have been paid;
    (2) Previously imported and on which duty and tax has been paid; or
    (3) Previously entered free of duty and tax.
    (b) Application. No application or permit is required for the 
admission of domestic status merchandise, including domestic packing and 
repair material, to a zone, except upon order of the Commissioner of 
Customs. No application or permit is required for the manipulation, 
manufacture, exhibition, destruction, or transfer to Customs territory 
of domestic status merchandise, including packing and repair materials, 
except: (1) When it is mixed or combined with merchandise in another 
zone status, or (2) upon order of the Commissioner of Customs. When the 
Commissioner orders a permit to be required for domestic status 
merchandise, he may also order the procedures, forms, and terms under 
which the permit will be received and processed.
    (c) Return of merchandise of Customs territory. Upon compliance with 
the provisions of this section, any of the merchandise specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, may subsequently be returned to Customs 
territory free of quotas, duty, or tax.


<R05>
Sec. 146.44  Zone-restricted status.

    (a) General. Merchandise taken into a zone for the sole purpose of 
exportation, destruction (except destruction of distilled spirits, 
wines, and fermented malt liquors), or storage will be given zone-
restricted status on proper application. That status may be requested at 
any time the merchandise is located in a zone, but cannot be abandoned 
once granted. Merchandise in zone-restricted status may not be removed 
to Customs territory for domestic consumption except where the Board 
determines the return to be in the public interest.
    (b) Application. Application for zone-restricted status will be made 
on Customs Form 214.
    (c) Merchandise considered exported--(1) For Customs purposes. If 
the applicant desires a zone-restricted status in order that the 
merchandise may be considered exported for the purpose of any Customs 
law, all pertinent Customs requirements relating to an actual 
exportation shall be complied with as though the admission of the 
merchandise into zone constituted a lading on an exporting carrier at a 
port of final exit from the U.S. Any declaration or form required for 
actual exportation will be modified to show the merchandise has been 
deposited in a zone in lieu of actual exportation, and a copy of the 
approved Customs Form 214 may be accepted in lieu of any proof of 
shipment required in cases of actual exportation.
    (2) For other purposes. If the merchandise is to be considered 
exported for the purpose of any Federal law other than the Customs laws, 
the port director shall be satisfied that all pertinent laws, 
regulations, and rules administered by the Federal agency concerned have 
been complied with before the Customs Form 214 is approved.
    (d) Merchandise entered for warehousing transferred to a zone. 
Merchandise entered for warehousing and transferred to a zone, other 
than temporarily for manipulation and return to Customs territory as 
provided for in Sec. 146.33, will have the status of zone-restricted 
merchandise when admitted into the zone. The application on Customs Form 
214 will state that zone-restricted status is desired for the 
merchandise.

<R05>
Sec. 146.51  Customs control of merchandise.

in Sec. 146.43, will be manipulated, manufactured, exhibited, destroyed, 
or transferred from a zone in any manner or for any purpose, except 
under Customs permit as provided for in this part. The port director may 
require segregation of any zone status merchandise whenever necessary to 
protect the revenue or properly administer U.S. laws or regulations.

[[Page 103]]


<R05>
Sec. 146.52  Manipulation, manufacture, exhibition or destruction; Customs Form 216.

    (a) Application. Prior to any action, the operator shall file with 
the port director an application (or blanket application) on Customs 
Form 216 for permission to manipulate, manufacture, exhibit, or destroy 
merchandise in a zone. After Customs approves the application (or 
blanket application), the operator will retain in his recordkeeping 
system the approved application.
    (b) Approval. (1) The port director shall approve the application 
unless (i) the proposed operation would be in violation of law or 
regulation; (ii) the place designated for its performance is not 
suitable for preventing confusion of the identity or status of the 
merchandise, or for safeguarding the revenue; (iii) the port director is 
not satisfied that the destruction will be effective; or (iv) the 
Executive Secretary of the Board has not granted approval of a new 
manufacturing operation.
    (2) The port director is authorized to approve a blanket application 
for a period of up to one year for a continuous or repetitive operation. 
The port director may disapprove or revoke approval of any application, 
or may require the operator to file an individual application.
    (c) Appeal of adverse ruling. If an approved application is 
subsequently rescinded by the port director for any reason, the 
applicant or grantee may appeal the adverse ruling pursuant to the 
hearing provisions of Sec. 146.82(b)(2). The rescission shall remain in 
effect pending the decision on the appeal.
    (d) Report results--(1) Separate application. The operator shall 
report on Customs Form 216 the results of an approved manipulation, 
manufacture, exhibition, or certification of destruction (other than by 
a blanket application), unless the port director chooses physically to 
supervise the operation.
    (2) Blanket application. The operator shall maintain a record of an 
approved manipulation, manufacture, exhibition, or certification of 
destruction, in its inventory control and recordkeeping system so as to 
provide an accounting and audit trail of the merchandise through the 
approved operation.
    (e) Destruction. The port director may permit destruction to be done 
outside the zone, in whole or in part and at the risk and expense of the 
applicant, and under such conditions as are necessary to protect the 
revenue, if proper destruction cannot be accomplished within the zone. 
Any residue from the destruction within a zone, which is determined to 
be without commercial value, may be removed to Customs territory for 
disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 146.53  Shortages and overages.

    (a) Report required. The operator shall report, in writing, to the 
port director upon identification, as such, of any:
    (1) Theft or suspected theft of merchandise;
    (2) Merchandise not properly admitted to the zone; or
    (3) Shortage of one percent (1%) or more of the quantity of 
merchandise in a lot or covered by a unique identifier, if the missing 
merchandise would have been subject to duties and taxes of $100 or more 
upon entry into the Customs territory. The operator shall record upon 
identification all shortages and overages, whether or not they are 
required to be reported to the port director at that time, in its 
inventory control and recordkeeping system. The operator shall record 
all shortages and overages as required in the annual reconciliation 
report under Sec. 146.25.
    (b) Certain domestic merchandise. Except in a case of theft or 
suspected theft, the operator need not file a report with the port 
director, or note in the annual reconciliation report, any shortage or 
overage concerning domestic status merchandise for which no permit is 
required.
    (c) Shortage--(1) Operator responsibility. The operator is 
responsible under its Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond for any loss of 
merchandise or for any merchandise which cannot be located or otherwise 
accounted for (except domestic status merchandise for which no permit is 
required), unless the port director is satisfied that the merchandise 
was:
    (i) Never received in the zone;
    (ii) Removed from the zone under proper permit;

[[Page 104]]

    (iii) Not removed from the zone; or
    (iv) Lost or destroyed in the zone through fire or other casualty, 
evaporation, spillage, leakage, absorption, or similar cause, and did 
not enter the commerce of the U.S.
    (2) Liability for duty and taxes. Upon demand of the port director, 
the operator shall make entry for and pay duties and taxes applicable to 
merchandise which is missing or otherwise not accounted for.
    (d) Overage. The person with the right to make entry shall file, 
within 5 days after identification of an overage, an application for 
admission of the merchandise to the zone on Customs Form 214 or file a 
Customs entry for the merchandise. If a Customs Form 214 or a Customs 
entry is not timely filed, and the port director has not granted an 
extension of the time provided, the merchandise shall be sent to general 
order.
    (e) Damage. The liability of the operator under its Foreign Trade 
Zone Operator's Bond may be adjusted for the loss of value resulting 
from damage to merchandise occurring in the zone. The operator shall 
segregate, mark, and otherwise secure damaged merchandise to preserve 
its identity as damaged merchandise.


<R04>
             Subpart F--Transfer of Merchandise From a Zone


<R05>
Sec. 146.61  Constructive transfer to Customs territory.

    The port director shall accept receipt of any entry in proper form 
provided under this subpart, and the merchandise described therein will 
be considered to have been constructively transferred to Customs 
territory at that time, even though the merchandise remains physically 
in the zone. If the entry is thereafter rejected or cancelled, the 
merchandise will be considered at that time to be constructively 
transferred back into the zone in its previous zone status.


<R05>
Sec. 146.62  Entry.

    (a) General. Entry for foreign merchandise which is to be 
transferred from a zone, or removed from a zone for exportation or 
transportation to another port, for consumption or warehouse, will be 
made on Customs Form 7512, Customs Form 3461, Customs Form 7501, or 
other applicable Customs forms. If entry is made on Customs Form 3461, 
the person making entry shall file an entry summary for all the 
merchandise covered by the Customs Form 3461 within 10 working days 
after the time of entry.
    (b) Documentation. (1) Customs Form 7501 or the entry summary will 
be accompanied by the entry documentation, including invoices as 
provided in parts 141 and 142 of this chapter. The person with the right 
to make entry shall submit any other supporting documents required by 
law or regulations that relate to the transferred merchandise and 
provide the information necessary to support the admissibility, the 
declared values, quantity, and classification of the merchandise. If the 
declared values are predicated on estimates or estimated costs, that 
information must be clearly stated in writing at the time an entry or 
entry summary is filed.
    (2) Customs Form 7512 for merchandise to be transferred to another 
port or zone or for exportation shall state that the merchandise covered 
is foreign trade zone merchandise; give the number of the zone from 
which the merchandise was transferred; state the status of the 
merchandise; and, if applicable, bear the notation or endorsement 
provided for in Sec. 146.64(c), Sec. 146.66(b), or Sec. 146.70(c).
    (c) Waiver of supporting documents. The port director may waive 
presentation of an invoice and supporting documentation required in 
paragraph (b) of this section with the entry or entry summary, if 
satisfied that presentation of those documents would be impractical, and 
the person making entry or the operator either files invoices and 
supporting documentation with the port director or maintains and makes 
those records available for examination by Customs.


<R05>
Sec. 146.63  Entry for consumption.

    (a) Foreign merchandise. Merchandise in foreign status or composed 
in part of merchandise in foreign status may be entered for consumption 
from a zone.
    (b) Zone-restricted merchandise. Merchandise in a zone-restricted 
status

[[Page 105]]

may be entered for consumption only when the Board has ruled that 
merchandise can be entered for consumption.
    (c) Estimated production--(1) Weekly entry. When merchandise is 
manufactured or otherwise changed in a zone (exclusive of packing) to 
its physical condition as entered within 24 hours before physical 
transfer from the zone for consumption, the port director may allow the 
person making entry to file an entry on Customs Form 3461 for the 
estimated removals of merchandise during the calendar week. The Customs 
Form 3461 must be accompanied by a pro forma invoice or schedule showing 
the number of units of each type of merchandise to be removed during the 
week and their zone and dutiable values. Merchandise covered by an entry 
made under the provisions of this section will be considered to be 
entered and may be removed only when the port director has accepted the 
entry on Customs Form 3461. If the actual removals will exceed the 
estimate for the week, the person making entry shall file an additional 
Customs Form 3461 to cover the additional units before their removal 
from the zone. Notwithstanding that a weekly entry may be allowed, all 
merchandise will be dutiable as provided in Sec. 146.65. When estimated 
removals exceed actual removals, that excess merchandise will not be 
considered to have been entered or constructively transferred to the 
Customs territory.
    (2) Individual transfers. After acceptance of the weekly entry, 
individual transfers of merchandise covered by the entry may be made 
from the zone.
    (d) Textiles and textile products. Subject to the existing statutory 
authority of the Board, textiles and textile products admitted into a 
zone, regardless of whether the merchandise has privileged or 
nonprivileged foreign status, which would have been subject to quota or 
visa or export license requirements in their condition at the time of 
importation (if entered for consumption rather than admitted to a zone), 
may not be subsequently transferred into Customs territory for 
consumption if, during the time the merchandise is in the zone, there 
has been a change by manipulation, manufacture, or other means:
    (1) In the country of origin of the merchandise as defined by 
Sec. 12.130 of this chapter;
    (2) To exempt from quota or visa or export license requirements 
other than a change brought about by statute, treaty, executive order or 
Presidential proclamation; or
    (3) From one textile category to another textile category.


<R05>
Sec. 146.64  Entry for warehouse.

    (a) Foreign merchandise. Merchandise in privileged foreign status or 
composed in part of merchandise in privileged foreign status may not be 
entered for warehouse from a zone. Merchandise in nonprivileged foreign 
status containing no components in privileged foreign status may be 
entered for warehouse in the same or at a different port.
    (b) Zone-restricted merchandise. Foreign merchandise in zone-
restricted status may be entered for warehouse in the same or at a 
different port only for storage pending exportation, unless the Board 
has approved another disposition.
    (c) Textiles and textile products. Textiles and textile products 
which have been changed as provided for in Sec. 146.63(d) may be entered 
for warehouse only if the entry is endorsed by the port director to show 
that the merchandise may not be withdrawn for consumption.
    (d) Time limit. Merchandise may neither be placed nor remain in a 
Customs bonded warehouse after 5 years from the date of importation of 
the merchandise.


<R05>
Sec. 146.65  Classification, valuation, and liquidation.

    (a) Classification--(1) Privileged foreign merchandise. Privileged 
foreign merchandise provided for in this section will be subject to 
tariff classification according to its character, condition and 
quantity, at the rate of duty and tax in force on the date of filing, in 
complete and proper form, the application for privileged status. 
Classification of merchandise subject to a tariff-rate import quota will 
be made only at

[[Page 106]]

the higher non-quota duty rate in effect on the date privileged foreign 
status was granted. Notwithstanding the grant of privileged status, 
Customs may correct any misclassification of any such entered 
merchandise when it posts the bulletin notice of liquidation under 
Sec. 159.9 of this chapter.
    (2) Nonprivileged foreign merchandise. Nonprivileged foreign 
merchandise provided for in this section will be subject to tariff 
classification in accordance with its character, condition and quantity 
as constructively transferred to Customs territory at the time the entry 
or entry summary is filed with Customs.
    (b) Valuation--(1) Total zone value. The total zone value of 
merchandise provided for in this section will be determined in 
accordance with the principles of valuation contained in sections 402 
and 500 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Trade Agreements 
Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1500). The total zone value shall be that 
price actually paid or payable to the zone seller in the transaction 
that caused the merchandise to be transferred from the zone. Where there 
is no price paid or payable, the total zone value shall be the cost of 
all materials and zone processing costs related to the merchandise 
transferred from the zone.
    (2) Dutiable value. The dutiable value of merchandise provided for 
in this section shall be the price actually paid or payable for the 
merchandise in the transaction that caused the merchandise to be 
admitted into the zone, plus the statutory additions contained in 
section 402(b)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Trade 
Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 1401a(b)(1)), less, if included, 
international shipment and insurance costs and U.S. inland freight 
costs. If there is no such price actually paid or payable, or no 
reasonable representation of that cost or of the statutory additions, 
the dutiable value may be determined by excluding from the zone value 
any included zone costs of processing or fabrication, general expenses 
and profit and the international shipment and insurance costs and U.S. 
inland freight costs related to the merchandise transferred from the 
zone. The dutiable value of recoverable waste or scrap provided for in 
Sec. 146.42(b) will be the price actually paid or payable to the zone 
seller in the transaction that caused the recoverable waste or scrap to 
be transferred from the zone.
    (3) Allowance. An allowance in the dutiable value of zone 
merchandise may be made by the port director in accordance with the 
provisions of subparts B and C of part 158 of this chapter, for damage, 
deterioration, or casualty while the merchandise is in the zone.
    (c) Liquidation; extension to update cost data. When the declared 
value or values of the merchandise are based on an estimate or 
estimates, the person making entry may request an extension of 
liquidation pending the presentation of updated or actual cost data. A 
request for an extension may be granted at the discretion of the port 
director.

Sec. 146.66  Transfer of merchandise from one zone to another.

    (a) At the same port. A transfer of merchandise to another zone with 
a different operator at the same port (including a consolidated port) 
will be by a licensed cartman or a bonded carrier as provided for in 
Sec. 112.2(b) of this chapter or by the operator of the zone for which 
the merchandise is destined under an entry for immediate transportation 
on Customs Form 7512 or other appropriate form with a Customs Form 214 
filed at the destination zone. A transfer of merchandise between zone 
sites at the same port having the same operator may be made under a 
permit on CF 6043 or under a local control system approved by the port 
director wherein any loss of merchandise between sites will be treated 
as if the loss occurred in the zone.
    (b) At a different port. A transfer of merchandise from a zone at 
one port of entry to a zone at another port will be by bonded carrier 
under an entry for immediate transportation on Customs Form 7512. All 
copies of the entry must bear a notation that the merchandise is being 
transferred to another zone designated by its number.
    (c) Forwarding of merchandise history; documentation. When 
merchandise is

[[Page 107]]

transferred under the provisions of this section, the operator of the 
transferring zone shall provide the operator of the destination zone 
with the documented history of the merchandise being transferred.
    (1) The following documentation must accompany merchandise 
maintained under a lot inventory control system:
    (i) A copy of the original Customs Form(s) 214 with accompanying 
invoices for admission of the merchandise and all components thereof;
    (ii) A copy of any Customs Form 214 filed subsequent to admission to 
change the status of the merchandise or its components; and
    (iii) A copy of any Customs Form 216 to manipulate or manufacture 
the merchandise.
    (2) The following documentation must accompany merchandise not under 
a lot system, and not manufactured in a zone:
    (i) A copy of the original Customs Form(s) 214 with accompanying 
invoices for admission of the merchandise as attributed under the 
particular zone inventory method;
    (ii) A copy of any Customs Form 214 filed subsequent to admission to 
change the status of the merchandise as attributed under the particular 
zone inventory method; and
    (iii) A copy of any Customs Form 216 to manipulate the merchandise 
as attributed under the particular zone inventory method.
    (3) If the documents specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
are not presented, the operator of the transferring zone shall submit 
the following:
    (i) A statement of the zone value, dutiable value, quantity, 
description, unique identifier, and zone status (showing any changes of 
status after admission and whether the merchandise was manipulated so as 
to change its tariff classification) of all the merchandise in the 
shipment covered by the transportation entry; and
    (ii) A certification that the statement in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of 
this section, is true and that the information contained therein is 
contained in the inventory control and recordkeeping system of the 
transferring zone.
    (4) The following documentation must accompany merchandise not under 
a lot system, but manufactured in a zone:
    (i) A statement by the transferring zone operator of the zone value, 
dutiable value, quantity, description, unique identifier, and zone 
status of all the merchandise (and components thereof, where applicable) 
covered by the transportation entry. The statement will also show any 
change in zone status in the transferring zone and whether the 
merchandise has been manufactured or manipulated in the zone so as to 
change its tariff classification; and
    (ii) A certification by the operator of the transferring zone that 
the statement in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is true and the 
information therein is contained in the inventory control and 
recordkeeping system of the zone.
    (5) The operator of the transferring zone shall transmit the 
historical documentation of the merchandise to the receiving zone within 
10 working days after it has been delivered to the bonded carrier for 
transportation. The documentation will be referenced to the I.T. number 
covering the merchandise.
    (d) Arrival at destination zone. Upon arrival of the merchandise at 
the destination zone, it will be admitted under the procedure provided 
for in Sec. 146.32, except that no invoice or Customs examination will 
be required. When the historical documentation is received, the operator 
of the destination zone shall associate it with the Customs Form 214 for 
admission of the merchandise and incorporate that information into the 
zone inventory control and recordkeeping system.

Sec. 146.67  Transfer of merchandise for exportation.

    (a) Direct exportation. Any merchandise in a zone may be exported 
directly therefrom (without transfer into Customs territory) upon 
compliance with the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Immediate exportation. Each transfer of merchandise to the 
Customs territory for exportation at the port

[[Page 108]]

where the zone is located, will be made under an entry for immediate 
exportation on Customs Form 7512. The person making entry shall furnish 
an export bond on Customs Form 301 containing the bond conditions 
provided for in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter.
    (c) Transportation and exportation. Each transfer of merchandise to 
the Customs territory for transportation to and exportation from a 
different port, will be made under an entry for transportation and 
exportation on Customs Form 7512. The bonded carrier will be responsible 
for exportation of the merchandise in accordance with Sec. 18.26 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Textiles and textile products. Textiles and textile products 
which have been changed as provided for in Sec. 146.63(d) may be 
exported and returned to Customs territory for warehousing provided the 
entry for warehouse is endorsed by the port director to show that the 
merchandise may not be withdrawn for consumption.
    (e) Merchandise produced or manufactured in a zone and returned to 
Customs territory after exportation. Merchandise produced or 
manufactured in a zone and exported without having been transferred to 
Customs territory other than for exportation or for transportation and 
exportation will be subject, on its return to Customs territory, to the 
duties and taxes applicable to like articles of wholly foreign origin, 
unless it is conclusively established that it was produced or 
manufactured exclusively with the use of domestic merchandise. The 
identity of the domestic merchandise must have been maintained in 
accordance with the provisions of this part, in which case that 
merchandise will be subject to the provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter 
I, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).

51263, Dec. 21, 1988


<R05>
Sec. 146.68  Transfer for transportation or exportation; estimated production.

    (a) Weekly permit. The port director may allow the person making 
entry for merchandise provided for in Sec. 146.63(c) to file an 
application for a weekly permit to enter and release merchandise during 
a calendar week for exportation, transportation, or transportation and 
exportation. The application will be on Customs Form 7512 stating at the 
top the words ``Application for Weekly Zone Permit,'' and will be filed 
with the port director. The application must be accompanied by a pro 
forma invoice or schedule like that required in Sec. 146.63(c)(1). If 
actual transfers will exceed the estimate for the week, the person with 
the right to make entry shall file a supplemental Customs Form 7512 to 
cover the additional merchandise to be transferred from the subzone or 
zone site. No merchandise covered by the weekly permit may be 
transferred from the zone before approval of the application by the port 
director.
    (b) Individual entries. After approval of the application for a 
weekly permit by the port director, the person making entry will be 
authorized to execute individual Customs Forms 7512 for exportation, 
transportation, or transportation and exportation of the merchandise 
covered by permit. Upon transfer of the merchandise, the operator shall 
obtain a receipt from the carrier on Customs Form 7512 to ensure its 
assumption of liability under the carrier's or cartman's bond. Customs 
will consider the time of entry to be when the removing carrier signs 
the receipt for the merchandise. The operator shall give the bonded 
carrier a copy of the individual Customs Form 7512 and the destination 
copy (Customs Form 7512-C), as provided for in Sec. 18.2(c) of this 
chapter. The operator also shall ensure that the port director receives 
a copy of the Customs Form 7512 and the origin copy (Customs Form 7512-
C) by the end of the next working day after the carrier has receipted 
for the merchandise.
    (c) Statement of merchandise entered. The person making entry for 
merchandise under an approved weekly permit shall file with the port 
director, by the close of business on the second working day of the week 
following the week designated on the permit, a statement of the 
merchandise entered under that permit. The statement must list each 
Customs Form 7512 by its unique I.T.

[[Page 109]]

number, and will provide a reconciliation of the quantities on the 
weekly permit with the manifested quantities on the individual Customs 
Forms 7512 submitted to Customs, as well as an explanation of any 
discrepancy.


<R05>
Sec. 146.69  Supplies, equipment, and repair material for vessels or aircraft.

    (a) General. Any merchandise which may be withdrawn duty and tax 
free in Customs territory under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317), and under Secs. 10.59 through 10.65 
of this chapter, may similarly be transferred from a zone, regardless of 
its zone status, under those statutes and regulations. Each transfer 
from a zone for delivery to a qualified vessel or aircraft, will be made 
on Customs Form 5512 (see Sec. 10.60 of this chapter). The person making 
entry shall furnish a bond on Customs Form 301 containing the bond 
conditions provided for in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter.
    (b) Merchandise for delivery within zone. Upon acceptance of the 
entry and bond, the port director shall release the merchandise to the 
operator for delivery to the qualified vessel or aircraft for lading in 
the zone.
    (c) Merchandise for delivery outside zone. Upon acceptance of the 
entry and bond, the port director shall release the merchandise to the 
operator for delivery to the bonded cartmen, lighterman, or carrier, for 
transportation through the Customs territory to the qualified lading 
vessel or aircraft.


<R05>
Sec. 146.70  Transfer of zone-restricted merchandise into Customs territory.

    (a) General. Zone-restricted merchandise may be transferred to 
Customs territory only for entry for exportation, for entry for 
transportation and exportation, for warehousing pending exportation, for 
destruction (except destruction of distilled spirits, wines and 
fermented malt liquors), for transfer from one zone to another, or for 
delivery to a qualified vessel or aircraft or as ground equipment of a 
qualified aircraft under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317), unless the Board has ruled that the 
return of the merchandise to Customs territory for domestic consumption 
is in the public interest. With Board approval (See 15 CFR part 400), 
that merchandise may be entered for consumption, for warehousing, for 
immediate transportation without appraisement, or under any other 
provision of the Customs laws, unless the Board has specified the form 
of entry to be made.
    (b) For consumption. If the return of zone-restricted merchandise to 
Customs territory for consumption has been ruled by the Board to be in 
the public interest, the entry shall be endorsed by the port director to 
show the authority under which it was made, and that the merchandise is 
subject to the provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter I, Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
    (c) For warehousing. Zone-restricted merchandise may be transferred 
from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse for storage pending 
exportation. The Customs Form 7501 shall be endorsed by the port 
director to show that the merchandise may not be withdrawn for 
consumption. In the case of zone-restricted merchandise transported in 
bond to another port for warehousing and exportation, Customs Form 7512 
shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise is 
foreign trade zone merchandise in zone-restricted status, which shall be 
entered for warehouse with proper endorsement on Customs Form 7501, and 
which may not be withdrawn for consumption. Zone-restricted merchandise 
transferred from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse may not be 
manipulated, except for packing or unpacking incidental to exportation.
    (d) For other purposes. Upon acceptance of an entry or withdrawal 
for zone-restricted merchandise for any purpose other than that 
described in a Board order, the entry shall be endorsed by the person 
making entry to show that actual exportation of the merchandise is 
required by the fourth proviso to section 3 of the Act, as amended, or 
the entry endorsed to require delivery to a qualified vessel or 
aircraft, under section 309 or 317, Tariff

[[Page 110]]

Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317).

51263, Dec. 21, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 146.71  Release and removal of merchandise from zone.

    (a) General. Except as provided for in Sec. 146.43, no merchandise 
will be transferred from a zone without a Customs permit on the 
appropriate entry or withdrawal form or other document as required in 
this part. This port director may authorize transfer from a zone without 
physical supervision or examination by a Customs officer. Upon issuance 
of a permit, the port director will authorize delivery of the 
merchandise only to the operator, who then may release the merchandise 
to the importer or carrier.
    (b) Liability for discrepancy. When a transfer is not physically 
supervised by a Customs officer, the operator will be relieved of 
responsibility only for the merchandise in a zone in the condition and 
quantity as shown on the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form. 
The operator will be relieved of responsibility only if it receives the 
signed receipt on the document of the importer or the carrier named in 
that document. The responsibility of the operator may be adjusted by any 
discrepancy report made jointly by the operator and the bonded cartman, 
lighterman, or carrier, or the importer, and signed by the above or an 
authorized representative within 15 days after transfer of the 
merchandise from the zone. Any adjustment must be noted on the permit 
copy of the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form or document. A 
copy of any joint report of discrepancy must be submitted to the port 
director within 10 working days of signing by the parties.
    (c) Time limit. Except in the case of articles for use in a zone, 
merchandise for which a Customs permit for transfer to Customs territory 
has been issued must be physically removed from the zone within 5 
working days of issuance of that permit. The port director, upon request 
of the operator, may extend that period for good cause. Merchandise 
awaiting removal within the required time limit will not be further 
manipulated or manufactured in the zone, but will be segregated or 
otherwise identified by the operator as merchandise that has been 
constructively transferred to Customs territory.
    (d) Retention or return of merchandise to zone for consumption. (1) 
The port director shall cancel any entry for consumption where: (i) The 
merchandise is not removed from the zone within the period specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section, or (ii) the merchandise was removed from 
the zone but did not enter the commerce of the U.S. in Customs territory 
and was subsequently readmitted to a zone in domestic status. If the 
port director has reason to believe any new entry would be cancelled 
under the provisions of this paragraph, he may reject the entry or 
demand a written stipulation, as a condition of entry acceptance, that 
the merchandise will not be returned to a zone in domestic status. 
Merchandise covered by an entry which has been cancelled under this 
paragraph shall be restored to its last foreign status.
    (2) A component of merchandise which has been entered, but not 
physically removed from a zone, shall be restored to its last zone 
status, provided the port director determines that the component was 
included in the entry through clerical error, mistake of fact, or other 
inadvertence not amounting to an error in the construction of the law. 
Such an error, including that in appraisement of any entry or 
liquidation due to the above circumstances, may be corrected pursuant to 
section 520(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1520(c)(1)), in accordance with the procedures described in part 173 of 
this chapter. If the port director decides there has been no error, 
mistake, or inadvertence, or that the information was not timely 
provided, the component will be considered as an overage and subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 146.53(d).
    (3) When merchandise which has been entered for consumption is 
subsequently returned to a zone for a reason other than that specified 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, it shall be admitted in domestic 
status.

              Subpart G--Penalties; Suspension; Revocation


<R05>
Sec. 146.81  Penalties.

    (a) Amount. Upon violation of the Act, or any regulation issued 
under the Act, by the grantee, or any officer, agent, operator or 
employee thereof, the person responsible for or permitting the violation 
shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000. Each day during 
which a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. 
Liquidated damages, where applicable, will be imposed in addition to the 
fine (19 U.S.C. 81s).
    (b) Review. All fines assessed by the port director under this 
section will be reviewed by the Director, International Trade Compliance 
Division, Headquarters, to determine whether further action against the 
grantee or operator, such as suspension or a recommendation for 
revocation of the grant, is warranted.

[T.D. 86-16, 51 FR 5049, Feb. 11, 1986, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 
46115, Sept. 10, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 146.82  Suspension.

    (a) For cause. The port director may suspend for cause the activated 
status of a zone or zone site, or the privilege to admit, manufacture, 
manipulate, exhibit, destroy, transfer or remove merchandise at a zone 
or zone site for a period not to exceed 90 days. Upon order of the Board 
the suspension may be continued. If appropriate, the suspension may be 
limited to an individual user or users and not to the zone or zone site 
as a whole, or may be limited to a particular activity of an operator or 
user, such as suspension of the privilege to admit merchandise or the 
privilege to manufacture. An action to suspend will be taken in 
accordance with the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section if:
    (1) The approval of the application to activate the zone was 
obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact;
    (2) The operator neglects or refuses to obey any proper order of a 
Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relating to 
the operation or administration of a zone;
    (3) The operator, or any officer of a corporation which has been 
granted the right to operate a zone, is convicted of or has commited 
acts which would constitute a felony, or misdemeanor involving theft, 
smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment 
status of the corporate officer (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, 
or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of 
a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, 
resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not 
preclude application of this provision;
    (4) The operator fails to furnish a current list of names, 
addresses, or other information as required by Sec. 146.7;
    (5) The operator does not provide a secure facility or properly 
safeguard merchandise within a zone;
    (6)  [Reserved]
    (7) The operator, or any officer, agent, or employee of the 
operator, discloses to an unauthorized person proprietary information 
contained on a Customs form or in the inventory control and 
recordkeeping system; or
    (8) The inventory control and recordkeeping system is impaired to 
the point where the identity of merchandise in zone status has been lost 
and cannot be reestablished without a suspension of zone operations.
    (b) Procedure--(1) Notice. The port director may, at any time, serve 
notice, in writing, upon an operator to show cause why its right to 
continue operation of a zone should not be suspended or why an 
individual user or activities of an individual user should not be 
suspended, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section. The notice 
will advise the operator of the grounds for the proposed action and will 
afford the operator an opportunity to respond, in writing, within 15 
days after receipt of the notice. Thereafter, the port director shall 
consider the allegations and any response made by the operator and issue 
a decision, unless the operator requests a hearing in the matter.
    (2) Hearing. If the operator requests a hearing, it will be held 
before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Customs or 
his designee within 30 days following the operator's request. The 
operator may be represented by

[[Page 112]]

counsel at the hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in 
the proceeding, including substantiation of the allegations and the 
response thereto, will be presented. The right of cross-examination will 
be available to both parties. A stenographic record of the proceeding 
will be made and a copy will be delivered to the operator. At the 
conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly 
all papers and the stenographic record of the hearing to the Assistant 
Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, together with a 
recommendation for final action.
    (3) Decision of Assistant Commissioner. Within 10 calendar days 
after delivery to the operator of a copy of the stenographic record of 
the hearing, the operator may submit to the Assistant Commissioner, 
Office of Field Operations, or designee, in writing any additional views 
or arguments. The Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or 
designee, shall then render a written decision stating his reasons 
therefor. That decision will be served on the operator and will be 
considered the final Customs administrative action in the case.
    (4) Grantee. If the grantee of the zone is not the operator, a copy 
of the notice to show cause will be served upon the grantee. The 
grantee, as a party-in-interest, may join the operator in any 
proceedings under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 146.83  Revocation of zone grant.

    (a) Recommendation of port director. The port director may at any 
time recommend to the Board that the privilege of establishing, 
operating, and maintaining a zone or subzone under Customs jurisdiction 
be revoked for willful and repeated violations of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
81r). If the port director believes that a substantial question of law 
exists as to whether willful and repeated violations of the Act have 
occurred, that officer may request internal advice under the provisions 
of part 177 of this chapter from the Director, Tariff Classification 
Appeals Division, Headquarters. A recommendation to the Board that a 
zone or subzone grant be revoked does not preclude, and may be in 
addition to, any liquidated damages, penalty, or suspension for cause.
    (b) Decision of the Board. The procedure for revocation of a grant, 
the decision of the Board, and appeal is covered by the provisions of 
the Act and title 15, chapter IV, part 400, Code of Federal Regulations.

        Subpart H--Petroleum Refineries in Foreign-Trade Subzones

    Source:  T.D. 95-35, 60 FR 20632, Apr. 27, 1995, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 146.91  Applicability.

    This subpart applies only to a petroleum refinery (as defined 
herein) engaged in refining petroleum in a foreign-trade zone or 
subzone. Further, the provisions relating to zones generally, which are 
set forth elsewhere in this part, including documentation and document 
retention requirements, and entry procedures, such as weekly entry, 
shall apply as well to a refinery subzone, insofar as applicable to and 
not inconsistent with the specific provisions of this subpart. It does 
not cover zone-to-zone transfers in which the fact of removal from one 
zone is ignored.


<R05>
Sec. 146.92  Definitions.

    (a) Attribution. ``Attribution'' means the association of a final 
product with its source material.
    (b) Feedstocks. ``Feedstocks'' means crude petroleum or intermediate 
product that is used in a petroleum refinery to make a final product.
    (c) Feedstock factor. ``Feedstock factor'' means the relative value 
of final products utilizing T.D. 66-16 (see Sec. 146.92(h)), and which 
takes into account any volumetric loss or gain.
    (d) Final product. ``Final product'' means any petroleum product 
that is produced in a refinery subzone and thereafter removed therefrom 
or consumed within the zone.
    (e) Manufacturing period. ``Manufacturing period'' means a period 
selected by the refiner which must be no more than a calendar month 
basis, for which

[[Page 113]]

attribution to a source feedstock must be made for every final product 
made, consumed in, or removed from the refinery subzone.
    (f) Petroleum refinery. ``Petroleum refinery'' means a facility that 
refines a feedstock listed on the top line of the tables set forth in 
T.D. 66-16 into a product listed in the left column of the tables set 
forth in T.D. 66-16.
    (g) Price of product. ``Price of product'' means the average per 
unit market value of each final product for a given manufacturing period 
or the published standard product value if updated each month.
    (h) Producibility. ``Producibility'' is a method of attributing 
products to feedstocks for petroleum manufacturing in accordance with 
the Industry Standards of Potential Production set forth in T.D. 66-16.
    (i) Relative value. ``Relative value'' means a value assigned to 
each final product attributed to the separation from a privileged 
foreign feedstock based on the ratio of the final product's value 
compared to the privileged foreign feedstock's duty.
    (j) Time of Separation. ``Time of separation'' means the 
manufacturing period in which a privileged foreign status feedstock is 
deemed to have been separated into two or more final products.
    (k) Weighted Average. ``Weighted average'' means the relative value 
of merchandise, which is determined by dividing the total value of 
shipments in a given period by the total quantity shipped in the same 
given period. See example in section VI of the appendix to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 146.93  Inventory control and recordkeeping system.

    (a) Attribution. All final products removed from or consumed within 
a petroleum refinery subzone must be attributed to feedstock admitted 
into said petroleum refinery subzone in the current or prior 
manufacturing period. Attribution must be based on records maintained by 
the operator. Attribution may be made by applying one of the authorized 
methods set forth in this section. Records must be maintained on a 
weight or volume basis.
    (1) Producibility. The producibility method of attribution requires 
that records be kept to attribute final products to feedstocks which are 
eligible for attribution as set forth in this section during the current 
or prior manufacturing period.
    (2) Actual production records. An operator may use its actual 
production records as provided for under Sec. 146.95(b) of this subpart.
    (3) Other inventory method. An operator may use the FIFO (first-in, 
first-out) method of accounting (see Sec. 191.22(c) of this chapter). 
The use of this method is illustrated in the appendix to this part.
    (b) Feedstock eligible for attribution. Only a feedstock that has 
been admitted into the refinery subzone is eligible for attribution. For 
a given manufacturing period, the quantity of feedstock eligible for 
attribution may be computed as beginning inventory, plus receipts less 
shipments of feedstock out of the subzone, and less ending inventory.
    (c) Consumption or removal of final product. Each final product that 
is consumed in or removed from a refinery subzone must be attributed to 
a feedstock eligible for attribution during the current or a prior 
manufacturing period. Each final product attributed as being produced 
from the separation of a privileged foreign status feedstock must be 
assigned the proper relative value as set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (d) Relative value. A relative value calculation is required when 
two or more final products are produced as the result of the separation 
of privileged foreign status feedstock. Ad valorem and compound rates of 
duty must be converted to specific rates of duty in order to make a 
relative value calculation.
    (e) Privileged status after admission. Nonprivileged status 
feedstock is eligible for privileged status only if the request shows to 
the satisfaction of the Customs Service that there was no manipulation 
or manufacture of the feedstock to change its tariff classification 
before the request is granted. The absence of such manipulation or 
manufacture can be shown by demonstrating that the feedstock was placed 
in an

[[Page 114]]

empty tank, in a tank that contained only feedstock with the same 
nominal specifications or providing a sample which shows there was no 
change in tariff status. The existence of negligible amounts of other 
feedstocks may be disregarded only in accordance with Sec. 146.95(b). A 
request for after-admission privileged foreign status shall be denied 
unless the feedstock's tank records from admission to the time that the 
request is made accompany the request. A refiner who makes such a 
request shall not put any other feedstock having different nominal 
specifications into the tank until the request for privileged status is 
granted. The Customs Service will deny or revoke a post-admission 
request if a refiner fails to retain the integrity of the feedstock in 
the tank.
    (f) Consistent use required. The operator must use the selected 
method, measurement (weight or volume), and the price of product 
consistently (see Sec. 146.92(g) of this subpart and paragraph (a) of 
this section).


<R05>
Sec. 146.94  Records concerning establishment of manufacturing period.

    (a) Feedstock admitted into the refinery subzone. The operator must 
maintain appropriate inventory records during the manufacturing period 
to substantiate the feedstock(s) eligible for attribution under 
Sec. 146.93(b) and in accordance with the operator's selected 
attribution method.
    (b) Final product consumed in or removed from subzone. The operator 
must record the date and amount of each final product consumed in, or 
removed from the subzone.
    (c) Consumption or removal. The consumption or removal of a final 
product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day 
of that week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation 
instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption occurred, 
unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see 
section II of the appendix to this part).
    (d) Gain or loss. A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing 
period must be taken into account in determining the attribution of a 
final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of 
privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in a final product attributed to 
a non-privileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for 
consumption unless otherwise exempt from duty.
    (e) Determining gain or loss; acceptable methods.--(1) Converting 
volume to weight. Volume measurements may be converted to weight 
measurements using American Petroleum Institute conversion factors to 
account for gain or loss.
    (2) Calculating feedstock factor to account for volume gain or loss. 
A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of 
production per product category by the quotient of the total value of 
production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be 
applied to a finished product that has been attributed to a feedstock to 
account for volume gain.
    (3) Calculating volume difference. Volume difference may be 
determined by comparing the amount of feedstocks introduced for a given 
period with the amount of final products produced during the period, and 
then assigning the volume change to each final product proportionately.


<R05>
Sec. 146.95  Methods of attribution.

    (a) Producibility.--(1) General. A subzone operator must attribute 
the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard 
to feedstocks which were eligible for attribution during the current or 
prior manufacturing period. Attribution of final products is allowable 
to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been 
produced from such feedstocks, using the industry standards of potential 
production on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66-16. 
Once attribution is made for a particular product, that attribution is 
binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior 
attributions into account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each 
attribution.
    (2) Industry standards of potential production. The industry 
standards of potential production on a practical operating basis 
necessary for the producibility attribution method are

[[Page 115]]

contained in tables published in T.D. 66-16. With these tables, a 
subzone operator may attribute final products consumed in, or removed 
from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior 
manufacturing period.
    (3) Attribution to product or feedstock not listed in T.D. 66-16. 
(i) For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is 
not listed in T.D. 66-16, the operator must submit a proposed 
attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the 
appropriate port director. The port director shall refer the request to 
the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit (``ORA''), who will verify the 
refiner's records and will coordinate with the Director, Office of 
Laboratories and Scientific Services (``OLSS''). The Director, ORA, 
shall either approve or deny the request. If the request is approved, 
the Director, ORA, shall publish a modification of T.D. 66-16. If an 
operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails 
to keep records on that basis, the operator shall use its actual 
operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative 
value calculation upon the Customs Service demand and subject to 
verification.
    (ii) An operator may attribute a final product to a feedstock in 
excess of the amount allowed under T.D. 66-16, when authorized by 
Customs, without losing the ability to attribute under T.D. 66-16 for 
all other feedstock-final product combinations. The operator must use 
its actual production records for the requested feedstock-final product 
combination. The operator must agree in writing that it will not, and it 
will not enable any other person, to file a drawback claim under 19 
U.S.C. 1313 inconsistent with those actual production records for that 
feedstock-final product combination. The operator shall file its request 
in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The Director, ORA, 
and the Director, OLSS, must determine whether T.D. 66-16 needs to be 
modified and shall publish in the Customs Bulletin each approval granted 
under this paragraph and request public comments with each such 
approval.
    (4) Attribution to privileged foreign feedstock; relative value. If 
a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign 
feedstock a relative value must be assigned (see section IV of the 
appendix to this part).
    (b) Refinery operating records. An operator may use the actual 
refinery operating records to attribute the feedstocks used to the 
removed or consumed products. Customs shall accept the operator's 
operating conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates that 
it actually uses these conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever 
conventions are elected by the operator, they must be used consistently 
in order to be acceptable to Customs. Additionally, Customs may use 
these records to test the validity of admissions into the subzone, 
consumption within and removals from the subzone.

    Example. If the operator mixes three equal quantities of material in 
a day tank and treats that product as a three-part mixture in its 
production unit, Customs will accept the resulting product as composed 
of the three materials. If, in the alternative, the operator assumes 
that the three products do not mix and treats the first product as being 
composed of the first material put into the day tank, the second product 
as composed of the second material put into the day tank, and the third 
product as being composed of the third material put into the day tank, 
Customs will accept that convention also.


<R05>
Sec. 146.96  Approval of other recordkeeping systems.

    (a) Approval procedure. An operator must seek prior approval of 
another recordkeeping procedure by submitting the following to the 
Director, Office of Regulatory Audit:
    (1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be 
made when a finished product is removed from or consumed in the subzone, 
and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented;
    (2) A mathematical example covering at least two months which shows 
the amounts attributed, all necessary relative value calculations, the 
dates of consumption and removal, and the amounts and dates that the 
transactions are reported to Customs.

[[Page 116]]

    (b) Failure to comply. Requests received that fail to comply with 
paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the requester with the 
defects noted by the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit.
    (c) Determination by Director. When the Director, Office of 
Regulatory Audit, determines that the recordkeeping procedures provide 
an acceptable basis for verifying the admissions and removals from or 
consumption in a refinery subzone, the Director will issue a written 
approval to the applicant.

   Appendix to Part 146--Guidelines for Determining Producibility and 
                 Relative Values for Oil Refinery Zones

    Where an example is set out in this appendix, the example is for 
purposes of illustrating the application of a provision, and where there 
is any inconsistency between the example and the provision, the 
provision prevails to the extent of the inconsistency. Alternative 
formats are also acceptable so long as they are consistent with the 
provisions of this part.

 I. Attribution Using Producibility Showing Manufacturing Periods From 
              Admission to Removal Within a Calender Month.

    Volume losses and gains accounted for by weight.

                                  Day 1

    Receipt into the refinery subzone during a 30-day month:

50,000 pounds privileged foreign (PF) class II crude oil.
50,000 pounds PF class III crude oil.
50,000 pounds domestic status class III crude oil.

                                 Day 10

    Removal from the refinery subzone for exportation of 50,000 pounds 
of aviation gasoline.
    The period of manufacture for the aviation gasoline is Day 1 to Day 
10. The refiner must first attribute the designated source of the 
aviation gasoline.
    In order to maximize the duty benefit conferred by the zone 
operation, the refiner chooses to attribute the exported aviation 
gasoline to the privileged foreign status crude oil. Under the tables 
for potential production (T.V. 66-16), class II crude has a 30% 
potential, and class III has a 40% potential. The maximum aviation 
gasoline producible from the class II crude oil is 15,000 pounds (50,000 
 x  .30). The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the privileged 
foreign status class III crude oil is 20,000 pounds (50,000  x  .40). 
The domestic class III crude would also make 20,000 pounds of aviation 
gasoline.
    The refiner could attribute 15,000 pounds of the privileged foreign 
class II crude oil, 20,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class III 
crude oil, and 15,000 pounds of the domestic class III crude oil as the 
source of the 50,000 pounds of the aviation gasoline that was exported; 
35,000 pounds of class II crude oil would be available for further 
production for other than aviation gasoline, 30,000 pounds of privileged 
foreign class III crude oil would be available for further production 
for other than aviation gasoline, and 35,000 pounds of domestic status 
class III crude oil would be available for further production, of which 
up to 5,000 pounds could be attributed to aviation gasoline.

                                 Day 21

    Receipt in the refinery subzone:

50,000 pounds PF status class I crude oil.
50,000 pounds PF status class IV crude oil.

                                 Day 30

    Removal from the refinery subzone:
30,000 pounds of motor gasoline for consumption.
10,000 pounds of jet fuel sold to the US Air Force for use in military 
aircraft.
10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline sold to a U.S. commuter airline for 
domestic flights.
10,000 pounds of kerosene for exportation.

    To the extent that the crude oils that entered production on Day 1 
are attributed as the designated sources for the products removed on Day 
30, the period of manufacture is Day 1 to Day 30. If the refiner chooses 
to attribute the crude oils that were admitted on Day 21 as the 
designated sources of the products removed on Day 30 using the 
production standards published in T.D. 66-16, the manufacturing period 
is Day 21 to Day 30. This choice will be important if a relative value 
calculation on the privileged foreign status crude oil is required, 
because the law requires the value used for computing the relative value 
to be the average per unit value of each product for the manufacturing 
period. Relative value must be calculated if a source feedstock is 
separated into two or more products that are removed from the subzone 
refinery. If the average per unit value for each product differs between 
the manufacturing period from Day 1 to Day 30 and the manufacturing 
period from Day 21 to Day 30, the correct period must be used in the 
calculation.
    In order to minimize duty liability, the refiner would try to 
attribute the production of the exported kerosene and the sale of the 
jet fuel to the US Air Force to the privileged foreign crude oils. For 
the same reason, the refiner would try to attribute the removed motor 
gasoline and the aviation gasoline for

[[Page 117]]

the commuter airline to the domestic crude oil.
    Accordingly, the refiner chooses to attribute up to 5,000 pounds of 
the domestic status class III crude as the source of the 10,000 pounds 
of aviation gasoline removed from the subzone refinery for the commuter 
airline. Since no other aviation gasoline could have been produced from 
the crude oils that were admitted into the refinery subzone Day 1, the 
refiner must attribute the remainder to the crude oils that entered 
production on Day 21. Again, using the production standards from T.D. 
66-16, the class I crude could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up 
to 10,000 pounds (50,000  x  .20). Likewise, the class IV crude oil 
could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 8,500 pounds (50,000 
x  .17).
    The refiner selects use of the class I crude as the source of the 
aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute up to 27,300 pounds 
(35,000-5,000  x  .91) of the domestic class III crude oil as the source 
of the motor gasoline. This would leave 2,700 pounds of domestic class 
III crude available for further production for other than aviation 
gasoline or motor gasoline. The remaining motor gasoline removed (also 
2,700 pounds) must be attributed to a privileged foreign crude oil. The 
refiner selects the privileged foreign class II crude oil that entered 
production on Day 1 as the source for the remaining 2,700 pounds of 
motor gasoline.
    This would leave 32,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude 
oil available for further production, of which no more than 27,400 
pounds could be designated as the source of motor gasoline. The refiner 
attributes the jet fuel that is removed from the refinery subzone for 
the US Air Force for use in military aircraft to the privileged foreign 
class II crude oil. The refiner could attribute up to 20,995 pounds of 
jet fuel from that class II crude oil (32,300  x  .65). Designating that 
class II crude oil as the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel leaves 
22,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for 
further production, of which up to 10,995 pounds could be attributed as 
the source of the jet fuel. Because the motor gasoline and the jet fuel, 
under the foregoing attribution, would be considered to have been 
separated from the privileged foreign class II crude oil, a relative 
value calculation would be required.
    The jet fuel is eligible for removal from the subzone free of duty 
by virtue of 19 U.S.C. 1309(a)(1)(A). The refiner could attribute the 
privileged foreign class II crude oil as being the source of the 10,000 
pounds of jet fuel (22,300  x  .65). The refiner chooses to attribute 
the privileged foreign class III crude oil as the source of the jet 
fuel. The refiner could attribute to that class III crude oil up to 
15,000 pounds of kerosene (30,000  x  .50).

                     II. Attribution on a FIFO Basis

(Accounting for volume losses or gains by the weight method)

                                 Day 1-5

    Transfer, into the Refinery Subzone, from one or more storage tanks 
into process 150 barrels of Privileged Foreign (PF) Class II crude oil, 
equivalent to 50,000 pounds.

                                  Day 6

    Removal from the refinery subzone 119 barrels of residual oils to 
customs territory, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.
    Since the operator uses the FIFO method of attribution, as the 
product is removed from the subzone, or consumed or lost within the 
subzone, attribution must be to the oldest feedstock available for 
attribution. Accordingly, the 40,000 pounds of residual oils will be 
attributed to 40,000 pounds of the PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5.

                                 Day 10

    Transfer, into the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks 
4 barrels of domestic motor gasoline blend stock, equivalent to 1,000 
pounds to motor gasoline blending tank.

                                Day 6-15

    Transfer, into the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks 
into process 320 barrels of Domestic Class III crude oil, equivalent to 
100,000 pounds.

                                 Day 16

    Removal from the refinery subzone 14 barrels of asphalt to customs 
territory, equivalent to 5,000 pounds.
    The 5,000 pounds of asphalt will be attributed to 5,000 pounds of PF 
Class II crude oil from Day 1-5.

                                 Day 17

    Removal from the refinery subzone, 324 barrels of motor gasoline to 
customs territory, equivalent to 81,000 pounds.
    The 81,000 pounds of motor gasoline will be attributed to 1,000 
pounds of domestic motor gasoline blend stock from Day 10, to the 
remaining 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5 and 75,000 
pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from Day 6-15.

                                Day 16-20

    Transfer, into the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks 
into process 169 barrels of Privileged Foreign (PF) Class III crude oil, 
equivalent to 50,000 pounds.

[[Page 118]]

                                 Day 22

    Removal from the refinery subzone, 214 barrels of jet fuel for 
exportation, equivalent to 60,000 pounds.
    The 60,000 pounds of jet fuel will be attributed to the remaining 
25,000 pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from Day 6-15 and 35,000 
pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20.

                                Day 21-25

    Transfer, into the refinery subzone from one or more storage tanks 
into process, 143 barrels of domestic Class I crude oil, equivalent to 
50,000 pounds.

                Day 30 (End of the Manufacturing Period)

    It is determined that during the manufacturing period just ended, 
that 34 barrels of fuel, equivalent to 10,000 pounds was consumed, and 5 
barrels of oil, equivalent to 1,500 pounds was lost in the refining 
production process within the refinery subzone.
    The 10,000 pounds of fuel consumed will be attributed 10,000 pounds 
of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20. The 1,500 pounds of oil lost 
in the refining production process will be attributed to 1,500 pounds of 
PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20. The remaining 3,500 pounds of PF 
Class III crude oil from Day 16-20 will be the first to be attributed 
during the next manufacturing period.

                     III. Relative Value Calculation

    Because privileged foreign feedstocks transferred into process 
during Day 1-5 and Day 16-20 have two or more products attributed to 
them, each feedstock will require a relative value calculation.
    Relative value calculation for UIN Day 1-5, 50,000 pounds, 
equivalent to 150 barrels.

    Since jet fuel was exported, no duty is applicable. Fuel consumed 
for refinery process was consumed within the subzone premises and did 
not enter customs territory, thus no duty is applicable (assume refinery 
not barred by duty-free consumption restriction). Likewise, the process 
loss occurred entirely within the subzone. Therefore, no duty is 
applicable.

    An operator who elects to attribute on a monthly basis files the 
following estimated removal of final products for the first week in 
September:

Jet Fuel (deemed exported on international flights)...........    20,000

    Because it does not elect to make attributions for feedstocks that 
were charged to operating units during the same week, the operator 
attributes the estimated removals to final products made during August 
from the following feedstocks:

Class II PF (privileged foreign) crude........................    20,000
Class III PF crude............................................    35,000
Class III D (domestic) crude..................................    20,000

   V. Weekly Entry, Weekly Manufacturing Period, and Relative Values 
Calculated on the Actual Weighted Average Values at the End of the Week.

    On the weekly estimated production CF 3461, the refiner is required 
to provide a pro forma invoice or schedule showing the number of units 
of each type of merchandise to be removed during the week and their zone 
and dutiable values. For example, on CF 3461 the refiner estimates the 
following shipments and relative values for the next week and files this 
on the preceding Friday.

    During that week the refiner actually removes the following products 
and reports those on the CF 7501 filed within 10 business days after the 
CF 3461 is filed. Column 3 is the actual ``weighted average'' value for 
the manufacturing period, therefore, no reconciliation is necessary.

Volumetric Gain 21,602..................................................
Avg. Value/Barrel Crude Consumed=$16,756,891<divide>518,451=$32.321 (8).
    This example shows volumetric gain of 21,602 mbbls. However, in that 
PF was requested, liquidated duties are only on actual feedstock (class 
III crude) used in the refining process. (518,451 @ $.105=$54,437).

   Calculated on the Actual Weighted Average Values at the End of the 
                                 Month.

    For example, on the CF 3461 the refiner estimates the following 
shipments and relative values for the next week and files this on the 
preceding Friday.

    During the week the refiner actually removes the following products 
and reports those on the CF 7501 filed within 10 business days after the 
CF 3461 is filed. The reported relative values may be an estimate based 
on Platts, prior period actual prices, or the refiner's transfer prices. 
For this example, the estimates are based on the refiner's actual 
transfer prices. Listed below are the data to be shown on the weekly CF 
7501s with actual quantities shipped and estimated values for weeks 1-5.

    Note: No change in amended total duties, because duty is computed on 
total quantity of class III crude used. The difference is amongst the 
various products, i.e., estimated weekly CF 7501 duties paid for Motor 
Gasoline was $2,317, while the reconciled amount as shown above is 
$2,298. Additional duties owed or refunds due would depend on the 
reconciliation of the weekly entry as an entirety.

    VII. Weekly entry, monthly manufacturing period, relative values 
   calculated on prior manufacturing period's actual weighted average 
        values. The prior period (PP) values are set forth below:

    Note: Actual monthly reconciliation data could result in 
attributions on a product basis that are less than or greater than 
weekly distributions. This is due to the ``weighing'' of the data i.e., 
motor gasoline on a weekly basis was $10,996 as compared to $10,379 as 
above. No additional duties are due to the averaging.

together with a completed, but unsigned, Customs Form 4457, which may be

conveyance ahead of, or after a passenger, shall be treated as 
accompanying him if it is fully evident to the examining officer from 
the circumstances that:
    (1) The passenger intended the baggage to arrive with him; and
    (2) It was misdirected through no fault of the passenger.

Sec. 148.5   Regular entry of articles in baggage.

    Subject to any applicable exemption from entry requirements, 
articles imported as baggage but not passed under a baggage declaration 
or under the procedure provided in Sec. 148.6 for unaccompanied 
shipments of effects subject to personal exemptions shall be entered in 
the same manner as a cargo importation of like goods. In making regular 
entry for articles imported in baggage, the value of articles entitled 
to free entry under subheadings 9804.00.10, or 9804.00.45, Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), shall be 
disregarded in determining whether formal or informal entry is required.

<R05>
Sec. 148.6   Entry of unaccompanied shipments of effects subject to personal exemptions.

    (a) Declaration to support free entry. When effects claimed to be 
free of duty under subheadings 9804.00.10, 9804.00.20, 9804.00.25, 
9804.00.35 or 9804.00.45, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), do not accompany the importer on his 
arrival in the United States or are forwarded in bond, a declaration of 
the importer on Customs Form 3299 shall be required to support the claim 
for free entry. However, an oral declaration may be accepted in lieu of 
a written declaration on Customs Form 3299, for effects of a resident 
which are free of duty under subheadings 9804.00.10 or 9804.00.45. 
Effects of returning residents entitled to free entry under subheadings 
9804.00.10 or 9804.00.45 (except automobiles and other vehicles of 
residents returning from countries other than Canada or Mexico) need not 
be itemized if a written declaration is required.
    (b) Exemption from entry. If the port director is satisfied that an 
entry would serve no good purpose, none need be required, but evidence 
of ownership for Customs purposes, such as a carrier's certificate or 
properly endorsed bill of lading, shall be required with the 
declaration. Such exemption from entry may also be applied with respect 
to household effects or tools of trade entitled to free entry (see 
Secs. 148.52 and 148.53 respectively) which are unaccompanied or 
forwarded in bond.

articles free of duty under subheadings 9804.00.20, 9804.00.25, 
9804.00.30, 9804.00.35, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(19 U.S.C. 1202), in accordance with the following procedure:
    (a) The person claiming the status shall agree to export all such 
articles upon his departure from the United States, except articles 
imported as gifts under subheading 9804.00.30, and articles consumed 
during his visit;
    (b) When required to do so, the person claiming the status shall 
list all articles of substantial value which he is importing on Customs 
Form 4455, in duplicate, noting thereon the expected duration of his 
visit. He shall present the completed form to the inspecting officer who 
will initial both copies and return the duplicate to him;
    (c) Upon his departure from the United States at the completion of 
his visit, the person claiming the status of a nonresident shall present 
to a Customs officer the duplicate copy of Customs

[[Page 133]]

Form 4455, initialed by the inspecting officer, and the articles listed 
thereon shall be subject to inspection; and
    (d) If he decides not to return abroad, the person claiming the 
status shall immediately notify the director of the port of entry. The 
port director will advise him of the amount of duties and taxes due by 
reason of his failure to return abroad.

any port if deemed necessary to protect the revenue. If an oral 
declaration is permitted, completion of the identifying information on 
Customs Form 6059-B may be required.
    (b) When permitted. Oral declarations may be permitted under the 
following conditions:
    (1) Residents. A returning resident may make an oral declaration if:

Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, if not more 
than $400 shall have been acquired elsewhere than in such insular 
possessions;
    (ii) None of his accompanying articles are forwarded in bond; and
    (iii) None of his accompanying articles are imported for the account 
of any other person or for sale.

    A family group residing in one household, traveling together, and 
having the same residence status may be permitted to declare orally 
articles acquired abroad for the personal or household use of any member 
of the family if the value of such articles does not exceed the total 
amount of the exemption to which the family group is entitled. (See 
Sec. 148.34.) Where a written declaration is required, one member of a 
family group may declare for all. Servants accompanying a family group 
shall not be included in the family declaration.


<R05>
Sec. 148.15   Inclusion of articles not for personal or household use.

    Articles not personal in character, or which are intended for sale

entry shall be required.


<R05>
Sec. 148.16   Amendment of declaration.

    (a) Before examination. A passenger shall be permitted to add an 
article to his declaration if, before examination of his baggage has 
begun, the fact that the article has not been declared is brought to the 
attention of the examining officer by the passenger.
    (b) After examination is begun. A passenger shall be permitted to 
add an article to his declaration after examination of his baggage has 
begun if, before any undeclared article is found, the passenger advises 
the examining officer that he has such an article and the officer is 
satisfied that there was no fraudulent intent. Under no circumstances 
shall a passenger be permitted to add any undeclared article to his 
declaration after such article has been discovered by the examining 
officer.

<R05>
Sec. 148.17   Declaration on arrival incidental to further foreign travel.

    (a) Declaration on incidental arrival. A resident who enters the 
United States merely as an incident of foreign travel and who will 
continue his foreign travel before finally returning to the United 
States from a continuous trip shall declare, but need not clear through 
Customs, any articles he has acquired or had repaired or altered while 
abroad. The incidental character of the arrival shall be made known to 
the Customs officer.
    (b) Treatment of articles on incidental arrival. In order that a 
resident may claim the $400 or $800 exemption upon his final arrival in 
the United States from a continuous trip, articles accompanying him at 
the time of an incidental arrival may be exported directly from Customs 
custody or after transportation in bond, or the articles may be left in 
Customs custody if the resident upon his final return is to arrive at 
the Customs facility where the articles are deposited.
    (c) Failure to advise of incidental character of arrival. If the 
traveler fails to advise the Customs officer of the incidental character 
of his arrival, or for other reason declares any articles for allowance 
of the $400 or $800 exemption, such declaration shall mark the beginning 
of the respective period or periods during which a further exemption 
cannot be granted.

<R05>
Sec. 148.18  Failure to declare.

    (a) Penalty incurred. Any article in the baggage of a passenger 
arriving from a foreign country which is not declared as required by 
this subpart shall be seized if it is available for seizure at the time 
the violation is detected, and the personal penalty prescribed by 
section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), shall be demanded from 
the passenger. If the article is not seized, a claim for the personal 
penalty shall be made against the person who imported the article 
without declaration. No duty shall be collected, because undeclared 
articles are treated as smuggled.
    (b) Remission of liability. When an article not declared as required 
by this subpart is found in the baggage of a person arriving in the 
United States, the personal penalty and forfeiture may be mitigated or 
remitted in accordance with the Guidelines for Disposition of Violations 
of 19 U.S.C. 1497 in the appendix to part 171 of this chapter.

Sec. 148.19  False or fraudulent statement.

    A passenger who makes any false or fraudulent statement or engages 
in other conduct within the purview of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), whereby a Customs officer is or may be 
induced to pass an article free of duty or at less than the proper 
amount of duty, or to treat an article in some other manner in order to 
obtain a benefit, shall be deemed to have violated 19 U.S.C. 1592. In 
any such case the article involved shall be seized only if one or more 
of the conditions set forth in section 162.75 of this chapter are 
present, if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is 
detected, and if such seizure is otherwise practicable, unless the 
article is in the possession of an innocent holder for value who has 
full right to possession as against any party to the Customs violation. 
If seizure is not made, an amount equivalent to the maximum penalty 
which may be assessed in accordance with the passenger's degree of 
culpability as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1592(c) shall be demanded from the 
passenger. The amount demanded in lieu of seizure shall be determined in 
accordance with the guidelines contained in the appendix to part 171 of 
this chapter. In all cases, the estimated duties shall be demanded of 
the passenger as soon as possible after the discovery of the violation. 
Any applicable internal revenue tax shall also be demanded unless the 
merchandise is to be, or has been, forfeited.

article is found upon opening by the Customs officer, the whole contents 
and the baggage or vehicle shall be subject to forfeiture, pursuant to

    (b) Subsequently acquired articles. When a person whose baggage has 
been examined and passed in foreign territory in accordance with

prior to return to the United States, the Customs officer to whom the 
declaration was surrendered may permit the amendment of that declaration 
to include the additional articles.

consumption of the importer or disposition as his bona fide gift, cigars 
and cigarettes are subject to the packaging and marking requirements in 
the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

tax under subheading 9804.00.45, and Chapter 98, U.S Note 3, Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States, (19 U.S.C. 1202), all personal and 
household effects taken abroad. To ensure allowance of the exemption, 
articles of foreign origin should be registered in accordance with 
Sec. 148.1. Automobiles and other vehicles, aircraft, boats, teams and 
saddle horses, together with their accessories, may be brought in free 
of duty if taken abroad for noncommercial use (see Sec. 148.32).
    (b) Repair or alteration while abroad. If any such personal or 
household effect taken abroad has been advanced in value or improved in 
condition while abroad by repairs (including cleaning) not merely 
incidental to wear or use while abroad, or by alterations (including 
additions) which did not change the identity of the article, the cost or 
value of such repairs or alterations is subject to duty unless all or 
part of such cost or value is covered by an allowance of the $400 or 
$800 exemption for articles acquired abroad (see Sec. 148.33). An effect 
taken abroad and there changed into a different article is dutiable at 
its full value when returned to the United States, unless covered in 
whole or in part by some provision for free entry.

Sec. 148.33   Articles acquired abroad.

    (a) Exemption. Each returning resident is entitled to bring in free 
of duty and internal revenue tax under subheadings 9804.00.65 and 
9804.00.70, and Chapter 98, U.S. Note 3, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), articles for his personal or 
household use which were purchased or otherwise acquired abroad merely 
as an incident of the foreign journey from which he is returning and 
which accompany him on his arrival, subject to the limitations and 
conditions set forth in this section and Secs. 148.34-148.38. The 
aggregate fair retail value in the country of acquisition of such 
articles for personal and household use shall not exceed $400, or $800 
in the case of a resident arriving directly or indirectly from American 
Samoa, Guam, or the Virgin Islands of the United States, of which not 
more than $400 shall have been acquired elsewhere than in such insular 
possession.
    (b) Application to articles of highest rate of duty. The $400 or 
$800 exemption shall be applied to the aggregate fair retail value in 
the country of acquisition of the articles acquired abroad which are 
subject to the highest rates of duty. If an internal revenue tax is 
applicable, it shall be combined with the duty in determining which 
rates are highest.
    (c) Gifts. An article acquired abroad by a returning resident and 
imported by him to be disposed of after importation as his bona fide 
gift is considered to be for the personal use of the returning resident 
and may be included in the exemption.
    (d) Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. Cigars, cigarettes, 
manufactured tobacco, and alcoholic beverages, may be included in the 
exemption to which a returning resident is entitled, with the following 
limits:
    (1) No more than 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars may be included;
    (2) No alcoholic beverages shall be included in the case of an 
individual who has not attained the age of 21; and
    (3) No more than 1 liter of alcoholic beverages may be included 
unless the individual is arriving directly or indirectly from American 
Samoa, Guam, or the Virgin Islands of the United States. An individual 
returning directly or indirectly from these insular possessions shall be 
entitled to include in the exemption no more than 4 liters of alcoholic 
beverages, not more than 1 liter of which shall have been acquired 
elsewhere than in such insular possessions.
    (e) Exemption not applicable. The exemption does not apply to 
articles intended for sale or acquired on commission, i.e., for the 
account of another person, with or without compensation for the service 
rendered. Articles acquired on one journey and left in a foreign country 
cannot be allowed the exemption accruing upon the return of the resident 
from a subsequent journey.
    (f) Remainder not applicable to subsequent journey. A returning 
resident who has received a total exemption of less than $400 under the 
$400 exemption, or less than $800 under the $800 exemption in connection 
with his return from one journey is not entitled to apply the remainder 
of either amount to articles acquired abroad on a subsequent journey.

    (a) Grouping of exemptions. Each member of a family is entitled to 
the $400 or $800 exemption for articles acquired

[[Page 140]]

abroad, subject to the conditions prescribed in this subpart. When 
members of a family residing in one household travel together on their 
return to the United States, the $400 or $800 exemption to which the 
several members of the family may be entitled may be grouped and allowed 
without regard to which member of the family is the owner of the 
articles. However, a group exemption shall not include an exemption for 
a family member not entitled to it in his own right, nor shall a group 
exemption be applied to any property of such a member. The exemption of 
a family member who has not attained the age of 21 shall not be applied 
under the group exemption to alcoholic beverages. No exemptions 
allowable to a resident servant accompanying the family shall be 
included in the family grouping.
    (b) Members of a family residing in one household. The term 
``members of a family in one household'' shall include all persons, 
regardless of age, who:
    (1) Are related by blood, marriage, or adoption;
    (2) Lived together in one household at their last permanent 
residence; and
    (3) Intend to live together in one household after their arrival in 
the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 148.35   Length of stay for exemption of articles acquired abroad.

    (a) Required for allowance of $400 exemption. The $400 exemption for 
articles acquired abroad shall not be allowed unless the returning 
resident has remained beyond the territorial limits of the United States 
for a period of not less than 48 hours, except in the case of a resident 
arriving directly in the United States from Mexico. The exemption may be 
allowed on articles acquired abroad by a returning resident arriving 
directly from Mexico without regard to the length of time the person has 
remained outside the territorial limits of the United States.
    (b) Required for allowance of $800 exemption on return from Virgin 
Islands. The $800 exemption applicable in the case of the arrival of a 
returning resident directly or indirectly from the Virgin Islands of the 
United States may be allowed without regard to the length of time such 
person has remained outside the territorial limits of the United States.
    (c) Computation of time. The 48-hour period a returning resident 
must have completed abroad to be entitled to an exemption shall be 
computed exactly. For example, a resident leaving United States 
territory at 1:30 p.m. on June 1 would complete the 48-hour period at 
1:30 p.m. on June 3.

<R05>
Sec. 148.36   Frequency of allowance of exemption for articles acquired abroad.

    (a) 30-day period. The $400 or $800 exemption for articles acquired 
abroad shall not be granted to a returning resident who has taken 
advantage of such exemption within the 30-day period immediately 
preceding his return to the United States. The date of the returning 
resident's latest prior arrival on which he declared articles acquired 
abroad for allowance of the $400 or $800 exemption shall be deemed the 
date he took advantage of the applicable exemption.
    (b) Computation of time. The 30-day period immediately preceding the 
resident's return shall be computed by excluding the day of arrival and 
counting backward 30 days. For example, in the case of an arrival on May 
28, the resident would not be entitled to the $400 or $800 exemption if 
he had taken advantage of such exemption on or after the preceding April 
28.

Sec. 148.37   Replacement of unsatisfactory articles acquired abroad.

    (a) Free entry of replacement articles. An article furnished by a 
foreign supplier to replace a like article of comparable value 
previously exempted from duty under the $400 or $800 exemptions for 
articles acquired abroad shall be allowed free entry if the original 
article is found by the importer to be unsatisfactory and the procedures 
provided by paragraph (b) of this section

[[Page 141]]

are followed. In any case in which the importer has failed to follow 
these procedures, the port director may allow free entry of the 
replacement article if he is satisfied that the unsatisfactory article 
was timely exported and that the failure to comply with the procedures 
of paragraph (b) of this section was due to inadvertence or lack of 
experience in Customs matters and was without willful intent to avoid 
Customs supervision.
    (b) Procedure for replacement. Any article previously exempted from 
duty under the $400 or $800 exemptions found by the importer to be 
unsatisfactory shall be returned to Customs custody and exported under 
Customs supervision at the expense of the importer within 60 days after 
its importation. A certificate of registration on Customs Form 4455 
shall be issued to the importer with instructions as to its use when the 
unsatisfactory article is exported for replacement under the provisions 
of subheading 9804.00.75, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States.
    (c) Articles found damaged upon declaration. The requirement that 
the original article be exported under Customs supervision does not 
apply when a duplicate article is furnished by a foreign supplier as a 
replacement for an article declared for entry under the $400 or $800 
exemption and found by the Customs inspector or other examining officer 
to be so damaged as to constitute a nonimportation (Sec. 158.11 of this 
chapter). In such a case, Customs Form 4455 shall be issued to the 
importer at the time the determination of nonimportation is made and the 
duplicate replacement shall be considered to have been acquired abroad 
for the purposes of the $400 or $800 exemption provision, provided no 
charge is made to the importer for the duplicate replacement.

returning resident actually acquired and imported the article for his 
bona fide personal or household use and not for sale.

Sec. 148.39   Rented automobiles.

resident of the United States while abroad may be brought into the 
United States by or on behalf of such resident for a temporary period 
not to exceed 30 days under subheading 9804.00.60, Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), without payment 
of duty. The automobile shall be used for the transportation of the 
resident and that of his family and guests, and for such incidental 
carriage of articles as may be appropriate to his personal use of the 
automobile. No entry or security for exportation shall be required.
    (b) Unauthorized use or failure to export. If any automobile 
exempted from duty under subheading 9804.00.60, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), 
is used otherwise than for the purpose expressed or is not returned 
abroad within 30 days, without prior payment to a port director of the 
duty which would have been payable at the time of entry if entered 
without benefit of the exemption, the automobile or its value (to be 
recovered from the importer) shall be subject to forfeiture.

amended (19 U.S.C. 1526), or section 42 of the Act of July 5, 1946 (60 
Stat. 440; 15 U.S.C. 1124), because the trademark has been registered 
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and recorded with Customs. The 
exemption may be applied to those trademarked articles of foreign 
manufacture bearing a trademark owned by a citizen of, or a corporation 
or association created or organized within, the United States when 
imported for the arriving person's personal use in the quantities 
provided in pararaph (c) of this section. Unregistered and unrecorded

of this section shall not be granted to any person who has taken 
advantage of the exemption for the same type of article within the 30-
day period immediately prior to his arrival in the United States. The 
date of the person's last arrival on which he claimed this exemption 
shall be considered to be the date he last took advantage of the 
exemption.
    (2) Sale of exempted articles. If an article which has been exempted 
is sold within one year of the date of importation, the article or its 
value (to be recovered from the importer), is subject to forfeiture. A 
sale subject to judicial order or in the liquidation of an estate is not 
subject to the provisions of this paragraph.
    (c) Quantities. Generally, each person arriving in the United States 
may apply the exemption to one article of the type bearing a protected 
trademark. The Commissioner shall determine if a quantity of an article 
in excess of one may be entered and, with the approval of the Secretary 
of the Treasury, publish in the Federal Register a list of types of 
articles and the quantities of each entitled to the exemption. If the 
holder of a protected trademark allows importation of a quantity in 
excess of one of its particular trademarked article, the total of those 
trademarked articles authorized by the trademark holder may be entered 
without penalty.

internal revenue tax under subheading 9808.00.40, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 
1202).

assessed.
    (b) Articles landed without declaration. Any article landed without

tobacco products provided in paragraph (c) of this section, entry free 
of duty and tax under subheading 9805.00.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), may be accorded personal and 
household effects of:
    (1) Any person in the service of the United States who returns to 
the United States upon the termination of assignment to extended duty at 
a post or station outside the Customs territory of the United States;
    (2) Members of his family who have resided with him at such post or 
station and are returning upon the termination of his assignment; or
    (3) Any person evacuated to the United States under Government

HTSUS, is not confined to that class of articles described in subheading 
9804.00.20, HTSUS, nor is any period of use, such as prescribed by 
subheading 9804.00.05, HTSUS, applicable to household effects entered 
under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS. The privilege of free entry under 
subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, does not apply to:

of not more than 4 liters of alcoholic beverages and not more than 100 
cigars shall be accorded free entry under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, 
subject to the conditions that:
    (1) These articles accompany the person making the claim for free

and
    (4) Such person, if other than one in the service of the U.S., shall 
have attained the age of 21.
    (d) Termination of assignment to extended duty. The requirement of 
subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS that the person ``returns to the United 
States upon the termination of assignment to extended duty'' shall be 
considered met upon the necessary proof being submitted that any one of 
the following is applicable:

duration.
    (2) The person is returning after the termination of an assignment

outside the Customs territory of the United States, regardless of the 
duration of the duty. A crewmember, including a member of a command, 
serving on a United States naval vessel when it departs from the United 
States on an intended deployment of 120 days or more outside the Customs 
territory of the United States and who continues to serve on the vessel 
until it returns to the United States may be considered as returning 
after the termination of an assignment of duty under permanent change of 
station orders.
    (3) The person is returning to the United States upon the 
termination of a tour of duty at any time after leaving the United 
States for duty of not less than 140 days outside the Customs territory

household effects under subheading 9805.00.50, Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), where the person 
returns to the United States pursuant to Government orders or 
instructions which authorized him initially to proceed to a foreign post 
or station and return to the United States upon termination of temporary 
duty, except as it may otherwise be deemed proper in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 148.74(d) or Sec. 148.76.
    (b) Persons returning on leave or before termination of extended 
duty assignment. A person returning on leave, other than on reemployment

returning to the United States under orders on temporary duty assignment

Sec. 148.76   Waiver of requirements or limitations.

    In any case in which the limitation on the quantity of alcoholic 
beverages and tobacco products which may be exempted from duty and tax 
under Sec. 148.74(c) or the failure of the person to meet the 
requirements that he be returning upon the termination of assignment to 
``extended duty,'' as explained in Sec. 148.74(d), will cause undue 
hardship to the person through no fault of his own, but rather because 
of the nature of his assignment or other hardship circumstances, the 
Commissioner of Customs, upon receipt of a request from the Government 
agency involved, may waive the limitation or the requirement, as the 
case may be, if he deems such waiver warranted by the facts.


<R05>
Sec. 148.77   Entry of effects on termination of assignment to extended duty, or on evacuation.

    (a) General procedure. All articles for which free entry is claimed 
under subheading 9805.00.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (19 U.S.C. 1202), shall be entered or withdrawn in accordance 
with the requirements prescribed by the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. 
Port directors shall be satisfied in all cases that the articles for 
which free entry is claimed under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, are 
personal and household effects of the importer entitled to the benefits 
of item 817.00, particularly in those cases where the quantity of 
effects imported may appear to be unreasonable for personal or household 
use. No invoice shall be required for articles accorded free entry under 
this provision.
    (b) Declaration and entry--(1) Person entitled to exemption. 
Declaration and entry for articles claimed to be exempt from duty and 
tax under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), may be made on 
Customs Form 3299, or Department of Defense Form (DD) 1252 when entry is 
made in the name of the person who is entitled to the benefits of the 
exemption. The date of the person's last departure from the United 
States shall be indicated on the declaration and entry.
    (2) Designated official. Customs Form 3299 or Department of Defense 
Form

[[Page 151]]

1252 executed on behalf of the owner of unaccompanied personal and 
household effects by either a United States Dispatch Agent or a 
designated responsible military official in his own name, may be 
accepted by the Customs officer as the declaration and entry if there is 
a valid reason evident from the owner's travel orders or information at 
hand why the United States Government agency concerned is unable to 
present Department of Defense Form (DD) 1252 or Customs Form 3299 
executed by the owner. The date of the owner's last departure from the 
United States need not be indicated on the form. The following statement 
shall be added across the face or to the back of Customs Form 3299 or 
Department of Defense Form 1252.

    This form is completed on behalf of (Name of Government employee) 
Travel orders and information on hand in this office show that the named 
person has met all requirements of section 148.74, Customs Regulations, 
and is entitled to the benefits of subheading 9805.00.50, Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States. The shipment imported consists of 
nothing but personal and household effects of the named person, which 
effects are not imported for sale or as an accommodation for others.

    (c) Verification of claim for exemption--(1) By travel orders. The 
declaration and entry shall be verified by the Customs officer by an 
inspection of the owner's travel orders. If the port director accepts an 
inspection of the owner's travel orders as evidence that the effects 
were brought into the United States within the requirements of 
subheading 9805.00.50, the owner's travel orders shall be identified on 
the entry, which shall be handled like a free baggage declaration.
    (2) By other evidence. The declaration and entry may be verified by 
other evidence which satisfies the port director that the effects were 
brought into the United States in connection with:
    (i) The person's return to the United States upon the termination of 
assignment to extended duty, as explained in Sec. 148.74(d);
    (ii) The return of members of his family who have resided with him 
at his post or station upon the termination of his assignment; or
    (iii) The evacuation of a person to the United States under 
Government orders or instructions.

United States, the port directors shall accord to the personnel of such 
foreign government privileges under the law only to the extent to which

    (c) Status of importer questioned. If any question arises as to the 
status of the importer under subheadings 9806.00.20, 9806.00.45 and

case each month.
    (ii) Advance entry or withdrawal. A maximum of three cases (the 
initial one plus two cases in advance) may be entered or withdrawn at 
any one time in a given 3-month period if the port director is satisfied 
they are for personal or family use but not as an accommodation to 
others or for sale or other commercial use. Such advance entry or 
withdrawal shall not be deemed to broaden the one case per month 
limitation.
    (iii) Certification. At the time of each entry or withdrawal, the 
member of the Armed Forces must certify that since his last entry or 
withdrawal there have expired a number of months equal to the numbers of 
cases last entered or withdrawn.

but not as an accommodation to others or for sale or other commercial 
use, in excess of the one case per month limitation may be allowed under 
the following procedure:

additional quantity is justified. Questionable cases shall be referred 
to the Commissioner of Customs for instructions.

records. The warehouse proprietor shall retain all records relating to 
the entry and withdrawal of alcoholic beverages under subheading

Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (Title 19, United States Code), and the 
regulations thereunder are applicable to articles for which free entry 
is claimed under subheadings 9806.00.20, 9806.00.45, 9809.00.30, HTSUS. 
No invoices shall be required.

         Subpart J--Noncommercial Importations of Limited Value


<R05>
Sec. 148.101  Applicability.

    Each person, including a crewmember, arriving in the United States 
who enters articles for his personal or household use, or as bona fide 
gifts not imported for sale nor for the account of another person, 
valued in the aggregate at not over $1,000 fair retail value in the 
country of acquisition, shall be assessed a flat rate of duty on the 
articles, as provided in Sec. 148.102. The entry shall be made under 
subheading 9816.00.20 or 9816.00.40, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), and is subject to the limitations and 
conditions in this subpart. Except as provided in Sec. 148.105, the flat 
rate of duty shall be assessed in place of any rates of duty other than 
free rates of duty. If the dutiable amount of the article(s) is over 
$1,000 fair retail value, the flat rate of duty provisions shall apply 
to the amount not over $1,000 fair retail value, and the excess amount 
shall be valued under section 402, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1401a). The article(s) shall be classified under the appropriate 
subheading number of the tariff schedule. For purposes of this subpart, 
``fair retail value'' in the country of acquisition means the price at 
which the merchandise is freely offered there for sale at retail and 
``country of acquisition'' includes America Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin 
Islands of the United States.
    Two examples of the application of this subpart are set forth below:

    Example 1: B returned from Europe where he acquired merchandise 
having a fair retail value of $1,050. Assume for purposes of this 
example that (1) in addition to the personal exemption of $400, $100 of 
the merchandise carries a free rate of duty, (2) allowances and 
exemptions have not been used within the past 30 days, and (3) all 
articles in excess of allowances and exemptions and duty-free articles 
are dutiable at rates other than the flat rate.
    B presents his baggage to the Customs officer for examination and 
his declaration for verification. Duty is figured as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        Fair            
                                                       retail     Duty

      Total.........................................  \1\1,950     (\1\)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\The articles not covered by exemptions, allowances, and duty-free    
  rates will be valued under section 402, Tariff Act of 1930, as        
  amended, and duty calculated at rates other than the flat rate.       

    Example 2: Mr. and Mrs. B return from the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
During the trip, they acquired merchandise having a fair retail value of 
$2,900. Assume for purposes of this example that (1) in addition to the 
personal exemption of $800 for each returning resident, $100 of the 
merchandise carries a free rate of duty, (2) allowances and exemptions 
have not been used within the past 30 days, (3) all articles in excess 
of allowances and exemptions and duty-free articles are dutiable at 
rates other than the flat rate, and (4) Mrs. B made $400 in purchases on 
the trip, none of which carries a free rate of duty.
    Mr. and Mrs. B present their baggage to the Customs officer for 
examination and their declaration for verification. Duty is figured as 
follows:

Sec. 148.105  Procedure for excluding articles from flat rate of duty.

    (a) Generally. Any person who has information that merchandise is 
being imported into the United States under the provisions of subheading 
9816.00.20 or 9816.00.40, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (19 U.S.C. 1202), and this subpart which adversely affects the 
economic interest of the United States may communicate the information 
in writing to the Commissioner of Customs, Attention: Office of Field 
Operations, Washington, DC 20229.
    (b) Content of communication. The communication to the Commissioner 
need not be in any particular form but shall contain the following:
    (1) The name of the individual and the person, firm, or association 
the individual represents, if any;
    (2) The nature of the individual's interest in the matter, if any;
    (3) A description of the merchandise, which it is alleged affects 
the economic interest of the United States adversely, including 
subheadings of the HTSUS, if known;
    (4) The country of acquisition and the ports and dates of entry of 
the merchandise, if known; and
    (5) A statement and supporting evidence as to the manner in which 
the individual believes the economic interest of the United States is 
being adversely affected.
    (c) Inquiry to be conducted. Upon receipt of a communication 
containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, an 
inquiry will be conducted.
    (d) Negative determination. If the inquiry results in a finding that 
no reasonable cause exists to believe that the application of the flat 
rate of duty provisions to a particular article of merchandise is 
adversely affecting the economic interest of the United States, the 
inquirer shall be advised in writing of the finding and the matter shall 
be closed.
    (e) Publication of tentative finding. If the inquiry results in a 
finding by the Secretary of the Treasury that reasonable cause exists to 
believe that the application of the flat rate of duty provisions to a 
particular article of merchandise is affecting the economic interest of 
the United States adversely, a notice of the finding will be published 
in the Federal Register and Customs Bulletin, along with a statement of 
intent to exclude the articles from application of the flat rate of duty 
provisions. Interested persons will be given an opportunity to submit 
written comments on the notice.
    (f) Final determination. Based upon the comments received and the 
results of any additional inquiry as may be necessary, if it is 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury that application of the flat 
rate of duty provisions adversely affects the economic interest of the 
United States, a Treasury Decision will be published in the Federal 
Register and Customs Bulletin announcing that the merchandise will be 
excluded from application of the flat rate of duty provisions. Excluded 
articles of merchandise shall be listed in Sec. 148.106. If it is 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury that a valid basis for 
excluding the merchandise from the flat rate of duty provisions does not 
exist, the notice proposing to exclude the article will be withdrawn by 
publishing a notice in the Federal Register and the Customs Bulletin.

  Subpart K--Unaccompanied Shipments From American Samoa, Guam, or the 
                   Virgin Islands of the United States


<R05>
Sec. 148.110  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to articles not 
accompanying a person, including a crewmember, which are purchased in 
and shipped from American Samoa, Guam, or the Virgin

[[Page 161]]

Islands of the United States. However, this subpart is not applicable to 
the importation of unaccompanied articles in a manner prohibited by law 
or regulation (e.g., mail shipments of alcoholic beverages or alcoholic 
beverages shipped other than by mail in excess of quantities authorized 
by State laws or regulations).
    The following is a summary of the procedure to be followed to obtain 
the benefits of this subpart: A person purchasing articles in American 
Samoa, Guam or the Virgin Islands of the United States would receive a 
sales slip, invoice, or other evidence of purchase which he would 
present to the Customs officer along with his baggage declaration, 
Customs Form 6059-B, and a Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles, 
Customs Form 255. The latter form is prepared in triplicate for each 
shipment to follow. The Customs officer would verify the information, 
indicate on the form whether the article or articles were free of duty, 
dutiable at the flat rate, or a combination of the foregoing, and 
validate the form. Two copies would be returned to the traveler, who 
would send one form to the vendor. Upon receipt of the form the vendor 
would place it in an envelope, affix it to the outside of the package, 
clearly mark the package ``Unaccompanied Tourist Shipment,'' and send 
the package to the traveler, generally via mail, although it could be 
sent by other means. If sent through the mail, the package would be 
examined by Customs and forwarded to the Postal Service for delivery. 
Any duties due would be collected by the mailman. If the shipment 
arrives other than through the mail, the traveler would be notified by 
the carrier when the article arrives. Entry would be made by the carrier 
or the traveler at the customhouse. Any duties due would be collected at 
that time.

character although differing as to quantity and value per package.
    (2) Exceptions to minimum quantities. At ports of entry specifically 
designated by the Commissioner of Customs, the port director is

conditions listed in Sec. 151.5, in the following cases:
    (1) Examination of perishable merchandise is desired solely to

in accordance with Sec. 152.35 of this chapter prior to making an entry 
for consumption or warehouse.

or for exportation--(1) Examination, sampling, weighing or emergency 
operation. As a bona fide incident to exportation or further 
transportation, the importer of merchandise entered or withdrawn for 
transportation under bond or for exportation may, upon written 
application to the port director supported by a valid business reason 
for the request, be permitted to examine, sample, weigh, or subject his 
merchandise to an operation required by reason of an emergency, provided 
that any operation performed on the merchandise does not constitute a 
manufacture, and

that Sec. 151.5 is complied with. For conditions governing transshipment 
and emergency access to the shipment by the carrier, see Sec. 18.3 of 
this chapter.
    (2) Nonemergency operation. In cases not involving an emergency, an 
operation not constituting a manufacture may be permitted under the 
conditions listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if neither the 
protection of the revenue nor the proper conduct of Customs business 
requires that the operation be done in a Customs bonded warehouse, 
provided that the importer's written application for such operation is 
approved by the port director.

Sec. 151.6  Place of examination.

    All merchandise will be examined at the place of arrival, unless 
examination at another place is required or authorized by the port 
director in accordance with Sec. 151.7 or Sec. 151.15 of this part. 
Except where the merchandise is required by the port director to be 
examined at the public stores, the importer shall bear any expense 
involved in preparing the merchandise for Customs examination and in the 
closing of packages.

<R05>
Sec. 151.7  Examination elsewhere than at place of arrival or public stores.

    The port director may require or authorize examination at a place 
other than the place of arrival or the public stores, such as at the 
importer's premises or at a centralized examination station under 
Sec. 151.15 of this part. If examination at a place other than at the 
place of arrival or the public stores is authorized it will be subject 
to the following conditions:
    (a) Sealing of packages. If examination is to be made at the 
importer's premises or other place not under the control of Customs, the 
port director may require the packages to be corded and sealed by a 
Customs officer before the packages are removed from the place of 
arrival. The packages shall be opened only in the presence of the 
Customs officer authorized to examine their contents.
    (b) Preparation for Customs examination and closing of packages. 
Except when merchandise is required by the port director to be examined 
at the public stores, the importer shall arrange and bear any expense 
for preparation of the merchandise for Customs examination and closing 
of packages.
    (c) Reimbursement of expenses outside port limits. If the place of 
examination is not located within the limits of a port of entry or at a 
Customs station at which Customs is permanently located, whether or not 
that location is the place of arrival, the importer shall pay any 
additional expenses, including actual expenses of travel and subsistence 
but not the salary during regular hours of duty of the examining 
officer. However, no collection will be made if the total amount 
chargeable against one importer for one day amounts to less than 50 
cents. If the total amount chargeable amounts to 50 cents or more but 
less than $1, a minimum charge of $1 will be made.
    (d) Bond for removal from Customs custody. Before permitting the 
removal of merchandise for examination elsewhere than at the public 
stores, wharf, or

[[Page 166]]

other place under the control of Customs, the port director shall 
require the importer to execute a bond on Customs Form 301, containing 
the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 151.8   Examination after assembly.

    (a) Application by importer. Upon application by the importer, 
machinery, altars, shrines, and other articles which must be set up or 
assembled prior to examination may be examined at the mill, factory, or 
other suitable place after being assembled.
    (b) Conditions applicable. The importer shall comply with the 
conditions set forth in Sec. 151.7 (b) through (d). The port director 
may also require that a deposit be made of the estimated additional 
expense. The packages need not be corded and sealed in accordance with 
Sec. 151.7(a), but the port director may make such preliminary 
examination as he deems necessary to identify the merchandise with the 
invoice.
    (c) Removal of merchandise and notification of assembly. After the 
bond required by Sec. 151.7(d) has been filed and any necessary 
preliminary examination has been made, the port director may permit the 
merchandise to be removed to the place at which it is to be assembled 
for examination. Within 90 days after such removal, unless an extension 
has been applied for and granted by the port director, the importer 
shall notify the port director that the merchandise has been assembled 
and is ready for examination, whereupon final examination shall be made.


<R05>
Sec. 151.9   Immediate transportation entry delivered outside port limits.

    When merchandise covered by an immediate transportation entry has 
been authorized by the port director to be delivered to a place outside 
a port of entry as provided for in Sec. 18.11(c) of this chapter, the 
provisions of Sec. 151.7 shall be complied with to the same extent as if 
the merchandise had been delivered to the port of entry, and then 
authorized to be examined elsewhere than at the public stores, wharf, or 
other place under the control of Customs.


<R05>
Sec. 151.10  Sampling.

    When necessary, the port director may obtain samples of merchandise 
for appraisement, classification, or other official purposes. Samples 
shall be taken by Customs or a commercial gauger approved in accordance 
with Sec. 151.13. Samples shall be marked to ensure identification and 
retained according to established policies.

<R05>
Sec. 151.11   Request for samples or additional examination packages after release of merchandise.

    If the port director requires samples or additional examination 
packages of merchandise which has been released from Customs custody, he 
shall send the importer a written request, on Customs Form 28, Request 
for Information, or other appropriate form, to submit the necessary 
samples or packages. If the request is not promptly complied with, the 
port director may make a demand under the bond for the return of the 
necessary merchandise to Customs custody in accordance with Sec. 141.113 
of this chapter.

Sec. 151.12  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 151.13  Commercial gaugers and commercial laboratories.

    Commercial gaugers are commercial organizations and individuals who 
measure, gauge, or sample merchandise. (The term ``public gauger'' has 
been used to denote a type of commercial gauger dealing mainly with 
petroleum and petroleum products. ``Public gaugers'' are commercial 
gaugers and are subject to the regulations in part 151.) Commercial 
laboratories are commercial organizations and individuals who analyze 
merchandise, i.e., determine its composition and/or characteristics 
through laboratory analysis. Commercial gaugers may own and operate 
commercial laboratories and vice versa. They may be approved or 
accredited, respectively, as a single organization, but each part of the 
organization

[[Page 167]]

is subject to the appropriate requirements of part 151.
    (a) Acceptance of reports. Provided that the commercial gauger or 
laboratory has complied with the appropriate provisions of the Customs 
Regulations, and in the absence of clear evidence that the port director 
should not do so, the port director shall accept the reports as 
described in the following paragraphs.
    (1) Customs shall accept, from Customs-approved commercial gaugers, 
gauging reports of the net landed quantity of the products described 
below, except that in the case of crude petroleum of Heading 2709, the 
gross quantity may be accepted; see Sec. 151.47. Reports shall be given 
in the appropriate Harmonized Tariff Schedule units of quantity, e.g., 
liters, barrels, and kilograms.

<R05>
Sec. 151.15  Movement of merchandise to a centralized examination station.

    (a) Permission to transfer merchandise for examination. When a 
shipment requires examination at a centralized examination station 
(CES), Customs Form 3461, or Customs Form 3461 (ALT) for land border 
cargo, or an attachment to either, may be used to request permission to 
transfer the merchandise to a CES. The entry filer must write, type or 
stamp the following lines on the form or attachment, and must supply the 
information called for on the first three lines:

Containers to be transferred: ______ All or,
    Container 's ______, ______, ______<l-arrow>

To CES__________________________________<l-arrow>

Approved by: U.S. Customs Inspector______<l-arrow>

Date__________________________________<l-arrow>
Unless the port director exercises his authority pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section, the reviewing inspector will initial and date the 
form or attachment being used, or stamp one copy of the Customs Form 
3461 or 3461 (ALT) if required by the port director. A copy of this 
document will act as notification and authorization to the entry filer 
that the merchandise must

[[Page 172]]

be transferred to the importer-designated CES unless another CES is 
designated by the port director under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Assumption of liability during transfer. Merchandise designated 
for examination may be transferred from the importing carrier's point of 
unlading or from a bonded facility, to a CES, only if the transfer takes 
place under bond. The entry filer shall select one of the following 
bonded movements for the transfer to the CES unless the type of bonded 
movement to be used is specified by the port director under paragraph 
(d) of this section:
    (1) If the merchandise is tranferred directly to a CES by an 
importing carrier, the importing carrier shall remain liable under the 
terms of its international carrier bond for the proper safekeeping and 
delivery of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES 
operator.
    (2) If the merchandise is transferred directly from a bonded 
carrier's facility to a CES or is delivered directly to the CES by a 
bonded carrier, the bonded carrier shall remain liable under the terms 
of its custodial bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the 
merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.
    (3) If containerized cargo, including excess loose cargo that is 
part of the containerized cargo, is transferred to a CES operator's own 
facility using his own vehicles, the CES operator shall be liable under 
the terms of his custodial bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery 
of the merchandise to the CES facility.
    (4) If the importer or his agent acting as importer of record 
transfers the merchandise to a CES, that importer or agent shall assume 
liability under his importation and entry bond (see Sec. 151.7(d) of 
this part) for the proper transfer of the merchandise until it is 
receipted for by the CES operator.
    (c) Annual blanket transfer. Port directors may institute an annual 
blanket transfer application procedure to facilitate any of the bonded 
movements described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Designation of bonded movement and CES to be used. In the event 
the port director deems it necessary, he may direct the type of bonded 
movement to be used to transfer merchandise to a CES and may designate 
the CES at which examination must take place. In either case the port 
director's action will be noted on the Customs Form 3461 or 3461 (ALT) 
or attachment thereto.

Sec. 151.42  Controls on unlading and gauging.

    (a) Methods of control. (1) Each port director shall establish 
controls and checks on the unlading and measurement of petroleum and 
petroleum products imported in bulk by vessel, truck, railroad car, 
pipeline, or other carrier. One of the following methods of control 
shall be employed:
    (i) Customs-approved metering and sampling installations provided by 
the importer;
    (ii) Shore tank gauging; or
    (iii) Weighing for trucks and railroad cars.
    (2) Vessel ullages shall be taken in every case unless the port 
director determines that it is impracticable to do so for safety or 
technological reasons. Ullages may be taken for trucks and railroad cars 
if weighing or shore tank gauging is not available as a method of 
control. Vessel ullages will not be used to determine the quantity 
unladen unless none of the other methods provided for in this paragraph 
is available or adequate.
    (3) The metering and sampling installations described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section are approved by Customs on a case-by-case 
basis. Importers seeking approval shall send a complete description of 
the installation to the port director who, with the concurrence of the 
Director, Laboratory & Scientific Services, or his designee, shall give 
approval or shall state, in writing, the reasons for disapproval. 
Approved installations are subject to periodic verification by Customs. 
Importers desiring to modify a Customs-approved installation shall 
obtain Customs approval beforehand.
    (b) Duties of Customs officers. Customs officers may perform or 
witness ullaging and gauging as follows:
    (1) Opening ullages.
    (2) Closing ullages of carriers which have not completely discharged 
cargo, or if an importer or carrier requests Customs to witness closing 
ullages because of special problems.
    (3) Shore tank gauges performed by company or related-party 
employees.
    (4) Between 5 and 10 per cent of shore tank gauges conducted by 
commercial gaugers.
    (5) Shore tank gauges, including those conducted by a commercial 
gauger if no carrier ullages are taken.
    (c) Manifest discrepancies. Manifest discrepancies (shortages and 
overages) shall be reported by or on behalf of the carrier in the manner 
specified in Sec. 4.12 of this chapter. If a reported discrepancy is not 
explained to the satisfaction of the port director, the master or other 
person in charge, or the owner of the vessel or vehicle, or any person 
directly or indirectly responsible for the discrepancy, will be subject 
to the imposition of the appropriate penalty under section 460, 584, or 
592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1460, 1584, 1592).

Sec. 151.44  Storage tanks.

    (a) Plans and gauge tables. When petroleum or petroleum products 
subject to duty at a specific rate per barrel are imported in bulk in 
tank vessels and are to be transferred into shore storage tanks, both 
the plans of each shore tank showing all outlets and inlets and the 
gauge table for each tank showing its capacity in barrels per centimeter 
or tenth of a centimeter of height shall be certified as correct by the 
proprietor of the tank. One set of these plans and

[[Page 175]]

gauge tables so certified shall be kept on file at the plant of the oil 
company and shall be available at all times to Customs officers. Another 
certified set of the shore tank plans and gauge tables shall be filed 
with the port director for use in verifying the Customs officers' 
reports. The port director may require such additional sets of shore 
tank plans, including subsidiary pipeline plans, and gauge tables as he 
may deem necessary. The storage tank proprietor shall maintain the plans 
and gauge tables for 3 years after discontinuing use of the storage 
tanks as bonded warehouses for the storage of imported petroleum or 
petroleum products.
    (b) Tags required on valves. The inlet and outlet valves of each 
tank shall have tags of a permanent type affixed by the proprietor or 
lessee indicating the use of the valves.
    (c) Verification of gauge tables. Whenever he has reason to suspect 
their reliability, the port director may require the measurement and 
calibrations shown on the gauge tables to be verified by a Customs 
officer. If no qualified Customs officer is available, the port director 
may accept an independent certification verifying the measurements and 
calibrations. The independent verification shall be performed at the 
expense of the storage tank proprietor.

bond (see Sec. 19.2 of this chapter), the certified plans and gauge 
tables required by Sec. 151.44 shall be filed.
    (b) Removal of nonbonded petroleum. If a bonded tank is not empty at 
the time the first importation of bonded petroleum or petroleum products 
is to be stored therein, the amount of nonbonded petroleum or petroleum 
products in the tank shall be withdrawn by the proprietor as soon as 
possible. The request to withdraw shall be in the form of a letter and 
no formal withdrawal need be filed. Domestic or duty-paid petroleum or 
petroleum products shall not thereafter be stored in the tank as long as 
the tank remains bonded.
    (c) Information on warehouse withdrawal. Warehouse withdrawals of 
petroleum or petroleum products from bonded tanks shall show the 
information specified in Sec. 151.41, as well as the designation of the 
tank from which the merchandise is to be withdrawn. Such withdrawals may 
be made for ``---- U.S. gallons, more or less'', but in no case may the 
estimate vary by more than three percent from the gross quantity 
unladen.

bearing materials which are classifiable under Chapter 26, Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), are 
entered for consumption or warehousing at the port of first arrival, 
they shall be sampled for assay and moisture purposes in accordance with 
Sec. 151.52. If proper facilities for weighing or sampling are not 
available at the port of entry, the merchandise shall be transported 
under bond to the place of sampling. The sampling or weighing of metal-
bearing ores or materials at any place other than the port of entry 
shall be at the expense of the parties in interest.
    (b) Ores of low metal content. When, on the basis of invoice 
information, the nature of any available sample, knowledge of prior 
importations of similar materials, and other data, the port director is 
satisfied that metal-bearing ores entered under heading 2617, HTSUS, as 
containing less than 1 percent of metals dutiable under headings 2603, 
2607, and 2608, HTSUS, are properly entered, he may liquidate the entry 
on the basis of the assay information contained in the entry papers. 
However, the sampling and testing procedures prescribed in Secs. 151.52 
and 151.54 shall be followed at random intervals for verification 
purposes.

Sec. 151.52   Sampling procedures.

    (a) Commercial samples taken under Customs supervision. 
Representative commercial moisture and assay samples shall be taken 
under Customs supervision for testing by the Customs laboratory. The 
samples used for the moisture test shall be representative of the 
shipment at the time the shipment is weighed for Customs purposes. When 
a shipment is made up of a number of lots a composite sample of the 
shipment shall be drawn for assay, providing composite sampling is 
feasible and assays of the individual lots are not required for tariff 
classification or other Customs purposes. The composite sample shall 
consist of proportional parts by weight of the prepared sample drawn 
from the various lots represented and shall be thoroughly mixed.
    (b) Commercial samples furnished by importer. When commercial 
samples cannot be taken under Customs supervision, the importer shall be 
required to furnish a verified commercial moisture sample and prepared 
assay sample certified to be representative of the shipment at the time 
the shipment was weighed for Customs purposes. The samples shall be in 
appropriate containers, properly labeled, and shall be accompanied by a 
statement including:
    (1) Entry number,
    (2) Lots represented,
    (3) Kind of ore or material,
    (4) Date and place where sampling occurred, and
    (5) The name and address of the sampling concern.
    (c) Samples taken by Customs. Where no commercial samples have been 
taken, the port director shall take representative samples from 
different parts of the shipment.

    Samples taken in accordance with Sec. 151.52 shall be promptly 
forwarded to the appropriate Customs laboratory for testing in 
accordance with commercial methods. The port director may secure from 
the importer a certified copy of the commercial settlement tests for 
moisture and for assay which shall be transmitted with the commercial 
samples to the Custom laboratory. If the Customs tests are not in 
substantial agreement with the settlement tests, the Customs laboratory 
director shall review his tests. The Customs tests shall be used in 
determining the final duties on the merchandise, except that the 
settlement tests shall be used if, in the opinion of the Customs 
laboratory director:
    (a) The settlement and Customs tests differ by no more than is to be 
expected between qualified laboratories, and
    (b) The use of the settlement test results will not require a 
different tariff

as provided for in section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1562), the percentage clean yield of the part not exported shall 
be determined, at the discretion of the port director, either on the 
basis of a new determination by reweighing, resampling, and retesting, 
or by a computation as described in paragraph (a) of this section, for 
either the exported or the remaining part.


<R05>
Sec. 151.70   Method of sampling by Customs.

    A general sample shall be taken from each sampling unit, unless it 
is not feasible to obtain a representative general sample of the wool or 
hair in a sampling unit or to test such a sample in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 151.71. At the request of the importer, two general 
samples may be taken from a sampling unit if the taking and testing of a 
second general sample is feasible. If two general samples are taken, one 
general sample shall be held for use in making a second test for clean 
yield if such a test is requested in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 151.71(c), or if a second test is found desirable by the port 
director or the chief chemist.

[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17470, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 93-52, 58 FR 
37854, July 14, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 151.71   Laboratory testing for clean yield.

    (a) Test and report by Customs laboratory. The clean yield of all 
general samples taken in accordance with Sec. 151.70 shall be determined 
by test in a Customs laboratory, unless it is found that it is not 
feasible to test such a sample and obtain a proper finding of percentage 
clean yield. A report of the percentage clean yield of each general 
sample as established by the test, or a statement of the reason for not 
testing a general sample, shall be forwarded to the port director.
    (b) Notification to importer. Where samples of wool or hair have 
been tested in a Customs laboratory and the port director has received a 
copy of the Laboratory Report, Customs Form 6415, the port director 
shall promptly provide notice of the test results by mailing a copy of 
that report to the importer.
    (c) Importer's request for retest. If the importer is dissatisfied 
with the port director's finding of clean yield, he may file with the 
port director a written request in duplicate for another laboratory test 
for percentage clean yield. Such request shall be filed within 14 
calendar days after the date of mailing of the notice of the port 
director's finding of clean yield. The request shall be granted if it 
appears to the port director to be made in good faith and if a second 
general sample as provided for in Sec. 151.70 is available for testing, 
or if all packages or, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Customs, an 
adequate number of the packages represented by the general sample are 
available and in their original imported condition.
    (d) Retest procedures. The second test shall be made upon the second 
general sample, if such a sample is available. If

[[Page 180]]

the second general sample is not available, the packages shall be 
reweighed, resampled, and tested in accordance with the provisions of 
this section. All costs and expenses of such operations, exclusive of 
the compensation of Customs officers, shall be borne by the importer, 
who may be present during such resampling and testing.
    (e) Request for commercial test. If the importer is dissatisfied 
with the results of the second laboratory test, or if a second 
laboratory test is not feasible, the wool or hair may be retested by a 
commercial laboratory in accordance with Sec. 151.73.

[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17470, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 75-121, 40

<R05>
Sec. 151.73   Importer's request for commercial laboratory test.

    (a) Conditions for commercial test. If the importer is dissatisfied 
with the results of a retest made in accordance with Sec. 151.71(c), he 
may request that a commercial test be made to determine the percentage 
clean yield of the wool or hair.
    (b) Time for filing request. The importer's request shall be filed 
in writing with the port director within 14 calendar days after the date 
of mailing of the notice of the port director's findings based on the 
retest.
    (c) Procedures for commercial test. The port director shall cause a 
representative quantity of the wool or hair in dispute to be selected 
and tested by a commercial method approved by the Commissioner of 
Customs. The yield, as determined by such commercial test, shall be 
suitably adjusted to coincide with the definition of clean yield in 
Sec. 151.61(b). Such test shall be made under the supervision and 
direction of the port director at an establishment approved by him, and 
the expense thereof, including the actual expense of travel and 
subsistence of Customs officers but not their compensation, shall be 
paid by the importer.

[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17470, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 93-52, 58 FR

<R05>
Sec. 151.74   Retest at port director's request.

    If the port director is not satisfied with the results of any test 
provided for in Sec. 151.71 or Sec. 151.73, he may, within 14 calendar 
days after receiving the report of the results of such test, proceed to 
have another test made upon a suitable sample of the wool or hair at the 
expense of the Government. When the port director is proceeding to have 
another test made, he shall, within the 14-day period specified in this 
paragraph, notify the importer by mail of that fact.


<R05>
Sec. 151.75   Final determination of clean yield.

    The port director shall base his final determination of clean yield 
upon a consideration of all the tests made in connection with the wool 
or hair concerned.

[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17470, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 93-52, 58 FR

<R05>
Sec. 151.76   Grading of wool.

    (a) Examination for grade. The port director shall cause wool 
dutiable at a rate per clean kilogram to be examined for grade. The 
standards for determining grades of wool shall be those which are 
established from time to time by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant 
to law and which are in effect on the date of importation of the wool, 
as provided by Chapter 51, Additional U.S. Note 2, Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
    (b) Notification to importer. If classification of the wool at the 
grade or grades determined on the basis of the examination will result 
in the assessment of duty at a rate higher than the rate provided for 
wool of the grade stated in the entry, the port director shall promptly 
notify the importer by mail.
    (c) Importer's request for reexamination. If the importer is 
dissatisfied with the port director's findings as to the grade or grades 
of the wool, he may, within 14 calendar days after the date of mailing 
of the notice of the port director's findings, file in duplicate a 
written request for another determination of grade or grades, stating 
the reason for

[[Page 181]]

the request. Notice of the port director's findings on the basis of the 
reexamination of the wool shall be mailed to the importer.

    When any merchandise not corresponding with the description given in 
the invoice is found by the examining officer, duties shall be assessed 
on the merchandise actually found. If the discrepancy appears 
conclusively to be the result of a mistake and not of any intent to 
defraud, no proceedings for forfeiture shall be taken. When the entire 
shipment does not agree with the invoice and there is no evidence of any 
intent to defraud, a new entry shall be required and the estimated duty 
paid on the original entry shall be refunded on liquidation as in the 
case of a nonimportation. (Sec. 499, 46 Stat. 728, as amended; 19 U.S.C.

    (b) Similar merchandise under decision favorable to Government. The 
principles of any court decision favorable to the Government shall be 
applied to merchandise, though not identical with the merchandise the 
subject of the court's decision, if its classification is affected by 
such principles, provided that it has been entered or withdrawn for 
consumption after 30 days from the date of publication of the court's 
decision in the Customs Bulletin.
    (c) Higher rate. If a court decision overruling a protest contains a 
definite statement that a higher rate than that assessed by the port 
director was properly chargeable, such higher rate shall be applied to 
all merchandise, whether identical or similar to that passed on by the 
court, which is affected by the principles of the court's decision and 
which is entered or withdrawn for consumption after 30 days from the 
date of

[[Page 185]]

the publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin.
    (d) American manufacturer's petition upheld. If the court upholds a 
petition made by an American manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler under 
the provisions of section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1516), the principles of the court's decision shall be applicable to all 
merchandise of that character which is entered or withdrawn for 
consumption after the date of publication of the court's decision in the 
Customs Bulletin. The liquidation of entries covering merchandise of 
that character made after publication of the court's decision shall be 
suspended in accordance with Sec. 159.57 of this chapter pending any 
rehearing or review, then liquidated, or, if necessary, reliquidated in 
accordance with the final judicial decision.
    (e) Other decisions adverse to Government. Unless the Commissioner 
of Customs otherwise directs, the principles of any court decision 
adverse to the Government (except for a decision upholding an American 
manufacturer's petition as covered in paragraph (d) of this section) 
shall be applied to unliquidated entries and protested entries which 
have not been denied in whole or in part and in which the same issue is 
involved as soon as the time within which an application for a rehearing 
or review may be filed has expired without such application having been 
made. See Sec. 176.31 of this chapter for the treatment of entries which 
are the subject of a court decision.

proclamation of the President, the new rate shall be applied in 
accordance with the detailed instructions in Sec. 141.69 of this 
chapter, which provides in general that the rates of duty applicable to 
merchandise shall be those in effect on the date of entry or withdrawal 
for consumption, except for certain merchandise covered by an entry for 
immediate transportation or overcarried and returned to the port of 
entry.

other evidence that the merchandise was destined for the United States 
at the time of original shipment, it shall be treated as an exportation 
of the country from which it was originally exported. The term 
``country'' is to be regarded for the purposes of this section as

duties to be deposited

[[Page 186]]

or notification of increased duties in accordance with Sec. 152.2.
    (b) Only for merchandise under port director's jurisdiction. The 
information shall be given only in regard to merchandise to be appraised

merchandise into the United States.
    (c) Information by importer. Each request shall be accompanied by 
the latest information as to the values in question which the importer 
has or can reasonably obtain.
    (d) Information not binding. Value information shall be given by the 
port director only with an understanding and agreement in each case that 
the information is in no sense an appraisement and is not binding upon 
the port director's action when he appraises the merchandise.
    (e) No reply required after entry. The port director shall not be 
required to reply to a written request for value information after a 
value for the merchandise has been declared on entry unless he has 
information indicating a probable appraised value different from such 
entered value.

<R05>
Sec. 152.100  Interpretative notes.

    The interpretative notes set forth in this subpart have been derived 
from information contained in the Statement of Administrative Action 
relating to customs valuation, submitted to and approved by Congress 
along with the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39), and will 
have the force and effect of regulations issued under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 152.101  Basis of appraisement.

    (a) Effective date. The value for appraisement of merchandise 
exported to the United States on or after July 1, 1980, or, for articles 
classified under subheading 6401.10.00 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), on or after July 1, 1981, will be 
determined in accordance with section 402, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1401a), as amended by section 201, Trade Agreements Act of 1979.
    (b) Methods. Imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis, 
and in the order, of the following:
    (1) The transaction value provided for in Sec. 152.103;
    (2) The transaction value of identical merchandise provided for in 
Sec. 152.104, if the transaction value cannot be determined, or can be 
determined but cannot be used because of the limitations provided for in 
Sec. 152.103(j);
    (3) The transaction value of similar merchandise provided for in 
Sec. 152.104, if the transaction value of identical merchandise cannot 
be determined;
    (4) The deductive value provided for in Sec. 152.105, if the 
transaction value of similar merchandise cannot be determined;
    (5) The computed value provided for in Sec. 152.106, if the 
deductive value cannot be determined; or
    (6) The value provided for in Sec. 152.107, if the computed value 
cannot be determined.
    (c) Importer's option. The importer may request the application of 
the computed value method before the deductive value method. The request 
must be made at the time the entry summary for the merchandise is filed 
with the port director (see Sec. 141.0a(b) of this chapter). If the 
importer makes the request, but the value of the imported merchandise 
cannot be determined using the computed value method, the merchandise 
will be appraised using the deductive value method if it is possible to 
do so. If the deductive value cannot be determined, the appraised value 
will be determined as provided for in Sec. 152.107.
    (d) Explanation to importer. Upon receipt of a written request from 
the importer within 90 days after liquidation, the port director shall 
provide a reasonable and concise written explanation of how the value of 
the imported merchandise was determined. The explanation will apply only 
to the imported merchandise being appraised

[[Page 187]]

and will not serve as authority with respect to the valuation of 
importations of any other merchandise at the same or a different port of 
entry. This procedure is for informational purposes only, and will not 
affect or replace the protest or administrative ruling procedures 
contained in parts 174 and 177, respectively, of this chapter, or any 
other Customs procedures. Under this procedure, Customs will not be 
required to release any information not otherwise subject to disclosure 
under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or any other statute (see part 103 
of this chapter).

<R05>
Sec. 152.102  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following terms will have the meanings 
indicated:
    (a) Assist. (1) ``Assist'' means any of the following if supplied 
directly or indirectly, and free of charge or at reduced cost, by the 
buyer of imported merchandise for use in connection with the production 
or the sale for export to the United States of the merchandise:
    (i) Materials, components, parts, and similar items incorporated in 
the imported merchandise.
    (ii) Tools, dies, molds, and similar items used in the production of 
the imported merchandise.
    (iii) Merchandise consumed in the production of the imported 
merchandise.
    (iv) Engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and 
sketches that are undertaken elsewhere than in the United States and are 
necessary for the production of the imported merchandise.
    (2) No service or work to which paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section 
applies will be treated as an assist if the service or work:
    (i) Is performed by an individual domiciled within the United 
States;
    (ii) Is performed by that individual while acting as an employee or 
agent of the buyer of the imported merchandise; and
    (iii) Is incidental to other engineering, development, artwork, 
design work, or plans or sketches that are undertaken within the United 
States.
    (3) The following apply in determining the value of assists 
described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section:
    (i) The value of an assist that is available in the public domain is 
the cost of obtaining copies of the assist.
    (ii) If the production of an assist occurred in the United States 
and one or more foreign countries, the value of the assist is the value 
added outside the United States.
    (iii) If the assist was purchased or leased by the buyer from an 
unrelated person, the value of the assist is the cost of the purchase or 
of the lease.
    (b) Commission. ``Selling commission'' means any commission paid to 
the seller's agent, who is related to or controlled by, or works for or 
on behalf of, the manufacturer or the seller.

consensus or substantial authoritative support regarding:
    (i) Which economic resources and obligations should be recorded as 
assets and liabilities;
    (ii) Which changes in assets and liabilities should be recorded;
    (iii) How the assets and liabilities and changes in them should be 
measured;
    (iv) What information should be disclosed and how it should be 
disclosed; and
    (v) Which financial statements should be prepared.
    (2) The applicability of a particular set of generally accepted 
accounting principles will depend upon the basis on which the value of 
the imported merchandise is sought to be established, and the relevant 
country for the point in contention.
    (3) Information submitted by an importer, buyer, or producer in 
regard to the appraisement of merchandise may not be rejected by Customs 
because of the accounting method by which that information was prepared, 
if the preparation was in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (d) Identical merchandise. ``Identical merchandise'' means 
merchandise identical in all respects to, and produced in

[[Page 188]]

the same country and by the same person as, the merchandise being 
appraised. If identical merchandise cannot be found (or for purposes of 
related buyer and seller transactions (see Sec. 152.103 (j)(2)(i)(A)) 
regardless of whether identical merchandise can be found), merchandise 
identical in all respects to, and produced in the same country as, but 
not produced by the same person as, the merchandise being appraised, may 
be treated as ``identical merchandise''. ``Identical merchandise'' does 
not include merchandise that incorporates or reflects any engineering, 
development, artwork, design work, or plan or sketch supplied free or at 
reduced cost by the buyer of the merchandise for use in connection with 
the production or sale for export to the United States of the 
merchandise, and is not an assist because undertaken within the United 
States.
    (e) Packing costs. ``Packing costs'' means the cost of all

materials, used in placing merchandise in condition, packed ready for 
shipment to the United States.
    (f) Price actually paid or payable. ``Price actually paid or 
payable'' means the total payment (whether direct or indirect, and 
exclusive of any charges, costs, or expenses incurred for 
transportation, insurance, and related services incident to the 
international shipment of the merchandise from the country of 
exportation to the place of importation in the United States) made, or 
to be made, for imported merchandise by the buyer to, or for the benefit 
of, the seller.
    (g) Related persons. ``Related persons'' means: (1) Members of the 
same family, including brothers and sisters (whether by whole or half 
blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants.
    (2) Any officer or director of an organization, and that 
organization.
    (3) An officer or director of an organization and an officer or 
director of another organization, if each individual also is an officer 
or director in the other organization.
    (4) Partners.
    (5) Employer and employee.
    (6) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or 
holding with power to vote, five percent or more of the outstanding 
voting stock or shares of any organization, and that organization.
    (7) Two or more persons directly or indirectly controlling, 
controlled by, or under common control with, any person.
    (h) Same class or kind. ``Merchandise of the same class or kind'' 
means merchandise (including, but not limited to, identical merchandise 
and similar merchandise) within a group or range of merchandise produced 
by a particular industry or industry sector.
    (i) Similar merchandise. ``Similar merchandise'' means merchandise 
produced in the same country and by the same person as the merchandise 
being appraised, like the merchandise being appraised in characteristics 
and component material, and commercially interchangeable with the 
merchandise being appraised. If similar merchandise cannot be found (or 
for purposes of related buyer and seller transactions (see Sec. 152.103 
(j)(2)(i)(A)) regardless of whether similar merchandise can be found), 
merchandise produced in the same country as, but not produced by the 
same person as, the merchandise being appraised, like the merchandise 
being appraised in characteristics and component material, and 
commercially interchangeable with the merchandise being appraised, may 
be treated as ``similar merchandise''. ``Similar merchandise'' does not 
include merchandise that incorporates or reflects any engineering, 
development, artwork, design work, or plan or sketch supplied free or at 
reduced cost by the buyer of the merchandise for use in connection with 
the production or the sale for export to the United States of the 
merchandise, and is not an assist because undertaken within the United 
States.
    (j) Sufficient information. ``Sufficient information'' means 
information that establishes the accuracy of:
    (1) Any amount:
    (i) Added under Sec. 152.103(b) to the price actually paid or 
payable;
    (ii) Deducted under Sec. 152.105(d) as profit or general expenses or 
value from further processing, or

[[Page 189]]

    (iii) Added under Sec. 152.106(b) as profit or general expenses; or
    (2) Any difference taken into account under Sec. 152.103(j)(2)(iv); 
or
    (3) Any adjustment made under Sec. 152.104(d).
    (k) Unit price in greatest aggregate quantity. ``Unit price at which 
merchandise is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity'' means the unit 
price at which the ``merchandise concerned'' is sold to unrelated 
persons at the first commercial level after importation (in cases to 
which Sec. 152.105(c)(1) and (2) apply), or after further processing (in 
cases to which Sec. 151.105(c)(3) applies), at which the sales take 
place in a total volume greater than the total volume sold at any other 
unit price and sufficient to establish the unit price.


<R05>
Sec. 152.103  Transaction value.

    (a) Price actually paid or payable--(1) General. In determining 
transaction value, the price actually paid or payable will be considered 
without regard to its method of derivation. It may be the result of 
discounts, increases, or negotiations, or may be arrived at by the 
application of a formula, such as the price in effect on the date of 
export in the London Commodity Market. The word ``payable'' refers to a 
situation in which the price has been agreed upon, but actual payment 
has not been made at the time of importation. Payment may be made by 
letters of credit or negotiable instruments and may be made directly or 
indirectly.

    Example 1. In a transaction with foreign Company X, a U.S. firm pays 
Company X $10,000 for a shipment of meat products, packed ready for 
shipment to the United States. No selling commission, assist, royalty, 
or license fee is involved. Company X is not related to the U.S. 
purchaser and imposes no condition or limitation on the buyer.
    The customs value of the imported meat products is $10,000--the 
transaction value of the imported merchandise.

    Example 2. A foreign shipper sold merchandise at $100 per unit to a 
U.S. importer. Subsequently, the foreign shipper increased its price to 
$110 per unit. The merchandise was exported after the effective date of 
the price increase. The invoice price of $100 was the price originally 
agreed upon and the price the U.S. importer actually paid for the 
merchandise.
    How should the merchandise be appraised?
    Actual transaction value of $100 per unit based on the price 
actually paid or payable.

    Example 3. A foreign shipper sells to U.S. wholesalers at one price 
and to U.S. retailers at a higher price. The shipment undergoing 
appraisement is a shipment to a U.S. retailer. There are continuing 
shipments of identical and similar merchandise to U.S. wholesalers.
    How should the merchandise be appraised?
    Actual transaction value based on the price actually paid or payable 
by the retailer.

    Example 4. Company X in the United States pay $2,000 to Y Toy 
Factory abroad for a shipment of toys. The $2,000 consists of $1,850 for 
the toys and $150 for ocean freight and insurance. Y Toy Factory would 
have charged Company X $2,200 for the toys; however, because Y owed 
Company X $350, Y charged only $1,850 for the toys. What is the 
transaction value?
    The transaction value of the imported merchandise is $2,200, that 
is, the sum of the $1,850 plus the $350 indirect payment. Because the 
transaction value excludes C.I.F. charges, the $150 ocean freight and 
insurance charge is excluded.

    Example 5. A seller offers merchandise at $100, less a 2% discount 
for cash. A buyer remits $98 cash, taking advantage of the cash 
discount.
    The transaction value is $98, the price actually paid or payable.

    (2) Indirect payment. An indirect payment would include the 
settlement by the buyer, in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the 
seller, or where the buyer receives a price reduction on a current 
importation as a means of settling a debt owed him by the seller. 
Activities such as advertising, undertaken by the buyer on his own 
account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in 
Sec. 152.103(b), will not be considered an indirect payment to the 
seller though they may benefit the seller. The costs of those activities 
will not be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining 
the customs value of the imported merchandise.
    (3) Assembled merchandise. The price actually paid or payable may 
represent an amount for the assembly of imported merchandise in which 
the seller has no interest other than as the assembler. The price 
actually paid or payable in that case will be calculated by the addition 
of the value of the components and required adjustments to

[[Page 190]]

form the basis for the transaction value.

    Example 1. The importer previously has supplied an unrelated foreign 
assembler with fabricated components ready for assembly having a value 
or cost at the assembler's plant of $1.00 per unit. The importer pays 
the assembler 50 cents per unit for the assembly. The transaction value 
for the assembled unit is $1.50.

    Example 2. Same facts as Example 1 above except the U.S. importer 
furnishes to the foreign assembler a tooling assist consisting of a tool 
acquired by the importer at $1,000. The transportation expenses to the 
foreign assembler's plant for the tooling assist equal $100. The 
transaction value for the assembled unit would be $1.50 per unit plus a 
pro rata share of the tooling assist valued at $1,100.

    (4) Rebate. Any rebate of, or other decrease in, the price actually 
paid or payable made or otherwise effected between the buyer and seller 
after the date of importation of the merchandise will be disregarded in 
determining the transaction value under Sec. 152.103(b).
    (5) Foreign inland freight and other inland charges incident to the 
international shipment of merchandise.--(i) Ex-factory sales. If the 
price actually paid or payable by the buyer to the seller for the 
imported merchandise does not include a charge for foreign inland 
freight and other charges for services incident to the international 
shipment of merchandise (an ex-factory price), those charges will not be 
added to the price.
    (ii) Sales other than ex-factory. As a general rule, in those 
situations where the price actually paid or payable for imported 
merchandise includes a charge for foreign inland freight, whether or not 
itemized separately on the invoices or other commercial documents, that 
charge will be part of the transaction value to the extent included in 
the price. However, charges for foreign inland freight and other 
services incident to the shipment of the merchandise to the United 
States may be considered incident to the international shipment of that 
merchandise within the meaning of Sec. 152.102(f) if they are identified 
separately and they occur after the merchandise has been sold for export 
to the United States and placed with a carrier for through shipment to 
the United States.
    (iii) Evidence of sale for export and placement for through 
shipment. A sale for export and placement for through shipment to the 
United States under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be 
established by means of a through bill of lading to be presented to the 
port director. Only in those situations where it clearly would be 
impossible to ship merchandise on a through bill of lading (e.g., 
shipments via the seller's own conveyance) will other documentation 
satisfactory to the port director showing a sale for export to the 
United States and placement for through shipment to the United States be 
accepted in lieu of a through bill of lading.
    (iv) Erroneous and false information. This regulation shall not be 
construed as prohibiting Customs from making appropriate additions to 
the dutiable value of merchandise in instances where verification 
reveals that foreign inland freight charges or other charges for 
services incident to the international shipment of merchandise have been 
overstated.
    (b) Additions to price actually paid or payable. (1) The transaction 
value of imported merchandise is the price actually paid or payable for 
the merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, plus 
amounts equal to:
    (i) The packing costs incurred by the buyer with respect to the 
imported merchandise;
    (ii) Any selling commission incurred by the buyer with respect to 
the imported merchandise;
    (iii) The value, apportioned as appropriate, of any assist;
    (iv) Any royalty or license fee related to the imported merchandise 
that the buyer is required to pay, directly or indirectly, as a 
condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for exportation to the 
United States; and
    (v) The proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the 
imported merchandise that accrue, directly or indirectly, to the seller.
    (2) The price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise will 
be increased by the amounts attributable to the items (and no others) 
described in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this section to the 
extent that each amount is not otherwise included within the

[[Page 191]]

price actually paid or payable, and is based on sufficient information. 
If sufficient information is not available, for any reason, with respect 
to any amount referred to in this section, the transaction value will be 
treated as one that cannot be determined.
    (3) Interpretative note. A royalty is paid on the basis of the price 
in a sale in the United States of a gallon of a particular product 
imported by the pound and transformed into a solution after importation. 
If the royalty is based partially on the imported merchandise and 
partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported 
merchandise (such as if the imported merchandise is mixed with domestic 
ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or if the royalty 
cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the 
buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt to make an 
addition for the royalty. However, if the amount of this royalty is 
based only on the imported merchandise and can be readily quantified, an 
addition to the price actually paid or payable will be made.
    (c) Sufficiency of information. Additions to the price actually paid 
or payable will be made only if there is sufficient information to 
establish the accuracy of the additions and the extent to which they are 
not included in the price.
    (d) Assist. If the value of an assist is to be added to the price 
actually paid or payable, or to be used as a component of computed 
value, the port director shall determine the value of the assist and 
apportion that value to the price of the imported merchandise in the 
following manner:
    (1) If the assist consist of materials, components, parts, or 
similar items incorporated in the imported merchandise, or items 
consumed in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the 
buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist is the cost of 
its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person 
related to the buyer, its value would be the cost of its production. In 
either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs 
to the place of production.
    (2) If the assist consists of tools, dies, molds, or similar items 
used in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the 
buyer from an unrelated seller,the value of the assist is the cost of 
its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person 
related to the buyer, its value would be cost of its production. If the 
assist has been used previously by the buyer, regardless of whether it 
had been acquired or produced by him, the original cost of acquisition 
or production would be adjusted downward to reflect its use before its 
value could be determined. If the assist were leased by the buyer from 
an unrelated seller, the value of the assist would be the cost of the 
lease. In either case, the value of the assist would include 
transportation costs to the place of production. Repairs or 
modifications to an assist may increase its value.

    Example 1. A U.S. importer supplied detailed designs to the foreign 
producer. These designs were necessary to manufacture the merchandise. 
The U.S. importer bought the designs from an engineering company in the 
U.S. for submission to his foreign supplier.
    Should the appraised value of the merchandise include the value of 
the assist?
    No, design work undertaken in the U.S. may not be added to the price 
actually paid or payable.

    Example 2. A U.S. importer supplied molds free of charge to the 
foreign shipper. The molds were necessary to manufacture merchandise for 
the U.S. importer. The U.S. importer had some of the molds manufactured 
by a U.S. company and others manufactured in a third country.
    Should the appraised value of the merchandise include the value of 
the molds?
    Yes. It is an addition required to be made to transaction value.

    (e) Apportionment. (1) The apportionment of the value of assists to 
imported merchandise will be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to 
the circumstances and in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. The method of apportionment actually accepted by Customs 
will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer. If the 
entire anticipated production using the assist is for exportation to the 
United States, the total value may be apportioned over (i) the first 
shipment, if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire

[[Page 192]]

value at once, (ii) the number of units produced up to the time of the 
first shipment, or (iii) the entire anticipated production. In addition 
to these three methods, the importer may request some other method of 
apportionment in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. If the anticipated production is only partially for 
exportation to the United States, or if the assist is used in several 
countries, the method of apportionment will depend upon the 
documentation submitted by the importer.
    (2) Interpretative note. An importer provides the producer with a 
mold to be used in the production of the imported merchandise and 
contracts to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival of the first 
shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. 
The importer may request Customs to apportion the value of the mold over 
1,000, 4,000, 10,000 units, or any other figure which is in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
    (f) Royalties or license fees. Royalties or license fees for patents 
covering processes to manufacture the imported merchandise generally 
will be dutiable. Royalties or license fees paid to third parties for 
use, in the United States, of copyrights and trademarks related to the 
imported merchandise generally will be considered selling expenses of 
the buyer and not dutiable. The dutiable status of royalties or license 
fees paid by the buyer will be determined in each case and will depend 
on (1) whether the buyer was required to pay them as a condition of sale 
of the merchandise for exportation to the United States, and (2) to whom 
and under what circumstances they were paid. Payments made by the buyer 
to a third party for the right to distribute or resell the imported 
merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable for 
the imported merchandise if the payments are not a condition of the sale 
of the merchandise for exportation to the United States.

    Example. A foreign producer sold merchandise to an unrelated U.S. 
importer. The U.S. importer pays a royalty to an unrelated third party 
for the right to manufacture and sell a product made in part from the 
imported merchandise. The royalty is based on the selling price of the 
further-manufactured product in the U.S.
    Is the license fee part of the appraised value? No. The license fee 
is not a condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for export to 
the U.S.

    (g) Proceeds of subsequent resale. Additions to the price actually 
paid or payable will be made for the value of any part of the proceeds 
of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise 
that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller. Dividends or other 
payments from the buyer to the seller which do not relate directly to 
the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or 
payable. Whether any addition would be made will depend on the facts of 
the particular case.

    Example. A buyer contracts to import a new product. Not knowing 
whether the product ultimately will sell in the United States, the buyer 
agrees to pay the seller initially $1 per unit with an additional $1 per 
unit to be paid upon the sale of each unit in the United States. 
Assuming the resale price in the United States can be determined in a 
reasonable period of time, the transaction value of each unit would be 
$2. Otherwise, the transaction value could not be determined for want of 
sufficient information.

    (h) Right to reproduce. Charges for the right to reproduce the 
imported merchandise in the United States will not be added to the price 
actually paid or payable. The right to reproduce denotes that an idea or 
an original work is incorporated in, or reflected by, the imported 
merchandise, and the right is reserved to reproduce that idea or work in 
other merchandise by using the imported merchandise. The concept of the 
right to reproduce relates only to the following classes of merchandise: 
originals or copies of artistic or scientific works; originals or copies 
of models and industrial drawings; model machines and prototypes; and 
plant and animal species.

    Example. The importer purchases a painting. By purchasing the 
painting, the owner possesses the right to resell, lease, or otherwise 
place it on display. Absent an agreement to the contrary, he does not 
possess the right to reproduce copies of the painting. Fees paid for the 
right to reproduce the painting would not be dutiable.


[[Page 193]]


    (i) Exclusions from transaction value. The transaction value of 
imported merchandise does not include any of the following, if 
identified separately from the price actually paid or payable and from 
any cost or other item referred to in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Any reasonable cost or charge that is incurred for--
    (i) The construction, erection, assembly, or maintenance of, or the 
technical assistance provided with respect to, the merchandise after its 
importation into the United States; or
    (ii) The transportation of the merchandise after its importation.
    (2) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on 
the imported merchandise by reason of its importation, and any Federal 
excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which 
vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable.

    Example. A foreign shipper sells a piece of equipment to a U.S. 
buyer. The total contract price for the equipment includes technical 
assistance in the U.S. The equipment cannot be purchased without the 
technical assistance, but the contract provides a breakdown of costs.
    Should the appraised value include the technical assistance? No, 
transaction value does not include any reasonable costs for 
construction, erection, assembly, maintenance of, or technical 
assistance, for the imported merchandise after its importation into the 
U.S., the cost of which can be accurately identified as being separate 
from the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise to which 
they relate.

    (j) Limitations on use of transaction value--(1) In general. The 
transaction value of imported merchandise will be the appraised value 
only if:
    (i) There are no restrictions on the disposition or use of the 
imported merchandise by the buyer, other than restrictions which are 
imposed or required by law, limit the geographical area in which the 
merchandise may be resold, or do not affect substantially the value of 
the merchandise;
    (ii) The sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the 
imported merchandise is not subject to any condition or consideration 
for which a value cannot be determined;
    (iii) No part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or 
use of the imported merchandise by the buyer will accrue directly or 
indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made 
under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section; and
    (iv) The buyer and seller are not related, or the buyer and seller 
are related but the transaction value is acceptable.
    (2) Related person transactions. (i) The transaction value between a 
related buyer and seller is acceptable if an examination of the 
circumstances of sale indicates that their relationship did not 
influence the price actually paid or payable, or if the transaction 
value of the imported merchandise closely approximates:
    (A) The transaction value of identical merchandise; or of similar 
merchandise, in sales to unrelated buyers in the United States; or
    (B) The deductive value or computed value of identical merchandise, 
or of similar merchandise; and
    (C) Each value referred to in paragraph (j)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of 
this section that is used for comparison relates to merchandise that was 
exported to the United States at or about the same time as the imported 
merchandise.
    (ii) In applying the values used for comparison, differences with 
respect to the sales involved will be taken into account if based on 
sufficient information supplied by the buyer or otherwise available to 
Customs and if the differences relate to:
    (A) Commercial levels;
    (B) Quantity levels;
    (C) The costs, commissions, values, fees, and proceeds described in 
paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (D) The costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller 
and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in 
sales in which the seller and the buyer are related.
    (k) Restrictions and conditions on sale. (1) A restriction placed on 
the buyer of imported merchandise that does not affect substantially its 
value will not prevent transaction value from being accepted as the 
appraised value.
    (i) Interpretative note. A seller requires a buyer of automobiles 
not to sell or exhibit them before a fixed date that represents the 
beginning of a model year.

[[Page 194]]

    (2) The transaction value will not be accepted as the appraised 
value if the sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the 
merchandise is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value 
cannot be determined.
    (i) Interpretative note 1. The seller establishes the price of the 
imported merchandise on condition that the buyer also will buy other 
merchandise in specified quantities.
    (ii) Interpretative note 2. The price of the imported merchandise is 
dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the merchandise 
sells other merchandise to the seller of the merchandise.
    (iii) Interpretative note 3. The price of the imported merchandise 
is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the 
merchandise, such as where the merchandise is to be further processed by 
the buyer, and has been provided by the seller on condition that he will 
receive a specified quantity of the finished merchandise.
    (l) Related buyer and seller--(1) Validation of transaction. The 
port director shall not disregard a transaction value solely because the 
buyer and seller are related. There will be related person transactions 
in which validation of the transaction value, using the procedures 
contained in Sec. 152.103(j)(2), may not be necessary.
    (i) Interpretative note 1. Customs may have previously examined the 
relationship or may already have sufficient detailed information 
concerning the buyer and seller to be satisfied that the relationship 
did not influence the price actually paid or payable. In such case, if 
Customs has no doubts about the acceptability of the price, the price 
will be accepted without requesting further information from the 
importer. If Customs does have doubts about the acceptability of the 
price and is unable to accept the transaction value without further 
inquiry, the importer will be given an opportunity to supply such 
further detailed information as may be necessary to enable Customs to 
examine the circumstances of the sale. In this context, Customs will 
examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which 
the buyer and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in 
which the price in question was arrived at in order to determine whether 
the relationship influenced the price.
    (ii) Interpretative note 2. If it is shown that the buyer and 
seller, although related, buy from and sell to each other as if they 
were not related, this will demonstrate that the price has not been 
influenced by the relationship, and the transaction value will be 
accepted. If the price has been settled in a manner consistent with the 
normal pricing practices of the industry in question, or with the way 
the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who are not related to 
him, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the 
relationship.
    (iii) Interpretative note 3. If it is shown that the price is 
adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is 
equivalent to the firm's overall profit realized over a representative 
period of time (e.g., on an annual basis), in sales of merchandise of 
the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price has not 
been influenced.

    Example. A foreign seller sells merchandise to a related U.S. 
importer. The foreign seller does not sell identical merchandise or 
similar merchandise to any unrelated parties. The transaction between 
the foreign seller and the U.S. importer is determined by Customs to be 
unaffected by the relationship.
    How should the merchandise be appraised?
    Transaction value based on the price actually paid or payable. A 
transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable if 
the relationship did not affect the price actually paid or payable. This 
is so even if similar merchandise is being sold at a higher price, which 
includes a higher percentage for profit and general expenses.

    (2) Test values. (i) The importer or the buyer may demonstrate that 
the transaction value in a related person transaction is acceptable by 
showing that the value ``closely approximates'' any one of the test 
values provided in Sec. 152.103(j)(2)(i). The factors that will be 
examined to determine if the transaction value closely approximates a 
test value include:
    (A) The nature of the imported merchandise and the industry,
    (B) The season in which the merchandise is imported,
    (C) Whether the difference in value is commercially significant, and

[[Page 195]]

    (D) Whether the difference in value is attributable to internal 
transport costs in the country of exportation.
    (ii) Because these factors may vary, Customs will not be able to 
apply a uniform standard, such as a fixed percentage, in each case. A 
small difference in value in a case involving one type of imported 
merchandise may be unacceptable, although a large difference in a case 
involving another type may be acceptable, in determining if the 
transaction value closely approximates any of the test values. Customs 
will be consistent in determining if one value ``closely approximates'' 
another value. The same approach will be taken if Customs considers a 
transaction value that is higher than any of the enumerated test values 
as will be taken if the transaction value is lower than any of the test 
values.

    Example. In applying any of the test values, if the transaction 
value in the sale under consideration is rejected because 95 does not 
closely approximate 100, then a transaction value for the sale of the 
same merchandise at 105 occurring at or about the same time likewise 
would have to be rejected. Similarly, if 103 were considered to closely 
approximate 100, a transaction value of 97 likewise would closely 
approximate 100.

    (iii) If one of the test values provided in Sec. 152.103(j)(2)(i) 
has been found to be appropriate, the port director shall not seek to 
determine if the relationship between the buyer and seller influenced 
the price. If the port director already has sufficient information to be 
satisfied, without further detailed inquiries, that one of the test 
values is appropriate, he shall not require the importer to demonstrate 
that the test value is appropriate.
    (m) Rejection of transaction value. When Customs has grounds for 
rejecting the transaction value declared by an importer and that 
rejection increases the duty liability, the port director shall inform 
the importer of the grounds for the rejection. The importer will be 
afforded 20 days to respond in writing to the port director if in 
disagreement. This procedure will not affect or replace the 
administrative ruling procedures contained in part 177 of this chapter, 
or any other Customs procedures.

[T.D. 81-7, 46 FR 2600, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended by T.D. 84-235, 49 FR 
46888, Nov. 29, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 152.104  Transaction value of identical merchandise and similar merchandise.

    (a) General. The transaction value of identical merchandise, or of 
similar merchandise, is the transaction value (acceptable as the 
appraised value under Sec. 152.103 but adjusted under paragraph (e) of 
this section) of imported merchandise that is--
    (1) With respect to the merchandise being appraised, either 
identical merchandise, or similar merchandise; and
    (2) Exported to the United States at or about the time that the 
merchandise being appraised is exported to the United States.
    (b) Identical merchandise. Minor differences in appearance will not 
preclude otherwise conforming merchandise from being considered 
``identical''. See Sec. 152.102(d).
    (c) Similar merchandise. The quality of the merchandise, its 
reputation, and the existence of a trademark will be factors considered 
to determine whether merchandise is ``similar''. See Sec. 152.102(i).
    (d) Commercial level and quantity. Transaction values determined 
under this section will be based on sales of identical merchandise, or 
similar merchandise, at the same commercial level and in substantially 
the same quantity as the sales of the merchandise being appraised. If no 
such sale is found, sales of identical merchandise, or similar 
merchandise, at either a different commercial level or in different 
quantities, or both, will be used, but adjusted to take account of that 
difference. Any adjustment made under this section will be based on 
``sufficient information''. See Sec. 152.102(j). If in applying this 
section to any merchandise, two or more transaction values for identical 
merchandise, or for similar merchandise, are determined, the merchandise 
will be appraised on the basis of the lower or lowest of those values.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) Adjustments for identical merchandise, or 
similar merchandise, because of different commercial levels or 
quantities, or both,

[[Page 196]]

whether leading to an increase or decrease in the value, will be made 
only on the basis of sufficient information; e.g., valid price lists 
containing prices referring to different levels or quantities.
    (2) Interpretative note. If the imported merchandise being valued 
consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical imported 
merchandise for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 
units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, 
the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's 
price list and using that price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This 
does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 
as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide 
through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective 
measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the 
provisions for transaction value of identical or similar merchandise is 
not appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 152.105  Deductive value.

    (a) Merchandise concerned. For the purposes of deductive value, 
``merchandise concerned'' means the merchandise being appraised, 
identical merchandise, or similar merchandise.
    (b) Merchandise of the same class or kind. For the purposes of 
deductive value, ``merchandise of the same class or kind'' includes 
merchandise imported from the same country as well as other countries as 
the merchandise being appraised.
    (c) Prices. The deductive value of the merchandise being appraised 
is whichever of the following prices (as adjusted under paragraph (d) of 
this section) is appropriate depending upon when and in what condition 
the merchandise concerned is sold in the United States:
    (1) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as 
imported at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being 
appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise 
concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity at or about such 
date.
    (2) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as 
imported but not sold at or about the date of importation of the 
merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the 
merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity after 
the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised but before 
the close of the 90th day after the date of such importation.
    (3) If the merchandise concerned was not sold in the condition as 
imported and not sold before the close of the 90th day after the date of 
importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit 
price at which the merchandise being appraised, after further 
processing, is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity before the 180th 
day after the date of such importation. This provision will apply to 
appraisement of merchandise only if the importer so elects at the time 
of filing the entry summary.
    (d) Deductions from price. The price determined under paragraph (c) 
of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to:
    (1) Any commission usually paid or agreed to be paid, or the 
addition usually made for profit and general expenses, in connection 
with sales in the United States of imported merchandise that is of the 
same class or kind, regardless of the country of exportation, as the 
merchandise concerned;
    (2) The actual costs and associated costs of transportation and 
insurance incurred with respect to international shipments of the 
merchandise concerned from the country of exportation to the United 
States;
    (3) The usual costs and associated costs of transportation and 
insurance incurred with respect to shipments of the merchandise 
concerned from the place of importation to the place of delivery in the 
United States, if those costs are not included as a general expense 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
    (4) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on 
the merchandise concerned by reason of its importation, and any Federal 
excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which 
vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable; and

[[Page 197]]

    (5) But only in the case of price determined under paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section, the value added by the processing of the merchandise 
after importation to the extent that the value is based on sufficient 
information relating to the cost of that processing.
    (e) Profit and general expenses; special rules. (1) The deduction 
made for profit and general expenses (taken as a whole) will be based 
upon the importer's profit and general expenses, unless the profit and 
general expenses are inconsistent with those reflected in sales in the 
United States of imported merchandise of the same class or kind from all 
countries, in which case the deduction will be based on the usual profit 
and general expenses reflected in those sales, as determined from 
sufficient information. Any State or local tax imposed on the importer 
with respect to the sale of imported merchandise will be treated as a 
general expense.
    (2) In determining deductions for commissions and usual profit and 
general expenses, sales in the United States of the narrowest group or 
range of imported merchandise of the same class or kind, including the 
merchandise being appraised, for which sufficient information can be 
provided, will be examined.
    (f) Packing costs. The price determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section will be increased, but only to the extent that the costs are not 
otherwise included, by an amount equal to the packing costs incurred by 
the importer or the buyer with respect to the merchandise concerned.
    (g) Assists. For purposes of determining deductive value, any sale 
to a person who supplies any assist for use in connection with the 
production or sale for export of the merchandise concerned will be 
disregarded.
    (h) Unit price in greatest aggregate quantity. The unit price will 
be established after a sufficient number of units have been sold to an 
unrelated person. The unit price to be used when the units have been 
sold in different quantities will be that at which the total volume sold 
is greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price.
    (1) Interpretative note 1. Merchandise is sold to an unrelated 
person from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for 
purchases made in larger quantities:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Total 
                                                                quantity
          Sale quantity             Unit     Number of sales     sold at
                                   price                          each  
                                                                  price 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-10 units......................     $100  10 sales of 5 units        65
                                           5 sales of 3 units.          
11-25 units.....................       95  5 sales of 11 units        55
Over 25 units...................       90  1 sale of 30 units.        80
                                           1 sale of 50 units.          
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The greatest number of units sold at a price is 80; therefore, the unit 
price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $90.
    (2) Interpretative note 2. Two sales to unrelated persons occur: in 
the first sale, 500 units are sold at a price of $95 each; in the second 
sale, 400 units are sold at a price of $90 each. In this example, the 
greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore, 
the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $95.
    (3) Interpretative note 3. Various quantities are sold to unrelated 
persons at various prices:

                                (i) Sales

                                                                  Unit  
                        Sale quantity                            price

35 units.....................................................         90
5 units......................................................        100
------------------------------------------------------------------------


                               (ii) Totals                              
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Unit  
                     Total quantity sold                         price  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
65...........................................................        $90
50...........................................................         95
60...........................................................        100
25...........................................................        105
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price 
is 65; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 
$90.
    (i) Further processing--(1) Quantified data. If merchandise has 
undergone further processing after its importation into the United 
States and the importer elects the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section, deductions made for the value added by that processing 
will be based on objective and quantifiable data relating to the

[[Page 198]]

cost of the work performed. Accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods 
of construction, and other industry practices would form the basis for 
the deduction. That deduction also will reflect amounts for spoilage, 
waste, or scrap derived from the further processing.
    (2) Loss of identity. If the imported merchandise loses its identity 
as a result of further processing, the method specified in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section will not be applicable unless the value added by 
the processing can be determined accurately without unreasonable 
difficulty for either importers or Customs. If the imported merchandise 
maintains its identity but forms a minor element of the merchandise sold 
in the United States, the use of paragraph (c)(3) of this section will 
be unjustified. The port director shall review each case involving these 
issues on its merits.

    Example. A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S. 
importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated person. The 
transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is 
determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no 
identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production. 
The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished 
product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of 
importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and 
the type of processing involved can be accurately costed.
    How should the merchandise be appraised?
    The merchandise should be appraised under deductive value with 
allowances for profit and general expenses, freight and insurance, 
duties and taxes, and the cost of processing.

<R05>
Sec. 152.106  Computed value.

    (a) Elements. The computed value of imported merchandise is the sum 
of:
    (1) The cost or value of the materials and the fabrication and other 
processing of any kind employed in the production of the imported 
merchandise;
    (2) An amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually 
reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the 
imported merchandise that are made by the producers in the country of 
exportation for export to the United States;
    (3) Any assist, if its value is not included under paragraph (a) (1) 
or (2) of this section; and
    (4) The packing costs.
    (b) Special rules. (1) The cost or value of materials under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not include the amount of any 
internal tax imposed by the country of exportation that is directly 
applicable to the materials or their disposition if the tax is remitted 
or refunded upon the exportation of the merchandise in the production of 
which the materials were used.
    (2) The amount for profit and general expenses under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section will be based upon the producer's profit and 
general expenses, unless the producer's profit and general expenses are 
inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the 
same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by 
producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States. 
In that case, the amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be 
based on the usual profit and general expenses of such producers in 
those sales, as determined from ``sufficient information''. See 
Sec. 152.102(j).
    (c) Profit and general expenses. The amount for profit and general 
expenses will be taken as a whole. If the producer's profit figure is 
low and general expenses high, those figures taken together nevertheless 
may be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of imported 
merchandise of the same class or kind.
    (1) Interpretative note 1. A product is introduced into the United 
States, and the producer accepts either no profit or a low profit to 
offset the high general expenses required to introduce the product into 
this market. If the producer can demonstrate that there is a low profit 
on sales of the imported merchandise because of peculiar commercial 
circumstances, the actual profit figures will be accepted provided the 
producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and his pricing 
policy reflects the usual pricing policies in the industry.
    (2) Interpretative note 2. Producers have been forced to lower 
prices temporarily because of an unforseeable drop in demand, or they 
sell merchandise to

[[Page 199]]

complement a range of merchandise being produced in the United States 
and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. If the producer's 
own figures for profit and general expenses are not consistent with 
those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or 
kind as the merchandise being valued which are made in the country of 
exportation for export to the United States, the amount for profit and 
general expenses will be based upon reliable and quantifiable 
information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of 
the merchandise.
    (d) Assists and packing costs. Computed value also will include an 
amount equal to the apportioned value of any assists used in the 
production of the imported merchandise and the packing costs for the 
imported merchandise. The value of any engineering, development, 
artwork, design work, and plans and sketches undertaken in the United 
States will be included in computed value only to the extent that their 
value has been charged to the producer. Depending on the producer's 
method of accounting, the value of assists may be included (duplicated) 
in the producer's cost of materials, fabrication, and other processing, 
or in the general expenses. If duplication occurs, a separate amount for 
the value of the assists will not be added to the other elements as it 
is not intended that any component of computed value be included twice.
    (e) Merchandise of same class or kind. Sales for export to the 
United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise, 
including the merchandise being appraised, will be examined to determine 
usual profit and general expenses. For the purpose of computed value, 
merchandise of the same class or kind must be from the same country as 
the merchandise being appraised.

    Example. A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S. 
importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated persons. 
The transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is 
determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no 
identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production. 
The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished 
product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of 
importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and 
the type of processing involved can be accurately costed. The U.S. 
importer has requested that the shipment be appraised under computed 
value. The profit and general expenses figure for the same class or kind 
of merchandise in the country of exportation for export to the U.S. is 
known.
    How should the merchandise be appraised?
    The merchandise should be appraised under computed value, using the 
company's profit and general expenses if not inconsistent with those 
usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind.

    (f) Availability of information. (1) It will be presumed that the 
computed value of the imported merchandise cannot be determined if:
    (i) The importer is unable to provide required computed value 
information within a reasonable time, and/or
    (ii) The foreign producer refuses to provide, or is legally 
prevented from providing, that information.
    (2) If information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the 
producer is used to determine computed value, the port director shall 
inform the importer, upon written request, of:
    (i) The source of the information,
    (ii) The data used, and
    (iii) The calculation based upon the specified data,

if not contrary to domestic law regarding disclosure of information. See 
also Sec. 152.101(d).


<R05>
Sec. 152.107  Value if other values cannot be determined or used.

    (a) Reasonable adjustments. If the value of imported merchandise 
cannot be determined or otherwise used for the purposes of this subpart, 
the imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis of a value 
derived from the methods set forth in Secs. 152.103 through 152.106, 
reasonably adjusted to the extent necessary to arrive at a value. Only 
information available in the United States will be used.
    (b) Identical merchandise or similar merchandise. The requirement 
that identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, should be exported 
at or about the same time of exportation as the merchandise being 
appraised may

[[Page 200]]

be interpreted flexibly. Identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, 
produced in any country other than the country of exportation or 
production of the merchandise being appraised may be the basis for 
customs valuation. Customs values of identical merchandise, or similar 
merchandise, already determined on the basis of deductive value or 
computed value may be used.
    (c) Deductive value. The ``90 days'' requirement for the sale of 
merchandise referred to in Sec. 152.105(c) may be administered flexibly.


<R05>
Sec. 152.108  Unacceptable bases of appraisement.

    For the purposes of this subpart, imported merchandise may not be 
appraised on the basis of:
    (a) The selling price in the United States of merchandise produced 
in the United States;
    (b) A system that provides for the appraisement of imported 
merchandise at the higher of two alternative values;
    (c) The price of merchandise in the domestic market of the country 
of exportation;
    (d) A cost of production, other than a value determined under 
Sec. 152.106 for merchandise that is identical merchandise, or similar 
merchandise, to the merchandise being appraised;
    (e) The price of merchandise for export to a country other than the 
United States;
    (f) Minimum values for appraisement;
    (g) Arbitrary or fictitious values.

  Subpart A--Lost or Missing Packages and Deficiencies in Contents of 
                                Packages


<R05>
Sec. 158.1   Definition of ``permitted'' merchandise.

    For the purpose of this subpart, merchandise is ``permitted'' when 
Customs authorizes the carrier bringing the shipment to the port to make 
delivery to the consignee or the next carrier and:
    (a) These parties in interest, or their agents, make a joint 
determination of the quantities being delivered, or,
    (b) The carrier bringing the shipment to the port, at its option, 
independently declares the quantities available for delivery by filing 
with the port director, no later than the close of business on the next 
working day after a determination of quantities is made, a signed 
statement that:
    (1) An independent determination of quantities of merchandise 
available for delivery has been made, with the date of the determination 
shown;
    (2) At least 4 days have elapsed since the consignee or his agent 
was notified that Customs has authorized delivery; and,
    (3) The merchandise was and is available for delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 158.2  Shortages in packages released under immediate delivery or entry.

    An importer may file an entry summary for consumption or an entry 
summary for warehouse for less than the invoiced and manifested number 
of packages in a shipment ``permitted'' and delivered to him or 
deposited in a bonded warehouse under the immediate delivery procedure 
in Sec. 142.21 of this chapter, or under the entry documentation in 
Sec. 142.3(a), if he files with the entry summary a Customs Form 5931 in 
triplicate. The Customs Form 5931 shall be completed by the importer 
with attached copies of the dock receipt or other documents evidencing 
nonreceipt of the lost or missing packages.

[T.D. 85-159, 50 FR 38520, Sept. 23, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 158.3   Allowance for lost or missing packages included in an entry summary.

    Allowance shall be made in the assessment of duties for lost or 
missing packages of merchandise included in an entry summary whenever it 
is established to the satisfaction of the port director before the 
liquidation of the entry summary becomes final that the merchandise 
claimed to be lost or missing was not ``permitted.'' A claim for such 
allowance shall be made on Customs Form 5931, in triplicate, executed by 
the importer and the importing carrier or bonded carrier, as 
appropriate. When the importing or bonded carrier refuses to execute the 
Customs Form 5931, a claim may be allowed if the importer properly 
executes the Customs Form 5931 and attaches copies of the dock receipt 
or other document evidencing nonreceipt of the lost or missing packages.

as set forth in Sec. 158.1 (a) or (b) resulting in the merchandise being 
``permitted,'' the carrier shall be responsible only for any discrepancy 
between the manifested quantity and the ``permitted'' quantity. In the 
case of an importing carrier, when there is a difference between the 
quantity shown on the inward foreign manifest and the quantity 
``permitted,'' liquidated damages or duties shall be assessed under the 
provisions of the carrier's bond or under the provisions of section 448, 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448), unless the carrier 
corrects his manifest (see Sec. 4.12 of this chapter). In the case of a 
bonded carrier, liquidated damages for lost or missing merchandise shall 
be assessed in accordance with Sec. 18.8 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 158.5   Deficiencies in contents of packages--general.

    An allowance shall be made in the assessment of duties for 
deficiencies in

becomes final, the importer files:
    (a) In the case of a concealed shortage, a Customs Form 5931, in 
triplicate, executed by the importer alone, and the port director 
satisfies himself as to the validity of the claim; or,
    (b) In the case of an unconcealed shortage, a Customs Form 5931, in 
triplicate, executed by both the importer and the importing or bonded 
carrier, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 158.6   Deficiencies in contents of examination packages.

    Allowance for deficiency in the contents of any examination package 
reported to the port director by a Customs officer shall be made in the 
liquidation of the entry. No Customs officer except one making an 
examination contemplated by section 499, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(19 U.S.C. 1499), shall report a supposed deficiency to the port 
director unless it is established to the satisfaction of the reporting 
officer that the merchandise was not imported.

    Merchandise subject to ad valorem, specific, or compound rates of 
duty found at the time of importation to be reduced or diminished by a 
natural force, such as evaporation, or by leakage, shall be appraised in 
its condition as imported, with an allowance made in the value, weight, 
quantity, or measure to the extent of the reduction or loss, except when 
forbidden by law or regulation.

(R.S. 251, as amended, sec. 499, sec. 624, 46 Stat. 728, as amended, 759

merchandise, or any portion thereof which shall have been segregated 
from the remainder of the shipment under Customs supervision at the 
expense of the importer, is found by the port director to be entirely 
without commercial value at the time of importation by reason of damage 
or deterioration, an allowance in duties on such merchandise on the 
ground of nonimportation shall be made in the liquidation of the entry.
    (b) Perishable merchandise. In the case of perishable merchandise, 
an allowance in duties may be made under the following conditions:
    (1) An application for such allowance shall be filed with the port 
director on Customs Form 4315 in duplicate, within 96 hours after the 
unlading of the merchandise and before any of the shipment involved has 
been removed from the pier (or other area permitted under 
Sec. 142.2(b)(2) of this chapter) pursuant to the entry permit.
    (2) Should an application filed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section be withdrawn, the merchandise involved shall thereafter 
be released upon presentation of an appropriate permit.
    (3) Allowance in duty shall be made in the liquidation of the entry 
on such of the merchandise covered by the application as is found by the 
port director to be entirely without commercial value by reason of 
damage or deterioration.

(Sec. 506, 46 Stat. 732, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1506)

<R05>
Sec. 158.12   Merchandise partially damaged at time of importation.

    (a) Allowance in value. Merchandise which is subject to ad valorem 
or compound duties and found by the port director to be partially 
damaged at the time of importation shall be appraised in its condition 
as imported, with an allowance made in the value to the extent of the 
damage. However, no allowance shall be made when forbidden by law or 
regulation; for example, Chapter 72, Additional U.S. Note 3, Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), provides that no 
allowance

[[Page 203]]

or reduction of duties for partial damage or loss in consequence of 
discoloration or rust occurring before importation shall be made upon 
iron or steel or upon any article of iron or steel.
    (b) No allowance in specific duties. In the case of merchandise 
subject to specific or compound duties and found to be partially damaged 
at the time of importation, no allowance may be made in the specific 
duties or in the weight, quantity, or measure (except that an allowance 
for any excessive moisture or other impurities may be made in accordance 
with Sec. 158.13). However, any part of the shipment which is totally 
worthless and can be segregated from the rest of the shipment may be 
treated as a nonimportation in accordance with Sec. 158.11.

(Sec. 506, 46 Stat. 732, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1506)

An application for an allowance in duties under section 507, Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1507), for all detectable moisture and 
impurities present in or upon imported petroleum or petroleum products 
shall be made by the importer on Customs Form 4315. The application 
shall be filed with the port director within 10 days of the port 
director's receipt of the gauging report or within 10 days of Customs 
acceptance of the entry's invoice gauge.
    (2) Other products. An application for an allowance in duties under 
19 U.S.C. 1507 for products other than petroleum or petroleum products 
for excessive moisture or other impurities not usually found in or upon 
such or similar merchandise shall be made by the importer on Customs 
Form 4315. The application shall be filed with the port director within 
10 days after the report of weight or gauge has been received by the 
port director or within 10 days after the date upon which the entry or a 
related document was endorsed to show that invoice weight or gauge has 
been accepted by the Customs inspector or other Customs officer.
    (b) Allowance by port director. If the port director is satisfied 
after any necessary investigation that the merchandise contains moisture 
or impurities as described in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall 
make allowance for the amount thereof in the liquidation of the entry.

[T.D. 90-78, 55 FR 40167, Oct. 2, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 158.14   Perishable merchandise condemned.

    (a) Application by importer. When fruit or other perishable 
merchandise has been condemned by health officers or other legally 
constituted authorities within 10 days after landing, an importer who 
desires allowance in duties under section 506(2), Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1506(2)), shall within 5 days after such condemnation 
file with the port director written notice of the condemnation. The date 
of landing in the case of merchandise forwarded under an entry for 
immediate transportation is the date of arrival at the port of 
destination.
    (b) Allowance in duties. If the port director is satisfied after any 
necessary investigation that the claim is valid, allowance in duties 
shall be made in the liquidation of the entry. Such allowance shall be 
limited to perishable goods condemned by the health officers or 
authorities in the original package, unless segregation of the 
merchandise was under constant Customs supervision at the importer's 
expense.

provides for allowance in duties upon satisfactory proof of the loss or 
theft of any merchandise while in the public stores, or of the actual

Customs

[[Page 204]]

custody although not in bond, or while within the limits of any port of 
entry and before having been landed under Customs supervision. Such 
allowance is subject to the conditions set forth in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 158.21a  Time period.

    An abatement or refund of duties shall be made in the case of injury 
to, or destruction of, merchandise in a bonded warehouse as a result of 
accidental fire or other casualty only if the fire or casualty occurs 
within 3 years from the date of importation.

[T.D. 79-221, 44 FR 46829, Aug. 9, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 158.22   Not applicable when allowances made under other provisions.

    The procedures in this subpart do not apply in cases where 
allowances in duties are made under subpart A or subpart B of this part, 
or Sec. 18.6 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 158.23   Filing of application and evidence by importer.

    Within 30 days from the date of his discovery of the loss, theft, 
injury, or destruction, the importer shall file an application in 
duplicate on Customs Form 4315, and within 90 days from the date of 
discovery shall file any evidence required by Sec. 158.26 or 
Sec. 158.27.


<R05>
Sec. 158.24   Place of filing.

    The application and evidence shall be filed with the director of the 
port where the loss, theft, injury, or destruction occurred. In the case 
of total loss of merchandise by fire or other casualty while in 
transportation under bond, the application and evidence shall be filed 
with the director of the port at which the transportation entry was 
made. In the case of partial destruction of or injury to such 
merchandise, the application and evidence shall be filed with the 
director of the port of destination, except that if the merchandise is 
returned to the port at which the transportation entry was made, the 
application shall be filed at that port.


<R05>
Sec. 158.25   Partial destruction or injury.

    In the case of partial destruction or injury, no application shall 
be entertained unless the port director shall have had an opportunity to 
examine the merchandise or the remainder thereof for the purpose of 
fixing the percentage of injury or destruction. Whether the duty 
involved is ad valorem, specific, or compound, the percentage of injury 
for the purpose of the allowance shall be determined by comparing the 
market value of comparable sound merchandise with the net salvage value 
of the injured merchandise computed on the basis of the market value of 
comparable injured merchandise, such comparison to be made as of the 
time and place of examination.


<R05>
Sec. 158.26   Loss or theft in public stores.

    In the case of alleged loss or theft while the merchandise is in the 
public stores, there shall be filed a declaration of the importer, 
owner, or ultimate consignee that he did not receive the merchandise and 
that to the best of his knowledge and belief it was lost or stolen as 
alleged in the application. If the alleged loss or theft consisted of 
only a part of an examination package and was discovered after the 
release of the package from Customs custody, the following evidence 
shall be submitted:
    (a) A declaration of each cartman, lighterman, or other carrier 
handling the package between the public stores and the place of 
delivery, setting forth the condition of the package at the time of 
receipt and delivery by him and whether or not there was an abstraction 
of the merchandise while the package was in his possession.
    (b) A declaration of the person who first received the package for 
the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee as to whether or not he 
examined the package at the time of receipt, and, if so, as to its 
condition at that time.
    (c) A declaration of the person who opened the package after release 
from Customs custody that the alleged missing merchandise was not found 
by him in the package or elsewhere.


<R05>
Sec. 158.27   Accidental fire or other casualty.

    In the case of injury or destruction by accidental fire or other 
casualty, the following evidence shall be submitted:

[[Page 205]]

    (a) A declaration of the master of the vessel, the conductor or 
driver of the vehicle, the proprietor of the warehouse, or other person 
(except a Customs officer) having charge of the merchandise at the time

approval of the port director.
    (b) Concurrence of warehouse proprietor. An application to abandon 
or destroy warehoused merchandise shall not be approved unless concurred

the abandonment of merchandise under section 563(b), Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1563(b)), will involve any expense or cost to the 
Government, or if the merchandise is worthless or unsalable, or cannot 
be sold for a sum sufficient to pay the expenses of sale, such 
abandonment shall not be permitted unless the importer deposits a sum 
which in the opinion of the port director will be sufficient to save the 
Government harmless from any expense or cost resulting from such 
abandonment. The sum so advanced shall be placed in a special deposit 
account and expended to cover the cost of destruction or to meet any 
deficit should the merchandise be sold and the proceeds of sale be less 
than the expenses of such sale. After meeting such expenses or deficit, 
any balance remaining shall be refunded to the importer. However, the 
applicant may elect to destroy such merchandise under Customs 
supervision pursuant to the provisions of section 557(c), Tariff Act of

may grant applications and make an allowance in duties for the 
merchandise abandoned or destroyed. In any case where doubt exists, the 
matter shall be referred to the Commissioner of Customs.

paid. In lieu of exportation, the merchandise may be destroyed in 
accordance with Sec. 158.41.

legally marked is exported or destroyed under Customs supervision after 
once having been released from Customs custody, as provided for in

exportation or destruction shall not exempt such merchandise from the 
payment of duties other than the marking duties.

<R05>
Sec. 159.0   Scope.

    This part sets forth general rules for the liquidation of entries. 
Certain specific procedures affecting liquidation appear in other parts 
of this chapter; e.g., part 158 of this chapter covers allowance for 
lost or damaged merchandise.


<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 159.1   Definition of liquidation.

    Liquidation means the final computation or ascertainment of the 
duties or drawback accruing on an entry.


<R05>
Sec. 159.2   Liquidation required.

    All entries covering imported merchandise, except temporary 
importation bond entries and those for transportation in bond or for 
immediate exportation, shall be liquidated.


<R05>
Sec. 159.3   Rounding of fractions.

    (a) Value. In the computation of duty on entries, ad valorem rates 
shall be applied to the values in even dollars, fractional parts of a 
dollar less than 50 cents being disregarded and 50 cents or more being 
considered as $1, with all merchandise in the same invoice subject to 
the same rate of duty to be treated as a unit. However, the total 
dutiable value of the invoice shall not be increased or decreased by 
more than the rounding of the total dutiable value to an even dollar. 
When necessary, fractional parts of a dollar, whether more or less than 
50 cents, shall be dropped or taken up as whole dollars in order to 
avoid such an increase or decrease. If in such cases it is necessary to 
drop fractional parts of a dollar amounting to 50 cents or more, the 
lower fractions shall be dropped, and if it is necessary to take up as 
whole dollars fractional parts less than 50 cents, the larger fractions 
shall be taken. In the case of two equal fractions, the one subject to 
the lower rate of duty shall be dropped or taken up, as the case may be. 
In determining a rate of duty dependent upon value, fractional parts of 
a dollar shall be considered.
    (b) Quantities subject to specific duty. Except in the case of 
alcoholic beverages treated under Sec. 159.4, if a rate of duty is 
specific and $1 or less per unit, fractional quantities, if less than 
one-half, shall be disregarded, and if one-half or more shall be treated 
as a whole unit. Subject to the same exception, if a specific rate is 
more than $1 per unit, duty shall be assessed upon the exact

[[Page 209]]

quantity with any fractional part expressed in the form of a decimal 
extended to two places.


<R05>
Sec. 159.4   Alcoholic beverages.

    (a) Quantities subject to duties. Customs duties and internal 
revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 
2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), (19 
U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes shall be collected 
only on the number of proof gallons and fractional parts thereof, 
entered or withdrawn for consumption. No internal revenue tax shall be 
collected on distilled spirits in bulk which have been transferred to 
Internal Revenue bonded premises in accordance with Sec. 141.102(b) of 
this chapter. Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic 
beverages other than subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.90, HTSUS, and 
distilled spirits provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, shall be 
collected only on the number of wine gallons and fractional parts 
thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption.
    (b) Computation of duties. In the computation of Customs duties on 
alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208 (19 U.S.C. 
1202), which are also subject to internal revenue taxes, the methods 
prescribed for the computation of internal revenue taxes on such 
beverages shall be followed. The following methods apply to the specific 
beverages shown:
    (1) Distilled spirits. The quantity of distilled spirits imported in 
barrels, kegs, or similar containers shall be ascertained in accordance 
with the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
Where distilled spirits are imported in bottles, jugs, or similar 
containers, Customs duties and taxes shall be collected on the exact 
quantity contained in each case or other outer container, fractional 
parts of a gallon being carried out to three decimal places utilizing 
the proof gallon method of computation.
    (2) Wine. Customs duties and taxes on wines shall be on the basis of 
a wine gallon of liquid measure equivalent to 231 cubic inches and shall 
be paid proportionally on all fractional parts of a wine gallon. 
Fractions of less than one-tenth gallon shall be converted to the 
nearest one-tenth gallon, and five-hundredths gallon shall be converted 
to the next full one-tenth gallon.
    (3) Beer and similar fermented beverages. Customs duties and taxes 
on beer, ale, porter, stout, and other similar fermented beverages, 
including sake, of any name or description containing one-half of 1 
percent or more of alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, 
wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor, shall be collected 
in accordance with section 5051(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 
U.S.C. 5051(a)).

    The internal revenue taxes imposed on cigars, cigarettes, and 
cigarette papers and tubes under section 5701 or 7652, Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5701 or 7652), are determined in accordance with 
section 5703 of that Code (26 U.S.C. 5703) at the time of removal; that 
is, on the quantity removed from Customs custody under the entry or 
withdrawal for consumption. The Customs duties, unlike those on 
alcoholic beverages, do not necessarily apply only to such quantities.

(Sec. 315, 46 Stat. 695, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1315)


<R05>
Sec. 159.6   Difference between liquidated duties and estimated duties.

    (a) Difference under $20 in original liquidation. When there is a 
net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, 
fees, and taxes assessed in the liquidation of any entry (other than an 
informal, mail, or baggage entry) and the total amount of estimated 
duties, fees, and taxes deposited, including any supplemental deposit, 
the difference shall be disregarded and the entry endorsed ``as 
entered.'' In the case of an informal, mail, or baggage entry, the 
amount of duties, fees, and taxes computed by a Customs officer when the 
entry is prepared by, or filed with, him shall be considered the 
liquidated assessment.

[[Page 210]]

    (b) Difference under $20 in reliquidation. When there is a net 
difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, 
and taxes found due in the reliquidation of any entry and the total 
amount of duties, fees, and taxes assessed in the prior liquidation of 
the entry, the difference shall be disregarded except in the following 
cases:
    (1) Reliquidation at importer's request. When reliquidation of any 
entry is made at the importer's request, such as reliquidation following 
the allowance of a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), or a request for correction under section 
520(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)), any refund 
determined to be due shall be refunded even if less than $20.
    (2) Court decision. Any refund or increase determined to be due as 
the result of the reliquidation of an entry in accordance with a court 
decision and judgment order shall be refunded or collected as the case 
may be.
    (c) Difference of $20 or more collected or refunded. If there is a 
difference of $20 or more between the duties, fees, and taxes assessed 
in the liquidation of an entry and the total estimated duties, fees, and 
taxes deposited, or between the total duties, fees, and taxes assessed 
in the reliquidation of an entry and those assessed in the prior 
liquidation, the entry shall be endorsed to show the difference and 
bills or refund checks shall be issued.
    (d) Customs duties and fees and internal revenue taxes netted for 
$20 limit. The assessments of Customs duties and fees and internal 
revenue taxes shall be separately stated on the entry at the time of 
liquidation, but the amounts of any differences shall be netted when 
applying the $20 minimum for issuance of a bill or refund check.

(Sec. 7, 52 Stat. 1081, as amended, sec. 505, 46 Stat. 732, as amended;

Sec. 159.7   Rewarehouse entries.

    The liquidation of the original warehouse entry shall be followed in 
determining the liability for duties on a rewarehouse entry, except in 
the following cases:
    (a) Merchandise excluded from liquidation of original warehouse 
entry. When any of the following types of merchandise are withdrawn from 
warehouse for transportation to another port, they shall be excluded 
from the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, and the liability 
for duties shall be determined by a liquidation of the rewarehouse entry 
made at the port where the merchandise is withdrawn for consumption or 
for exportation:
    (1) Alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2203 through 2208, 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 
1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes;
    (2) Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes subject to 
internal revenue taxes;
    (3) Tariff-rate quota merchandise; and
    (4) Wool or hair subject to duty at a rate per clean kilogram under 
Chapter 51, HTSUS.
    (b) Reliquidation required by change in rate. When a rate of Customs 
duty or tax is changed by an act of Congress or a proclamation of the 
President, any necessary reliquidation of Customs duty or tax on 
merchandise covered by a rewarehouse entry which may be required by 
reason of the change in rate shall be made at the port where the 
merchandise is held in Customs custody on the effective date of the 
change.
    (c) Shortage, irregular delivery, nondelivery, and other cases. In 
cases involving shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery under the 
original warehouse withdrawal for transportation, or in other cases when 
the port director of the port where the merchandise is entered for 
rewarehouse is of the opinion that circumstances make it inadvisable to 
follow the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, he shall make an 
appropriate adjustment in the amount of duties to be assessed under the 
rewarehouse entry.

shall be deemed the legal evidence of liquidation. For electronic entry 
summaries, the date of liquidation will be the date of posting of the 
bulletin notice of liquidation. Customs will endeavor to provide the 
filer with electronic notification of this date as an informal, courtesy 
notice of liquidation.
    (2) Exception: Entries liquidated by operation of law. (i) Entries 
liquidated by operation of law at the expiration of the time limitations 
prescribed in section 504. Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1504), and set out in Secs. 159.11 and 159.12, shall be deemed 
liquidated as of the date of expiration of the appropriate statutory 
period.
    (ii) The bulletin notice of liquidation shall be posted or lodged in 
the customhouse within a reasonable period after each liquidation by 
operation of law and shall be dated as of the date of expiration of the 
statutory period.

operation of law is posted or lodged in the customhouse.
    (d) Courtesy notice of liquidation. Customs will endeavor to provide 
importers or their agents with Customs Form 4333-A, ``Courtesy Notice,'' 
for all entries scheduled to be liquidated or deemed liquidated by 
operation of law. This notice shall serve as an informal, courtesy 
notice and not as a direct, formal and decisive notice of liquidation.

Sec. 159.10   Notice of liquidation and date of liquidation for informal, mail, and baggage entries.

    (a) Usual date of liquidation. Except in the cases provided for in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the effective date of liquidation for 
informal, mail, and baggage entries shall be:
    (1) The date of payment by the importer of duties due on the entry;
    (2) The date of release by Customs or the postmaster when the 
merchandise is released under such an entry free of duty; and
    (3) The date a free entry is accepted for articles released under a 
special permit for immediate delivery under part 142 of this chapter.
    (b) Date of liquidation when duty cannot be determined at time of 
entry. When the proper rate or amount of duty cannot be determined at 
the time of entry because the merchandise is subject to a tariff-rate 
quota, because of a missing document which, if for free entry, is not 
produced prior to the release of the merchandise to the importer, or 
because of any other reason, the printed notice of liquidation appearing 
on the receipt issued for any money collected on the entry shall be 
voided. When the tariff status of the merchandise either as dutiable or 
free is finally ascertained it shall be noted on the entry. The 
effective date of liquidation shall be the date of posting or lodging of 
the notice of liquidation required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

[[Page 212]]

    (c) Notice of liquidation--(1) Dutiable entries. Where duties are 
paid on an entry in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
notice of liquidation is furnished by a suitable printed statement 
appearing on the receipt issued for duties collected. No other notice of 
liquidation shall be given, but notice of reliquidation of any such 
entry shall be given on Customs Form 4333 posted or lodged in the place 
and manner specified in Sec. 159.9(b).
    (2) Free entries. Notice of liquidation is furnished by release of 
the merchandise under a free entry in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, or by acceptance of the free entry in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section after release under a special permit 
for immediate delivery. No further notice of the liquidation of such 
entries shall be given.
    (3) Entries where duty cannot be determined at time of entry. When 
the proper rate or amount of duty cannot be determined at the time of 
entry as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, notice of 
liquidation shall be given on a bulletin notice of liquidation, Customs 
Form 4333, in the manner specified in Sec. 159.9 for formal entries.

Sec. 159.11  Entries liquidated by operation of law.

    (a) Time limit generally. Except as provided in Sec. 159.12, an 
entry not liquidated within 1 year from the date of entry of the 
merchandise, or the date of final withdrawal of all merchandise covered 
by a warehouse entry, shall be deemed liquidated by operation of law at 
the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duties asserted by the 
importer at the time of filing an entry summary for consumption in 
proper form, with estimated duties attached, or a withdrawal for 
consumption in proper form, with estimated duties attached. Notice of 
liquidation shall be given on the bulletin notice of liquidation, 
Customs Form 4333, as provided in Secs. 159.9 and 159.10(c)(3). Customs 
will endeavor to provide a courtesy notice of liquidation on Customs 
Form 4333-A in accordance with Sec. 159.9(d).
    (b) Applicability. The provisions of this section and Sec. 159.12 
shall apply to entries of merchandise for consumption or withdrawals of 
merchandise for consumption made on or after April 1, 1979, but shall 
not apply to vessel repair entries or drawback entries.

<R05>
Sec. 159.12  Extension of time for liquidation.

    (a) Reasons--(1) Extension. The port director may extend the 1-year 
statutory period for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 
1 year if:
    (i) Information needed by Customs. Information needed by Customs for 
the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise is not 
available, or
    (ii) Importer's request. The importer requests an extension in 
writing before the statutory period expires and shows good cause why the 
extension should be granted. ``Good cause'' is demonstrated when the 
importer satisfies the port director that more time is needed to present 
to Customs information which will affect the pending action, or there is 
a similar question under review by Customs.
    (2) Suspension. The 1-year liquidation period may be suspended as 
required by statute or court order.
    (b) Notice of extension. If the port director extends the time for 
liquidation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, he 
promptly shall notify the importer or the consignee and his agent and 
surety on Customs Form 4333-A, appropriately modified, that the time has 
been extended and the reasons for doing so.
    (c) Notice of suspension. If the liquidation of an entry is 
suspended as required by statute or court order, as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the port director promptly shall 
notify the importer or the consignee and his agent and surety on Customs 
Form 4333-A, appropriately modified, of the suspension.
    (d) Additional extensions--(1) Information needed by Customs. If an 
extension has been granted because Customs needs more information and 
the port director thereafter determines that more time is needed, he may 
extend

[[Page 213]]

the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year 
provided he issues the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section 
before termination of the prior extension period.
    (2) At importer's request. If the statutory period has been extended 
for 1 year at the importer's request, and the importer thereafter 
determines that additional time is necessary, he may request another 
extension in writing before the original extension expires, giving 
reasons for his request. If the port director finds that good cause (as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) exists, he shall issue 
a notice extending the time for liquidation for an additional period not 
to exceed 1 year.
    (e) Limitation on extensions. The total time for which extensions 
may be granted by the port director may not exceed 3 years.
    (f) Time limitation--(1) Generally. An entry not liquidated within 4 
years from either the date of entry, or the date of final withdrawal of 
all the merchandise covered by a warehouse entry, shall be deemed 
liquidated by operation of law at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and 
amount of duty asserted by the importer at the time of filing the entry 
summary for consumption in proper form, with estimated duties attached, 
or the withdrawal for consumption in proper form, with estimated duties 
attached, unless liquidation continues to be suspended by statute or 
court order. Customs will endeavor to provide a courtesy notice of 
liquidation on Customs Form 4333-A, in accordance with Sec. 159.9(d), in 
addition to the bulletin notice specified in Sec. 159.9(c)(2)(ii).
    (2) Suspension of liquidation by statute or court order. When 
liquidation of an entry continues to be suspended beyond the 4-year 
period specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section due to a statute or 
court order, the entry shall be liquidated within 90 days after removal 
of the suspension.
    (g) Notice of liquidation. If an entry is liquidated after an 
extension expires or a suspension is removed, notice of liquidation 
shall be given on the bulletin notice of liquidation, Customs Form 4333, 
as provided in Secs. 159.9 and 159.10(c)(3). Customs will endeavor to 
provide a courtesy notice of liquidation on Customs Form 4333-A in 
accordance with Sec. 159.9(d).

                  Subpart B--Weight, Gage, and Measure


<R05>
Sec. 159.21   Quantity upon which duties based.

    Insofar as duties are based upon the quantity of any merchandise, 
such duties shall be based upon the quantity of such merchandise at the 
time of its importation, except in the following cases:
    (a) Manipulation in warehouse. If any merchandise covered by a 
warehouse entry has been cleaned, sorted, repacked, or otherwise changed 
in condition under section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1562), withdrawals shall be passed and the entry liquidated on 
the basis of the weight, gauge, or measure of such merchandise in its 
manipulated condition with an appropriate notation in the duty statement 
that the duties are assessed on the basis of the manipulated condition 
of the merchandise.
    (b) Alcoholic beverages. Duties on certain alcoholic beverages are 
assessed only on the quantities entered or withdrawn for consumption 
(see Sec. 159.4).
    (c) Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes. Although 
Customs duties on cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes are 
assessed on the quantities imported, the internal revenue taxes on such 
merchandise are assessed only on the quantities entered or withdrawn for 
consumption (see Sec. 159.5).

(Sec. 315, 46 Stat. 695, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1315)

<R05>
Sec. 159.22   Net weights and tares.

    (a) Determination of net weight. The net weight of merchandise 
dutiable by net weight, or upon a value dependent upon net weight, shall 
be determined insofar as possible by obtaining the actual weight, or by 
deducting the actual or schedule tare from the gross weight.

[[Page 214]]

Actual tare may be determined on the basis of tests when the tares of 
the packages in a shipment are reasonably uniform.
    (b) Invoice net weight or tare. When the actual net weight or tare 
cannot reasonably be determined and no schedule tare is applicable, 
liquidation may be made on the basis of the invoice net weight or tare.
    (c) Schedule tare. The following tares, which, from experience, have 
proved to be the average for certain classes of merchandise shall be 
known as schedule tares and shall be applied, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section:

    Apple boxes. 2.984 kilograms per box. This schedule tare includes 
the paper wrappers, if any, on the apples.
    China clay in so-called half-ton casks: 26.856 kilograms per cask.
    Figs in skeleton cases: Actual tare for outer containers plus 13 
percent of the gross weight of the inside wooden boxes and figs.
    Fresh tomatoes: 113 grams per 100 paper wrappings.
    Lemons and oranges: 283 grams per box and 142 grams per half box for 
paper wrappings, and actual tare for outer containers.
    Ocher, dry, in casks: Eight percent of the gross weight.
    Ocher, in oil, in casks: Twelve percent of the gross weight.
    Pimientos in tins imported from Spain: The following schedule 
drained weight shall be used as the Customs dutiable weight in the 
liquidation of entries, the difference between the weight of the new 
contents of pimientos in tins and such drained weight being the 
allowance made in liquidation for tare for water:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Size can                          Drained weight        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 kilo.................................  13.6 kilograms-case of 6 tins. 
794 grams..............................  16.7 kilograms-case of 24 tins.
425 grams..............................  8.0 kilograms-case of 24 tins. 
198 grams..............................  3.9 kilograms-case of 24 tins. 
113 grams..............................  2.4 kilograms-case of 24 tins. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Tobacco, leaf not stemmed: 5.9 kilograms per bale: Sumatra: actual 
tare for outside coverings, plus 1.9 kilograms for the inside matting 
and, if a certificate is attached to the invoice certifying that the 
bales contain paper wrapping and specifying whether light or heavy paper 
has been used, either 113 grams or 227 grams for the paper wrapping 
according to the thickness of paper used.

    (d) Actual tare. In the following circumstances, the actual tare 
shall be ascertained and in so doing the weigher shall empty and weigh 
as many casks, boxes, and other coverings as he may deem necessary:
    (1) If the importer is not satisfied with the invoice tare or with 
the schedule tare;
    (2) If the port director is of the opinion that the invoice or 
schedule tare does not correctly represent the tare of the merchandise; 
or
    (3) If the weigher has reason to believe that the invoice or 
schedule tare is greater than the real tare.
    (e) Estimated tare. When it is impracticable to ascertain the actual 
tare, the weigher shall state in his report what, in his judgment, 
constitutes a fair tare allowance.
    (f) Weight for value purposes. In determining the total dutiable 
value of merchandise which is subject to ad valorem duty and appraised 
on the basis of weight, liquidation shall be made on the same basis as 
appraisement. For example, if appraisement is made on the basis of gross 
weight, the unit value shall be multiplied by the total gross weight in 
computing the total value even though net weight may be used for other 
purposes in liquidation, such as in determining total specific duties.

Sec. 159.33   Proclaimed rate.

    If a rate of exchange has been proclaimed by the Secretary of the 
Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 372(a) for the currency involved, 
such proclaimed rate shall be used unless it varies by 5 percent or more 
from the certified daily rate for the date of exportation as set forth 
in Sec. 159.35. In determining the percentage of variation between the 
proclaimed rate and the certified rate, the difference between the two 
rates shall be divided by the certified rate.


<R05>

    (a) Countries for which quarterly rate is certified. For the 
currency of each of the following foreign countries, there will be

rate established under paragraph (a) of this section shall be used for 
Customs purposes for any date of exportation within the quarter, except 
in the following cases:
    (1) Proclaimed rate. If a rate has been proclaimed by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under Sec. 159.33 which does not vary by 5 percent or 
more from the appropriate certified daily rate, notice of such variance 
shall be published in the Customs Bulletin and the proclaimed rate shall 
be used for Customs purposes in connection with merchandise exported on 
such date.
    (2) Certified daily rate. If the certified daily rate for the date 
of exportation varies by 5 percent or more from the certified quarterly 
rate, notice of such variation and the rate or rates certified for such 
day shall be published in the Customs Bulletin, and such certified daily 
rate shall be used for Customs purposes in connection with merchandise 
exported on such day.

Sec. 159.35   Certified daily rate.

    The daily buying rate of foreign currency which is determined by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and certified to the Secretary of the 
Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 372(c)(2) shall be used for the 
conversion of foreign currency whenever a proclaimed rate or certified 
quarterly rate is not applicable under the provisions of Secs. 159.33 
and 159.34. If the date of exportation is one on which banks are 
generally closed in New York City, then the certified daily rate for the 
last preceding business day shall be considered the certified daily rate 
for the day of exportation.


<R05>
Sec. 159.36   Multiple certified rates.

    The following procedures shall apply when the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York certifies two or more rates of exchange (e.g., official and 
free) for a foreign currency:
    (a) Rates to be published. When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
certifies two or more rates of exchange for the currency of any country, 
those rates will be published in the Customs Bulletin.
    (b) Laws of country of exportation followed. When multiple rates 
have been certified for a foreign currency, the rate to be used for 
Customs purposes shall be the type of certified rate which the port 
director is satisfied, from information in his own files, information 
obtained and presented to him by the importer, or information obtained 
from other sources, is uniformly applicable under the laws and 
regulations of the country of exportation to the particular class of 
merchandise on the date of exportation. In cases where two or more types 
of certified rates are uniformly applicable on a percentage bases, each 
type of certified rate shall be used for the percentage of value to 
which it is applicable. The percentages used shall be those which 
reflect realistically the percentage for which each type of rate is 
uniformly applicable

[[Page 216]]

under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation on the date 
of exportation.
    (c) Procedure when multiple certified rates not uniformly 
applicable. If the port director has credible information that a type of 
rate or combination of types of rates which would otherwise be 
applicable under paragraph (b) of this section were not required or 
permitted, as the case may be, under the laws and regulations of the 
country of exportation to be used uniformly during any period in 
connection with the payment for all merchandise of the class involved, 
he shall immediately submit a detailed report to the Commissioner of 
Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation as to all 
merchandise of the class involved exported to the United States during 
the period involved, until instructions are received from the 
Commissioner of Customs.
    (d) Rate for merchandise different from rate for costs. If the port 
director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of 
types of rates not applicable to payment for the merchandise was 
required or permitted in payment of costs, charges, or expenses, the 
currency conversions for the exchange covering payment for the 
merchandise and for the exchange covering such costs, charges, or 
expenses shall be calculated separately. In deducting nondutiable costs, 
charges, or expenses, the foreign exchange shall be at the rate or rates 
actually used in payment of such costs, charges, or expenses, whether or 
not certified in accordance with Sec. 159.34 or Sec. 159.35. If the 
costs, charges or expenses are dutiable, they shall be calculated 
according to the rules set forth in this subpart. In the event that any 
type of rate uniformly applicable to payment of such dutiable costs, 
charges, or expenses for merchandise of the class involved was a type of 
rate not certified in accordance with Sec. 159.34 or Sec. 159.35, the 
port director shall immediately submit a detailed report to the 
Commissioner of Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation 
as to all merchandise of the class involved exported to the United 
States during the period involved, until instructions are received from 
the Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 159.37   Suspension of certification of rates.

    Whenever the Federal Reserve Bank of New York advises that its 
certification of rates for a currency is being suspended pending 
determination of the question whether it will certify multiple rates for 
that currency, the following procedures shall apply:
    (a) Notification of suspension. Customs field officers will be 
informed when certification of a currency is being suspended. Currency 
information received from the Federal Reserve Bank, or otherwise 
available, which might be helpful in calculating estimated duties during 
the period of suspension will be furnished to the Customs field 
officers.
    (b) Suspension of liquidation. In any case where for the purposes of 
the assessment and collection of duties it is necessary to determine the 
proper rate or rates for a currency during the period when it has been 
suspended from certification, appraisement and liquidation shall be 
suspended until resumption of certification.
    (c) Resumption of certification. When certification is resumed by 
the Federal Reserve Bank, the procedures in Sec. 159.36 shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 159.38   Rates for estimated duties.

    For purposes of calculating estimated duties, the port director 
shall use the rate or rates appearing to be applicable under the 
instructions in this subpart to the merchandise involved. When it is not 
yet known what certified rate or rates are applicable or no rate has 
been certified, the port director shall take into account all the 
information in his possession and shall use the highest rate or 
combination of rates (i.e., the rate or combination of rates showing the 
highest amount of United States money), certified or uncertified as the 
case may be, which could be applicable.

of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1503).
    (b) Suspension of liquidation. The liquidation of entries shall not 
be suspended merely because the merchandise covered thereby is not 
legally marked, but, upon special application by the importer, the 
liquidation may be deferred for a reasonable time to permit the marking, 
destruction, or exportation of the merchandise.

accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 159.54   Open bonds for production of documents.

this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 159.55   Possible prohibited food, drugs, or other articles.

covering merchandise the subject of Sec. 12.1 of this chapter (which

admission of such merchandise into the United States is refused and the 
merchandise is exported under Customs supervision in accordance with

Customs waters of the United States;
    (2) Any American vessel on the high seas;
    (3) Any vessel within a Customs-enforcement area designated such 
under the provisions of the Anti-Smuggling Act (Act of August 5, 1935, 
as amended, 49 Stat. 517; 19 U.S.C. 1701, 1703 through 1711), but

in charge of the result of such search. If, after the cargo has been 
discharged, passengers and their baggage landed, and the baggage of

    Customs officers are authorized to procure search warrants under the

                           Subpart C--Seizures


<R05>
Sec. 162.21  Responsibility and authority for seizures.

    (a) Seizures by Customs officers. Property may be seized, if 
available, by any Customs officer who has reasonable cause to believe 
that any law or regulation enforced by the Customs Service has been 
violated, by reason of which the property has become subject to seizure 
or forfeiture. This paragraph does not authorize seizure when seizure or 
forfeiture is restricted by law or regulation (see, for example, 
Sec. 162.75), nor does it authorize a remedy other than seizure when 
seizure or forfeiture is required by law or regulation. A receipt for 
seized property shall be given at the time of seizure to the person from 
whom the property is seized.
    (b) Seizure by persons other than Customs officers. The port 
director may adopt a seizure made by a person other than a Customs 
officer if such port director has reasonable cause to believe that the 
property is subject to forfeiture under the Customs laws.
    (c) Seizure by State official. If a duly constituted State official 
has seized any merchandise, vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or other 
conveyance under provisions of the statutes of such State, such property 
shall not be seized by a Customs officer unless the property is 
voluntarily turned over to him to be proceeded against under the Federal 
statutes.

FR 31956, June 4, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 162.22   Seizure of conveyances.

    (a) General applicability. If it shall appear to any officer 
authorized to board conveyances and make seizures that there has been a 
violation of any law of the United States whereby a vessel, vehicle, 
aircraft, or other conveyance, or any merchandise on board of or 
imported by such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or other conveyance is 
liable to forfeiture, the officer shall seize such conveyance and arrest 
any person engaged in such violation. Common carriers are exempted from 
seizure except under

[[Page 228]]

certain specified conditions as provided for in section 594, Tariff Act 
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1594).
    (b) Facilitating importation contrary to law. Except as provided in 
Sec. 171.52(b), every vessel, vehicle, animal, aircraft, or other thing, 
which is being or has been used in, or to aid or facilitate, the 
importation, bringing in, unlading, landing, removal, concealing, 
harboring or subsequent transportation of any article which is being, or 
has been introduced or attempted to be introduced into the United States 
contrary to law, shall be seized and held subject to forfeiture. Any 
person who directs, assists financially or otherwise, or is in any way 
concerned in any such unlawful activity shall be liable to a penalty 
equal to the value of the article or articles involved.
    (c) Common carrier clearance. Unless specifically authorized by law, 
clearance of vessels within the common carrier exception of section 594, 
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1594), shall not be refused for the 
purpose of collecting a fine imposed upon the master or owner, unless 
either of them was a party to the illegal act. The Government's remedy 
in such cases is limited to an action against the master or owner.
    (d) Retention of vessel or vehicle pending penalty payment. If a 
penalty is incurred under section 460, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(19 U.S.C. 1460), by a person in charge of a vessel or vehicle and the 
vessel or vehicle is not subject to seizure, such vessel or vehicle may 
be held by the port director under section 594, Tariff Act of 1930, 
until the penalty incurred by the person in charge has been settled.
    (e) Maritime Administration vessels; exemption from penalty. (1) 
When a vessel owned or chartered under bareboat charter by the Maritime 
Administration and operated for its account becomes liable for the 
payment of a penalty incurred for violation of the Customs revenue or 
navigation laws, clearance of the vessel shall not be withheld nor shall 
any proceedings be taken against the vessel itself looking to the 
enforcement of such liability.
    (2) This exemption shall not in any way be considered to relieve the 
master of any such vessel or other person incurring such penalties from 
personal liability for payment.

either required or authorized to be seized under this section, the 
forfeiture incurred may be remitted in accord with 19 U.S.C. 1618, to

such conditions as Customs shall impose, unless its release would 
adversely affect health, safety, or conservation, or be in contravention 
of a bilateral or multilateral agreement or treaty.
    (d) Seizure under 19 U.S.C. 1592. If merchandise is imported,

interest in property subject to forfeiture, fails to petition for relief 
as set forth in part 171 of this chapter, or fails to pay the fine or 
penalty within 30 days from the mailing date of the violation/penalty 
notice provided in Sec. 162.31 (unless additional time is authorized for 
filing a petition, as set forth in part 171 of this chapter) the port 
director, shall, after any required collection action is complete, refer 
any fine or penalty case promptly to the U.S. attorney, or the 
Department of Justice if the penalty was assessed under section 592, 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592). In the case of property 
subject to forfeiture, the port director, where appropriate, shall 
complete administrative forfeiture proceedings or shall refer the matter 
promptly to the U.S. attorney, or the Department of Justice if the case 
arose under section 592, in accordance with the provisions of 
subparagraph (c) below, unless the Commissioner of Customs expressly 
authorizes other action.
    (b) Institution of forefeiture proceedings before completion of 
administrative procedures. Nothing in these regulations is intended to 
prevent the institution of forfeiture proceedings before completion of 
the administrative remission or mitigation procedures pursuant to 
section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618).
    (c) Seized property not eligible for administrative forfeiture. If 
the seized property is not eligible for administrative forfeiture, and 
neither a petition for relief in accordance with part 171 of this 
chapter, nor an offer to pay the domestic value as provided for in 
Sec. 162.44, is made within 30 days (unless additional time has been 
authorized under part 171 of this chapter), the port director shall 
refer the case promptly to the U.S. attorney for the judicial district 
in which the seizure was made, or the Department of Justice if the 
penalty was assessed under section 592.

Sec. 162.41  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 162.42   Proceedings by libel.

    If seizure is made under a statute which provides that the property 
may be seized and proceeded against by libel, the summary forfeiture 
procedures set forth in Secs. 162.45, 162.46, and 162.47 do not apply. 
Such cases shall be referred to the U.S. attorney. The port director may 
request the U.S. attorney to seek a decree of forfeiture providing for 
delivery of the property to the port director for sale or other 
appropriate disposition, if such property is not to be retained for 
official use.


<R05>
Sec. 162.43   Appraisement.

    (a) Property under seizure and subject to forfeiture. Seized 
property shall be appraised as required by section 606, Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1606). The term ``domestic value'' as used 
therein shall mean the price at which such or similar property is freely 
offered for sale at the time and place of appraisement, in the same 
quantity or quantities as seized, and in the ordinary course of trade. 
If there is no market for the seized property at the place of 
appraisement, such value

[[Page 231]]

in the principal market nearest to the place of appraisement shall be 
reported.
    (b) Property not under seizure. The basis for a claim for forfeiture 
value or for an assessment of a penalty relating to the forfeiture value 
of property not under seizure is the domestic value as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section, except that the value shall be fixed as 
of the date of the violation. In the case of entered merchandise, the 
date of the violation shall be the date of the entry, or the date of the 
filing of the document, or the commission of the act forming the basis 
of the claim, whichever is later.

Sec. 162.44   Release on payment of appraised value.

    (a) Value exceeding $100,000. Any offer to pay the appraised 
domestic value of seized property in order to obtain the immediate 
release of the property which was seized under the Customs laws or laws 
administered by Customs and exceeding $100,000 in appraised domestic 
value, or which was seized under the navigation laws, shall be in 
writing, addressed to the Commissioner of Customs, and signed by the 
claimant or his attorney. It shall be submitted in duplicate to the 
director of the port where the property was seized. Proof of ownership 
shall be submitted with the application if the facts in the case make 
such action necessary.
    (b) Value not over $100,000--(1) Authority to accept offer. The port 
director is authorized to accept a written offer pursuant to section 
614, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1614), to pay the 
appraised domestic value of property seized under the Customs laws and 
to release such property if:
    (i) The appraised domestic value of the seized property does not 
exceed $100,000.
    (ii) The port director is satisfied that the claimant has, in fact, 
a substantial interest in the property; and
    (iii) Entry of the seized property into the commerce of the United 
States is not prohibited by law.
    (2) Referral of offer. The port director shall refer to the 
Commissioner of Customs any offer where it appears that the claimant 
does not have a substantial interest in the seized property or where it 
appears it would not be in the best interest of the United States to 
accept.
    (c) Retention of property. The port director shall retain custody of 
the property pending payment of the amount of the offer when the 
application is approved.

    (a) Contents. The notice required by section 607, Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1607), of seizure and intent to forfeit and 
sell or otherwise dispose of according to law property not exceeding 
$500,000 in value, or any seized merchandise the importation of which is 
prohibited, or any seized vessel, vehicle or aircraft that was used to 
import, export, transport, or store any controlled substance, or such 
seized merchandise is any monetary instrument within the meaning of 31 
U.S.C. 5312(a)(3), shall:
    (1) Describe the property seized and in the case of motor vehicles, 
specify the motor and serial numbers;
    (2) State the time, cause, and place of seizure;
    (3) State that any person desiring to claim property must appear at 
a designated place and file with the port director within 20 days from 
the date of first publication of the notice a claim to such property and 
a bond in the sum of $5,000 or 10% of the value of the claimed property, 
whichever is lower, but not less than $250, in default of which the 
property will be disposed of in accordance with the law; and
    (4) State the name and place of residence of the person to whom any 
vessel or merchandise seized for forfeiture under the navigation laws 
belongs or is consigned, if that information is known to the port 
director.
    (b) Publication. (1) If the appraised value of any property in one 
seizure from one person other than Schedule 1 controlled substances (as 
defined in 21

[[Page 232]]

U.S.C. 802(6) and 812) exceeds $2,500, the notice shall be published in 
a newspaper in the Customs district and the judicial district in which 
the property was seized for at least three successive weeks. All known 
parties-in-interest shall be notified of the newspaper and expected 
dates of publication of such notice.
    (2) In all other cases, except for Schedule I controlled substances 
(see Sec. 162.45a), the notice shall be published by posting in a 
conspicious place accessible to the public in the customhouse nearest 
the place of seizure and in the customhouse at the headquarters port for 
the Customs district, with the date of posting noted thereon, and shall 
be kept posted for at least three successive weeks. Articles of small 
value of the same class or kind included in two or more seizures shall 
be advertised as one unit.
    (c) Delay of publication. Publication of the notice of seizure and 
intent to summarily forfeit and dispose of property eligible for such 
treatment may be delayed for a period not to exceed 30 days in those 
cases where the port director has reason to believe that a petition for 
administrative relief in accord with part 171 of this chapter will be 
filed.

<R05>
Sec. 162.45a  Summary forfeiture of Schedule I controlled substances.

    The Controlled Substances Act (84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. 801) 
provides that all controlled substances in Schedule I (as defined in 21 
U.S.C. 802(6) and 812) that are possessed, transferred, sold or offered 
for sale in violation of the Act shall be deemed contraband and seized 
and summarily forfeited to the United States (21 U.S.C. 881(f)). By 
reference, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 
951) incorporates this contraband forfeiture provision. See 21 U.S.C. 
965. Accordingly, in the case of a seizure of Schedule I controlled 
substances, the port director or his designee shall contact the 
appropriate Drug Enforcement Administration official responsible for 
issuing permits authorizing the importation of such substances (see 21 
CFR part 1312). If upon inquiry the port director or his designee is 
notified that no permit for lawful importation has been issued, he shall 
declare the seized substances contraband and forfeited pursuant to 21 
U.S.C. 881(f). Inasmuch as such substances are Schedule I controlled 
substances, the notice procedures set forth in Sec. 162.45 are 
inapplicable. When seized controlled substances are required as evidence 
in a court proceeding, they shall be preserved to the extent and in the 
quantities necessary for that purpose.

Sec. 162.46  Summary forfeiture: Disposition of goods.

    (a) General. If no petition for relief from the forfeiture is filed 
in accordance with the provision of part 171 of this chapter, or if a 
petition was filed and has been denied, and the property is not retained 
for official use, it shall be disposed of in accordance with section 
609, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1609) or section 491(b), 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1491(b)).
    (b) Articles required to be inspected by other Government agencies. 
Before seized drugs, insecticides, seeds, plants, nursery stock, and 
other articles required to be inspected by other Government agencies are 
sold, they shall be inspected by a representative of such agency to 
ascertain whether or not they meet the requirements of the laws and 
regulations of that agency, and if found not to meet such requirements, 
they shall be destroyed forthwith.
    (c) Sale--(1) General. If the forfeited property is cleared for 
sale, it shall be sold in accordance with the applicable provisions of 
part 127 of this chapter. The port director may postpone the sale of 
small seizures until he believes the proceeds of a consolidated sale 
will pay all expenses.
    (2) Transfer to another port for sale. Property shall be moved to 
and sold at such other Customs port as the Commissioner of Customs may 
direct pursuant to the provisions of section 611, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1611), if:
    (i) The laws of a State in which property is seized and forfeited 
prohibit the sale of such property; or

[[Page 233]]

    (ii) The Commissioner is of the opinion that the sale of forfeited 
property may be made more advantageously at another Customs port.
    (d) Destruction. If, after summary forfeiture of property is 
completed, it appears that the net proceeds of sale will not be 
sufficient to pay the costs of sale, the port director may order 
destruction of the property. Any vessel or vehicle summarily forfeited 
for violation of any law respecting the Customs revenue may be destroyed 
in lieu of the sale thereof when such destruction is authorized by the 
Commissioner of Customs to protect the revenue.
    (e) Disposition of distilled spirits, wines, and malt liquor. In 
addition to disposition by sale or destruction as provided for by this 
section, distilled spirits, wines, and malt liquor may be delivered:
    (1) To any Government agency the Commissioner of Customs or his 
designee determines has a need for these articles for medical, 
scientific, or mechanical purposes, or for any other official purpose 
for which appropriated funds may be expended by a Government agency, or
    (2) By gift to any charitable institution the Commissioner of 
Customs or his designee determines has a need for the articles for 
medical purposes.

Sec. 162.47   Claim for property subject to summary forfeiture.

    (a) Filing of claim. Any person desiring to claim under the 
provisions of section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1608), seized property not exceeding $500,000 in value (however there is 
no limit in value of merchandise, the importation of which is 
prohibited, or in the value of vessels, vehicles or aircraft used to 
import, export, transport, or store any controlled substance, or in the 
amount of any monetary instruments within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 
5312(a)(3), that may be seized and forfeited) and subject to summary 
forfeiture, shall file a claim to such property with the port director 
within 20 days from the date of the first publication of the notice 
prescribed in Sec. 162.45.
    (b) Bond for costs. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section, the bond in the penal sum of $5,000 or 10% of the value of the 
claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250, required 
by section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to be filed with a claim 
for seized property shall be on Customs Form 301, containing the bond 
conditions set forth in Sec. 113.72 of this chapter.
    (c) Claimant not entitled to possession. The filing of a claim and 
the giving of a bond, if required, pursuant to section 608, Tariff Act 
of 1930, shall not be construed to entitle the claimant to possession of 
the property. Such action only stops the summary forfeiture proceeding.
    (d) Report to the U.S. attorney. When the claim and bond, if 
required, are filed within the 20-day period, the port director shall 
report the case to the U.S. attorney for the institution of condemnation 
proceedings.
    (e) Waiver of bond. Upon satisfactory proof of financial inability 
to post the bond, the port director shall waive the bond requirement for 
any person who claims an interest in the seized property.

Sec. 162.48  Disposition of perishable and low-value property.

    (a) Disposition of perishable property. Seized property which is 
perishable or otherwise enumerated in section 612, Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1612), and is covered by the provisions of section 
607, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1607), shall be 
advertised for sale and sold at public auction at the earliest possible 
date. The port director shall proceed to give notice by advertisement of 
the summary sale for such time as he considers reasonable. This notice 
shall be of sale only and not notice of seizure and intent to forfeit. 
The proceeds of the sale shall be held subject to the claims of parties 
in interest in the same manner

[[Page 234]]

as the seized property would have been subject to such claims.
    (b) Disposition of low-value property. (1) If the expense of keeping 
any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise or baggage is 
disproportionate to the value thereof, and such value is less than 
$1,000, destruction or other disposition of such property may be ordered 
by the appropriate Customs officer. Storage expenses are presumed to be 
disproportionate to the value of the property where the expense has 
reached or is anticipated to reach 50 percent of the value of the 
property. The right of a claimant to seized property which has been 
destroyed or otherwise disposed of shall not be extinguished.
    (2) Publication of a notice of the seizure, regardless of the 
disposition of the property, will be required pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 
1607. Claimants to seized property will be permitted to file a petition 
for remission of the forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1618, and part 171 
of this chapter. A claimant receiving full or partial relief from the 
forfeiture shall be reimbursed the difference between the value of the 
merchandise at the time of the seizure, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1606 and 
Sec. 162.43 of this part, and any remitted forfeiture amount that the 
claimant is required to pay.
    (3) A claimant to destroyed or otherwise disposed of seized property 
requesting relief in the form of payment may file a claim and cost bond 
and seek judicial hearing on the forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1608.
    (4) Successful claimants shall be compensated from Customs 
Forfeiture Fund pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1613b.

    (a) Report to the U.S. attorney or the Department of Justice if the 
penalty was assessed under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(19 U.S.C. 1592). When it is necessary to institute legal proceedings in 
order to forfeit seized property, or to forfeit the value of property 
subject to forfeiture, the port director or the special agent in charge 
of the area involved shall furnish a report to the U.S. attorney or the 
Department of Justice if the penalty was assessed under section 592, 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), in accordance with the 
provisions of section 603, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C.

    (b) Bonding of seized property. When a claimant desires to file a 
bond for the release of seized property which is the subject of a court 
proceeding, he shall be referred to the U.S. attorney. The Government is 
entitled to recover the penal sum of the bond if forfeiture is then 
decreed.

Sec. 162.50   Forfeiture by court decree: Disposition.

    (a) Sale. Forfeited property decreed by the court for sale or 
disposition by the port director shall be disposed of in the same manner 
as property summarily forfeited. (See Sec. 162.46.)
    (b) Transfer to other districts for sale. If the laws of the State 
in which property is seized and forfeited prohibit the sale of such 
property, or if the Commissioner of Customs is of the opinion that the 
sale of forfeited property may be made more advantageously in another 
Customs district, application may be made to the court to permit 
disposition in accordance with the provisions of section 611, Tariff Act 
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1611). If the court permits such disposition, the 
property shall be moved to and sold in such other district as the 
Commissioner may direct provided it has been cleared for sale.
    (c) Destruction--(1) Proceeds of sale not sufficient. Property 
forfeited under a decree of any court may be destroyed if it is provided 
in the decree of forfeiture that the property shall be delivered to the 
Secretary of the Treasury or the Commissioner of Customs for disposition 
in accordance with section 611, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1611).
    (2) For protection of the revenue. Any vessel or vehicle forfeited 
under a decree of any court for violation of any law respecting the 
Customs revenue may be destroyed in lieu of sale when such destruction 
is authorized by the Commissioner of Customs to protect the revenue if 
it is provided in the decree of forfeiture that the property shall be 
delivered to the Secretary of

remission and restoration is filed and approved. Section 613 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613), and Sec. 171.41 of this 
chapter authorize the filing of an application for remission of the 
forfeiture and restoration of the proceeds from the sale of seized and 
forfeited property. If the application is filed within 3 months after 
the date of sale and is approved, the proceeds of the sale, or any part 
thereof, shall be restored to the applicant after deducting the 
following charges in the order named:
    (i) Internal revenue taxes.
    (ii) Marshal's fees and court costs.
    (iii) Expenses of advertising and sale.
    (iv) Expenses of cartage, storage, and labor. When the proceeds are 
insufficient to pay these expenses fully, they shall be paid pro rata.
    (v) Duties.
    (vi) Any sum due to satisfy a lien for freight, charges, or 
contributions in general average, provided notice of the lien has been 
given in the manner prescribed by law.
    (2) When no application for remission and restoration is filed or 
the application is denied. If no application for remission and 
restoration is filed within 3 months after the date of sale of seized 
and forfeited property, or if the application is denied, the proceeds of 
the sale shall be disbursed in the following order:
    (i) Internal revenue taxes.
    (ii) Marshal's fees and court costs.
    (iii) Expenses of advertising and sale.
    (iv) Expenses of cartage, storage, and labor. When the proceeds are 
insufficient to pay these expenses fully, they shall be paid pro rata.
    (v) Any sum due to satisfy a lien for freight, charges, or 
contributions in general average, provided notice of the lien has been 
given in the manner prescribed by law.
    (vi) The residue, if any, shall be deposited with the Treasurer of 
the United States as a customs or navigation fine.
    (b) Transfer of seized and forfeited property to another Federal 
agency. In the event that the seized and forfeited property has been 
authorized for transfer to another Federal agency for official use, the 
receiving agency shall reimburse Customs for the costs incurred in 
moving and storing the property from the date of seizure to the date of 
delivery.

Sec. 162.52  Disposition of proceeds of sale of property seized and forfeited under 19 U.S.C. 1592.

    (a) Order of disposition of proceeds. Section 613 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613), provides for the disposition of 
the proceeds from the sale of property seized and forfeited under 
section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), as 
provided for in Sec. 162.75 of this part. Distribution shall be made in 
the following order:
    (1) Internal revenue taxes.
    (2) Marshal's fees and court costs.
    (3) Expenses of advertising and sale.
    (4) Expenses of cartage, storage, and labor. When proceeds are 
insufficient to pay these expenses fully, they shall be paid pro rata.
    (5) Duties.
    (6) Any sum due to satisfy a lien for freight, charges, or 
contributions in general average, provided notice of the lien has been 
given in the manner prescribed by law.
    (7) The monetary penalty assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592.
    (8) The remaining proceeds, if any, shall be paid to the appropriate 
party-in-interest as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) Determination of appropriate party-in-interest. (1) If the 
property is subject to a judicial forfeiture proceeding and if it 
appears at the time of this proceeding that 2 or more parties claim an 
interest in the remaining proceeds referred to in paragraph (a)(8), each 
of the parties shall be joined in the proceeding so that the issue of 
proper distribution may be determined by the court.

[[Page 236]]

    (2) If the property is sold under the summary forfeiture procedure, 
or if the court has not specified the manner of distribution, the port 
director shall hold the excess proceeds for 3 months from the date of 
the sale to allow any party-in-interest to claim the proceeds.
    (3) If there is one alleged violator and no petition has been filed 
for the excess proceeds by another person, the excess proceeds shall be 
disbursed to the person against whom the penalty was assessed.
    (4) If there are 2 or more persons with claims or possible claims to 
the excess proceeds, the port director shall attempt to obtain a written 
agreement from the parties as to the distribution. If an agreement 
cannot be reached, the matter shall be referred to Customs Headquarters 
for determination.

available to the receiving agency for the purchase, hire, operation, 
maintenance, and repair of the type of property involved shall be

Sec. 162.71  Definitions.

    When used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the 
meanings indicated:
    (a) Loss of duties. ``Loss of duties'' means the duties of which the 
Government is or may be deprived by reason of the violation and includes 
both actual and potential loss of duties.
    (1) Actual loss of duties. ``Actual loss of duties'' means the 
duties of which the Government has been deprived by reason of the 
violation in respect of entries on which liquidation had become final.
    (2) Potential loss of duties. ``Potential loss of duties'' means the 
duties of which the Government tentatively was deprived by reason of the 
violation in respect of entries on which liquidation had not become 
final.
    (b) Noncommercial importation. ``Noncommercial importation'' means 
merchandise imported by a traveler for an individual's personal or 
household use, or as a gift, but not imported for sale or other 
commercial purposes.
    (c) Clerical error. ``Clerical error'' means an error in the 
preparation, assembly, or submission of a document which results when a 
person intends to do one thing but does something else. It includes, for 
example, errors in transcribing numbers, errors in arithmetic, and the 
failure to assemble all the documents in a record.
    (d) Mistake of fact. ``Mistake of fact'' means an action based upon 
a belief by a person that the material facts are other than they really 
are; it can be that a fact exists but is unknown to the person, or that 
he believes something is a fact when in reality it is not. An action is 
not a mistake of fact if the erroneous belief is caused by the neglect 
of a legal duty.
    (e) Discloses the circumstances of the violation. When used in 
Sec. 162.74(a), the term ``discloses the circumstances of the 
violation'' means the act of providing to Customs a written statement 
which:
    (1) Identifies the class or kind of merchandise involved in the 
violation;
    (2) Identifies the importation included in the disclosure by entry 
number or by indicating each Customs port of entry and the approximate 
dates of entry;
    (3) Specifies the material false statements or material omissions 
made; and
    (4) Sets forth to the best of the violator's knowledge, the true and 
accurate information or data which should have been provided in the 
entry documents, and states that the person will provide any information 
or data which is unknown at the time of disclosure within 30 days of the 
initial disclosure date or within an extension of the 30-day period as 
the port director may permit in order for the person to obtain the 
information or data.

responsible for the discrepancy, if any merchandise described in the 
manifest is not found on board (a ``shortage'').
    (3)(i) A penalty equal to the lesser of $10,000 or the domestic 
value of merchandise found on board of or after having been unladen from 
a vessel or vehicle, or
    (ii) A penalty of $500 (see Sec. 122.161 of this chapter) if 
merchandise (other than narcotics or marihuana--see Sec. 162.65 of this 
chapter) is found on board of or after having been unladen from an 
aircraft--if the merchandise is not included or described in the 
manifest or does not agree with the manifest (an ``overage'').
    (iii) Unmanifested merchandise belonging to or consigned to the 
master or crew of the vessel, the commander or crew of the aircraft, or 
to the owner or person in charge of the vehicle, also shall be subject 
to forfeiture.

6621, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 6621).
    (c) Exception; clerical error or mistake of fact. There is no 
violation and, consequently, no penalty incurred, if the falsity or 
omission is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact, unless the 
error or mistake is part of the pattern of negligent conduct.


<R05>
Sec. 162.74  Prior disclosure.

    (a) In general. (1) A prior disclosure is made if the person 
concerned discloses

[[Page 240]]

the circumstances of a violation (as defined in Sec. 162.71(e) of this 
part), in writing to a port director before, or without knowledge of, 
the commencement of a formal investigation of that violation, and makes 
a tender of any actual loss of duties in accordance with paragraph (h) 
of this section.
    (2) A person shall be accorded the full benefit of prior disclosure 
treatment if that person provides information to Customs with respect to 
a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 which does not meet the requirements of a 
written disclosure statement pursuant to this section if the port 
director is satisfied that the information was provided before or 
without knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation, and the 
information provided includes substantially the information specified in 
Sec. 162.71(e). The provision of this information need not be in 
writing.
    (b) Time of prior disclosure. (1) If the documents which provide the 
disclosing information are sent by certified mail, return-receipt 
requested, and are ultimately received by Customs, the disclosure shall 
be deemed to have been made at the time of mailing.
    (2) If the documents are sent otherwise by mail or are delivered in 
person, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of 
receipt by Customs. If the documents are delivered in person, the person 
delivering the documents is to request a receipt from Customs, stating 
the time and date of receipt.
    (3) The provision of information which is not in writing but which 
qualifies for prior disclosure treatment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section shall be deemed to have occurred at the time which Customs 
was provided with information which substantially complies with the 
requirements of Sec. 162.71(e).
    (4) Any documents relating to a prior disclosure should be addressed 
to the immediate attention of the port director.
    (c) Referral for investigation. Any disclosure of a violation shall 
be referred immediately by the port director to the appropriate field 
office of the Office of Investigations. Upon completion of its 
investigation, the field office shall immediately return the disclosure, 
together with its report, to the port director for appropriate action.
    (d) Commencement of formal investigation. A formal investigation of 
a violation is considered to be commenced:
    (1) In the case of a referral by an import specialist or other 
Customs officer of a matter involving the disclosing party and the 
disclosed information for investigation of a possible violation of 19 
U.S.C. 1592, on the date recorded in writing as the date on which the 
matter was referred to the Office of Investigations;
    (2) In the case of referral by an import specialist or other Customs 
officer of a request for value, classification, or other technical 
investigation, on the date recorded in writing by an investigating agent 
in the investigatory record (including contemporaneous notes) as the 
date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was 
received which caused an investigating agent to believe that possibility 
of a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 existed with respect to the disclosing 
party and the disclosed information;
    (3) In the case of an investigation prompted by an individual other 
than a Customs officer with regard to the disclosing party and the 
disclosed information, on the date recorded in writing by the Office of 
Investigations in the investigatory record (including contemporaneous 
notes) as the date on which the information was received;
    (4) In all other cases, on the earliest of the following:
    (i) The date recorded in writing by the Office of Investigations in 
the investigatory record (including contemporaneous notes) as the date 
on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was 
received which caused an investigating agent to believe that the 
possibility of a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 existed with respect to the 
disclosing party and the disclosed information;
    (ii) The date on which an investigating agent, having properly 
identified himself and the nature of his inquiry, had, either in person 
or in writing, made an inquiry of the person concerning the type of or 
circumstances of the disclosed violation;

[[Page 241]]

    (iii) The date on which an investigating agent, having properly 
identified himself and the nature of his inquiry, requested specific 
books and records of the person relating to the disclosed information.
    (e) Expansion of formal investigation. A formal investigation is 
deemed to have commenced as to additional violations (outside the scope 
of the original investigation but committed by the same party) on the 
earliest of the following:
    (1) The date recorded in writing by the Office of Investigations in 
the investigatory record (including contemporaneous notes) as the date 
on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was 
received which caused an investigating agent to believe that the 
possibility of a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 existed with respect to the 
additional violations;
    (2) The date on which an investigating agent, having properly 
identified himself and the nature of his inquiry, had, either in person 
or in writing, made an inquiry of the person concerning the type of or 
circumstances of additional violations; or
    (3) The date on which an investigating agent, having properly 
identified himself and the nature of his inquiry, requested specific 
books and records of the person relating to the additional violations.
    (f) Proof of lack of knowledge. A person who claims a lack of 
knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden 
to prove that lack of knowledge. A person shall be presumed to have had 
knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation of a violation 
if before the claimed prior disclosure of the violation:
    (1) An import specialist, regulatory auditor, inspector or other 
Customs officer, having reasonable cause to believe that there has been 
a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592, so informed the person concerning the 
type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or
    (2) An investigating agent, having properly identified himself and 
the nature of his inquiry, had, either in person or in writing, made an 
inquiry of the person concerning the type of or circumstances of the 
disclosed violation; or
    (3) An investigating agent, having properly identified himself and 
the nature of his inquiry, requested specific books and records of the 
person relating to the disclosed information.
The presumption of knowledge may be rebutted by evidence that, 
notwithstanding the foregoing notice, inquiry or request, the person did 
not have knowledge that an investigation had commenced with respect to 
the disclosed information.
    (g) Penalty claims not requiring formal investigation. A prior 
disclosure may not be made after a determination by an authorized 
Customs officer that there is reasonable cause to believe that there has 
been a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 and that a claim for monetary penalty 
shall be issued without commencement of a formal investigation. Such 
determination shall be evidenced as follows:
    (1) By the issuance of a pre-penalty notice:
    (2) By the issuance of a penalty notice if a pre-penalty notice is 
not required;
    (3) In the case of violations involving merchandise accompanying 
persons entering the United States or commercial merchandise inspected 
in connection with entry, by oral notification to the person of the 
officer's finding of a violation; or
    (4) In the case of the seizure of merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1592, 
by the act of seizure.
    (h) Tender of actual loss of duties. A person who discloses the 
circumstances of the violation shall tender any actual loss of duties at 
the time of disclosure or within 30 days after the port director 
notifies the person in writing of his calculation of the actual loss of 
duties. The port director may extend the period if he determines there 
is good cause to do so.
    (i) Undisclosed violations. Undisclosed violations discovered by 
Customs as the result of an investigation of a prior disclosure of 
another violation shall not be entitled to treatment under the prior 
disclosure provisions.
    (j) Minor violations. The port director shall not refer a disclosed 
violation for investigation or establish a penalty case if;

[[Page 242]]

    (1) The disclosed violation involves a loss of duties of $500 or 
less;
    (2) Any actual loss of duties has been deposited;
    (3) There is no evidence that the violation was fraudulent; and
    (4) There are no other compelling reasons for a penalty proceeding, 
such as history of similar violations.

1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1466, 1584(a)(1)), has occurred and 
determines that further proceedings are warranted, he shall issue to the

presentation within 30 days of the mailing of the notice (or such 
shorter period as may be prescribed under Sec. 162.78) as to why a 
penalty claim or claim of forfeiture should not be issued or, if issued 
and it involves a monetary amount, why it should be in a lesser amount 
than proposed.
    (c) Exception. No prepenalty notice shall be issued if the proposed 
penalty for an alleged violation of 19 U.S.C. 1584(a)(1) is $500 or

believe that a violation of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended

accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the named person shall 
have 30 days from the date of mailing of the prepenalty notice to make a

part 171 of this chapter (except for the reason described in 
Sec. 171.15(a)(4)), relating to extensions of time for filing petitions

[[Page 244]]

<R05>
Sec. 162.79  Determination as to violation.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any presentations made in 
response to the prepenalty notice, the port director determines that 
there was no violation by the person named in the prepenalty notice, he 
promptly shall notify the person in writing of that determination and 
that no claim for a monetary penalty will be issued.
    (b) Violation--(1) Written notice of claim. If, after considering 
any presentations made in response to the prepenalty notice, the port 
director determines that there was a violation by the person named in 
the prepenalty notice, he promptly shall issue a written notice of a 
claim for a monetary penalty to that person.
    (2) Contents. The notice of a claim for a monetary penalty shall 
contain any changes in the information provided in the prepenalty 
notice, and shall inform the person of his right to apply for relief 
under section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), in 
accordance with part 171 of this chapter. If the person to whom the 
notice is issued is liable for any actual loss of duties recoverable 
under section 592(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1592(d)), the notice shall identify the entries involved, state the 
amount of duties payable and how it was calculated, and require the

    If no prepenalty notice is issued, a written notice of any monetary 
penalty incurred shall contain the information required under 
Sec. 162.76(b)(1) or Sec. 162.77(b)(1), except that the notice shall 
state the amount of the claim for a monetary penalty. The notice also 
shall inform the person of his right to apply for relief under section 
618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), in accordance with 
part 171 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 162.79b  Recovery of actual loss of duties.

    Whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed under this subpart, 
the port director shall require the deposit of any actual loss of duties 
resulting from a violation of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), notwithstanding that the liquidation of the 
entry to which the loss is attributable has become final. If a person is 
liable for the payment of actual loss of duties in any case in which a 
monetary penalty is not assessed or a written notice of claim of 
monetary penalty is not issued, the port director shall issue a written 
notice to the person of the liability for the actual loss of duties. The 
notice shall identify the merchandise and entries involved, state the 
loss of duties and how it was calculated, and require the person to 
deposit or arrange for payment of the duties within 30 days from the 
date of the notice. Any determination of actual loss of duties under 
this section is subject to review upon written application to the 
Commissioner of Customs.


<R05>
Sec. 162.80  Liability for duties; liquidation of entries.

    (a)(1) When an entry is the subject of an investigation for possible 
violation of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1592), or of a penalty action established under that section, the port 
director, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
may liquidate the entry and collect duties before the conclusion of the 
investigation or final disposition of the penalty action if he 
determines that liquidation would be in the interest of the Government.

[[Page 245]]

    (2)(i) An entry not liquidated within 1 year from the date of entry 
or final withdrawal of all merchandise covered by a warehouse entry 
shall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and 
amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer, his 
consignee, or agent unless the time for liquidation is extended by the 
port director because--
    (A) Information needed by Customs for the proper appraisement or 
classification of the merchandise is not available.
    (B) The importer, his consignee, or agent requests an extension and 
demonstrates good cause why the extention should be granted, or
    (C) The 1-year liquidation period is suspended as required by 
statute or court order.
    (ii) An entry not liquidated within 4 years from the date of entry 
or final withdrawal of all merchandise covered by a warehouse entry 
shall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and 
amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer, his 
consignee, or agent unless liquidation continues to be suspended by 
statute or court order. In that event, the entry shall be liquidated 
within 90 days after removal of the suspension.
    (iii) The port director promptly shall notify the importer or 
consignee concerned and any authorized agent and surety of the importer 
or consignee in writing of any extension or suspension of the 
liquidation period.
    (b) When merchandise not covered by an entry is subject to section 
592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), a demand shall be 
made on the importer for payment of the duty estimated to be due on such 
merchandise.
    (c) Any applicable internal revenue tax shall also be demanded 
unless the merchandise is to be, or has been, forfeited.

    (2) The date and place of the violation or seizure; and
    (3) The facts and circumstances relied upon by the petitioner to 
justify the remission or mitigation.

sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory evidence. The notice 
shall inform any interested party in a case involving forfeiture of

<R05>
Sec. 171.13  Additional evidence required with certain petitions.

    (a) Seized property in possession of another responsible for act. If 
the seized property was in the possession of another who was responsible 
for or caused the act which resulted in the seizure, the petitioner 
shall present the following evidence, as applicable:
    (1) Evidence as to the manner in which the property came into the 
possession of such other person;
    (2) Evidence that before parting with the property the petitioner 
did not know, or have reasonable cause to believe, that the property 
would be used to violate customs laws or other laws of the United 
States;
    (3) Evidence that the petitioner did not know, or have reasonable 
cause to believe, that the violator had a criminal record or general 
reputation for commercial crime; and
    (4) Evidence that, with respect to a seized transporting conveyance, 
the petitioner took reasonable steps to prevent the conveyance from 
being used in violation of the customs laws or other laws of the United 
States.
    (b) Petitioner holding chattel mortgage or conditional sales 
contract. A petitioner holding a chattel mortgage or conditional sales 
contract covering the seized property shall submit with his petition 
evidence showing that:
    (1) He has an interest in such property, as owner or otherwise, 
which he acquired in good faith;
    (2) He had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that the 
property was being or would be used in violation of the customs laws or 
other laws of the United States; and
    (3) He had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that the 
owner of the beneficial interest in the property had a criminal record 
or general reputation for commercial crime.
    (c) Long-term lease agreements. A lessor who leases property on a 
long-term basis with the right to sublease shall submit with his 
petition evidence in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Voluntary bailments. A petitioner who allows another to use his 
property without cost and who is not in the business of lending money 
secured by property or of renting property for profit, shall submit with 
his petition evidence in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. 
Property belonging to one family member which is seized from another is 
property subject to a voluntary bailment within the meaning of this 
subsection.
    (e) Straw purchase transactions. If a person purchases in his own 
name property for another who has a criminal record or general 
reputation for commercial crime, and if a lienholder knows or has reason 
to believe that the purchaser of record is not the real purchaser, the 
lienholder shall submit with his petition evidence in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section as to both the purchaser of record and the 
real purchaser.
    (f) Evidence to be considered in determining extent of mitigation 
with respect to transporting conveyances. Listed below are some examples 
of the types of evidence that will be considered in determining whether 
the petitioner is entitled to relief from the forfeiture of a seized 
transporting conveyance. This list is not all-inclusive; Customs 
officers may consider other similar types of evidence in making their 
determination.
    (1) Whether the petitioner asked the person taking possession of the 
property whether he had a criminal record;
    (2) Whether the petitioner asked for and was provided with business 
or financial references;
    (3) Whether the petitioner asked for and was provided with personal 
references;
    (4) Whether the petitioner contacted the references to confirm the 
reliability and good reputation of such person;
    (5) Whether an agreement was reached between the petitioner and the 
person taking possession that the property would be used only in 
accordance with law; and
    (6) Whether the petitioner contacted Federal, State or local law 
enforcement authorities as to the criminal

[[Page 248]]

record or reputation of the person taking possession. Information from a 
Federal law enforcement agency may require a waiver of the Privacy Act 
from the person who is the subject of the request.
    (g) Denial of relief. The failure to furnish adequate evidence as 
required by this section may be a basis for denial of relief. Relief may 
also be denied to a petitioner who has met the applicable criteria, but 
with respect to whom remission would be inimical to the interests of 
justice.

<R05>
Sec. 171.14  Oral presentations seeking relief.

    (a) For certain violations--(1) Right to make oral presentation. If 
the penalty incurred is for a violation of section 592, Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), for which proceedings commenced after 
December 31, 1978, the person named in the notice also may make an oral 
presentation seeking relief in accordance with this paragraph. For 
purposes of this paragraph, a proceeding commences with the issuance of 
a prepenalty notice or, if no prepenalty notice is issued, with the 
issuance of a notice of a claim for a monetary penalty.
    (2) Prerequisites. The person shall be given a reasonable 
opportunity to make an oral presentation provided that a petition has 
been filed under Sec. 171.12, and that the petition contains a request 
to present orally the reasons for remission or mitigation of the 
penalty.
    (b) Other oral presentations. Oral presentations other than those 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section may be allowed in the 
discretion of any official of the Customs Service or Department of the 
Treasury authorized to act on a petition or supplemental petition.

<R05>
Sec. 171.15  Extensions of time for filing petition.

    (a) Extension of time for filing petition or supplemental petition 
for relief. If there is at least 1 year before the statute of 
limitations may be asserted as a defense, a Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer may extend the time for filing a petition (or 
establish a 60-day or 90-day response period pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section) or supplemental petition, upon the request of a 
person who is or may be liable for a fine or penalty, or who has an 
interest in property subject to forfeiture, in the following situations:
    (1) The person is incapacitated and unable to prepare or to assist 
in the preparation of a petition.
    (2) The person is absent from the U.S. for 20 days or more during 
the specified period for filing the petition for relief.
    (3) Evidence necessary to file an effective petition is not 
immediately available. Evidence is not immediately available if, for 
example, it:
    (i) Is in the possession of a foreign source and must be procured 
from same.
    (ii) Requires that a request of any Government agency be complied 
with, provided that any such request is not frivolous and is made in 
accordance with law.
    (4) The case involves a complex legal or factual problem. Examples 
of the type of problem are the need to examine voluminous records (e.g., 
Customs entries, purchase orders, invoices and the like) to learn the 
facts on which to base a petition, or the need to determine legal 
responsibilities in a case involving numerous parties or numerous 
violations. In such cases, the Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture Officer, 
on his own initiative, may specify in any seizure notice that a 60-day 
response period from the date of mailing of the notice is warranted, or 
may specify in any fine or penalty notice that a 90-day response period 
from the date of mailing of the notice is warranted. If, in such cases, 
the Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture Officer concludes that only a 30 or 
60 day response period is warranted and so indicates in the seizure or 
penalty notice, the person charged with responding shall have 7 days 
from the date of the mailing of the notice to appeal the decision of the 
Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture Officer to the Director, International 
Trade Compliance Division, Customs Headquarters. If an appeal is taken, 
a copy of the appeal must be furnished to the Fines, Penalties and 
Forfeiture Officer who issued

[[Page 249]]

the notice, and the original forwarded to the Director, International 
Trade Compliance Division, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution Ave., 
NW., Washington, DC 20229. Such appeals should clearly set forth why the 
particular case warrants an extension beyond the 30- or 60-day period. 
If the appeal is granted, the Director, International Trade Compliance 
Division, will notify both the Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture Officer 
and the person charged with responding of the time period allotted for 
response. In no case will the filing of an appeal under this paragraph 
toll the 30- or 60-day period of time specified by the Fines, Penalties 
and Forfeiture Officer in the seizure or penalty notice.
    (5) There is an occurrence of some act of God which makes compliance 
with petitioning time limits impossible.
    (6) In any seizure case involved or related to controlled 
substances, no extensions of time to respond shall be granted absent a 
demonstration of extraordinary circumstances justifying additional time 
beyond the 30-day period.
    (7) Any other situation in which the Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture 
Officer determines that an extension of time for filing a petition is 
justified.
    (b) Retention of new counsel insufficient reason to grant extension. 
As a general rule, the mere fact that counsel has just been retained, or 
new counsel appointed or selected, without another enumerated reason, 
will be insufficient reason to grant an extension of petitioning time.

the provisions of sections 592 and 641(b)(6) or (d)(1) of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592 and 1641(b)(6) or (d)(1)), on such 
terms and conditions as, under the law and in view of the circumstances, 
he shall deem appropriate when the total amount of the fines and 
penalties incurred with respect to any one offense, together with the 
total value of any merchandise or other article subject to forfeiture or 
to a claim for forfeiture value, does not exceed $100,000. The Fines, 
Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer may mitigate or remit fines, penalties, 
or forfeitures incurred under 19 U.S.C. 1592 when the total amount of 
those fines, penalties or forfeitures does not exceed $50,000. The

under 19 U.S.C. 1641(b)(6), 1641(d)(1), and assessed under section 
1641(d)(2)(A) when the total amount of the penalties does not exceed 
$10,000.

<R05>
Sec. 171.22  Special cases acted upon by Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer.

    (a) Merchandise illegally transported coastwise. A forfeiture of 
merchandise or a claim for forfeiture of a monetary amount under title 
46, United States Code, section 883, for illegally transporting 
merchandise coastwise, may be remitted by the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer, regardless of the value of the merchandise or the 
amount of the penalty, if the petition for relief establishes to the 
satisfaction of the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer that the 
violation occurred as a direct result of an arrival of the transporting 
vessel in distress.
    (b) Forfeiture of imported liquor or compound. When any package of 
or package containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented 
liquor, or any compound containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or 
other fermented liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, or any vessel 
or vehicle in which the same has been transported has become subject to 
forfeiture under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3615, for noncompliance 
with 18 U.S.C. 1263, and the U.S. attorney has advised the Fines, 
Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer that there is not sufficient evidence of 
intent to violate the law to warrant criminal prosecution thereunder, 
the forfeiture incurred shall be remitted

pursuant to the authority of section 7327, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
(26 U.S.C. 7327), and section 618, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1618),

Canada, brought into the United States and seized by Customs authorities 
for violation of law, may file with the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture 
Officer having custody of the property a petition for its release, 
addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury. The petition shall be 
supported by evidence of ownership in the claimant and shall contain a 
waiver and release of all possible claims against the United States or 
any officer thereof for compensation or damages incident to the seizure 
and detention of the property. If the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture 
Officer is satisfied that the claimant is the owner of the property and 
that it was brought into the United States without collusion on the part 
of the claimant, the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer may release 
the property for return to Canada upon the payment of all expenses 
incident to its seizure and detention. In the event of conflicting 
claims for the property or any doubt as to the claimant's interest in or 
right to the property, the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer shall 
submit the matter to the Commissioner of Customs for decision.

<R05>
Sec. 171.31   Act or omission did not occur.

    If it is definitely determined that the act or omission forming the 
basis of a penalty or forfeiture claim did not in fact occur, the claim 
shall be canceled by the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer. When 
the determination of whether or not the claim was erroneously made 
depends upon a construction of law, the claim shall not be canceled 
without the approval of the Commissioner of Customs unless there is in 
force a ruling by the Commissioner of Customs decisive of the issue.

conclusions of law upon which the decision is based. Decisions on 
initial or supplemental petitions which are considered to be 
precedential in nature or otherwise significant will be published in the

    A decision to mitigate a penalty or to remit a forfeiture upon 
condition that a stated amount is paid shall be effective for not more 
than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision, 
unless the decision itself prescribes a different effective period or 
the decision is later amended to change the effective period. If payment 
of the stated amount is not made, or arrangements made for delayed 
payment or installment payments, or a supplemental petition filed, 
within the effective period, the full penalty or claim of forfeiture 
shall be deemed applicable and shall be enforced by promptly referring 
the matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the 
U.S. attorney unless other action has been directed by the Commissioner 
of Customs.

<R05>
Sec. 171.33   Supplemental petitions for relief.

    (a) Time and place of filing. If the petitioner is not satisfied 
with a decision of the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer or the 
Commissioner of Customs, a supplemental petition may be filed with the 
Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer. Such a petition shall be filed 
either:
    (1) Within 30 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the 
decision from which further relief is requested if no effective period 
is prescribed in the decision; or
    (2) Within the time prescribed in the decision from which further 
relief is requested as the effective period of the decision.
    (b) Consideration--(1) Decisions of the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer. Except in cases when liability is incurred under the 
provisions of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
1592) in an amount that exceeds $25,000, where a supplemental petition 
requests further relief from a decision of the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer, the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer may grant 
additional relief, if he believes it is warranted, in cases in which he 
has the authority to grant relief in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 171.21 and 171.22. If the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer 
believes no additional relief is warranted, or if the petitioner is not 
satisfied with the additional relief granted by the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer, or if there has been a specific request by the 
petitioner for review by a higher level official, the supplemental 
petition, together with all pertinent documents, shall be forwarded to 
the designated higher level official or if the liability was incurred 
under 19 U.S.C. 1592, for an amount that exceeded $25,000, to the 
Commissioner of Customs.
    (2) Decisions of the Commissioner of Customs. A supplemental 
petition appealing a decision of the Commissioner of Customs shall be 
filed, together with all pertinent documents, with the Fines, Penalty, 
and Forfeiture Officer who initiated the case for transmittal to the 
Commissioner of Customs for reconsideration.
    (c) Second supplemental petition. (1) Only one further supplemental 
petition may be filed appealing a decision made with respect to an 
initial supplemental petition. The second supplemental petition will not 
be accepted unless accompanied or preceded by full payment of all 
penalties and withheld duties determined to be due in the decision 
rendered on the first supplemental petition. Such payment must be made 
within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision 
on the first supplemental petition if no effective period is prescribed 
in the decision, or within such time prescribed, if any. The second 
supplemental petition should be filed with the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer who initiated the case. For the purpose of this 
section, the term ``second supplemental

[[Page 252]]

petition'' shall include an offer in compromise under 19 U.S.C. 1617 
made prior to the commencement of a civil action to enforce the penalty 
claim.
    (2) A second supplemental petition will not be considered except in 
one of the following circumstances:
    (i) If it is filed within 2 years from the date of notice to the 
petitioner of the decision on the first supplemental petition;
    (ii) If it is filed within 30 days following an administrative or 
judicial decision with respect to the entries involved in the penalty 
case which reduces the loss of duties upon which the mitigated penalty 
amount was based; or
    (iii) If the deciding official in his discretion determines that the 
acceptance of a second supplemental petition is warranted.
    (d) Appeals to the Secretary of the Treasury. A petitioner filing a 
supplemental petition pursuant to this section from a decision of the 
Commissioner of Customs with respect to any liability assessed under 19 
U.S.C. 1592 may request that the petition be accepted as an appeal to 
the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary will accept for decision 
any such supplemental petition when in his discretion he determines that 
such petition raises a question of fact, law or policy of such 
importance as to require a decision by the Secretary. If the Secretary 
declines to accept an appeal for decision, the petitioner will be so 
informed; in such a case, if the supplemental petition is an initial 
supplemental petition or a second supplemental petition eligible for 
consideration under paragraph (c) of this section, a decision thereon 
will be issued by Customs.

               Subpart E--Restoration of Proceeds of Sale


<R05>
Sec. 171.41   Application of provisions for petitions for relief.

    The general provisions of Subpart B of this part on filing and 
content of petitions for relief apply to petitions for restoration of 
proceeds of sale except insofar as modified by this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 171.42   Time limit for filing petition for restoration.

    A petition for the restoration of proceeds of sale under section 
613, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613), shall be filed 
within 3 months after the date of the sale.


<R05>
Sec. 171.43   Evidence required.

    In addition to such other evidence as may be required under the 
provisions of subpart B of this part, the petition for restoration of 
proceeds of sale under section 613, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 1613), shall show the interest of the petitioner in the property, 
supported in appropriate cases by bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, 
or other satisfactory documentary evidence. The petition shall be 
supported by satisfactory proof that the petitioner did not know of the 
seizure prior to the declaration or decree of forfeiture and was in such 
circumstances as prevented him from knowing of it.


<R05>
Sec. 171.44   Forfeited property authorized for official use.

    If forfeited property the subject of a claim under section 613, 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613), has been authorized for 
official use, retention or delivery shall be regarded as the sale 
thereof for the purposes of section 613. The appropriation available to 
the receiving agency for the purchase, hire, operation, maintenance, and 
repair of property of the kind so received is available for the granting 
of relief to the claimant and for the satisfaction of

<R04>
               Subpart F--Expedited Petitioning Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 171.51  Application and definitions.

    (a) Application. The following definitions, regulations, and 
criteria are designed to establish and implement procedures required by 
section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, title 
VI (102 Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and 
procedures relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified 
statutory authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect 
the existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an 
interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions 
relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and 
responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of 
action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress 
to minimize the adverse impact occasioned by the prolonged detention of 
property subject to forfeiture due to violations of law involving 
possession of personal use quantities of controlled substances. The 
definition of personal use quantities of controlled substance as 
contained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities 
small in amount which are generally considered to be possessed for 
personal consumption and not for distribution, and those larger 
quantities generally considered to be subject to distribution.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart, the following terms shall 
have the meanings specified:
    (1) Appraised value. ``Appraised value'' has the meaning given in    
 Sec. 162.43(a) of this chapter.
    (2) Commercial fishing industry vessel. ``Commercial fishing 
industry vessel'' means a vessel that:
    (i) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of 
fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the 
catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
    (ii) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by 
gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or 
brine chilling; or
    (iii) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports 
fish, fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the 
preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish 
tender vessel or fish processing facility.
    (3) Controlled substance. ``Controlled substance'' has the meaning 
given in 21 U.S.C. 802.
    (4) Normal and customary manner. ``Normal and customary manner'' 
means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances which 
would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a 
like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and 
circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive 
knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is 
persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether a 
petitioner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how 
property would be used by another legally in possession of the property.
    (5) Owner or interested party. ``Owner or interested party'' means 
one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for 
foreiture or one who was in legal possession of the property at the time 
of seizure and is entitled to legal possession at the time of granting 
the petition for expedited procedure. This includes a lienholder, to the 
extent of his interest in the property, whose claim is in writing 
(except for a maritime lien which need not be in writing), unless the 
collateral is in the possession of the secured party. The agreement 
securing such a lien must create or provide for a security interest in 
the collateral, describe the collateral and be signed by the debtor.
    (6) Personal use quantities. ``Personal use quantities'' means 
possession of controlled substances in circumstances where there is no 
evidence of intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, 
compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any 
controlled substance. A quantity of a controlled substance is presumed 
to be for personal use if the amounts

[[Page 254]]

possessed do not exceed the quantities set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) 
of this section if there is no evidence of illicit drug trafficking or 
distribution such as, but not limited to the factors set forth in 
paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. The possession of a narcotic, a 
depressant, a stimulant, a hallucinogin or a cannabis-controlled 
substance will be considered in excess of personal use quantities if the 
dosage unit amount possessed provides the same or greater equivalent 
efficacy as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
    (i) Quantities presumed to be for personal use unless evidence of 
illicit drug trafficking or distribution exists. (A) One gram of a 
mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of heroin;
    (B) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of--
    (1) Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from 
which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have 
been removed;
    (2) Cocaine, its salts, optional and geometric isomers, and salts of 
isomers;
    (3) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of 
isomers; or
    (4) Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any 
quantity of any of the substances referred to in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(B) 
(1) through (3) of this section;
    (C) \1/10\th gram of a mixture of substances described in paragraph 
(b)(6)(i)(B) of this section which contains cocaine base;
    (D) \1/10\th gram of mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of phencyclidine (PCP);
    (E) 500 micrograms of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);
    (F) One ounce of a mixture of substance containing a detectable 
amount of marihuana; or
    (G) One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of 
its isomers, or one gram of a mixture of substances containing a 
detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of 
its isomers.
    (ii) Evidence of possession for other than personal use. Quantities 
shall not be considered to be for personal use if sweepings are present 
or there is other evidence of possession for other than personal use 
such as:
    (A) Evidence such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, 
drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug 
``cutting'' agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to 
process, package or distribute a controlled substance;
    (B) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a 
controlled substance with intent to distribute;
    (C) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons in 
actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for 
offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to 
distribute a controlled substance;
    (D) The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or 
any amount of prerecorded government funds;
    (E) The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that 
indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for 
distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large 
quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or
    (F) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the 
possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate 
possession with intent to distribute.
    (7) Property. ``Property'' means property subject to forfeiture 
under 21 U.S.C. 881(a) (4), (6), and (7); 19 U.S.C. 1595a, and 49 U.S.C. 
App. 782.
    (8) Seizing agency. ``Seizing agency'' means the Federal agency 
which has seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency, 
and has the responsibility for administratively forfeiting the property.
    (9) Sworn to. ``Sworn to'' refers to the oath as provided by 28 
U.S.C. 1746 or as notarized in accordance with state law.

<R05>
Sec. 171.52  Petition for expedited procedures in an administrative forfeiture proceeding.

    (a) Procedures for violations involving possession of controlled 
substance in personal use quantities. The usual procedures for petitions 
for relief when property is seized are set forth in subpart B of this 
part. However, where property is seized for administrative forfeiture 
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881(a) (4), (6) or (7), 19 U.S.C. 1595a and/or 49 
U.S.C. App. 782 due to violations involving controlled substances in 
personal use quantities, a petition may be filed pursuant to paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section to seek expedited procedures for release of 
the property. A petition filed pursuant to this subpart shall also serve 
as a petition for relief filed under subpart B of this part. The 
petition may be filed by an owner or interested party.
    (b) Commercial fishing industry vessels. Where a commercial fishing 
industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate 
port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations is subject to 
seizure for administrative forfeiture for a violation of law involving 
controlled substances in personal use quantities, a summons to appear 
shall be issued in lieu of a physical seizure. The vessel shall report 
to the port designated in the summons no later than the date specified 
in the summons. When a commercial fishing industry vessel reports, the 
appropriate Customs officer shall, depending on the facts and 
circumstances, either issue another summons to appear at a time deemed 
appropriate, execute a constructive seizure agreement pursuant to 19 
U.S.C. 1605, or take physical custody of the vessel. When a summons to 
appear has been issued, the seizing agency may be authorized to 
institute administrative forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically 
seized. When a summons to appear has been issued, the owner or 
interested party may file a petition for expedited procedures pursuant 
to subsection (a); the provisions of subsection (a) and other provisions 
in this subpart relating to a petition for expedited release shall apply 
as if the vessel had been physically seized.
    (c) Elements to be established in petition. (1) The petition for 
expedited procedures shall establish that:
    (i) The petitioner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized 
property as owner or otherwise;
    (ii) The petitioner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the 
property in a normal and customary manner; and
    (iii) The petitioner did not know or consent to the illegal use of 
the property or, in the event that the petitioner knew or should have 
known of the illegal use, the petitioner did what reasonably could be 
expected to prevent the violation.
    (2) In addition, the petitioner may submit evidence to establish 
that he has statutory rights or defenses such that he would prevail in a 
judicial proceeding on the issue of forfeiture.
    (d) Manner of filing. A petition for expedited procedures must be 
filed in a timely manner to be considered by Customs. To be filed in a 
timely manner, the petition must be received by Customs within 20 days 
from the date the notice of seizure was mailed, or in the case of a 
commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons to appear is 
issued, 20 days from the original date when the vessel is required to 
report. The petition must be sworn to by the petitioner and signed by 
the petitioner or his attorney at law. If the petitioner is a 
corporation, the petition may be sworn to by an officer or responsible 
supervisory employee thereof and signed by that individual or an

Sec. 171.53  Ruling on petition for expedited procedures.

    (a) Final administrative determination. Upon receipt of a petition 
filed pursuant to Sec. 171.52, Customs shall determine first whether a 
final administrative determination of the case can be made within 21 
days of the seizure. If such a final administrative determination is 
made within 21 days, no further action need be taken under this subpart.
    (b) Determination within 20 days. If no such final administrative 
determination is made within 21 days of the seizure, Customs shall 
within 20 days after the receipt of the petition make a determination as 
follows:
    (1) If Customs determines that the factors listed in Sec. 171.52(c) 
have been established, it shall terminate the administrative proceedings 
and release the property from seizure, or in the case of a commercial 
fishing industry vessel for which a summons has been issued, but not yet 
answered, dismiss the summons. The property shall not be returned if it 
is evidence of a violation of law.
    (2) If Customs determines that the factors listed in Sec. 171.52(c) 
have not been established, it shall proceed with the administrative 
forfeiture.

Sec. 171.54  Substitute res in an administrative forfeiture action.

    (a) Substitute res. Where property is seized for administrative 
forfeiture for a violation involving controlled substances in personal 
use quantities, the owner or interested party may offer to post an 
amount equal to the appraised value of the property (the res) to obtain 
release of the property. The offer, which may be tendered at any time 
subsequent to seizure and up until the completion of administrative 
forfeiture proceedings, must be in the form of cash, irrevocable letter 
of credit, certified funds such as a certified check, traveler's 
check(s), or money order made payable to U.S. Customs. Unless the 
property is evidence of a violation of law or has other characteristics 
that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities, it will be 
released to the owner or interested party subsequent to tender of the 
substitute res.
    (b) Forfeiture of res. If a substitute res is posted and it is 
determined that the property should be administratively forfeited, the 
res will be forfeited in lieu of the property.

Sec. 171.55  Notice provisions.

    (a) Special notice provision. At the time of seizure of property 
defined in Sec. 171.51, written notice must be provided to the possessor 
of the property regarding applicable statutes and Federal regulations 
including the procedures established for the filing of a petition for 
expedited procedures as set forth in section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse 
Act of 1988 and implementing regulations.
    (b) Notice provision. The notice as required by section 1607 of 
Title 19, United States Code and applicable regulations shall be made at 
the earliest practicable opportunity after determining ownership of, or 
interest in, the seized property and shall include a statement of the 
applicable law under which the property is seized and a statement of the 
circumstances of the seizure sufficiently precise to enable an owner or 
interested party to identify the date, place and use or acquisition 
which makes the property subject to forfeiture.

 Appendix A to Part 171--Guidelines for Disposition of Violations of 19 
                               U.S.C. 1497

    Liabilities incurred under section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1497), shall be mitigated or remitted in accordance with the 
following guidelines (see also part 148, Customs Regulations):

[[Page 257]]

    I. Violations Involving Dutiable Articles. For violations involving 
articles subject to duty and for which there is no applicable exemption 
from duty, the following rules apply:
    1. Mitigated Penalty for First Offense. For violations which are the 
first offense, where there is knowledge of the declaration requirements, 
and where the undeclared articles are discovered by the Customs 
officers, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of Three Times 
the Duty (but not less than $50), or the domestic value, whichever is 
lower.
    2. Mitigating Factors. When one or more of the following mitigating 
factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, 
remit the liabilities upon payment of Between One and One-Half and Three 
Times the Duty or the domestic value, whichever is lower:
    a. Communications with the violator are impaired because of language 
barrier, mental condition, or physical ailment;
    b. Violator cooperates with Customs officers after discovery of the 
violation by providing additional information which facilitates 
conclusion of the case;
    c. Violator is an inexperienced traveler;
    d. There is contributory Customs error (for example, violator 
demonstrates he was given incorrect advice by a Customs officer).
    3. Aggravating Factors. When one or more of the following 
aggravating factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his 
discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Three and Six 
Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, 
whichever is lower:
    a. Documentary or other evidence discovered establishes violator's 
intent;
    b. Informant provides information which tends to establish 
violator's intent and leads to discovery of the violation after the 
violator has been given an opportunity to properly declare;
    c. Violator is an experienced traveler;
    d. Undeclared articles are concealed to evade U.S. law;
    e. There is behavior, including extreme lack of cooperation, verbal 
or physical abuse, or attempted escape, which tends to demonstrate a 
lack of respect for law and authority.
    4. Commercial Articles. When the undeclared articles are brought in 
for commercial purposes, the liabilities shall be remitted upon the 
payment of Six Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic 
value, whichever is lower. Mitigating factors may be used to lower this 
amount to as little as Three Times the Duty; aggravating factors may be 
used to increase this amount up to Eight Times the Duty.
    5. Extraordinary Mitigating Factor.
    a. When an individual who has been cleared through Customs without 
discovery of any undeclared article returns to the examination area and 
declares that article, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, 
remit the liabilities upon payment of One Times the Duty.
    b. An individual who declares articles some time later (hours, days, 
weeks, etc.) may be treated similarly.
    6. Extraordinary Aggravating Factors.
    a. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, the 
deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon 
payment of Between Six and Eight Times the Duty (but not less than 
$250), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.
    b. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, and there 
are aggravating factors present, generally there shall either be a 
denial of relief or mitigation to No Less Than Eight Times the Duty or 
the domestic value, whichever is lower.
    c. When there is evidence of an ongoing scheme to defraud the 
revenue involving multiple entries without declaration of articles 
subject to declaration, the deciding officer shall act in accordance 
with the preceding paragraph.
    II. Violations Involving Absolutely or Conditionally Free Articles. 
For violations involving articles either entitled to entry free of duty 
absolutely (classifiable under a duty-free provision in Chapters 1-97, 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); (19 U.S.C. 
1202)), or entry free of duty conditionally (entitled to treatment under 
the Generalized System of Preferences (see Secs. 10.171-10.178, Customs 
Regulations) or Chapter 98, HTSUS), the following rules apply:
    1. Mitigated Penalty for First Offense.
    a. For violations which are first offense, and involve articles 
entitled to the benefit of GSP or Chapter 98, HTSUS, the liabilities 
shall be remitted upon payment of One Times the Duty which would have 
been due if the articles had not been entitled to the benefit.
    b. For violations which are first offense, and involve absolutely 
duty-free articles, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of 
Between One and Five Percent of the Domestic Value, but not less than 
$50 (or the domestic value, whichever is less) nor more than $1,000.
    2. Mitigating Factors. When mitigating factors such as those 
outlined above are present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, 
reduce the mitigated amount to a lower figure.
    3. Aggravating Factors.
    a. When aggravating factors such as those outlined above are 
present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, remit the 
liabilities for conditionally free articles upon the payment of Between 
One and Two Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic 
value, whichever is lower.

[[Page 258]]

    b. For absolutely free articles, the deciding officer may remit the 
liabilities upon payment of Between Five and Ten Percent of the Domestic 
Value, but not less than $100.
    4. Commercial Merchandise.
    The fact that undeclared duty-free articles are imported for 
commercial purposes may be considered an aggravating factor under 
section II.3. of these guidelines.
    III. Other Applicable Rules.
    1. These guidelines provide a framework and procedure by which 
violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 are to be analyzed. They are not mandatory 
in the sense that they must be absolutely applied. Customs officers 
varying from these guidelines must provide reasons for doing so in the 
case record.
    2. Customs officers shall document mitigating and aggravating 
factors found in each case in the case file. There must be a basis shown 
for mitigated amounts.
    3. It is intended that mitigating and aggravating factors shall be 
considered together and used to offset each other where appropriate.
    4. The rate of duty to be used in calculating the mitigated penalty 
shall be the appropriate rate from Chapters 1-97, HTSUS, and not the 
flat rate from Chapter 98, HTSUS.
    5. ``Duty'' means Customs duties and any internal revenue taxes 
which would have attached upon importation (see section 101.1(i), 
Customs Regulations). Therefore, multiples will also be applied to 
internal revenue taxes which would have been due.
    6. Customs officers may, within their discretion, consider other 
factors not here delineated as aggravating or mitigating and apply the 
guidelines accordingly. These additional factors must also be documented 
in the case file.
    7. These guidelines are not authority for admitting into the 
commerce of the United States articles which are conditionally or 
absolutely prohibited from entry.
    8. The presence of one or more extraordinary aggravating factors, 
including but not limited to those set forth in section I.6. of these 
guidelines, may within the discretion of the deciding officer be a basis 
for denial of relief.
    9. If the violator is being prosecuted criminally, the civil (19 
U.S.C. 1497) liability generally is administratively settled only after 
completion of the prosecution or with the express approval of the 
appropriate U.S. attorney. Criminal prosecution of the violator, 
however, is insufficient grounds to delay indefinitely determination of 
the civil liability. The Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer should 
contact the Chief Counsel representative in the field to determine the 
best course of action to follow with respect to the civil liability. 
Chief Counsel representative will consult with the U.S. attorney and the 
Penalties Branch at Customs Headquarters. Because of time delay 
problems, all seizures involving criminal prosecutions must be promptly 
coordinated in this manner, and consideration should be given to 
immediate referral of the forfeiture action to the U.S. attorney for the 
institution of a judicial proceeding.

[T.D. 83-145, 48 FR 30100, June 30, 1983, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR

Appendix B to Part 171--Customs Regulations, Revised Penalty Guidelines, 
                             19 U.S.C. 1592

    A monetary penalty incurred under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592; hereinafter referred to as section 592) may 
be remitted or mitigated under section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), if it is determined that there exist such 
mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation. The 
guidelines below will be used by the Customs Service in arriving at a 
just and reasonable assessment and disposition of liabilities arising 
under section 592 within the stated limitations. It is intended that 
these guidelines shall be applied by Customs officers in pre-penalty 
proceedings and in determining the monetary penalty assessed in the 
penalty notice. The assessed or mitigated penalty amount determined in 
accordance with these guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which 
the Government may seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant 
to 19 U.S.C. 1592(e).

               (A) Violations of Section 592; Materiality

    Without regard to whether the United States is or may be deprived of 
all or a portion of any lawful duty thereby, a violation of section 592 
occurs when a person, through fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, 
enters, introduces, or attempts to enter or introduce any merchandise 
into the commerce of the United States by means of any document, written 
or oral statement, or act which is material and false, or any omission 
which is material; or when a person aids or abets any other person in 
the entry, introduction, or attempted entry or introduction of 
merchandise by such means. A document, statement, act, or omission is 
material if it has the potential to alter the classification, 
appraisement, or admissibility of merchandise, or the liability for 
duty, or if it tends to conceal an unfair trade practice under the 
antidumping, countervailing duty or a similar statute, or an unfair act 
involving patent or copyright infringement. There is no violation if the 
falsity or omission is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact, 
unless the error or mistake is part of a pattern of negligent conduct.

[[Page 259]]

                       (B) Degrees of Culpability

    There are three degrees of culpability under section 592: 
negligence, gross negligence, and fraud.
    (1) Negligence. A violation is determined to be negligent if it 
results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done through 
either the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and 
competence expected from a person in the same circumstances in 
ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences therefrom, in 
ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute, or in 
communicating information so that it may be understood by the recipient. 
As a general rule, a violation is determined to be negligent if it 
results from the offender's failure to exercise reasonable care and 
competence to ensure that a statement made is correct.
    (2) Gross Negligence. A violation is determined to be grossly 
negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) 
done with actual knowledge of or wanton disregard for the relevant facts 
and with indifference to or disregard for the offender's obligations 
under the statute.
    (3) Fraud. A violation is determined to be fraudulent if the 
material false statement or act in connection with the transaction was 
committed (or omitted) knowingly, i.e., was done voluntarily and 
intentionally, as established by clear and convincing evidence.

                       (C) Assessment of Penalties

    (1) Issuance of Pre-Penalty Notice. (a) As provided in Sec. 162.77, 
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.77), if the port director has reasonable 
cause to believe that a violation of section 592 has occurred and 
determines that further proceedings are warranted, he shall issue to 
each person concerned a notice of his intent to issue a claim for a 
monetary penalty. In issuing such pre-penalty notice, the port director 
shall make a tentative determination of the degree of culpability and 
the amount of the proposed claim. A pre-penalty notice is not required 
if the violation involves a non-commercial importation or if the 
proposed claim does not exceed $1,000.
    (b) If the violation is determined to be the result of fraud, the 
proposed claim shall be equal to the domestic value of the merchandise. 
In cases involving gross negligence and negligence, in determining the 
amount of the proposed claim, the port director shall take into account 
the gravity of the offense, the amount of loss of revenue, the extent of 
wrongdoing, mitigating, aggravating and extraordinary factors, and other 
factors bearing upon the seriousness of the violation, but in no case 
shall the assessed penalty exceed the statutory ceilings prescribed in 
section 592. In cases involving gross negligence and negligence, 
penalties equivalent to the ceilings stated in paragraph (D) regarding 
disposition of cases may be appropriate in cases involving serious 
violations, e.g., violations involving a high loss of revenue and quota 
evasions. To be serious, a violation need not result in a loss of 
revenue. The violation may be serious because it affects the 
admissibility of merchandise or the enforcement of other laws, as in the 
case of quota evasions, false statements to conceal the dumping of 
merchandise, or violations of exclusionary orders of the International 
Trade Commission.
    (c) Violations where the loss of revenue is nonexistent or minimal 
and which have an insignificant impact on enforcement of the laws of the 
United States may justify a proposed penalty in a fixed amount not 
related to the value of merchandise, but an amount believed sufficient 
to have a deterrent effect, i.e., violations involving the subsequent 
sale of merchandise or vehicles entered for personal use; violations 
involving failure to comply with declaration or entry requirements which 
do not change the admissibility or entry status of merchandise, its 
appraised value or classification; violations involving the illegal 
diversion to domestic use of instruments of international traffic; and 
local point-to-point traffic violations. This category also includes 
violations in which the falsity or omission is revelant only to the 
assessment of duties, but in which it is finally determined that the 
falsity or omission did not result in any loss of duties, i.e., failure 
to report commissions paid which are ultimately determined to be non-
dutiable; or a false statement as to the relationship of the parties if 
the fact of the relationship is determined not to affect appraisement. 
In order for there to be a violation of section 592, the falsity or 
omission must be material, as defined in paragraph (A) of these 
guidelines. Generally, a penalty in a fixed amount ranging from $100 to 
$500 would be appropriate in cases where there are no prior violations 
of the same kind. Fixed sums ranging from $500 to $10,000 may be 
appropriate, however, in the case of multiple or repeated violations. 
Fixed sum penalty amounts may not exceed the maximum amounts stated in 
section 592 and in these guidelines.
    (d) In determining the amount of the proposed penalty, the port 
director shall also take into account any mitigating, aggravating, or 
extraordinary factors that are clearly established by the evidence 
available at the time.
    (2) Issuance of Penalty Notice. (a) Following issuance of the pre-
penalty notice, and in consideration whether or not to issue a penalty 
notice pursuant to Sec. 162.79, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.79), and 
if so, in what amount, the port director shall give consideration to all 
available evidence with respect to the existence of material false 
statements or omissions (including evidence presented by the alleged 
violator), the degree of culpability, the existence of a prior 
disclosure,

[[Page 260]]

the seriousness of the violation, and the existence of mitigating, 
aggravating, or extraordinary factors. In all cases involving fraud, the 
penalty notice shall be in the amount of the domestic value of the 
merchandise. In general, the degree of culpability stated in a pre-
penalty notice shall not be increased in the penalty notice. If, 
subsequent to the issuance of a pre-penalty notice and upon further 
review of the evidence, the port director determines that a higher 
degree of culpability exists, the pre-penalty notice should be cancelled 
and a new pre-penalty notice issued indicating the higher degree of 
culpability and increased penalty amount proposed, with supporting 
evidence reflected therein. If, however, less than 3 months remain 
before expiration of the statute of limitations, the higher degree of 
culpability and higher penalty amount may be indicated in the notice of 
penalty. Alternatively, the port director shall consider whether a lower 
degree of culpability is warranted by the evidence. The penalty notice 
shall contain other changes in the information provided in the pre-
penalty notice.
    (b) No penalty case shall be initiated for revenue-loss violation, 
if the port director is certain that the violation has resulted from 
negligence, the combined actual and potential loss of revenue from 
entries at that port is $500 or less, and the circumstances make it 
certain it is a violation which does not extend to other ports. In cases 
in which the loss of revenue is between $500 and $1,000, the port 
director may initiate a penalty case if, in his consideration of all the 
circumstances, the claim for monetary penalty is warranted as a 
deterrent for future violations. Any actual loss of revenue shall be 
collected pursuant to Sec. 162.79b, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 
162.79b).
    (c) No penalty case shall be initiated for a violation involving 
gross negligence or negligence where a prior disclosure has been made 
and there is no actual loss of revenue, or where the actual loss of 
revenue has been tendered to Customs and the interest thereon is less 
than $500.

                        (D) Disposition of Cases

    (1) In General. In mitigating claims for monetary penalty, the 
Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer or appropriate customs official 
shall consider all the information in the petition and all available 
evidence, taking into account any mitigating, aggravating, and 
extraordinary factors in determining the final assessed penalty. All 
factors used by the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer or 
appropriate customs official in determining the penalty should be stated 
in this decision. If a penalty in a fixed amount is deemed not to be 
appropriate (see (C)(1)(c)), disposition in revenue-loss and non-
revenue-loss cases shall proceed in the manner set forth below.
    (2) Violations Determined to be Fraudulent. Absent extraordinary 
factors justifying further relief, a penalty for a fraudulent violation 
shall be mitigated as follows:
    (a) For revenue-loss violations, to an amount ranging from a minimum 
of five times the loss of revenue to a maximum of the lesser of the 
domestic value of the merchandise or eight times the loss of revenue. 
However, a penalty equal to the greater of the domestic value of the 
merchandise or eight times the loss of revenue may be warranted due to 
the existence of aggravating factors.
    (b) For non-revenue-loss violations, to an amount ranging from 50 to 
80 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise. However, a penalty 
equal to the domestic value of the merchandise may be warranted due to 
the existence of aggravating factors.
    (3) Violations Determined to be Grossly Negligent. Absent 
extraordinary factors justifying further relief, a penalty for a grossly 
negligent violation shall be mitigated as follows:
    (a) For revenue-loss violations, to an amount ranging from a minimum 
of two and one-half times the loss of revenue to a maximum of the lesser 
of the domestic value of the merchandise or four times the loss of 
revenue;
    (b) For non-revenue-loss violations, to an amount ranging from 25 to 
40 percent of the dutiable value of merchandise.
    (4) Violations Determined to be Negligent. Absent extraordinary 
factors justifying further relief, a penalty for a negligent violation 
shall be mitigated as follows:
    (a) For revenue-loss violations, to an amount ranging from a minimum 
of one-half the loss of revenue to a maximum of the lesser of the 
domestic value of the merchandise or two times the loss of revenue.
    (b) For non-revenue-loss violations, to an amount ranging from five 
to 20 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise.
    (5) Cancellation of Claim. The Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture 
Officer shall cancel a claim for monetary penalty whenever it is 
determined that an essential element of the violation has not been 
established by the available evidence.
    (6) Remission of Claim. If, following consultation with the Chief 
Counsel representative in the field, the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture 
Officer determines by clear and convincing evidence that the statute of 
limitations would be available as a defense to enforcement of a claim 
for monetary penalty, then the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer 
shall remit such claim, if it is within his authority as provided in 
Sec. 171.21, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 171.21). Any such case not 
within the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer's authority should be 
referred to

[[Page 261]]

(263the Penalties Branch at Customs Headquarters. If the Fines, Penalty, 
and Forfeiture Officer believes that a claim for monetary penalty should 
be remitted for a reason not set forth in these guidelines, he shall 
first obtain approval from the Chief, Penalties Branch, Customs 
Headquarters.

               (E) Prior Disclosure; Disposition of Cases

    (1) In non-revenue-loss cases and potential-revenue loss cases 
involving a prior disclosure where the degree of culpability is 
determined to be negligence or gross negligence, the claim for monetary 
penalty is to be remitted in full.
    (2) In non-revenue-loss cases involving a prior disclosure where the 
degree of culpability is determined to be fraud, the claim for monetary 
penalty shall be equal to ten percent of the dutiable value of the 
merchandise. There shall be no further mitigation in the absence of 
extraordinary factors.
    (3) In actual-revenue-loss cases involving a prior disclosure where 
the degree of culpability is determined to be negligence or gross 
negligence, the claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to the 
interest computed from the date of liquidation on the amount of the 
actual loss of revenue resulting from the violation.
    (4) In revenue-loss cases involving a prior disclosure where the 
degree of culpability is determined to be fraud, the claim for monetary 
penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of the total actual and potential 
loss of revenue resulting from the violation. There shall be no further 
mitigation in the absence of extraordinary factors.

                         (F) Mitigating Factors

    The following factors shall be considered in mitigation of the 
penalty, provided that sufficient evidence establishes their existence. 
The list is not exclusive.
    (1) Contributory Customs Error. This factor includes misleading or 
erroneous advice given by a Customs official only if it appears that the 
violator reasonably relied upon the information. If the claimed 
erroneous advice was not given in writing, the violator has the burden 
of establishing this claim by a preponderance of the evidence. The 
concepts of comparative negligence may be utilized in determining the 
weight to be assigned to this factor. If it is determined that the 
Customs error was the sole cause of the violation, the penalty is to be 
cancelled. If the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the 
violator is also culpable, the Customs error is to be considered as a 
mitigating factor.
    (2) Cooperation with the Investigation. In order to obtain the 
benefits of this factor, the violator must exhibit cooperation beyond 
that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. 
Some examples of the cooperation contemplated include assisting Customs 
officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the 
violator, and assisting Customs in obtaining additional information 
relating to the subject violation or other violations. Merely providing 
the books and records of the violator may not be considered cooperation 
justifying mitigation.
    (3) Immediate Remedial action. This factor includes the payment of 
the actual loss of duties prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and 
within 30 days of the determination of the duties owed. In certain 
extreme circumstances, this factor may include the removal of an 
offending employee. The correction of organizational or procedural 
defects will not be considered a mitigating factor. It is expected that 
any importer or other involved individual will seek to remove or change 
any condition which contributed to the existence of a violation.
    (4) Inexperience in Importing. Inexperience is a factor only if it 
contributes to the violation and the violation is not due to fraud or 
gross negligence.
    (5) Prior Good Record. For the violator to benefit from this factor, 
the violation must have occurred as a result of negligence or gross 
negligence, and the violator must be able to show a consistent pattern 
of importations without violation of section 592, or any other statute 
prohibiting false or fraudulent importation practices.

                         (G) Aggravating Factors

    Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in 
arriving at the final administrative penalty decision. Examples of 
aggravating factors include obstructing the investigation, withholding 
evidence, providing misleading information concerning the violation, 
transshipment in the case of textiles and textile products affecting a 
country of origin determination, and prior substantive violations of 
section 592 for which a final administrative finding of culpability has 
been made.

           (H) Extraordinary Factors Justifying Further Relief

    (1) The four factors specified below may be considered in connection 
with further relief. Such relief may be accorded for extraordinary 
factors not specified below only upon the concurrence of the Chief, 
Commercial Fraud and Negligence Penalities Branch, Headquarters.
    (a) Inability to obtain jurisdiction over the violator or inability 
to enforce a judgement against the violator.
    (b) Inability to Pay the Mitigated Penalty. The party claiming the 
existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in

[[Page 262]]

support thereof, i.e., copies of income tax returns, current financial 
statements, and independent audit reports.
    (c) Extraordinary Expenses. This factor may include such expenses as 
those incurred in providing one-time computer runs solely for submission 
to Customs to aid it in analyzing a case involving an unusual number of 
entries, with each entry involving several factors, i.e., violations 
involving subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States. Usual accounting and legal expenses (both general and 
Customs), or the cost incurred in instituting remedial action would not 
be considered extraordinary expenses.
    (d) Customs Knowledge. Additional relief in non-fraud cases will be 
granted if it is determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a 
violation and failed to inform the violator so that it could have taken 
earlier corrective action. In such cases, if a penalty is to be assessed 
involving repeated violations of the same kind, the maximum penalty 
amount for violations occurring after the date on which actual knowledge 
was obtained by Customs will be limited to two times the loss of revenue 
in revenue-loss cases or five percent of dutiable value in non-revenue-
loss cases if the continuing violations were the result of gross 
negligence, or the lesser of one time the loss of revenue in revenue-
loss cases or two percent of dutiable value in non-revenue-loss cases if 
the violations were the result of negligence. This factor shall not be 
applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable 
to the violator.

                         (I) Customhouse Brokers

    A customhouse broker shall be subject to the above guidelines only 
if he is determined to have (1) committed a fraudulent or grossly 
negligent violation; or (2) committed a grossly negligent or negligent 
violation and shared in the financial benefits of the violation to an 
extent over and above the prevailing brokerage fees.
    If the broker committed a grossly negligent violation without 
sharing in the financial benefits over and above the prevailing 
brokerage fees, the penalty should ordinarily be mitigated to a flat sum 
which should not exceed $500.
    If the broker committed a negligent violation without sharing in the 
financial benefits over and above the prevailing brokerage fees, the 
penalty should ordinarily be mitigated to a flat sum not to exceed $250. 
A broker is not negligent if he acts with reasonable care (as measured 
by the prevailing standards of the profession) in the preparation and 
presentation of the entry or the entry summary, and reasonably relies on 
the information or documents supplied to him by the actual owner, 
consignee, shipper, or their agent.

                         (J) Arriving Travelers

    (1) Liability. Assessment of penalties and determination of degrees 
of culpability for violations by an arriving traveler must be determined 
in accordance with the above guidelines.
    (2) Limitations on Liability. (a) In the absence of a referral for 
criminal prosecution, monetary penalties assessed in the case of a 
first-offense, non-commercial, fraudulent violation by an arriving 
traveler will generally be limited: (1) In the case of revenue-loss 
violations, to an amount ranging from a minimum of three times the loss 
of revenue to a maximum of five times the loss of revenue, provided the 
loss of revenue is also paid; (2) in the case of non-revenue-loss 
violations, to an amount ranging from a minimum of 30 percent of the 
dutiable value to a maximum of 50 percent of the dutiable value.
    (b) With respect to revenue-loss violations, no penalty case shall 
be initiated against an arriving traveler if the violation is not 
fraudulent or commercial, the loss of revenue is $100 or less, and there 
are no other concurrent or prior violations of section 592 or other 
statutes prohibiting false or fraudulent importation practices. However, 
all lawful duties shall be collected. With respect to non-revenue-loss 
violations, no penalty case shall be initiated against an arriving 
traveler if the violation is not fraudulent or commercial, there are no 
other concurrent or prior violations of section 592, and a penalty is 
not believed necessary to deter future violations or to serve a law 
enforcement purpose.

      (K) Violations of Laws Administered by Other Federal Agencies

    Violations of laws administered by other federal agencies (such as 
Foreign Assets Control, Agriculture, Fish and Wildlife) should be 
referred to the appropriate agency for its recommendation. Such 
recommendation, if promptly tendered, will be given due consideration, 
and may be followed provided the recommendation would not result in a 
disposition inconsistent with these guidelines.

amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51271, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 89-83, 54 FR

     Appendix C to Part 171--Customs Regulations Guidelines for the 
 Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1641

    The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 promulgated numerous changes to the 
current statute relating to Customs brokers. The following document 
attempts to define that conduct which is to be proscribed and to suggest 
penalty amounts to be assessed for such violations. It also chronicles 
procedures to be followed in assessment and mitigation of penalties.

    Note: Assessment of a monetary penalty is an alternative sanction to 
revocation or suspension of the broker's license or permit.

      I. Penalty Assessment Procedures--19 CFR Part 111, Subpart E

    A. When a penalty against a broker is contemplated, the 
``appropriate Customs officer'', (i.e., the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer) shall issue a written notice which advises the 
violator of the allegations which would warrant imposition of a penalty. 
The written notice shall be in a format similar to a prepenalty notice 
that would be issued in contemplation of assessment of a penalty under 
section 1592 or 1584.
    B. The written notice shall inform the violator that he has 30 days 
to respond as to why a penalty should not be issued. See 19 CFR 111.92.
    C. If no response is received from the violator, or, if after 
receipt of the response, it is determined that the penalty should be 
issued as stated in the prepenalty notice, a notice of penalty CF-5955A 
shall be issued formally assessing a monetary penalty against the 
broker.
    D. The Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer may reduce the amount 
of the contemplated penalty or cancel its issuance altogether if, after 
review of the violator's submission in response to the prepenalty 
notice, he is satisfied that the acts which are the basis for the 
penalty did not occur as charged or occurred in a manner that would 
permit a reduction in the contemplated penalty.

    Note: If the penalty requires approval of the Director, 
International Trade Compliance Division, and the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer wishes to reduce the penalty amount, approval from 
Headquarters must be obtained.

    E. Any notice which contemplates issuance of a penalty of more than 
$10,000 must be submitted to the Broker's Compliance Branch, Office of 
Trade Operations, for forwarding to the Director, Regulatory Procedures 
and Penalties Division, for approval prior to issuance. See 19 CFR 
111.92.
    F. After issuance of a penalty notice, the petitioning provisions of 
part 171 of the Customs Regulations are in effect.
    G. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 171.21 of the Regulations 
(19 CFR 171.21) all petitions for relief in broker penalty cases in 
which the amount assessed exceeds $10,000 shall be forwarded to 
Headquarters, Penalties Branch, for decision. For purposes of 
Sec. 111.94 of the Regulations (19 CFR 111.94), the appropriate Customs 
officer in cases of over $10,000 shall be the Director, International 
Trade Compliance Division. In cases where a penalty has been assessed 
for $10,000 or less, the appropriate Customs officer is the Fines, 
Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer.
    H. Supplemental petitions, see 19 CFR 111.95.

    Note: The deciding official may, as a matter of discretion, accept a 
supplemental petition despite the final mitigation offered to a 
petitioner of $1,000 or less.

    I. If the broker does not comply with a final mitigation decision 
within 60 days, the matter shall be referred to the Department of 
Justice for commencement of judicial action.

 II. Penalty Assessment--Conducting Customs Business Without a License 
                         (19 U.S.C. 1641(b)(6))

    A. No person may conduct Customs business, other than solely on 
behalf of that person, without a broker's license.
    B. Penalty amount:
    1. The maximum penalty for any one incident of conducting Customs 
business without a license is $10,000.
    2. Total aggregate penalties for violation of this or any other 
section of the broker penalty statute is $30,000. As a general rule, 
$10,000 will be the maximum assessment for a violation solely involving 
conducting Customs business without a license, without regard to the 
frequency of violations. In particularly aggravated circumstances, this 
rule shall be suspended.
    C. Customs business includes:
    1. Classification and valuation.
    2. Payment of duties, taxes or other charges.
    3. Drawback or refund of duties.
    4. Filing of entries or other documents relating to issues covered 
by 1-3.
    D. Customs business does not include:
    1. Marine transactions.
    2. In-bond movement or transportation of merchandise.
    3. Foreign Trade Zone admissions. See C.S.D. 84-23.
    E. Penalty amounts to be imposed for transacting Customs business 
without a license are as follows:
    1. No penalty action when importation is conducted on behalf of a 
family member. For

[[Page 264]]

purposes of this subsection, ``family member'' is defined as a parent, 
child, spouse, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.
    2. No penalty action against an individual who has a power of 
attorney to act as an unpaid agent on a non-commercial shipment. See 19 
CFR 141.133.
    3. A $250 penalty for:
    a. First violation when transaction is non-commercial but is 
conducted on behalf of any business entity, or
    b. First violation where the importation is commercial in nature 
(i.e., imported merchandise is for resale) or where the violator is 
compensated for his action, e.g., an importation of raw material or 
parts of merchandise that is to be manufactured, refined or assembled 
here before resale would be a commercial entry because the merchandise 
eventually would be resold, albeit in another form than that which it 
was entered.
    4. A $1,000 penalty for repeat violation involving:
    a. Commercial importation.
    b. Non-commercial importation made on behalf of a business entity.
    c. Non-commercial importation for which compensation is received by 
the violator.
    5. A $10,000 penalty when:
    a. Violator falsely holds himself out as being a licensed Customs 
broker.
    b. A continuing course of conduct can be shown (determined by 
frequency of violations or number of entries involved) which would 
indicate that the violator is entering merchandise for others on a 
regular commercial basis, e.g., if the violator has incurred numerous 
penalties under subsections (3) and (4) above, but the smaller penalties 
have had no deterrent effect, the $10,000 penalty under this subsection 
should be assessed in an action separate from those smaller penalties.
    F. Mitigation--No mitigation will be afforded for any violation 
involving conducting Customs business without a license unless the 
violator can show an inability to pay such penalty.
    G. IMPORTANT: As a general rule, a separate penalty should not be 
imposed for each unlawful Customs business transaction if numerous 
transactions occur contemporaneously. For example:
    1. If an unlicensed individual files six commercial entries at one 
time, that should be treated as one violation. It should not be treated 
as six violations because the entries were presented contemporaneously.
    2. If Customs discovers that an individual has conducted Customs 
business without a license on numerous occasions, but such individual 
acted without knowledge of the prohibition on such conduct, those 
numerous transactions should be treated as one violation for purposes of 
imposition of any penalty.
    H. Note: Conducting Customs business without a license is not the 
same violation as conducting Customs business without a permit. The 
latter violation is discussed later in this appendix in the section 
involving Violation of Other Laws or Regulations Enforced by Customs.
    I. Intent to violate the law is not an element of this violation. 
Reference to ``intentionally transacts Customs business'' in subsection 
1641(b)(6) relates to the intentional transaction of the business 
itself, not to any intentional attempt to violate the terms of the 
statute.

III. Section 1641(d)(1)(A)--Making a False or Misleading Statement or an 
  Omission as to Material Fact Which Was Required To Be Stated in Any 
                   Application for a License or Permit

    A. If the license would not have been issued but for the false 
statement, the proper sanction would be suspension or revocation of the 
license. If the false or misleading statement would not have absolutely 
resulted in the denial, revocation or suspension of a license, then 
penalty sanctions are proper.
    B. Material facts include but are not limited to:
    1. Facts as to identity.
    2. Facts as to citizenship status of an individual.
    3. Facts as to moral character of an individual which relate to his 
fitness to conduct Customs business.
    4. The organization of any corporation, association or partnership.
    5. The status of the license of a license holder who is a corporate 
officer or partner.
    C. Penalty Amount--$5,000 for each false statement, to a maximum of 
$30,000.
    D. Examples of situations where revocation of the license is 
appropriate.
    1. An applicant states that he is 21 years old (as required by 19 
CFR 111.11) and he is not. But for the false statement, the applicant 
could not meet the age requirement for a license.
    2. An applicant provides an alias in the application which is a 
material false statement as to identity.
    E. Mitigation guidelines.
    1. Violation due to clerical error (clerical error as defined by 19 
U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), mitigated without payment.
    2. Violation due to negligence.
    a. This is defined as more than clerical error, but not an 
intentional violation. Examples include:
    i. Failing to list a new corporate office because corporate records 
have not been kept current.
    ii. Listing an incorrect address for a reference because applicant 
has failed to update his records.
    b. Mitigate to $500 for each $5,000 penalty assessed.

[[Page 265]]

    c. This category excludes cases of harmless error, i.e., a mistake 
which could not possibly harm the government's interests. Cases falling 
in this category should be mitigated in full.
    3. Intentional violations--Revocation of a license which has been 
granted is the preferred sanction. If no license has been granted, no 
mitigation.

   IV. Section 1641(d)(1)(B)--Broker Convicted of Certain Felonies or 
          Misdemeanors Subsequent To Filing License Application

    A. As a general rule, license revocation is the standard sanction 
for these violations. If the conviction occurs subsequent to the filing 
of an application, monetary penalties may be assessed according to the 
following criteria.
    B. Unlawful conduct must relate to:
    1. Importation or exportation of merchandise.
    2. Conduct of Customs business (this shall include violations 
relating to taxes and duties and documents required to be filed with 
regard to such taxes and duties).
    3. Relevant convictions would include:
    a. 18 U.S.C. 1001--making a false statement to Customs or any other 
agency with regard to any relevant transaction.
    b. 18 U.S.C. 545--unlawful importation of merchandise.
    c. 18 U.S.C. 542--unlawful importation by means of a fraudulent act 
or omission.
    d. 22 U.S.C. 2778--illegal exportation of munitions.
    C. Monetary penalties may not be imposed in connection with 
convictions relating to conduct described in subsection 
1641(d)(1)(B)(iii) including larceny, theft, robbery, extortion, 
counterfeiting, fraudulent concealment or conversion, embezzlement or 
misappropriation of funds. Either suspension or revocation is the 
appropriate penalty for these infractions.
    D. Penalty amounts.
    1. $15,000 for a misdemeanor conviction.
    2. $30,000 for a felony conviction.
    E. Mitigation.
    1. For a misdemeanor conviction, mitigation to a lesser amount is 
permitted if the conviction related to Customs business and the domestic 
value of the merchandise involved is less than $15,000. In such case, 
mitigation to an amount equal to the domestic value of the merchandise 
is appropriate.
    2. For other misdemeanor convictions, no relief.
    3. Felony convictions, no relief.

 V. Section 1641(d)(1)(C)--Violation of Any Law Enforced by the Customs 
   Service or the Rules or Regulations Issued Under Any Such Provision

    A. Penalties under this section may be imposed in addition to any 
penalty provided for under the law enforced by Customs. Exception: 
Penalties imposed against a broker under 19 U.S.C. 1592 at a culpability 
level of less than fraud or under 19 U.S.C. 1595a(b) shall not be 
imposed in addition to a broker's penalty.
    B. Additional penalties under this section shall also be imposed 
against any broker where the other statute violated only moves against 
property, or the violator has demonstrated a continuing course of 
illegal conduct or evidence exists which indicates repeated violations 
of other statutes or regulations.
    C. Conducting Customs business without a permit penalties should be 
assessed under this section.
    1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.19 as the 
regulation violated. A party operating without a permit is required to 
apply for one under the above-noted regulation.
    2. Assessment amount--$1,000 per transaction conducted without a 
permit.
    3. Mitigation.
    a. Negligence, mitigate to $250-$500 per transaction depending on 
the presence of mitigating factors (lack of knowledge of permit 
requirement).
    b. Intentional, grant no relief.
    c. No mitigation if permit revoked by operation of law.
    4. Generally, a separate penalty should not be assessed for each 
non-permitted transaction if numerous transactions occurred 
contemporaneously. For example, if a broker files 30 entries the day 
after a permit expires, the 30 filings should be treated as one 
violation, not 30 separate violations.
    D. Penalties for failure to exercise due diligence in payment, 
refund or deposit of monies received from clients in connection with 
clients' Customs business also should be assessed under this section. 
This includes failure to pay over to a client, or file a written 
statement to a client accounting for, funds received.
    1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.29 as the 
regulation violated.
    2. Assessment amount--an amount equal to the value of any monies up 
to a maximum of $30,000, to be deposited with Customs or refunded or 
accounted for to a client.
    3. No mitigation shall be afforded until the monies are properly 
paid to Customs or refunded or accounted for to the clients.

[[Page 266]]

    4. If any claims for liquidated damages result against the client's 
bond from the failure to pay monies to Customs, no mitigation from the 
penalty shall be granted until the claim for liquidated damages is 
settled by the violating broker either through payment of the full claim 
or a mitigated amount.
    5. After monies are paid or accounted for and/or liquidated damages 
claims are settled as stated in 3. and 4. above, mitigation may be 
afforded. If the violator is found to be negligent, the penalty may be 
mitigated to an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the assessed amount, 
but no lower than $250. No mitigation from an intentional violation.
    E. Penalties for failure to retain powers of attorney from clients 
to act in their names.
    1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 141.46 as the 
regulation violated.
    2. Assessment amount--$1,000 for each power of attorney not on file.
    3. Mitigation--for a first offense, mitigate to an amount between 
$250 and $500 unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present, in 
which case full mitigation should be afforded. An extraordinary 
mitigating factor would be a fire, theft or other destruction of records 
beyond broker control. Subsequent offenses--no mitigation unless 
extraordinary mitigating factors are present.
    4. Penalty should be mitigated in full if it can be established that 
a valid power of attorney had been issued to the broker, but it was 
misplaced or destroyed through clerical error or mistake.
    F. If the other statute violated moves only against property, the 
violator shall incur a monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of 
such property or $30,000, whichever is less.

e.g., Violation of 22 U.S.C. 401 for unlawful exportation of merchandise 
results in seizure and forfeiture of the violative merchandise. There 
are no penalty provisions which Customs enforces against parties 
responsible for the seizable offense. If brokers are recalcitrant and 
are constantly responsible for offenses which result in seizure of 
merchandise, a penalty equal to the domestic value of such merchandise 
(in no case to exceed $30,000) should be imposed.
    G. Use of a broker's importation bond to aid an importer who has had 
his immediate delivery privileges revoked.
    1. The broker has aided his client in avoiding the immediate 
delivery sanctions. The penalty notice should cite 19 CFR 142.25(c) as 
the regulation violated. Before assessment of this penalty, the broker 
should be shown to have known or been negligent in not knowing of the 
client's sanction.
    2. A penalty equal to the value of the merchandise, not to exceed 
$30,000, should be assessed.
    3. Mitigation--The penalty shall be mitigated to an amount between 
25 and 50 percent of that assessed for a first violation where 
negligence is shown. Any knowing violation or a subsequent negligent 
violation (not necessarily involving the same client) will result in no 
mitigation.
    H. If the other statute violated provides for a personal penalty, 
the violator shall incur an additional monetary penalty under this 
section equal to such personal penalty or $30,000, whichever is less.
    I. Penalties assessed under this provision are not limited to 
violations just involving Customs business as defined in the statute.
    J. Mitigation guidelines.
    1. If the other law violated moves only against property, mitigate 
the penalty using guidelines in effect for the other statute violated. 
For example, if the broker is responsible for a 401 seizure of 
merchandise valued at $45,000, he incurs a penalty of $30,000. The 
guidelines for remission of the 401 forfeiture are applicable to 
mitigation of the broker penalty. Thus, if the forfeiture is remitted 
upon payment of 5 percent of the merchandise's value, the penalty will 
be mitigated upon payment of a like amount.
    2. If the other law violated provides for a personal penalty, 
mitigate the broker penalty using guidelines in effect for the other 
statute violated.

For example, a broker incurs a $40,000 penalty under 1592. The penalty 
amount represents eight times the loss of revenue because a preliminary 
finding of fraud is made (see section V.A. of this appendix). A penalty 
of $30,000, in addition to the $40,000 penalty issued under 1592, may be 
assessed. The 1592 penalty is later mitigated to $25,000, an amount 
equal to five times the loss of revenue, as the finding of fraud is 
upheld and it is also determined that the broker shared in the financial 
benefits of the violation. The broker penalty also should be mitigated 
to that $25,000 figure, for a total collection of $50,000.

 VI. Section 1641(d)(1)(D)--Counseling, Commanding, Inducing, Procuring 
 or Knowingly Aiding and Abetting Violations by Any Other Person of Any 
                   Law Enforced by the Customs Service

    A. If the law violated by another moves only against property, a 
monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of such property or $30,000 
whichever is less, may be imposed against the broker who counsels, 
commands or knowingly aids and abets such violation.
    B. If the law violated provides for only a personal penalty against 
the actual violator, a penalty may be imposed against the broker in an 
amount equal to that assessed against the violator, but in no case can 
the penalty exceed $30,000.
    C. If the broker is assessed a penalty under the statute violated by 
the other person, he may be assessed a penalty under this section in 
addition to any other penalties.

[[Page 267]]

    D. Examples of violations of this subsection:
    1. A broker counsels a client that certain gemstones are absolutely 
free of duty and need not be declared upon entry into the United States. 
The client arrives in the United States and fails to declare a quantity 
of gemstones worth $45,000. A penalty of $30,000 may be imposed against 
the broker for such counseling. The client would incur a personal 
penalty of $45,000 under the provisions of title 19, United States Code, 
section 1497, but the penalty against the broker cannot exceed $30,000.
    2. A client imports $15,000 worth of merchandise by vessel. The 
merchandise is unladen at the wharf but Customs has not appraised or 
released it. Customs informs the broker that the shipment must be held 
for an intensive examination. The broker informs the client that the 
merchandise can be moved and delivered to the consignee. The broker 
assures his client that he will handle all the necessary paperwork. The 
merchandise is moved from the wharf. The broker is subject to a $15,000 
penalty for counseling and inducing his client to violate the provisions 
of title 19, United States Code, section 1448 and title 19, United 
States Code, section 1595a(b).
    E. Mitigation--Follow guidelines applicable to the other penalty or 
forfeiture statute involved.

VII. Section 1641(d)(1)(E)--Knowingly Employing or Continuing to Employ 
Any Person Who Has Been Convicted of a Felony, Without Written Approval 
          of Such Employment From the Secretary of the Treasury

    A. A broker has 30 days to seek approval of the Secretary for such 
employment. If he seeks the approval within such time, no penalty will 
be assessed.
    B. A $5,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and 
failing to make application with the Secretary approving such employment 
within 30 days of the date of discovery of the felony conviction.
    C. A $25,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon 
without seeking approval for employment.
    D. A $30,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and 
continuing to employ same after approval has been denied (generally 
revocation or suspension of the license would be appropriate under this 
circumstance).
    E. Example: If a broker unknowingly employs a convicted felon and 1 
year after employment discovers the existence of such a conviction, the 
following actions would dictate imposition of a penalty:
    1. If he seeks approval of the Secretary within 30 days after 
discovery of the existence of the conviction, no penalty will be 
assessed.
    2. If he seeks approval at some time after 30 days from the date of 
discovery, a $5,000 penalty would lie.
    3. If he does not seek approval until after Customs becomes aware of 
the violation, a $25,000 penalty would lie.
    4. If he seeks approval, but is denied, and continues to employ the 
convicted felon, a $30,000 penalty would lie.
    F. Customs discovery of a felony conviction. If Customs discovers 
the felony conviction and there is no indication that the employer is 
aware of same, Customs may inform the employer of such conviction. 
Discretion should be used in divulging this information.
    G. Mitigation will only be permitted from the $5,000 penalty as 
follows:
    1. If the application for approval is submitted within 60 days, but 
after 30 days, mitigate to $2,000.
    2. If there is no application beyond the 60-day period, no 
mitigation shall be granted. Continued employment will result in further 
penalties as described above in sections E.3 and E.4.

  VIII. Section 1641(d)(1)(F)--In the Course of Customs Business, With 
 Intent to Defraud, Knowingly Deceiving, Misleading or Threatening Any 
                      Client or Prospective Client

    A. An unsubstantiated accusation by a client is inadequate basis to 
assess any penalty under this section of law.
    B. A $30,000 penalty should be imposed for any violation of this 
section.
    C. Mitigation--Inasmuch as evidence of intent must be shown before a 
penalty can be imposed, no mitigation should be permitted if a violation 
is found to lie. A petition for mitigation could be entertained only on 
the issue of whether such violation did, in fact, occur.

IX. Section 1641(b)(5)--The Failure of a Customs Broker That is Licensed 
as a Corporation, Association or Partnership to Have, For Any Continuous 
     Period of 120 Days, at Least One Officer of the Corporation or 
      Association or One Member of the Partnership Validly Licensed

    A. Important: Violation of this section results in the revocation of 
the broker's license by operation of law.
    B. A $10,000 penalty may be imposed pursuant to section 1641(b)(6) 
because the revocation by operation of law results in the broker 
conducting Customs business without a license. No penalty liability 
would be incurred specifically under section 1641(b)(5).
    C. Mitigation--Grant no mitigation from any penalty incurred by a 
broker for conducting Customs business without a license as a result of 
revocation of that license by operation of law.

[[Page 268]]

 X. Section 1641(c)(3)--Failure of a Customs Broker Granted a Permit to 
   Conduct Business in a Certain District to Employ, for a Continuous 
 Period of 180 Days, at Least One Individual Who is Licensed Within the 
                           District or Region

    A. Important: Violation of this section results in the revocation of 
a permit by operation of law.
    B. Penalties may be imposed for violation of the provisions of 
1641(d)(1)(C), violation of other laws enforced by Customs. Guidelines 
for imposition of penalties for conducting Customs business without a 
permit should be followed.
    C. Mitigation--No mitigation should be permitted from any penalty 
imposed for failure to have a permit when the permit lapses by operation 
of law.

    XI. Section 1641(b)(4)--Failure of a Licensed Broker to Exercise 
 Responsible Supervision and Control Over the Customs Business That it 
                                Conducts

    A. Standards of responsible supervision and control shall be issued 
by the Commissioner of Customs. Statutory authority to set such 
standards is provided by section 1641(f).

    Note: All penalties assessed for violation of 1641(b)(4) shall also 
cite section 1641(d)(1)(C) as the statute violated in all notices issued 
to the alleged violator.

    B. The following penalty amounts shall be assessed against brokers 
who fail to exercise responsible supervision and control over business 
conducted at district level.
    1. A penalty of $1,000 against any broker who:
    a. Continuously makes the same errors on a particular type of entry;
    b. Fails to properly instruct employees about Customs business, 
thereby resulting in the filing of incorrect entries or the mishandling 
of transactions relating to Customs business;
    c. Knowingly allows his entry bond to be used to effect release of 
merchandise in districts where he does not have a license or permit 
(this is imposed in addition to any penalty for conducting Customs 
business without a license);
    d. Fails to comply with regulations or procedures but does not 
commit violations that would warrant any higher penalty amount as 
described below.
    2. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who, when requested, is 
unable to produce documents relating to specific Customs business which 
are material to that business (e.g., if the business regards an entry he 
should have the invoice, packing list, etc.). This requirement excludes 
documents not required to be kept by a broker.
    3. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who is unable to satisfy 
the deciding Customs official that he has a working knowledge of any 
operation material to his ability to render valuable service to others 
in the conduct of Customs business.
    Examples include:
    a. A working knowledge of all automated systems in use in the 
district;
    b. A knowledge of the cash flow procedures in each district of 
operation;
    c. Retention of copies of all surety bonds in proper form and in 
sufficient dollar amount;
    d. Knowledge of filing systems and document record storage in each 
district;
    e. Continuous monitoring to ensure timely payment of all obligations 
including duties, taxes and refunds.
    4. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who fails to exercise 
responsible supervision and control over the Customs business that it 
conducts as defined in section XI.C. of this appendix.
    5. A penalty of $10,000 against any broker who is found to have 
failed to maintain satisfactory accounting records or records of 
documents filed with Customs on any matter.
    C. The following factors shall be indicative of a lack of 
supervision or lack of working knowledge of Customs procedures (the list 
is not conclusive):
    1. A high rate of entry rejections when compared with other brokers 
in the permitted district.
    2. A high rate of late filing liquidated damages cases when compared 
with other brokers in the permitted district.
    3. In the case of entry summaries filed in the broker's name, a high 
number of missing document cases when compared with other brokers in the 
permitted district.
    4. An inordinate number of entries for which free entry is claimed, 
but no documentation supporting such claim is submitted, resulting in 
liquidation of the entries as dutiable.
    5. Inability to assist or failure to cooperate with an audit, 
including failure to provide all records and any other necessary 
information pertaining to a broker's Customs business to assist 
auditors.
    6. Failure to settle (including petitioning) liquidated damages 
claims in a timely manner.
    7. Evidence to indicate that timely duty refunds to clients are not 
made or accounted for and adequate records of same are not kept (usually 
will result in penalty assessed in accordance with section B.5. above).
    8. Employing a licensed individual for a minimal number of days each 
120- or 180-day period (see sections 1641(b)(5) and 1641(c)(3) so as to 
avoid violation of the statute.
    a. For purposes of imposition of penalties under this subsection, a 
minimal number of days shall be 10 working days for each 120-day period 
or 15 working days for each 180-day period.

[[Page 269]]

    b. It shall be presumed that temporary employment of such a licensed 
individual is undertaken solely to avoid revocation of a license or 
permit. Such minimal employment shall be prima facie evidence of lack of 
supervision.
    D. Mitigation.
    1. $1,000 penalties shall not be mitigated unless the broker can 
show that extraordinary mitigating factors are present.
    2. $5,000 penalties for failure to produce documents may be 
mitigated to an amount between $2,000 and $3,500 if the documents are 
produced but not in a timely fashion. No mitigation shall be afforded if 
the documents are not produced, unless the broker can satisfactorily 
demonstrate that such failure to produce was caused by circumstances 
beyond the control of the broker or his client (e.g., a rupture of 
relations with the party responsible for generating the documents). Full 
mitigation shall be afforded in the case of destruction of records by 
events beyond a broker's control, such as theft, flood, fire or other 
acts of God.
    3. $5,000 penalty for failure to have a working knowledge of any 
operation for which a broker is licensed to do business may be mitigated 
to a lesser amount upon a showing by the broker that steps have been 
taken to improve instruction and supervision of employees and an 
improvement in the knowledge of his operation occurs.
    4. $5,000 penalty for failure to exercise responsible supervision 
and control may be mitigated to a lesser amount if the broker 
immediately corrects the problem which was the basis for the assessment 
and sufficiently monitors the situation to avoid recurrence.
    5. $10,000 penalty for failure to maintain satisfactory accounting 
records will only be subject to mitigation in full if the broker can 
prove that satisfactory accounting records and documents records are 
being kept. Mitigation in a lesser degree may be afforded upon a showing 
by the broker that a bona fide attempt was made to establish a 
satisfactory accounting and/or recordkeeping system, or upgrade a 
deficient system, but such efforts proved unsuccessful or only partially 
effective.
    6. Penalty equal to the value of monies not properly paid or 
accounted for.
    a. If the broker shows that the monies were paid or accounted for 
and requisite notifications were made, albeit in an untimely fashion not 
to exceed 30 days after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon 
payment of 25 percent of the assessed amount, but no less than $250.
    b. If the monies were paid and notifications made more than 30 days 
after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon payment of 50 
percent of the assessed amount, but not less than $1,000.
    c. If there is no proof of proper payment of duties, refunds, etc., 
no mitigation shall be granted.

                   XII. Limits of Penalty Assessments

    A. A broker shall be penalized a maximum of $30,000 for any 
violation or violations of the statute in any one penalty notice.
    B. If a broker is penalized to the maximum the statue will allow and 
continues to commit the same violation or violations, revocation or 
suspension of his license would be the appropriate sanction. Barring 
such revocation or suspension action, he may again be penalized to the 
maximum the statute will allow.
    C. From any one audit, the maximum aggregate penalty for all 
violations discovered is $30,000.

                      XIII. Consolidation of Cases

    Whenever multiple penalties arising from a particular fact situation 
or pattern are contemplated against brokers or individuals operating in 
different districts, the cases may be consolidated in one district. 
Approval for consolidation must be sought from the Brokers Compliance 
Branch, Field Operations Division, Office of Trade Operations.

                     Subpart C--Action on Petitions


<R05>
Sec. 172.21  Petitions acted on by Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer.

    The port director may cancel any claim for liquidated damages 
incurred on such terms and conditions as, under the law and in view of 
the circumstances, he shall deem appropriate when the claim is $100,000 
or less.

[T.D. 85-25, 50 FR 7336, Feb. 22, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 172.22   Special cases acted on by Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer.

    (a) Nonproduction of documents in general. Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officers are hereby authorized to treat any bond charge for 
the production of a missing document as satisfied upon payment by the 
principal or surety of the sum of $25 as liquidated damages for each 
missing declaration of the consignee or other document, except shippers' 
export declarations and special Customs and commercial invoices, not 
produced within the time prescribed by law or regulations or any lawful 
extension of such time.
    (b) Nonproduction of commercial invoices. If a required commercial 
invoice is not produced (1) on the date the entry or entry summary is 
filed, (2) within 120 days after the date the entry or entry summary is 
required to be filed, or (3) if the invoice is needed for statistical 
purposes, within 50 days after the date the entry or entry summary is 
required to be filed, then unless the production is waived under the 
provisions of Sec. 141.92 of this chapter, the bond charge for the 
production thereof may be canceled by the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture 
Officer upon the payment of $25 as liquidated damages, if:
    (i) The party who made the entry submits an application for relief 
explaining in detail why the commercial invoice could not be produced 
within the prescribed period; and
    (ii) The Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer is satisfied by such 
application or otherwise that the failure to produce the invoice within 
the prescribed period was due to causes wholly beyond the control of the 
party making the entry and not to any purpose of the foreign seller or 
shipper to withhold information required by law, regulation, or special 
instruction to be shown on the invoice.
    (c) Nonproduction of free-entry or reduced-duty documents. When free 
entry or the application of a reduced rate of duty is dependent upon the 
production of a document which the importer fails to produce, or when a 
conditionally free or reduced duty provision claimed on entry is held to 
be inapplicable, the claim for free entry or reduced rate of duty shall 
be treated by the port director as abandoned upon the assessment and 
payment of duty and the bond (or, in the case of a continuous bond, the 
charge against the bond) given for the production of the free-entry or 
reduced-duty document may be cancelled without the collection of 
liquidated damages.
    (d) Failure to file timely entry summary after release under entry 
or immediate delivery permit. (1) If an entry summary for merchandise 
not subject to quota has not been timely filed after release under an 
entry or under a special permit for immediate delivery, the port 
director shall issue a demand for liquidated damages in accordance with 
Sec. 142.15 or Sec. 142.27 of this chapter, and in accordance with 
guidelines published by the authority of the Commissioner of Customs. 
The demand shall be cancelled in accordance with guidelines published by 
the authority of the Commissioner of Customs.
    (2) If the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer is satisfied that 
the violation occurred solely because of a delay in the return by 
Customs to the importer or broker of documents necessary to file the 
entry summary, he may cancel such liquidated damages without payment.
    (3) If collection of an amount greater than that established in 
accordance with this section appears warranted,

[[Page 272]]

the case shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of Customs for 
disposition.
    (4) In the case of an entry summary which has not been filed, the 
Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer may not grant relief from a 
demand for liquidated damages until the entry summary has been filed.
    (e) Failure to timely deliver merchandise traveling in-bond. (1) If 
merchandise traveling under bond is not delivered to the port of 
destination or exportation within time limits established by 
Secs. 18.2(c)(2), 122.119(b) or 122.120(c) of this chapter and 
liquidated damages are assessed for violation of the provisions of 
Sec. 18.8(b) of this chapter, notwithstanding other delegations of 
authority, the demand shall be cancelled by the port director in 
accordance with guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Customs.
    (2) If the in-bond manifest is not delivered to the port director as 
required by Sec. 18.2(d) or Sec. 18.7(a) of this chapter and liquidated 
damages are assessed for violation of the provisions of Sec. 18.8(b) of 
this chapter, notwithstanding any other delegation of authority, the 
demand shall be cancelled by the port director in accordance with 
guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Customs.

Sec. 172.23   Limitations on consideration of petitions.

    No action looking to relief from the payment of full liquidated 
damages shall be taken on any petition, irrespective of the amount 
involved, if the claim has been referred to the Department of Justice 
for collection as provided in Sec. 172.2.

<R04>
                   Subpart D--Disposition of Petitions


<R05>
Sec. 172.31   Act or omission did not occur.

    (a) Definite. If it is definitely determined that the act or 
omission forming the basis for a claim for liquidated damages did not in 
fact occur, the claim shall be cancelled by the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer. If the liquidated damages have already been paid, 
they shall be refunded by Customs, and an appropriate notation shall be 
made on Customs Form 5955-A, if the transaction has already been 
recorded thereon.
    (b) Dependent upon a construction of law. When the determination of 
whether or not the claim was erroneously made depends upon a 
construction of law, the claim shall not be cancelled without the 
approval of the Commissioner of Customs, unless there is in force a 
ruling decisive of the issue.
    (c) Doubtful cases. Approval of the Commissioner of Customs shall be 
requested in all doubtful cases.

[T.D. 74-227, 39 FR 32023, Sept. 4, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 172.32   Limitation on time decision effective.

    A decision to cancel a claim for liquidated damages on condition 
that a stated amount be paid shall be effective for not more than 60 
days from the date of notice to the parties of such decision, unless the 
decision itself prescribes a different effective period or the decision 
is later amended to change the effective period. If payment of the 
stated amount is not made, or arrangements made for delayed payment or 
installment payments, or a supplemental petition filed, within the 
effective period, the full claim for liquidated damages shall be deemed 
applicable and, after required collection action, shall be promptly 
referred to the U.S. attorney unless other action has been directed by 
the Commissioner of Customs.

<R05>
Sec. 172.33   Supplemental petitions for relief.

    (a) Time and place of filing. If the interested parties are not 
satisfied with a decision of the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer 
or the Commissioner of Customs, a supplemental petition may be filed 
with the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer by the interested 
parties. Such a petition shall be filed either:
    (1) Within 30 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the 
decision from which further relief is requested if no effective period 
is prescribed in the decision: or
    (2) Within the time prescribed in the decision from which further 
relief as requested as the effective period of the decision.
    (b) Consideration--(1) Decisions of the Fines, Penalty, and 
Forfeiture Officer. Where a supplemental petition requests further 
relief from a decision of the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer, he 
may grant additional relief, if he believes it is warranted, in cases in 
which he has the authority to grant relief in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 172.21. Supplemental petitions for further relief in 
cases initially decided by the Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 172.21, together with all 
pertinent documents, shall be forwarded to the designated Headquarters 
official if:
    (i) There has been a specific request by the petitioner for review 
by the designated Headquarters official; or
    (ii) The Fines, Penalty, and Forfeiture Officer believes no 
additional relief is warranted.
    (2) Decisions of the Commissioner of Customs. A supplemental 
petition appealing a decision of the Commissioner of Customs shall be 
filed, together with all pertinent documents, with the Fines, Penalty, 
and Forfeiture Officer who initiated the case for transmittal to the 
Commissioner of Customs for reconsideration.
    (c) Second supplemental petition. (1) Only one further supplemental 
petition may be filed appealing a decision made with respect to an 
initial supplemental petition. The second supplemental petition will not 
be accepted unless accompanied or preceded by full payment of all 
liquidated damages determined to be due in the decision rendered on the 
first supplemental petition. Such payment must be made within 60 days

timely protest was not filed if an application for refund is filed with 
the port director within 1 year after the date of the entry and no 
waiver of compliance with applicable regulations is involved other than

warehouse for consumption on or after October 1, 1970;
    (2) Articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption 
prior

[[Page 276]]

to October 1, 1970, for which appraisement has not become final by 
October 1, 1970;
    (3) Articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption 
prior to October 1, 1970, for which the appraisement has become final 
but with respect to which the entry has not been liquidated prior to 
October 1, 1970;
    (4) Articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption 
with respect to which the entry has been liquidated prior to October 1, 
1970, if
    (i) The time for filing a protest has not expired and a protest has 
not been filed prior to October 1, 1970; or
    (ii) A protest has been filed and has not been disallowed in whole 
or in part before October 1, 1970; or
    (5) Articles excluded from entry before October 1, 1970, with 
respect to which
    (i) The time for filing a protest has not expired and a protest has 
not been filed prior to October 1, 1970; or
    (ii) A protest has been filed and has not been disallowed in whole 
or in part before October 1, 1970.
    (b) Limitation--(1) Appraisement not final. When the appraisement of 
articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption prior to

provisions of this part after such liquidation shall not include issues 
which were raised or could have been raised on an appeal to 
reappraisement before the appraisement became final.
    (3) Protest not disallowed. When a protest filed prior to October 1, 
1970, has not been disallowed in whole or in part before such date, the 
provisions of this part shall be applicable to such protests. The time 
within which any action must be taken under the provisions of this part 
with respect to such a protest shall commence on the date the protest

law or a customhouse broker or his authorized employee acting in his 
behalf, there shall have been filed or shall be filed with the protest a 
power of attorney which either specifically authorizes such agent to 
make, sign, and file the protest or grants unlimited authority to such 
agent. No power of attorney to file a protest shall be required in the 
following cases:
    (1) Attorney at law. When the protest is filed by an attorney at law 
as agent or attorney for the principal, the signing of the protest as 
agent or attorney for the principal by the attorney at law shall be 
considered a declaration by him that he is currently a member in good 
standing of the highest court of a State, possession, territory, 
commonwealth, or the District of Columbia, and has been authorized to

customhouse broker, or an authorized employee acting in his behalf, as

be considered a declaration by the broker that he or the employee 
signing in his behalf, is authorized to sign and file the protest for

power of attorney to transact Customs business for the principal on 
Customs Form 5291.
    (b) Execution of power of attorney--(1) Corporation. A corporate 
power of attorney to file protests shall be signed by a duly authorized 
officer or employee of the corporation. If the port

[[Page 277]]

director is otherwise satisfied as to the authority of such corporate 
officer or employee to grant such power of attorney, compliance with the 
requirements of Sec. 141.37 of this chapter may be waived with respect 
to such power.
    (2) Partnership. A partnership power of attorney to file protests 
may be signed by one member in the name of the partnership, provided the 
power recites the name of all the members.
    (c) Duration. Powers of attorney issued by a partnership shall be 
limited to a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of receipt 
thereof by the port director. All other powers of attorney may be 
granted for an unlimited period.

Sec. 174.15  Consolidation of protests filed by different parties.

    (a) General. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, separate 
protests relating to one category of merchandise covered by an entry 
shall be considered as a single protest whether filed as a single 
protest or filed as separate protests relating to the same category by 
one or more parties in interest or an authorized agent.
    (b) NAFTA transactions. The following rules shall apply to a 
consolidation of multiple protests concerning a determination of origin 
under subpart G of part 181 of this chapter if one of the protests is 
filed by or on behalf of an exporter or producer described in 
Sec. 174.12(a)(5) of this part:
    (1) If consolidation under paragraph (a) of this section is pursuant 
to specific written requests for consolidation received from all 
interested parties who filed protests under this part, those interested 
parties shall be deemed to have waived their rights to confidentiality 
as regards business information within the meaning of Sec. 181.121 of 
this chapter. In such cases, a separate notice of the decision will be 
issued to each interested party under this part but without regard to 
whether the notice reflects confidential business information obtained 
from one but not all of those interested parties.
    (2) If consolidation under paragraph (a) of this section is done by 
the port director in the absence of specific written requests for 
consolidation from all interested parties who filed protests under this 
part, no waiver of confidentiality by those interested parties shall be 
deemed to have taken place. In such cases, a separate notice of the 
decision will be issued to each interested party and each such notice 
shall adhere to

section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), within 30 
days from the date the protest was filed, unless the person filing the

protest. In no event shall the port director (or the Commissioner of 
Customs or his designee if the protest is the subject of further review 
as provided for in Secs. 174.25 and 174.26) delay action on the protest 
beyond 30 days, or such additional time period as may be agreed to by 
the person filing the protest. Any protest filed pursuant to this

the protesting parties shall be treated as a request for accelerated 
disposition by all the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 174.23   Further review of protests.

    A protesting party may seek further review of a protest in lieu of 
review by the port director by filing, on the form prescribed in 
Sec. 174.25, an application for such review within the time allowed and 
in the manner prescribed by Sec. 174.12 for the filing of a protest. The 
filing of an application for further review shall

[[Page 281]]

not preclude a preliminary examination by the port director whose 
decision is the subject of the protest for the purpose of determining 
whether the protest may be allowed in full. If such preliminary 
examination indicates that the protest would be denied in whole or in 
part by the port director in the absence of an application for further 
review, however, he shall forward the protest and application for 
consideration in accordance with Sec. 174.26.


<R05>
Sec. 174.24   Criteria for further review.

    Further review of a protest which would otherwise be denied by the 
port director shall be accorded a party filing an application for 
further review which meets the requirements of Sec. 174.25 when the 
decision against which the protest was filed:
    (a) Is alleged to be inconsistent with a ruling of the Commissioner 
of Customs or his designee, or with a decision made at any port with 
respect to the same or substantially similar merchandise;
    (b) Is alleged to involve questions of law or fact which have not 
been ruled upon by the Commissioner of Customs or his designee or by the 
Customs courts;
    (c) Involves matters previously ruled upon by the Commissioner of 
Customs or his designee or by the Customs courts but facts are alleged 
or legal arguments presented which were not considered at the time of 
the original ruling; or
    (d) Is alleged to involve questions which the Headquarters Office, 
United States Customs Service, refused to consider in the form of a 
request for internal advice pursuant to Sec. 177.11(b)(5) of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 174.25   Application for further review.

    (a) Form and number of copies. An application for further review may 
be filed on the same Customs Form 19 used for filing the protest for 
which further review is requested, or on a separate Customs Form 19. In 
either case, the Customs Form 19 shall be filed in quadruplicate. If a 
fifth copy of the application is presented for the purpose of having 
recorded thereon the date of its receipt, such information shall be 
recorded thereon and the fifth copy shall be returned to the person 
filing the application.
    (b) Contents. An application for further review shall contain the 
following information:
    (1) Information identifying the protest to which it applies and the 
protesting party and his importer number;
    (2) Allegations that the protesting party:
    (i) Has not previously received an adverse administrative decision 
from the Commissioner of Customs or his designee nor has presently 
pending an application for an administrative decision on the same claim 
with respect to the same category of merchandise; and
    (ii) Has not received a final adverse decision from the Customs 
courts on the same claim with respect to the same category of 
merchandise and does not have an action involving such a claim pending 
before the Customs courts.
    (3) A statement of any facts or additional legal arguments, not part 
of the record, upon which the protesting party relies, including the 
criterion set forth in Sec. 174.24 which justifies further review. A 
showing of facts that support the allegation of a criterion set forth in 
Sec. 174.24(c) will constitute a ground for the granting of further 
review in circumstances where the applicant's inability to affirmatively 
make the allegations described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section would 
otherwise result in its denial.

    (2) All other protests shall be reviewed by a designee of the port 
director who did not participate directly in the decision which is the 
subject of the protest.

    (c) Further notice when issue not presented. If, upon examination of 
the information and inspection of any sample supplied by the district 
director, the petitioner believes and the district director agrees that 
the merchandise or the facts surrounding this importation are not 
sufficient to raise the issue involved in the petition, the district 
director shall then give the petitioner notice of the first liquidation 
thereafter which will permit the framing of the issue covered by the 
petition. The

[[Page 286]]

district director shall, under the same conditions, continue to give 
notice for so long as he is of the opinion that the petitioner 
affirmatively intends to contest. When the district director concludes 
that the petitioner does not intend to contest the decision of the 
Commissioner of Customs, he shall refer the matter to the Commissioner 
of Customs for his decision before issuing any further notice of 
liquidation.

<R05>
Sec. 177.0  Scope.

    This part relates to the issuance of rulings to importers and other 
interested persons by the United States Customs Service, other than 
advance rulings under Article 509 of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (see subpart I of part 181 of this chapter). It describes the 
situations in which a ruling may be requested, the procedures to be 
followed in requesting a ruling, the conditions under which a ruling 
will be issued, the effect of a ruling when it is issued, and the 
publication of rulings in the Customs Bulletin. The rulings issued under 
the provisions of this part will usually be prospective in application 
and, consequently, will usually not relate to specific matters or 
situations presently or previously under consideration by any Customs 
Service field office. Accordingly, the rulings requested under the 
provisions of this part should be distinguished from the administrative 
rulings, determinations, or decisions which may be requested under 
procedures set forth elsewhere in this chapter, including, but not 
limited to, those set forth in part 12 (relating to submissions of proof 
of admissibility of articles detained under section 307 of the Tariff 
Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)), part 103 (relating to disclosure of 
information in Customs files), part 133 (relating to disputed claims of 
piratical copying of copyrighted matter), subpart C of part 152 
(relating to determinations concerning the dutiable value of merchandise 
by Customs field officers), part 153 (relating to enforcement of the 
Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended), part 159 (insofar as it relates to 
countervailing duties), part 171 (relating to fines, penalties, and 
forfeitures), part 172 (relating to liquidated damages), part 174 
(relating to protests), and part 175 (relating to petitions filed by 
American manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers pursuant to section 
516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended). Nor do the provisions of 
part 177 apply to requests for decisions of an operational, 
administrative, or investigative nature which are properly within the 
cognizance of a Customs Headquarters Office other than the Office of 
Regulations and Rulings.

<R04>
                   Subpart A--General Ruling Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 177.1  General ruling practice and definitions.

    (a) The issuance of rulings generally--(1) Prospective transactions. 
It is in the interest of the sound administration of the Customs and 
related laws that persons engaging in any transaction affected by those 
laws fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its 
consummation. For this reason, the Customs Service will give full and 
careful consideration to written requests from importers and other 
interested parties for rulings or information setting forth, with 
respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive 
interpretation of applicable law, or other appropriate information. 
Generally, a ruling may be requested under the provisions of this part 
only with respect to prospective transactions--that is, transactions 
which are not already pending before a Customs Service office by reason 
of arrival, entry, or otherwise.
    (2) Current or completed transactions--(i) Current transactions. A 
question arising in connection with a Customs transaction already before 
a Customs Service office will normally be resolved by that office in 
accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by 
the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the 
basis of clearly established rules set forth in the Customs and related 
laws, or in the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury 
Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the 
Customs Bulletin, that office may be requested to forward the question 
to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as more fully described in 
Sec. 177.11.
    (ii) Completed transactions. A question arising in connection with 
an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with 
any other completed Customs transaction, may not be the subject of a 
ruling request.
    (b) Oral advice. The Customs Service will not issue rulings in 
response to oral requests. Oral opinions or advice of Customs Service 
personnel are not binding on the Customs Service. However, oral 
inquiries may be made to Customs Service offices regarding existing 
rulings, the scope of such rulings, the types of transactions with 
respect to which the Customs Service will issue rulings, the scope of 
the rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in 
submitting ruling requests, as described in this part.
    (c) Who may request a ruling. Except as otherwise provided in 
subpart I of part 181 of this chapter, a ruling may be requested under 
this part by any person who, as an importer or exporter of merchandise, 
or otherwise, has a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or 
questions presented in the ruling request, or by the authorized agent of 
such person. A ``person'' in this context includes an individual, 
corporation, partnership, association, or other entity or group.
    (d) Definitions. (1) A ``ruling'' is a written statement issued by 
the Headquarters Office or the appropriate office of Customs as provided 
in this part that interprets and applies the provisions of the Customs 
and related laws to a specific set of facts. A ``ruling letter'' is a 
ruling issued in response to a written request therefor and set forth in 
a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A 
``published ruling''' is a ruling which has been published in the 
Customs Bulletin.
    (2) An ``information letter'' is a written statement issued by the 
Customs Service that does no more than call attention to a well-
established interpretation or principle of Customs law, without applying 
it to a specific set of facts. An information letter may be issued in 
response to a request for a ruling when: (i) The request suggests that 
general information, rather than a ruling, is actually being sought, 
(ii) the request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the 
requirements set forth in this part, or (iii) the ruling requested 
cannot be issued for any other reason, and (iv) it is believed that 
general information may be of some benefit to the party making the 
request.
    (3) A ``Customs transaction'' is an act or activity to which the 
Customs and related laws apply. A ``prospective''

[[Page 290]]

Customs transaction is one that is contemplated or is currently being 
undertaken and has not resulted in any arrival or the filing of any 
entry or other document, or in any other act to bring the transaction, 
or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs Service office. 
A ``current'' Customs transaction is one which is presently under 
consideration by a port office of the Customs Service. A ``completed'' 
Customs transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs 
Service field office and with respect to which that office has issued a 
determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to 
appeal, petition, protest, or other review, as provided in the 
applicable Customs laws and regulations. In a series of identical, 
recurring transactions, each transaction shall be considered an 
individual transaction for purposes of this part.
    (4) An ``authorized agent'' is a person expressly authorized by a 
principal to act on his behalf. A ruling requested by an attorney or 
other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the 
authority under which the request is made. With the exception of 
attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing 
before the Customs Service as an agent in connection with a ruling 
request may be required to present evidence of his authority to 
represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an 
individual representing his full-time employer, or to a bona-fide 
officer, director, or other qualified representative of a corporation, 
association, or organized group.
    (5) The term ``Customs and related laws,'' as generally used in this 
part, includes any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(including the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or the 
Customs Regulations, or any provision contained in other legislation 
(including the navigation laws), regulations, treaties, orders, 
proclamations, or other agreements administered by the Customs Service.
    (6) The term ``Headquarters Office,'' as used herein, means the 
Office of Regulations and Rulings at Headquarters, United States Customs 
Service, Washington, DC.

<R05>
Sec. 177.2  Submission of ruling requests.

    (a) Form. A request for a ruling should be in the form of a letter. 
Requests for Valuation and Carrier rulings should be addressed to the 
Commissioner of Customs, Attention: Office of Regulations and Rulings, 
Washington, DC 20229. The Division and Branch in the Office of 
Regulations and Rulings to which the request should be directed may also 
be indicated, if known. Requests for tariff classification rulings 
should be addressed to the Director, National Commodity Specialist 
Division, U.S. Customs, Attn: Classification Ruling Requests, New York, 
New York 10048, or to any service port office of the Customs Service.
    (b) Content--(1) Generally. Each request for a ruling must contain a 
complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the transaction. 
Such facts include the names, addresses, and other identifying 
information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port 
or place at which any article involved in the transaction will arrive or 
be entered, or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to 
the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of 
the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the type of ruling 
requested.
    (2) Description of transaction--(i) Generally. The Customs 
transaction to which the ruling request relates must be described in 
sufficient detail to permit the proper application of relevant Customs 
and related laws.
    (ii) Tariff classification rulings. (A) If the transaction involves 
the importation of an article for which a ruling as to its proper 
classification under the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States is requested, the request for a ruling should include 
a full and complete description of the article and whenever germane to 
the proper classification of the article, information as to the 
article's chief use

[[Page 291]]

in the United States, its commercial, common, or technical designation, 
and, where the article is composed of two or more materials, the 
relative quantity (by weight and by volume) and value of each. The 
ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of 
the article, and its approximate selling price in the United States. 
Individual requests for rulings submitted to service port offices will 
be limited to five (5) merchandise items, all of which must be of the 
same class or kind.
    (B) Rulings issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist 
Division, or any service port office are limited to prospective 
transactions. Only the Headquarters Office will prepare final decisions 
under Sec. 177.11 (Requests for Advice by Field Officers), or 
Sec. 174.23 (Further Review of Protests), Sec. 177.10 (Change of 
Practice), decisions under part 175 of this chapter (petitions under 
section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended), decisions under 
Sec. 177.12 (Inconsistent Customs decisions), and decisions under 
Policies and Procedures Manual Supplement 2126-01.
    (C) The requesting party may send the request directly to the 
Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, U.S. Customs Service, 
Washington, DC 20229. The Headquarters Office retains authority to 
independently review all tariff classification ruling letters issued by 
the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, and any service 
port office. If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is 
issued disagrees with the tariff classification set forth in a ruling 
issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any 
service port office, he may petition the Director, Tariff Classification 
Appeals Division, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229, for review 
of the ruling.
    (iii) Valuation rulings. If the transaction involves the valuation 
of an article for Customs purposes, the request for a ruling should 
include all of the applicable information described in subparts C and D 
of part 152 of this chapter, and, insofar as is relevant, the 
information which would be required on an invoice as described in 
subpart F of part 141 of this chapter. The request should also describe 
the nature of the transaction (whether f.o.b./c.i.f., ex-factory, or 
some other arrangement), the relationship (if any) of the parties, 
whether the transaction was at arm's-length, whether there have been 
other sales of the same or similar merchandise in the country of 
exportation, whether an agency relationship exists, or any other 
information relevant to a determination under section 402 or 402a of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1402).
    (iv) Carrier rulings. If the transaction involves a vessel, the 
request for a ruling should include information relating to place of 
build and nationality of registration and, if to be used in waters under 
the jurisdiction of the United States, the exact place or places of 
intended use, if known. If the request for a ruling involves a 
determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated 
voyage would be considered to be coastwise transportation in violation 
of 46 U.S.C. 289 (see Sec. 4.80a of this chapter), the request should 
completely identify the voyage, including the proposed time of arrival 
at and departure from every port on the itinerary and any coordination 
of the voyage with special events at coastwise ports, and should be 
accompanied by samples, if available, of brochures, advertising, and 
other information that may be relevant to a determination of the primary 
object of the proposed voyage.
    (3) Samples. Each request for a ruling regarding the status of an 
article under any Customs or related law affecting the importation or 
arrival of that article should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, 
or other pictorial representations of the article and, whenever 
possible, by a sample article, unless a precise description of the 
article is not essential to the ruling requested. Any article consisting 
of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory 
analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a 
copy of that analysis. A sample submitted in connection with a request 
for a ruling becomes a part of the Customs Service file in the matter 
and will be retained until the ruling is issued or the ruling request is 
otherwise disposed of. If the

[[Page 292]]

return of the sample is desired, the ruling request should so state and 
should specify the desired means of return. A sample should only be 
submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged 
or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other 
actions undertaken in connection with the ruling request.
    (4) Related documents. If the question or questions presented in the 
ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, 
contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be 
submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted 
inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the ruling request 
become a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and cannot be 
returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and 
an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, 
must be expressly set forth in the ruling request.
    (5) Prior or current transactions. Each request for a ruling must 
state whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, 
the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, 
or is currently being considered by any Customs Service office or 
whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the 
issues involved have ever been considered, or are currently being 
considered, by the United States Court of International Trade, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of 
appeal therefrom. Where the transaction described in the ruling request 
is but one of a series of similar and related transactions, that fact 
must also be stated.
    (6) Statement of position. If the request for a ruling asks that a 
particular determination or conclusion be reached in the ruling letter, 
a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for 
that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all 
relevant supporting authority.
    (7) Privileged or confidential information. Information which is 
claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential 
commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions 
of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm 
to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of 
another interested party), must be identified clearly and the reasons 
such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, 
the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the 
competitive position of the person making the request (or of another 
interested party) must be set forth.
    (c) Signing; instructions as to reply. The request for a ruling must 
be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in 
Sec. 177.1(c). A ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may 
direct that the ruling letter be addressed to the other.
    (d) Requests for immediate consideration. The Customs Service will 
normally process requests for rulings in the order they are received and 
as expeditiously as possible. However, a request that a particular 
matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in 
writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and 
showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as 
the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special 
consideration made by telegram will be treated in the same manner as 
requests made by letter, but rulings will not ordinarily be issued by 
telegram. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular 
request for a ruling will be acted upon by the time requested. However, 
upon request and where a clear need is shown for such action, a collect 
telephone call will be made to advise that the ruling letter has been 
issued and is being mailed.

Sec. 177.3  Nonconforming requests for rulings.

    A person submitting a request for a ruling that does not comply with 
all of the provisions of this part will be so

[[Page 293]]

notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be 
pointed out. Except in the case of ruling requests submitted to Area or 
District offices, such person will be given a period of thirty (30) days 
from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may 
provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or 
otherwise conform the ruling request to the requirements referred to in 
the notice. The Customs Service file with respect to ruling requests 
which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this part 
within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and 
the request removed from active consideration until such time as the 
deficiencies cited in the notice are corrected. A request for a ruling 
that is removed from active consideration by reason of failing to comply 
with the provisions of this part may be treated as withdrawn. In the 
case of ruling requests made to Area or District offices, a failure to 
comply with the provisions of this part will result in the return of the 
ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies and such 
requests will not be considered as having been filed until such 
deficiencies are corrected.

<R05>
Sec. 177.4  Oral discussion of issues.

    (a) Generally. A person submitting a request for a ruling and 
desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved 
should indicate that desire in writing at the time the ruling request is 
filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of 
the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, 
a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or 
when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the 
ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the 
purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly 
discuss the matters set forth in the ruling request. Accordingly, the 
parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or 
agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless 
either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The 
conference will not conclude with the issuance of a ruling letter.
    (b) Time, place, and number of conferences. If a request for a 
conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of 
the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with 
respect to the matters set forth in a ruling request will be scheduled, 
unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling 
request is under consideration, additional conferences are necessary.
    (c) Representation. A person whose request for a conference has been 
granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other 
representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference 
in his place.
    (d) Additional information presented at conferences. It will be the 
responsibility of the person submitting the request for a ruling to 
provide for inclusion in the Customs Service file in the matter a 
written record setting forth any and all additional information, 
documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent 
that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the 
ruling request.

<R05>
Sec. 177.5  Change in status of transaction.

    Each person submitting a request for a ruling in connection with a 
Customs transaction shall immediately advise Customs in writing of any 
change in the status of that transaction, as defined in 
Sec. 177.1(d)(3). In particular, the Customs Service office to which the 
request was made must be advised when any transaction described in the 
ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction 
of a Customs Service field office. In addition, any person engaged in a 
Customs transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service 
field office and having previously requested a ruling with respect to 
that transaction shall advise the field office of that fact. The field 
office will normally withhold action with respect to any transaction for

[[Page 294]]

which a ruling has previously been requested pending the disposition of 
the ruling request.

<R05>
Sec. 177.6  Withdrawal of ruling requests.

    Any request for a ruling may be withdrawn by the person submitting 
it at any time before the issuance of a ruling letter or any other final 
disposition of the request. All correspondence, documents, and exhibits 
submitted in connection with the request will be retained in the Customs 
Service file and will not be returned. In addition, the Headquarters 
Office may forward to Customs Service field offices which have or may 
have jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling request 
relates, its views in regard to the transaction or the issues involved 
therein, as well as appropriate information derived from materials in 
the Customs Service file.

[T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80105, Dec. 3, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 177.7   Situations in which no ruling will be issued.

    (a) Generally. No ruling letter will be issued in response to a 
request for a ruling which fails to comply with the provisions of this 
part. Moreover, no ruling letter will be issued with regard to 
transactions or questions which are essentially hypothetical in nature 
or in any instance in which it appears contrary to the sound 
administration of the Customs and related laws to do so. No ruling 
letter will be issued in regard to a completed transaction.
    (b) Pending litigation in the United States Court of International 
Trade. No ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue which 
is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of 
appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other court will not preclude 
the issuance of a ruling letter, provided neither the Customs Service 
nor any of its officers or agents is named as a defendant.

[T.D. 75-186, 40 FR 31929, July 30, 1975, as amended by T.D. 85-90, 50 
FR 21430, May 24, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 177.8  Issuance of rulings.

    (a) Ruling letters--(1)  Generally. The Customs Service will 
endeavor to issue a ruling letter setting forth a determination with 
respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a 
request for such a ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions 
of this part and it is in the sound administration of the Customs and 
related laws to do so. Otherwise, a request for a ruling will be 
answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which 
general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter 
stating that no ruling can be issued.
    (2) Submission of ruling letters to field offices. Any person 
engaging in a Customs transaction with respect to which a binding tariff 
classification ruling letter (including pre-entry classification 
decisions) has been issued under this part shall ascertain that a copy 
of the ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the 
appropriate Customs Service office in connection with that transaction, 
or shall otherwise indicate with the information filed for that 
transaction that a ruling has been received. Any person receiving a 
ruling setting forth the tariff classification of merchandise shall set 
forth such classification in the documents or information filed in 
connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; the failure to 
do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such 
penalties as may be appropriate. A ruling received after the filing of 
such documents or information shall immediately be brought to the 
attention of the appropriate Customs Service field office.
    (3) Disclosure of ruling letters. The ruling letter shall be based 
on the information set forth in the ruling request. No part of the 
ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to 
the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to 
constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial 
information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), unless, as 
provided in Sec. 177.2(b)(7), the information claimed to be exempt from 
disclosure is clearly identified and the

[[Page 295]]

reasons for the exemption are set forth. Before the issuance of the 
ruling letter, the person submitting the ruling request, will be 
notified of any decision adverse to his claim for exemption from 
disclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working 
days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the ruling 
request. All ruling letters issued by the Customs Service will be 
available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any 
person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure 
deleted).
    (b) Other rulings. The Headquarters Office may from time to time 
issue other rulings with respect to issues or transactions described or 
suggested by requests for rulings submitted under the provisions of this 
part, or with respect to issues or transactions otherwise brought to its 
attention. These rulings, which are statements of the official position 
of the Customs Service which are likely to be of widespread interest and 
application, are published in the Customs Bulletin, as described in 
Sec. 177.10.

<R05>
Sec. 177.9  Effect of ruling letters; modification or revocation.

    (a) Effect of ruling letters generally. A ruling letter issued by 
the Customs Service under the provisions of this part represents the 
official position of the Customs Service with respect to the particular 
transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs 
Service personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section 
until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or 
other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the 
ruling set forth in the ruling letter, that principle may be cited as 
authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same 
circumstances. Generally, a ruling letter is effective on the date it is 
issued and may be applied to all entries which are unliquidated, or 
other transactions with respect to which the Customs Service has not 
taken final action on that date. See, however, paragraphs (d) and (e) 
(ruling letters which modify previous ruling letters or positions) and 
Sec. 177.10(e) (ruling letters published in the Customs Bulletin).
    (b) Application of rulings to transactions--(1) Generally. Each 
ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information 
furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the 
ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is 
accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of a 
ruling letter by a Customs Service field office to the transaction to 
which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the 
facts incorporated in the ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction 
described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any 
conditions on which the ruling was based. If, in the opinion of any 
Customs Service field office by whom the transaction is under 
consideration or review, the ruling letter should be modified or 
revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be 
forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as provided in 
Sec. 177.11(b)(1)(i), prior to any final disposition with respect to the 
transaction by that office. Otherwise, if the transaction described in 
the ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and 
all conditions set forth in the ruling letter have been satisfied, the 
ruling will be applied to the transaction.
    (2) Tariff classification rulings. Each ruling letter setting forth 
the proper classification of an article under the provisions of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will be applied only 
with respect to transactions involving articles identical to the sample 
submitted with the ruling request or to articles whose description is 
identical to the description set forth in the ruling letter.
    (3) Valuation rulings. Each ruling letter setting forth the proper 
valuation of an article under the provisions of section 402 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a), will be applied only 
with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and like 
facts.
    (4) Carrier rulings. Each ruling letter setting forth the 
applicability of the

[[Page 296]]

navigation laws to a vessel will be applied only with respect to 
transactions involving operations identical to those set forth in the 
ruling letter. Each ruling letter setting forth a determination as to 
whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage is coastwise 
transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 will be binding on the 
United States Customs Service with respect to any transaction identical 
to the facts and circumstances described in the ruling request and 
undertaken in reliance on the ruling letter.
    (c) Reliance on ruling letters by others. A ruling letter is subject 
to modification or revocation without notice to any person, except the 
person to whom the letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person 
should rely on the ruling letter or assume that the principles of that 
ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the 
one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request a 
ruling under Sec. 177.1(c) may request information as to whether a 
previously-issued ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing 
the Commissioner of Customs, Attention: Office of Regulations and 
Rulings, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the ruling 
letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the ruling 
letter in question to be identified.
    (d) Modification or revocation of ruling letters--(1) Generally. Any 
ruling letter found to be in error or not in accordance with the current 
views of the Customs Service may be modified or revoked. Modification or 
revocation of a ruling letter shall be effected by Customs Headquarters 
by giving notice to the person to whom the ruling letter was addressed 
and, where circumstances warrant, by the publication of a notice or 
other statement in the Customs Bulletin.
    (2) Effect of modification or revocation of ruling letters. The 
modification or revocation of a ruling letter will not be applied 
retroactively with respect to the person to whom the ruling was issued, 
or to any person directly involved in the transaction to which that 
ruling related, Provided:
    (i) The request for a ruling contained no misstatement or omission 
of material facts,
    (ii) The facts subsequently developed are not materially different 
from the facts on which the ruling was based,
    (iii) There has been no change in the applicable law,
    (iv) The ruling was originally issued with respect to a prospective 
transaction, and
    (v) All of the parties involved in the transaction acted in good 
faith in reliance upon the ruling and retroactive modification or 
revocation would be to their detriment.

Nothing in this paragraph will prohibit the retroactive modification or 
revocation of a ruling with respect to a transaction which was not 
prospective at the time the ruling was issued, inasmuch as such a 
transaction was not entered into in reliance on a ruling from the 
Customs Service.

    (3) Effective dates. Generally, a ruling letter modifying or 
revoking an earlier ruling letter will be effective on the date it is 
issued. However, the Customs Service may, upon application or on its own 
initiative, delay the effective date of such a ruling for a period of up 
to 90 days from the date of issuance. Such a delay may be granted with 
respect to the party to whom the ruling letter was issued or to any 
other party, provided such party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Customs Service that they reasonably relied on the earlier ruling to 
their detriment. All parties applying for a delay will be issued a 
separate ruling letter setting forth the period, if any, of the delay to 
be provided. In appropriate circumstances, the Customs Service may 
decide to make its decision, with respect to a delay, applicable to all 
affected parties, irrespective of demonstrated reliance; in this event, 
a notice announcing the delay will be published in the Customs Bulletin 
and individual ruling letters will not be issued.
    (e) Ruling letters modifying past Customs treatment of transactions 
not covered by ruling letters--(1) General. The Customs Service will 
from time to time issue a ruling letter covering a transaction or issue 
not previously the subject of a ruling letter and which has the effect 
of modifying the treatment previously accorded by the Customs

[[Page 297]]

Service to substantially identical transactions of either the recipient 
of the ruling letter or other parties. Although such a ruling letter 
will generally be effective on the date it is issued, the Customs 
Service may, upon application by an affected party, delay the effective 
date of the ruling letter, and continue the treatment previously 
accorded the substantially identical transaction, for a period of up to 
90 days from the date the ruling letter is issued.
    (2) Applications by affected parties. In applying to the Customs 
Service for a delay in the effective date of a ruling letter described 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an affected party must demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the Customs Service that the treatment previously 
accorded by Customs to the substantially identical transactions was 
sufficiently consistent and continuous that such party reasonably relied 
thereon in arranging for future transactions. The evidence of past 
treatment by the Customs Service shall cover the 2-year period 
immediately prior to the date of the ruling letter, listing all 
substantially identical transactions by entry number (or other Customs 
assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each 
such transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, and the dates 
of final action by the Customs Service. The evidence of reliance shall 
include contracts, purchase orders, or other materials tending to 
establish that the future transactions were arranged based on the 
treatment previously accorded by the Customs Service.
    (3) Decision by Customs to grant delay. The Customs Service will 
examine all factors relevant to the issue of reliance in determining 
whether, and for what period, to delay the effective date of a ruling 
letter described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. In particular, the 
Customs Service will examine the past transactions on which reliance is 
claimed to determine whether there was an examination of the merchandise 
(where applicable) by the Customs Service or the extent to which those 
transactions were otherwise examined and analyzed by the Customs Service 
to determine the proper application of the Customs laws and regulations. 
In general, transactions involving small quantities or values, as well 
as informal entries and other entries or transactions which the Customs 
Service, in the interest of commercial facilitation and accommodation, 
processes expeditiously and without examination and/or import specialist 
review, will be given diminished weight in establishing the required 
history of consistent and continuous Customs treatment. Unless a notice 
covering all affected parties is published in the Customs Bulletin, each 
affected party applying for a delay in the effective date of the ruling 
letter will be advised in a separate ruling letter of the extent to 
which a delay in the effective date will be applied to their 
transactions.

Sec. 177.10  Publication of decisions.

    (a) Generally. Within 120 days after issuing any precedential 
decision under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, relating to any 
Customs transaction (prospective, current, or completed), the Customs 
Service shall publish the decision in the Customs Bulletin or otherwise 
make it available for public inspection. For purposes of this paragraph 
a precedential decision includes any ruling letter, internal advice 
memorandum, or protest review decision. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR 
part 1, 19 CFR part 103, and 19 CFR 177.8(a)(3).
    (b) Rulings regarding a rate of duty or charge. Any ruling regarding 
a rate of duty or charge which is published in the Customs Bulletin will 
establish a uniform practice. A published ruling may result in a change 
of practice, it may limit the application of a court decision, it may 
otherwise modify an earlier ruling with respect to the classification or 
valuation of an article or any other action found to be in error or no 
longer in accordance with the current views of the Customs Service, or 
it may revoke a previously-published ruling or a previously-issued 
ruling letter.
    (c) Changes of practice or position. (1) Before the publication of a 
ruling

[[Page 298]]

which has the effect of changing a practice and which results in the 
assessment of a higher rate of duty, notice that the practice (or prior 
ruling on which the practice is based) is under review will be published 
in the Federal Register and interested parties given an opportunity to 
make written submissions with respect to the correctness of the 
contemplated change. This procedure will also be followed when the 
contemplated change of practice will result in the assessment of a lower 
rate of duty and the Headquarters Office determines that the matter is 
of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic industry. 
No advance notice will be provided with respect to rulings which result 
in a change of practice but no change in the rate of duty.
    (2) Before the publication of a ruling which has the effect of 
changing a position of the Customs Service and which results in a 
restriction or prohibition, notice that the position (or prior ruling on 
which the position is based) is under review will be published in the 
Federal Register and interested parties given an opportunity to make 
written submissions with respect to the correctness of the contemplated 
change. This procedure will also be followed when the change of position 
will result in a holding that an activity is not restricted or 
prohibited and the Headquarters Office determines that the matter is of 
sufficient importance to involve the interests of the general public.
    (d) Limiting rulings. A published ruling may limit the application 
of a court decision to the specific article under litigation, or to an 
article of a specific class or kind of such merchandise, or to the 
particular circumstances or entries which were the subject of the 
litigation.
    (e) Effective dates. Except as otherwise provided for in the ruling 
itself, all rulings published under the provisions of this part shall be 
applied immediately. If the ruling involves merchandise, it will be 
applicable to all unliquidated entries, except that a change of practice 
resulting in the assessment of a higher rate of duty or increased duties 
shall be effective only as to merchandise entered for consumption or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the 90th day after 
publication of the change in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 177.11   Requests for advice by field offices.

    (a) Generally. Advice or guidance as to the interpretation or proper 
application of the Customs and related laws with respect to a specific 
Customs transaction may be requested by Customs Service field offices 
from the Headquarters Office at any time, whether the transaction is 
prospective, current, or completed. Advice as to the proper application 
of the Customs and related laws to a current transaction will be sought 
by a Customs Service field office whenever that office is requested to 
do so, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, by an importer or 
other person having an interest in the transaction. Advice or guidance 
will be furnished by the Headquarters Office as a means of assisting 
Customs personnel in the orderly processing of Customs transactions 
under consideration by them and to insure the consistent application of 
the Customs and related laws in the several Customs districts. Requests 
for advice received by the Headquarters Office will be processed as 
expeditiously as possible.
    (b) Certain current transactions--(1) When a ruling has been issued. 
--(i) Requests by field offices. If any Customs Service office has 
issued a ruling letter with respect to a particular Customs transaction 
and the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over that 
transaction believes that the ruling should be modified or revoked, the 
field office will forward to the Headquarters Office, pursuant to 
Sec. 177.9(b)(1), a request that the ruling be reconsidered. The field 
office will notify the importer or other person to whom the ruling 
letter was issued, in writing, that it has requested the Headquarters 
Office to reconsider the ruling.
    (ii) Requests by importers and others. If the importer or other 
person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the Customs 
Service field office having

[[Page 299]]

jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling relates as to the 
proper application of the ruling to the transaction, the field office 
will, upon receipt of a written request submitted in accordance with the 
procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, request advice 
from the Headquarters Office as to the proper application of the ruling 
to the transaction. Such advice may not be requested for the purpose of 
seeking reconsideration of a ruling with which the importer or other 
person to whom the ruling letter was issued disagrees.
    (2) When no ruling has been issued. Internal advice will be sought 
by a Customs Service field office with respect to a current transaction 
for which no ruling was requested or issued under the provisions of this 
part whenever a difference of opinion exists as to the interpretation or 
proper application of the Customs and related laws to the transaction, 
and the field office is requested to seek such advice by an importer or 
other person who would have been entitled, under Sec. 177.1(c), to 
request a ruling with respect to the transaction, while prospective. The 
request must be submitted to the field office in writing and in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (3) Form of request by importers and others. An importer or other 
person requesting that a Customs Service field office seek advice from 
the Headquarters Office must make such a request, in writing, to the 
field office having jurisdiction over the transaction in question. The 
request shall contain a complete statement setting forth a description 
of the transaction, the specific questions presented, the applicable 
law, and an argument for the conclusions advocated. The statement must 
also specify whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the 
statement, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been 
considered, or is currently being considered, by any Customs Service 
office. In addition, the statement should indicate at which port or 
ports of entry identical or substantially identical merchandise has been 
entered.
    (4) Review of requests by importers and others. All requests 
submitted by importers and other persons under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, will be reviewed by the field office to which they are 
submitted. In the event a difference of opinion exists as to the 
description of the transaction or as to the point or points at issue, 
the person submitting the request will be so advised in writing. If 
agreement cannot be reached, both the statements of the person 
submitting the request and the field office will be forwarded to the 
Headquarters Office for consideration.
    (5) Refusal by Headquarters Office to furnish advice. The 
Headquarters Office may refuse to consider the questions presented to it 
in the form of a request for internal advice whenever (i) the 
Headquarters Office determines that the period of time necessary to give 
adequate consideration to the questions presented would result in a 
withholding of action with respect to the transaction, or in any other 
situation, that is inconsistent with the sound administration of the 
Customs and related laws, and (ii) the questions presented can 
subsequently be raised by the importer or other interested party in the 
form of a protest filed in accordance with the provisions of part 174 of 
this chapter.
    (6) Effect of advice received from the Headquarters Office. Advice 
furnished by the Headquarters Office in response to a request therefor 
represents the official position of the Customs Service as to the 
application of the Customs laws to the facts of a specific transaction. 
If the field office believes that the advice furnished by the 
Headquarters Office should be reconsidered, it shall promptly request 
such reconsideration. Otherwise, the advice furnished by the 
Headquarters Office will be applied by the field office in its 
disposition of the Customs transaction in question.
    (7) Publication. Within 120 days after issuing an internal advice 
memorandum, the Customs Service shall publish the decision in the 
Customs Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. 
Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1 and 19 CFR part 103.
    (8) Judicial review of importers' requests. A refusal by the 
Headquarters Office to consider the questions raised by an importer in 
the form of a request

[[Page 300]]

for internal advice may be appealed to the Court of International Trade 
if the importer demonstrates to the Court that he would be irreparably 
harmed unless given an opportunity to obtain judicial review prior to 
the importation of the merchandise.

Sec. 177.12  Inconsistent customs decisions.

    (a) Generally. Certain decisions made by Customs officials at one 
field location which are inconsistent with decisions being made by 
Customs officials at another location may be brought to the attention of 
Customs Headquarters for resolution by a petition filed by an interested 
party. The types of decisions which may be the subject of such a 
petition, a description of the parties who qualify as interested 
parties, and the period of time in which the petition may be filed are 
set forth below.
    (1) Inconsistent decisions subject to petition. The decisions which 
may be the subject of a petition include:
    (i) Decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)), made with respect to the same, or 
substantially similar, merchandise; and
    (ii) Repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or 
examinations of merchandise at ports of entry.
    (2) Interested Parties. The following parties shall be considered 
interested parties entitled to file a petition under this section:
    (i) Parties described in section 514(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(c)(1)), as eligible to file a protest 
under section 514;
    (ii) A port authority; and
    (iii) An ``interested party,'' as described in section 516(a)(2) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516(a)(2)).
    (3) Time for filing. In the case of decisions described in section 
514(a) of the Tariff Act, the petition must be filed within the time 
prescribed by section 514(c)(2), for filing a protest with respect to 
the later (or latest) of the decisions which are the subject of the 
petition. In the case of repeated decisions to conduct intensified 
inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry, the 
petition must be filed within ninety (90) days of the later (or latest) 
such decision.
    (b) Petition--(1) Form. The petition shall be in the form of a 
letter addressed to the Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs 
Service, Washington, DC 20229-0001. Three copies of the petition should 
be submitted, if possible.
    (2) Content. The petition should contain a complete description of 
the inconsistent decisions complained of, including the ports of entry 
(or other Customs office) where the decisions were made, entry numbers, 
and the dates (or approximate dates) such decisions were made. The 
information set forth in the petition must be sufficient to demonstrate 
the inconsistency of the decisions described and that the merchandise, 
or circumstances in which the allegedly inconsistent decisions were 
made, were substantially similar. In the case of repeated decisions 
regarding the inspection or examination of merchandise, the decisions 
must be sufficient in number to demonstrate a pattern of inconsistency 
not attributable to random selection. Any information which the 
petitioner considers to be confidential business information should be 
so noted pursuant to Sec. 177.2(b)(7) of this subpart and a sanitized 
version of his petition should be submitted as well as the three copies 
requested in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Petitions which do not 
contain information sufficient to permit the Customs Service to verify 
that the decisions described have occurred will not be considered 
properly filed and will be returned to the petitioner for additional 
information. Only one petition will be accepted by the Customs Service 
with respect to the decisions alleged to be inconsistent.
    (i) Tariff classification decision. In the case of decisions 
involving the tariff classification of merchandise, the petition should 
also include, with respect to each of the decisions described, the 
information requested in Sec. 177.2 (b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii) of this 
subpart, including a sample (see Sec. 177.2(b)(3)).

[[Page 301]]

    (ii) Other subjects addressable by administrative rulings. In the 
case of other decisions involving subjects which could be addressed 
under the administrative rulings procedure provided for in Secs. 177.1 
through 177.10 of this subpart, the information contained in Sec. 177.2 
(b)(1), (b)(2)(iii) and/or (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, should be also 
furnished for each of the decisions addressed by the petition.
    (c) Publication and public comment. Upon receipt of a properly filed 
petition, notice will be published in the Federal Register announcing 
the receipt of the petition and describing the decisions alleged to be 
inconsistent. Public comment on the petition will be permitted for a 
period of fifteen (15) days after publication. Public comment regarding 
the proper disposition of the petition shall be limited to that 
submitted in writing, either with the petition or in response to the 
Federal Register solicitation of public comment.
    (d) Determination of petition; distribution and publication. Within 
fifteen (15) days after the close of the period for public comment 
referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, the Customs Service will 
issue a decision to the petitioner addressing the inconsistency 
complained of. That decision will either conform the inconsistent 
decisions to the current views of the Customs Service as to the proper 
tariff classification or other disposition of the subject of those 
decisions or explain why no inconsistency exists. Copies of the 
decisions to the petitioner will be transmitted directly to all ports 
(or other Customs offices) identified in the petition and will be 
distributed through the Customs Information Exchange or by other means 
to such other ports or offices as may be necessary to correct any 
inconsistency identified. A summary of the decision will also be 
published in the Federal Register and the weekly Customs Bulletin.
    (e) Effective date. Unless otherwise specified in the decision, a 
decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section will 
be effective immediately and, where applicable, applied to all entries 
for which liquidation is not final.
    (f) Effect on other procedures. The filing of a petition under this 
procedure shall not preclude the petitioner or any other person entitled 
to do so from filing a protest or a domestic interested party petition 
regarding the same matter under the procedures set forth in sections 
514, 515 and 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended and parts 174 and 
175 of this chapter, provided the applicable requirements set forth 
therein are complied with. However, the decision issued in response to 
the petition may serve as the basis for the disposition of any protest 
so filed, or as an information letter setting forth the position of the 
Customs Service pursuant to subpart A of part 175 of this chapter. The 
decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section is 
not itself a decision subject to protest under sections 514-515 of the 
Tariff Act and part 174 of this chapter.

   Subpart B--Government Procurement; Country-of-Origin Determinations

    Authority: R.S. 251, as amended (19 U.S.C. 66), sec. 624, 46 Stat. 
759 (19 U.S.C. 1624); Pub. L. 96-39, 93 Stat. 144.

    Source: T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 177.21  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to the issuance of country-of-origin advisory 
rulings and final determinations relating to Government procurement 
under Title III, ``Trade Agreements Act of 1979,'' Pub. L. 96-39, 93 
Stat. 144, for the purpose of granting waivers of certain ``Buy 
American'' restrictions in U.S. law or practice for products for 
eligible countries. This subpart is intended to be applied consistent 
with the Federal Procurement Regulations (41 CFR part 1-6) and the 
Defense Acquisition Regulation (32 CFR section VI).


<R05>
Sec. 177.22  Definitions.

    (a) Country of origin. For the purpose of this subpart, an article 
is a product of a country or instrumentality only if (1) it is wholly 
the growth, product, or manufacture of that country or instrumentality, 
or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part

[[Page 302]]

of materials from another country or instrumentality, it has been 
substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce 
with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or 
articles from which it was so transformed. The term ``instrumentality'' 
shall not be construed to include any agency or division of the 
government of a country, but may be construed to include such 
arrangements as the European Economic Community.
    (b) Advisory ruling. An advisory ruling is a non-binding, non-
reviewable written statement issued by the Director, Commercial Rulings 
Division, Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service, which does no more than 
call attention to a well established interpretation or principal of law 
relating to the country of origin, without applying it to a particular 
set of facts. Customs will issue an advisory ruling in response to a 
request for a final determination if:
    (1) The request suggests that general information, rather than a 
final determination, is actually being sought,
    (2) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 177.25(a), or
    (3) The ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and 
Customs believes that the general information supplied by an advisory 
ruling may be of some benefit to the party making the request. An 
advisory ruling is not a ruling issued prior to importation under 28 
U.S.C. 1581(h).
    (c) Final determination. A final determination is a binding 
judicially reviewable statement issued by the Assistant Commissioner, 
Office of Regulations and Rulings, Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service, 
in response to a written request submitted under the provisions of this 
subpart that interprets and applies the provisions of law and regulation 
relating to the country of origin to a specific set of facts. A final 
determination may be issued to a party-at-interest prior to actual entry 
of the merchandise.
    (d) Party-at-interest. For purposes of this subpart the term party-
at-interest means:
    (1) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or a United 
States importer of merchandise which is the subject of a final 
determination under this subpart,
    (2) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of 
a like product,
    (3) United States members of a labor organization or other 
association of workers whose members are employed in the manufacture, 
production, or wholesale in the United States of a like product, and
    (4) A trade or business association a majority of whose members 
manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States.

[T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 
46115, Sept. 10, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 177.23  Who may request a country-of-origin advisory ruling or final determination.

    A country-of-origin advisory ruling or final determination may be 
requested by:
    (a) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or a United 
States importer of merchandise,
    (b) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of 
a like product,
    (c) United States members of a labor organization or other 
association of workers whose members are employed in the manufacture, 
production, or wholesale in the United States of a like product, or
    (d) A trade or business association a majority of whose members 
manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 177.24  By whom request is filed.

    A request may be filed by an individual or organization listed in 
Sec. 177.23 or by a duly authorized attorney or agent on behalf of the 
individual or organization. A request filed by a corporation shall be 
signed by a corporate officer, and a request filed by a partnership 
shall be signed by a partner.


<R05>
Sec. 177.25  Form and content of request.

    (a) A request for an advisory ruling shall be in writing and shall 
contain such information as will enable Customs to provide the requester 
with the

[[Page 303]]

applicable principle of law or well established interpretation relating 
to the particular country of origin.
    (b) A request for a final determination shall be in writing and 
shall contain the following information:
    (1) The name of the requester, the requester's principal place of 
business, and a statement that the requester is authorized to file the 
request under the provisions of Sec. 177.24;
    (2) A description of the existing article for which a country-of-
origin determination is requested;
    (3) The country or instrumentality an article is claimed to be the 
product of;
    (4) Such further information as will enable Customs to determine if 
an article is a product of a specific country or instrumentality, and;
    (5) If applicable, the specific procurement for which the final 
determination is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 177.26  Where request filed.

    The request shall be filed with the Director, Office of Regulations 
and Rulings, Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229.


<R05>
Sec. 177.27  Oral discussion of issues.

    Any party authorized to request a ruling under the provisions of 
Sec. 177.23 may request an opportunity for oral discussion of the issues 
presented in the request. The oral discussion of issues will be governed 
by the provisions of Sec. 177.4.


<R05>
Sec. 177.28  Issuance of advisory rulings and final determinations.

    (a) Pursuant to a request for an advisory ruling which meets the 
requirements of this subpart, Customs will promptly issue an advisory 
ruling.
    (b) Pursuant to a request for a final determination which meets the 
requirements of this subpart, Customs will promptly issue a final 
determination. If the request does not meet the requirements of this 
subpart Customs may decline to issue a final determination or may issue 
instead an advisory ruling.
    (c) Requests for final determinations which include the information 
set forth in Sec. 177.25(b)(5) (relating to a specific procurement) will 
be considered by Customs before all other requests (advisory rulings and 
final determinations).


<R05>
Sec. 177.29  Publication of notice of final determinations.

    Notice of all final determinations shall be published in the Federal 
Register within 60 days of the date the final determination is issued.


<R05>
Sec. 177.30  Review of final determinations.

    Any party-at-interest listed in Sec. 177.22(d) may seek judicial 
review of a final determination within 30 days after publication of such 
determination in the Federal Register, and may seek judicial review of a 
refusal to issue a final determination within 30 days after such 
refusal. The Court of International Trade shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to review a final determination or a refusal to issue a 
final determination made under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 177.31  Reexamination of final determinations.

    A party-at-interest, other than the party-at-interest which 
requested and received the initial final determination, may ask Customs 
to consider the matter anew and issue, on an expedited basis, a new 
final determination. Such a request shall specifically identify the 
previous final determination. Upon receipt of such a request, Customs 
will issue a new final determination within five working days of receipt 
of the request unless (a) the previous final determination was the 
subject of a contested lawsuit timely filed in the Court of 
International Trade under 28 U.S.C. 1581(e) or, (b) the merchandise at 
issue in the initial final determination was tendered and deemed 
responsive to the request for proposals or an invitation for bids in a 
competitive procurement subject to the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a 
et seq.) and a contract under such procurement was let. Any new final 
determination issued under this section shall be published in accordance 
with Sec. 177.29 and is reviewable under Sec. 177.30.

                     Subpart B--Export Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 181.11  Certificate of Origin.

     (a) General. A Certificate of Origin shall be employed to certify 
that a good being exported either from the United States into Canada or 
Mexico or from Canada or Mexico into the United States qualifies as an 
originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under the 
NAFTA.
     (b) Preparation of Certificate in the United States. An exporter in 
the United States who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin for 
the purpose set forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall use Customs 
Form 434 or such other medium or format as approved by the Canadian or 
Mexican customs administration for that purpose. Where the U.S. exporter 
is not the producer of the good, that exporter may complete and sign a 
Certificate on the basis of:
     (1) Its knowledge of whether the good qualifies as an originating 
good;
     (2) Its reasonable reliance on the producer's written 
representation that the good qualifies as an originating good; or
    (3) A completed and signed Certificate for the good voluntarily 
provided to the exporter by the producer.
     (c) Submission of Certificate to Customs. An exporter in the United 
States, and a producer in the United States who has voluntarily provided 
a copy of a Certificate of Origin to that exporter pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, shall provide a copy of the Certificate to 
Customs upon request.
     (d) Notification of errors in Certificate. An exporter or producer 
in the United States who has completed and signed a Certificate of 
Origin, and who has reason to believe that the Certificate contains 
information that is not correct, shall within 30 calendar days after the 
date of discovery of the error notify in writing all persons to whom the 
Certificate was given by the exporter or producer of any change that 
could affect the accuracy or validity of the Certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 181.12  Maintenance and availability of records.

     (a) Maintenance of records--(1) General. An exporter or producer in 
the United States who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin shall 
maintain in the United States, for five years after the date on which 
the Certificate was signed, all records relating to the origin of a good 
for which preferential tariff treatment may be claimed in Canada or 
Mexico, including records associated with:
     (i) The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, the good 
that is exported from the United States;

[[Page 310]]

     (ii) The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all 
materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the 
good that is exported from the United States; and
     (iii) The production of the good in the form in which the good is 
exported from the United States.
     (2) Method of maintenance. The records referred to in paragraph (a) 
of this section shall be maintained in accordance with the Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the United States and may be 
maintained in hard-copy form, on microfilm or microfiche or in automated 
record storage devices (for example, magnetic discs and tapes) if 
associated computer programs are available to facilitate retrieval of 
the data in a usable form.
     (b) Availability of records--(1) To Customs. For purposes of 
determining compliance with the provisions of this part, the records 
required to be maintained under this section shall be made available for 
examination and inspection by the port director or other appropriate 
Customs officer in the same manner as provided in Sec. 162.1d of this 
chapter in the case of U.S. importer records.
     (2) To the Canadian or Mexican customs administration. If a U.S. 
exporter or producer receives notification of, and consents to, an 
origin verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs 
administration under Article 506 of the NAFTA (see Sec. 181.74(e) of 
this part), such consent shall constitute agreement by the U.S. exporter 
or producer to make available to an officer of that customs 
administration all records required to be maintained under this section 
and to provide facilities for the inspection thereof. If, during the 
course of an origin verification of a U.S. producer, the Canadian or 
Mexican customs administration finds that the U.S. producer has failed 
to maintain its records in accordance with the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles applied in the United States, that customs 
administration will so inform the U.S. producer in writing and will give 
the U.S. producer 60 calendar days to conform the records to those 
Principles. If a U.S. exporter or producer fails to maintain records or 
make records available to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration 
in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if a U.S. producer 
fails to conform its records to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
as provided in this paragraph, the Canadian or Mexican customs 
administration may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that 
is the subject of the verification visit.


<R05>
Sec. 181.13  Failure to comply with requirements.

     The port director may apply such measures as the circumstances may 
warrant where an exporter or a producer in the United States fails to 
comply with any requirement of this part.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Import Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 181.21  Filing of claim for preferential tariff treatment upon importation.

     (a) Declaration. In connection with a claim for preferential tariff 
treatment for a good under the NAFTA, the U.S. importer shall make a 
written declaration that the good qualifies for such treatment. The 
written declaration may be made by including on the entry summary, or 
equivalent documentation, the symbol ``CA'' for a good of Canada, or the 
symbol ``MX'' for a good of Mexico, as a prefix to the subheading of the 
HTSUS under which each qualifying good is classified. Except as 
otherwise provided in Sec. 181.22 of this part and except in the case of 
a good to which appendix 6.B. to Annex 300-B of the NAFTA applies (see, 
however, Sec. 12.132 of this chapter), the declaration shall be based on 
a complete and properly executed original Certificate of Origin, or copy 
thereof, which is in the possession of the importer and which covers the 
good being imported.
     (b) Corrected declaration. If, after making the declaration 
required under paragraph (a) of this section or under Sec. 181.32(b)(2) 
of this part, the U.S. importer has reason to believe that a Certificate 
of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is 
not correct, the importer shall within 30 calendar days after the date 
of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any 
duties that may be due. A corrected declaration shall be effected by 
submission of a letter or other written statement to

[[Page 311]]

the Customs office where the original declaration was filed.


<R05>
Sec. 181.22  Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.

     (a) Maintenance of records. Each importer claiming preferential 
tariff treatment for a good imported into the United States shall 
maintain in the United States, for five years after the date of entry of 
the good, all documentation relating to the importation of the good. 
Such documentation shall include a copy of the Certificate of Origin and 
any other relevant records as specified in Sec. 162.1a(a) of this 
chapter.
     (b) Submission of Certificate. An importer who claims preferential 
tariff treatment on a good under Sec. 181.21 of this part shall provide, 
at the request of the port director, a copy of each Certificate of 
Origin pertaining to the good which is in the possession of the 
importer. A Certificate of Origin submitted to Customs under this 
paragraph or under Sec. 181.32(b)(3) of this part:
     (1) Shall be on Customs Form 434, including privately-printed 
copies thereof, or on such other form as approved by the Canadian or 
Mexican customs administration, or, as an alternative to Customs Form 
434 or such other approved form, in an approved computerized format or 
such other medium or format as is approved by the Office of Field 
Operations, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229. An alternative 
format must contain the same information and certification set forth on 
Customs Form 434;
     (2) Shall be signed by the exporter or by the exporter's authorized 
agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
     (3) Shall be completed either in the English language or in the 
language of the country from which the good is exported. If the 
Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer 
shall also provide to the port director, upon request, a written English 
translation thereof;
     (4) Shall be accepted by Customs for four years after the date on 
which the Certificate was signed by the exporter or producer; and
    (5) May be applicable to:
    (i) A single importation of a good into the United States, including 
a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and 
a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
    (ii) Multiple importations of identical goods into the United States 
that occur within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months, set out 
therein by the exporter or producer.
    (c) Acceptance of Certificate. A Certificate of Origin shall be 
accepted by the port director as valid for the purpose set forth in 
Sec. 181.11(a) of this part, provided that the Certificate is completed, 
signed and dated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section. If the port director determines that a Certificate is 
illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section, the importer shall be given a period of 
not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. 
Acceptance of a Certificate will result in the granting of preferential 
tariff treatment to the imported good unless, in connection with an 
origin verification initiated under subpart G of this part or based on a 
pattern of conduct within the meaning of Sec. 181.76(c) of this part, 
the port director determines that the imported good does not qualify as 
an originating good or should not be accorded such treatment for any 
other reason as specifically provided for elsewhere in this part. A 
Certificate shall not be accepted in connection with subsequent 
importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section if, based on an origin verification under subpart G of this 
part, the port director determined that a previously imported identical 
good covered by the Certificate did not qualify as an originating good.
    (d) Certificate not required--(1) General. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer shall not be 
required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
    (i) An importation of a good for which the port director has in 
writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the 
port director is otherwise satisfied that the good qualifies for 
preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA;

[[Page 312]]

    (ii) A non-commercial importation of a good; or
    (iii) A commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed 
US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the port director, the 
producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or 
attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the 
following signed statement:

    I hereby certify that the good covered by this shipment qualifies as 
an originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under 
the NAFTA.

    (2) Exception. If the port director determines that an importation 
described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of 
importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken 
or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a certification requirement set 
forth in this part, the port director shall notify the importer in 
writing that for that importation the importer must have in his 
possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for 
preferential tariff treatment. The importer shall have 30 calendar days 
from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate, and a 
failure to timely obtain the Certificate will result in denial of the 
claim for preferential tariff treatment. For purposes of paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, a ``series of importations'' means two or more 
entries covering goods arriving on the same day from the same exporter 
and consigned to the same person.


<R05>
Sec. 181.23  Effect of noncompliance; failure to provide documentation regarding transshipment.

    (a) Effect of noncompliance. If the importer fails to comply with 
any requirement under this part, including submission of a Certificate 
of Origin under Sec. 181.22(b) or submission of a corrected Certificate 
under Sec. 181.22(c), the port director may deny preferential tariff 
treatment to the imported good.
    (b) Failure to provide documentation regarding transshipment. Where 
the requirements for preferential tariff treatment set forth elsewhere 
in this part are met, the port director nevertheless may deny 
preferential tariff treatment to an originating good if the good is 
shipped through or transshipped in a country other than the United 
States, Canada or Mexico and the importer of the good does not provide, 
at the request of the port director, copies of the customs control 
documents that indicate to the satisfaction of the port director that 
the good remained under customs control while in such other country.


<R04>
             Subpart D--Post-Importation Duty Refund Claims


<R05>
Sec. 181.31  Right to make post-importation claim and refund duties.

    Notwithstanding any other available remedy, including the right to 
amend an entry so long as liquidation of the entry has not become final, 
where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was 
imported into the United States but no claim for preferential tariff 
treatment on that originating good was made at that time under 
Sec. 181.21(a) of this part, the importer of that good may file a claim 
for a refund of any excess duties at any time within one year after the 
date of importation of the good in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in Sec. 181.32 of this part. Subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 181.23 of this part, Customs may refund any excess duties by 
liquidation or reliquidation of the entry covering the good in 
accordance with Sec. 181.33(c) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 181.32  Filing procedures.

    (a) Place of filing. A post-importation claim for a refund under 
Sec. 181.31 of this part shall be filed with the director of the port at 
which the entry covering the good was filed.

[[Page 313]]

    (b) Contents of claim. A post-importation claim for a refund shall 
be filed by presentation of the following:
    (1) A written declaration stating that the good qualified as an 
originating good at the time of importation and setting forth the number 
and date of the entry covering the good;
    (2) Subject to Sec. 181.22(d) of this part, a copy of each 
Certificate of Origin (see Sec. 181.11 of this part) pertaining to the 
good;
    (3) A written statement indicating whether or not the importer of 
the good provided a copy of the entry summary or equivalent 
documentation to any other person. If such documentation was so 
provided, the statement shall identify each recipient by name, Customs 
identification number and address and shall specify the date on which 
the documentation was provided;
    (4) A written statement indicating whether or not the importer of 
the good is aware of any claim for refund, waiver or reduction of duties 
relating to the good within the meaning of Article 303 of the NAFTA (see 
subpart E of this part). If the importer is aware of any such claim, the 
statement shall identify each claim by number and date and shall 
identify the person who made the claim by name, Customs identification 
number and address; and
    (5) A written statement indicating whether or not any person has 
filed a protest or a petition or request for reliquidation relating to 
the good under any provision of law, and if any such protest or petition 
or request for reliquidation has been filed, the statement shall 
identify the protest, petition or request by number and date.


<R05>
Sec. 181.33  Customs processing procedures.

    (a) Status determination. After receipt of a post-importation claim 
under Sec. 181.32 of this part, the port director shall determine 
whether the entry covering the good has been liquidated and, if 
liquidation has taken place, whether the liquidation has become final.
    (b) Pending protest, petition or request for reliquidation or 
judicial review. If the port director determines that any protest or any 
petition or request for reliquidation relating to the good has not been 
finally decided, the port director shall suspend action on the claim 
filed under this subpart until the decision on the protest, petition or 
request becomes final. If a summons involving the tariff classification 
or dutiability of the good is filed in the Court of International Trade, 
the port director shall suspend action on the claim filed under this 
subpart until judicial review has been completed.
    (c) Allowance of claim.--(1) Unliquidated entry. If the port 
director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart 
should be allowed and the entry covering the good has not been 
liquidated, the port director shall take into account the claim for 
refund under this subpart in connection with the liquidation of the 
entry.
    (2) Liquidated entry. If the port director determines that a claim 
for a refund filed under this subpart should be allowed and the entry 
covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation 
has become final, the entry must be reliquidated in order to effect a 
refund of duties pursuant to this subpart. If the entry is otherwise to 
be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest or petition 
for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, the port director 
shall reliquidate the entry taking into account the claim for refund 
under this subpart.
    (3) Information to be provided to Canada or Mexico. If any 
information is provided to Customs pursuant to Sec. 181.32(b) (4) or (5) 
of this part, that information, together with notice of the allowance of 
the claim and the amount of duty refunded pursuant to this subpart, 
shall be provided by the port director to the customs administration of 
the country from which the good was exported.
    (d) Denial of claim--(1) General. The port director may deny a claim 
for a refund filed under this subpart if the claim was not filed timely, 
if the importer has not complied with the requirements of this subpart, 
if the Certificate of Origin submitted under Sec. 181.32(b)(3) of this 
part cannot be accepted as valid (see Sec. 181.22(c) of this part), or 
if, following initiation of an origin verification under Sec. 181.72(a) 
of this part, the port director determines either that the imported good 
did not

[[Page 314]]

qualify as an originating good at the time of importation or that a 
basis exists upon which preferential tariff treatment may be denied 
under Sec. 181.72(d), Sec. 181.74(c) or Sec. 181.76(c) of this part.
    (2) Unliquidated entry. If the port director determines that a claim 
for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry 
covering the good has not been liquidated, the port director shall deny 
the claim in connection with the liquidation of the entry, and written 
notice of the denial and the reason therefor shall be given to the 
importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who 
completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good. Each 
notice of denial given to a person who completed and signed a 
Certificate of Origin shall also include a statement regarding the right 
to file a protest against the denial under part 174 of this chapter.
    (3) Liquidated entry. If the port director determines that a claim 
for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry 
covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation 
has become final, the claim may be denied without reliquidation of the 
entry. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on 
administrative review of a protest or petition for reliquidation or as a 
result of judicial review, such reliquidation may include denial of the 
claim filed under this subpart. In either case, the port director shall 
give written notice of the denial and the reason therefor to the 
importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who 
completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good. Each 
notice of denial given to a person who completed and signed a 
Certificate of Origin shall also include a statement regarding the right 
to file a protest against the denial under part 174 of this chapter.


<R04>
     Subpart E--Restrictions on Drawback and Duty-Deferral Programs


<R05>
Sec. 181.41  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the provisions regarding drawback claims and 
duty-deferral programs under Article 303 of the NAFTA and applies to any 
good that is a ``good subject to NAFTA drawback'' within the meaning of 
19 U.S.C. 3333. Except in the case of Sec. 181.42(d), the provisions of 
this subpart apply to goods which are imported into the United States 
and then subsequently exported from the United States to Canada on or 
after January 1, 1996, or to Mexico on or after January 1, 2001. The 
requirements and procedures set forth in this subpart for NAFTA drawback 
are in addition to the general definitions, requirements and procedures 
for all drawback claims set forth in part 191 of this chapter, unless 
otherwise specifically provided in this subpart. Also, the requirements 
and procedures set forth in this subpart for NAFTA duty-deferral 
programs are in addition to the requirements and procedures for 
manipulation, manufacturing and smelting and refining warehouses 
contained in part 19 and part 144 of this chapter, for foreign trade 
zones under part 146 of this chapter, and for temporary importations 
under bond contained in part 10 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 181.42  Duties and fees not subject to drawback.

    The following duties or fees which may be applicable to a good 
entered for consumption in the Customs territory of the United States 
are not subject to drawback under this subpart:
    (a) Antidumping and countervailing duties;
    (b) A premium offered or collected on a good with respect to 
quantitative import restrictions, tariff rate quotas or tariff 
preference levels;
    (c) Fees applied under section 22 of the U.S. Agricultural 
Adjustment Act; and
    (d) Customs duties paid or owed under unused merchandise 
substitution drawback. There shall be no payment of such drawback under 
19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) on goods exported to Canada or Mexico on or after 
January 1, 1994.


<R05>
Sec. 181.43  Eligible goods subject to drawback.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, drawback is authorized 
for an imported good that is entered for consumption and is:
    (a) Subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 
1313(j)(1));

[[Page 315]]

    (b) Used as a material in the production of another good that is 
subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(a)); or
    (c) Substituted by a good of the same kind and quality as defined in 
Sec. 181.44(c) of this subpart and used as a material in the production 
of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 
19 U.S.C. 1313(b)).


<R05>
Sec. 181.44  Calculation of drawback.

    (a) General. Except in the case of goods specified in Sec. 181.45 of 
this part, drawback of the duties previously paid upon importation of a 
good into the United States may be granted by the United States, upon 
presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under this subpart, on the lower 
amount of:
    (1) The total duties paid or owed on the good in the United States; 
or
    (2) The total amount of duties paid on the exported good upon 
subsequent importation into Canada or Mexico.
    (b) Individual relative value and duty comparison principle. For 
purposes of this section, relative value shall be determined, and the 
comparison between the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section and the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
shall be made, separately with reference to each individual exported 
good, including where two components or materials are used to produce 
one exported good or one component or material is divided among multiple 
exported goods.

    Example. Upon importation of Chemical X into the United States, 
Company A entered Chemical X and paid $2.00 in duties. Company A 
processed Chemical X into Products Y and Z, each having the same 
relative value; that is, $1.00 in duty is attributable to Product Y and 
$1.00 in duty is attributable to Product Z. Company A exported Product Y 
to Canada and Canada assessed a free rate of duty. Company A exported 
Product Z to Mexico and Mexico assessed the equivalent of US$2.00 in 
duty. There is no entitlement to drawback on the export of Product Y to 
Canada because zero is the lesser amount when compared to the $1.00 in 
duty attributable to Product Y as a result of the separation of Chemical 
X into Products Y and Z. There would be entitlement to drawback on the 
export to Mexico, consisting of the $1.00 duty attributable to Product 
Z, because that amount is the lesser amount when comparing the duty paid 
to the United States and the US$ equivalent duty paid to Mexico.

    (c) Direct identification manufacturing drawback under 19 U.S.C. 
1313(a). Upon presentation of the NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 
1313(a), in which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser 
amount of the customs duties paid on the good either to the United 
States or to Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback refunded shall not 
exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on such imported merchandise into the 
United States.

    Example 1. Upon the importation of Product X to the United States 
from Japan, Company A paid $2.00 in duties. Company A manufactured the 
imported Product X into Product Y, and subsequently exported it to 
Mexico. Mexico assessed the equivalent of US$11.00 in duties upon 
importation of Product Y. Upon presenting a drawback claim in the United 
States, in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), Company A would be 
entitled to a refund of 99 percent of the $2.00, or $1.98. The $2.00 
paid by Company A (less 1 percent) on the importation of Product X into 
the United States is a lesser amount of duties than the total amount of 
customs duties paid to Mexico (the equivalent of US$11.00) on Product Y.

    Example 2. Upon the importation of Product X into the United States 
from Hong Kong, Company A entered Product X and paid $5.00 in duties. 
Company A manufactured Product X into Product Y, sold it to Company B in 
Mexico and subsequently exported it to Mexico. Company A reserved its 
right to drawback. Upon Product Y's importation, Company B was assessed 
a free rate of duty. Company A's claim for drawback will be denied 
because Company A is entitled to zero drawback for the reason that, as 
between the duty paid in the United States and the duty paid in Mexico, 
the duty in Mexico was zero.

    (d) Substitution manufacturing drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). 
Upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), on 
which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser amount of 
the customs duties paid on the good either to the United States or to 
Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback is the same as that which would 
have been allowed had the substituted merchandise used in manufacture 
been itself imported. For purposes of drawback under this subpart, the 
term ``same kind and quality'' used in Sec. 1313(b) (see Sec. 191.2(m) 
of

[[Page 316]]

this chapter) shall have the same meaning as the term ``identical or 
similar good'' used in Article 303 of the NAFTA except that there shall 
be no requirement that the good be manufactured in the same country.

    Example 1. Upon importation of Product X from Japan to the United 
States, Company A paid $5.00 in duties. Company A substituted a same 
kind and quality domestic Product X for the Japanese Product X in its 
production of Product Y under its 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) drawback contract. 
Company A sold Product Y to Company B which subsequently exported it to 
Canada. On the importation of Product Y by Company B, Company B paid the 
equivalent of US$2.00 in duties assessed by Revenue Canada and waived 
its right to drawback to Company A. Company A is entitled to obtain 
drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) in the United States in the amount of 
$1.98 (or 99 percent of the US$2.00 equivalent Company B paid in duty to 
Canada) since that $2.00 was the lesser of the total amount of customs 
duties paid on the product to either Canada or the United States.

    Example 2. Same facts as above example, but Company B paid the 
equivalent of US$5.00 to Revenue Canada. Company A is entitled to obtain 
$4.95 in drawback (a refund of 99 percent of $5.00 paid to the United 
States). Since the same amount of duty was assessed by each country, 
drawback is allowable because the drawback paid does not exceed the 
lesser amount paid.

    (e) Meats cured with imported salt. Meats, whether packed or smoked, 
which have been cured with imported salt may be eligible for drawback in 
aggregate amounts of not less than $100 in duties paid on the imported 
salt upon exportation of the meats to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 
1313(f)).

    Example. Company Z produced Virginia smoked ham on its Smithfield, 
Virginia farm, using 4,000 pounds of imported salt in curing the meat. 
The salt was imported from an HTSUS Column 2 country, with a duty of 
$200. Upon exportation of the hams to Mexico, Company Z pays the 
equivalent of US$250.00 in duties to Mexico. Company Z is entitled to 
drawback of the full 100 percent of the $200.00 in duties it paid on the 
importation of the salt into the United States because that $200.00 is a 
lesser amount than the total amount of customs duties paid to Mexico on 
the exported meat.

    (f) Jet aircraft engines. A foreign-built jet aircraft engine that 
has been overhauled, repaired, rebuilt, or reconditioned in the United 
States with the use of imported merchandise, including parts, may be 
eligible for drawback of duties paid on the imported merchandise in 
aggregate amounts of not less than $100 upon exportation of the engine 
to Canada or Mexico (19 U.S.C. 1313(h)).

    Example. A Swedish-made jet aircraft engine is repaired in the 
United States using imported parts from Korea on which $160.00 in duties 
have been paid by Company W. The engine is subsequently exported to 
Canada by Company W and Company W pays the equivalent of US$260.00 in 
duties to Canada. Upon showing the country in which the engine was 
manufactured and a description of the processing performed thereon in 
the United States on Customs Form 7575-A, appropriately modified, 
Company W is entitled to the full refund of the duties paid to the 
United States since that $160.00 was a lesser amount than the duties 
paid on the engine to Canada.

    (g) Unused goods under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) that have changed in 
condition. An imported good that is unused in the United States under 19 
U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) and that is shipped to Canada or Mexico not in the 
same condition within the meaning of Sec. 181.45(b)(1) may be eligible 
for drawback under this section, except when the shipment to Canada or 
Mexico does not constitute an exportation under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(4).

    Example. Upon importation of Product X from Spain to the United 
States, the U.S. importer pays $10.00 in duties. While in the original 
package in the importer's warehouse, Product X becomes damaged. A 
Canadian purchaser buys Product X and imports it into Canada and pays 
the equivalent of US$5.00 in duties assessed by Revenue Canada. The 
Canadian purchaser who exported Product X from the United States to 
Canada and who otherwise qualifies for drawback is entitled to drawback 
under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) in the amount of $4.95 (99 percent of the 
US$5.00 equivalent in duties paid to Canada). Eligibility for full 
drawback of the $10.00 in U.S. duties under Sec. 181.45(b) would be 
precluded because Product X, although unused, was not exported to Canada 
in the same condition as when imported into the United States within the 
meaning of Sec. 181.45(b)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 181.45  Goods eligible for full drawback.

    (a) Goods originating in Canada or Mexico. A Canadian or Mexican 
originating good that is dutiable and is imported into the United States 
is eligible for drawback without regard to the

[[Page 317]]

limitation on drawback set forth in Sec. 181.44 of this part if that 
originating good is:
     (1) Subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico;
    (2) Used as a material in the production of another good that is 
subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico; or
    (3) Substituted by a good of the same kind and quality and used as a 
material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported 
to Canada or Mexico.

    Example. Company A imports a dutiable (3 percent rate) Canadian 
originating good. During Company A's manufacturing process, Company A 
substitutes a German good of the same kind and quality (on which duty 
was paid at a 2.5 percent rate) in the production of another good that 
is subsequently exported to Canada. Company A may designate the dutiable 
Canadian entry and claim full drawback (99 percent) on the 3 percent 
duty paid under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). (Note: NAFTA originating goods will 
continue to receive full drawback as they cross NAFTA borders for 
successive stages of production until NAFTA tariffs are fully phased 
out.)

    (b) Claims under 19 U.S.C 1313(j)(1) for goods in same condition. A 
good imported into the United States and subsequently exported to Canada 
or Mexico in the same condition is eligible for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 
1313(j)(1) without regard to the limitation on drawback set forth in 
Sec. 181.44 of this part.

    Example. X imports a desk into the United States from England and 
pays $25.00 in duty. X immediately exports the desk to Z in Mexico and Z 
pays the equivalent of US$10.00 in Mexican duties. X can obtain a refund 
of 99 percent of the $25.00 paid upon importation of the desk into the 
United States.

    (1) Same condition defined. For purposes of this subpart, a 
reference to a good in the ``same condition'' includes a good that has 
been subjected to any of the following operations provided that no such 
operation materially alters the characteristics of the good:
    (i) Mere dilution with water or another substance;
    (ii) Cleaning, including removal of rust, grease, paint or other 
coatings;
    (iii) Application of preservative, including lubricants, protective 
encapsulation, or preservation paint;
    (iv) Trimming, filing, slitting or cutting;
    (v) Putting up in measured doses, or packing, repacking, packaging 
or repackaging; or
    (vi) Testing, marking, labelling, sorting or grading.
    (2) Commingling of fungible goods--(i) General. Commingling of 
fungible goods in inventory, such as parts, is permissible (see 
Sec. 191.141(e) of this chapter), provided that the entries for 
designation for same condition drawback are identified on the basis of 
an approved inventory method set forth in the appendix to this part.
    (ii) Exception. Agricultural goods imported from Mexico may not be 
commingled with fungible agricultural goods in the United States for 
purposes of same condition drawback under this subpart.
    (c) Goods not conforming to sample or specifications or shipped 
without consent of consignee under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c). An imported good 
exported to Canada or Mexico by reason of failure of the good to conform 
to sample or specification or by reason of shipment of the good without 
the consent of the consignee is eligible for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 
1313(c) without regard to the limitation on drawback set forth in 
Sec. 181.44 of this part. Such a good must be returned to Customs 
custody for exportation under Customs supervision within three years 
after the release from Customs custody.

     Example. X orders, after seeing a sample in the ABC Company's 
catalog, a certain quantity of 2-by-4 lumber from ABC Company located in 
Honduras. ABC Company, having run out of the specific lumber, ships 
instead a different kind of lumber. X rejects the lumber because it did 
not conform to the sample and is asked to send it to a customer of ABC 
in Canada. X exports it within 90 days of its release from Customs 
custody. X may recover 99 percent of the $500 duties it paid to U.S. 
Customs upon the exportation of the lumber, or $495.00.

    (d) Certain goods exported to Canada. Goods identified in Annex 
303.6 of the NAFTA and in sections 203(a) (7) and (8) of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, if exported to Canada, 
are eligible for drawback without regard to the limitation on drawback 
set forth in Sec. 181.44 of this part.

[[Page 318]]


<R05>
Sec. 181.46  Time and place for filing drawback claim.

    (a) Time of filing. A drawback claim under this subpart shall be 
filed or applied for, as applicable, within 3 years after the date of 
exportation of the goods on which drawback is claimed. No extension will 
be granted unless it is established that a Customs officer was 
responsible for the untimely filing. Drawback shall be allowed only if 
the completed good is exported within 5 years after importation of the 
merchandise identified or designated to support the claim. A good 
subject to a claim for same condition drawback must be exported before 
the close of the 3-year period beginning on the date of importation of 
the good into the United States.
    (b) Place of filing. A drawback claim must be filed at the port(s) 
where the manufacturing drawback contract is on file, whether a general 
rate or specific rate, but exportation need not occur from that port. To 
facilitate expedited processing of claims, claimants should file same 
condition drawback claims in the port where the examination would take 
place (see Sec. 191.141(b)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this chapter). Customs 
must be notified at least 2 working days in advance of the intended date 
of exportation in order to have the opportunity to examine the goods.


<R05>
Sec. 181.47  Completion of claim for drawback.

    (a) General. A claim for drawback shall be granted, upon the 
submission of appropriate documentation to substantiate compliance with 
the drawback laws and regulations of the United States, evidence of 
exportation to Canada or Mexico, and satisfactory evidence of the 
payment of duties to Canada or Mexico. Unless otherwise provided in this 
subpart, the documentation, filing procedures, time and place 
requirements and other applicable procedures required to determine 
whether a good qualifies for drawback shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of part 191 of this chapter; however, a drawback claim 
subject to the provisions of this subpart shall be filed separately from 
any part 191 drawback claim (that is, a claim that involves goods 
exported to countries other than Canada or Mexico). Claims 
inappropriately filed or otherwise not completed within the 3-year 
period specified in Sec. 181.46 of this part shall be considered 
abandoned.
    (b) Complete drawback claim--(1) General. A complete drawback claim 
under this subpart shall consist of the filing of the appropriate 
completed drawback entry form, evidence of exportation (a copy of the 
Canadian or Mexican customs entry showing the amount of duty paid to 
Canada or Mexico) and its supporting documents, certificate(s) of 
delivery, when necessary, or certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery, 
and a certification from the Canadian or Mexican importer as to the 
amount of duties paid. Each drawback entry form filed under this subpart 
shall be conspicuously marked at the top with the word ``NAFTA''.
    (2) Specific claims. The following documentation, for the drawback 
claims specified below, must be submitted to Customs in order for a 
drawback claim to be processed under this subpart. Missing documentation 
or incorrect or incomplete information on required customs forms or 
supporting documentation will result in an incomplete drawback claim.
    (i) Manufacturing drawback claim. The following shall be submitted 
in connection with a claim for direct identification manufacturing 
drawback or substitution manufacturing drawback:
    (A) A completed Customs Form 331, to establish the manufacture of 
goods made with imported merchandise and, if applicable, the identity of 
substituted domestic, duty-paid or duty-free merchandise, and including 
the tariff classification number of the imported merchandise;
    (B) Customs Form 7501 or the import entry number;
    (C) Exporter's summary procedure, if applicable. For purposes of 
this subpart, the exporter's summary procedure must include the Canadian 
or Mexican customs entry number and the amount of duty paid to Canada or 
Mexico;
    (D) Evidence of exportation and satisfactory evidence of the payment 
of duties in Canada or Mexico, as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section;

[[Page 319]]

    (E) Waiver of right to drawback. If the person exporting to Canada 
or Mexico was not the importer or the manufacturer, written waivers 
executed by the importer or manufacturer and by any intervening person 
to whom the good was transferred shall be submitted in order for the 
claim to be considered complete; and
    (F) An affidavit of the party claiming drawback stating that no 
other drawback claim has been made on the designated goods, that such 
party has not provided an exporter's Certificate of Origin pertaining to 
the exported goods to another party except as stated on the drawback 
claim, and that the party agrees to notify Customs if he subsequently 
provides such an exporter's Certificate of Origin to any person.
    (ii) Same condition drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1). The 
following shall be submitted in connection with a drawback claim 
covering a good in the same condition:
    (A) A completed Customs Form 7539J. In addition, the tariff 
classification number of the imported goods shall be recorded on the 
form;
    (B) Customs Form 7501. The form must show the entry number, date of 
entry, port of importation, date of importation, importing carrier, and 
importer of record or ultimate consignee name and Customs or taxpayer 
identification number. Explicit line item information shall be clearly 
noted on the Customs Form 7501 so that the subject goods are easily 
discernible;
    (C) Customs Form 7505, if applicable, to trace the movement of the 
imported goods after importation;
    (D) The certificate of delivery portion of Customs Form 331, if 
applicable, for purposes of tracing the transfer of ownership of the 
imported goods from the importer to the claimant. This is required if 
the drawback claimant is not the original importer of the merchandise 
which is the subject of a same condition claim;
    (E) Customs Form 7512, if applicable. This is required for 
merchandise which is examined at one port but exported through border 
points outside of that port. Such goods must travel in bond from the 
location where they were examined to the point of the border crossing 
(exportation). If examination is waived, in-bond transportation is not 
required;
    (F) Notification of intent to export or waiver of prior notice;
    (G) Evidence of exportation. If a claimant is not approved for the 
exporter's summary procedure, either a certified Customs Form 7511 or an 
uncertified Customs Form 7511 supported by documentary evidence of 
exportation to Canada or Mexico such as a bill of lading, air waybill, 
freight waybill, export ocean bill of lading, Canadian customs manifest, 
cargo manifest, or certified copies thereof, issued by the exporting 
carrier, or any other evidence of exportation provided for in 
Sec. 191.51 of this chapter. Supporting documentary evidence shall 
establish fully the time and fact of exportation, the identity of the 
exporter, and the identity and location of the ultimate consignee of the 
exported goods;
    (H) Waiver of right to drawback. If the party exporting to Canada or 
Mexico was not the importer, a written waiver from the importer and from 
each intermediate person to whom the goods were transferred shall be 
required in order for the claim to be considered complete; and
    (I) An affidavit of the party claiming drawback stating that no 
other drawback claim has been made on the designated goods.
    (iii) Nonconforming or improperly shipped goods drawback claim. The 
following shall be submitted in the case of goods not conforming to 
sample or specifications or shipped without the consent of the consignee 
and subject to a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c):
    (A) Customs Form 7539C, completed and submitted at the time the 
goods are returned to Customs custody;
    (B) Customs Form 7501 to establish the fact of importation, the 
receipt of the imported goods and the identity of the party to whom 
drawback is payable (see Sec. 181.48(c) of this part);
    (C) Documentary evidence to support the claim that the goods did not 
conform to sample or specifications or were shipped without the consent 
of the consignee. In the case of nonconforming goods, such documentation 
may include a copy of a purchase order and any related documents such as 
a

[[Page 320]]

specification sheet, catalogue or advertising brochure from the 
supplier, the basis for which the order was placed, and copy of a letter 
or telex or credit memo from the supplier indicating acceptance of the 
returned merchandise. This documentation is necessary to establish that 
the goods are, in fact, being returned to the party from which they were 
procured or that they are being sent to the supplier's other customer 
directly;
    (D) Customs Form 7512, if applicable; and
    (E) Evidence of exportation, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) 
of this section.
    (iv) Meats cured with imported salt. The provisions of paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section relating to direct identification 
manufacturing drawback shall apply to claims for drawback on meats cured 
with imported salt filed under this subpart insofar as applicable to and 
not inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart, and the forms 
referred to in that paragraph shall be modified to show that the claim 
is being made for refund of duties paid on salt used in curing meats.
    (v) Jet aircraft engines. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section relating to direct identification manufacturing drawback 
shall apply to claims for drawback on foreign-built jet aircraft engines 
repaired or reconditioned in the United States filed under this subpart 
insofar as applicable to and not inconsistent with the provisions of 
this subpart and the provisions of subpart L of part 191 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Evidence of exportation and of duties paid in Canada or Mexico. 
For purposes of this subpart, evidence of exportation and satisfactory 
evidence of payment of duties in Canada or Mexico shall consist of one 
of the following types of documentation, provided that, for purposes of 
evidence of duties paid, such documentation includes the import entry 
number, the date of importation, the tariff classification number, the 
rate of duty and the amount of duties paid:
     (1) In the case of Canada, the Canadian entry document, referred to 
as the Canada Customs Invoice or B-3, presented with either the K-84 
Statement or the Detailed Coding Statement. A Canadian customs document 
that is not accompanied by a valid receipt is not adequate evidence of 
exportation and payment of duty in Canada;
     (2) In the case of Mexico, the Mexican entry document (the 
``pedimento'');
     (3) The final customs duty determination of Canada or Mexico, or a 
copy thereof, respecting the relevant entry; or
     (4) An affidavit, from the person claiming drawback, which is based 
on information received from the importer of the good in Canada or 
Mexico.


<R05>
Sec. 181.48  Person entitled to receive drawback.

     (a) Manufacturing drawback. The person named as exporter on the 
notice of exportation or on the bill of lading, air waybill, freight 
waybill, Canadian or Mexican customs manifest, cargo manifest, or 
certified copies of these documents, shall be considered the exporter 
and entitled to manufacturing drawback, unless the manufacturer or 
producer shall reserve the right to claim drawback. The manufacturer or 
producer who reserves this right may claim drawback, and he shall 
receive payment upon production of satisfactory evidence that the 
reservation was made with the knowledge and consent of the exporter. 
Drawback also may be granted to the agent of the manufacturer, producer, 
or exporter, or to the person the manufacturer, producer, exporter, or 
agent directs in writing to receive the drawback of duties.
     (b) Nonconforming or improperly shipped goods drawback. Only the 
importer of record or the actual owner of the merchandise or its agent 
may claim drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c).
     (c) Same condition drawback. The importer of record on the 
consumption entry is entitled to claim same condition drawback under 19 
U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) unless he has in writing waived his right to claim 
drawback.


<R05>
Sec. 181.49  Retention of records.

     All records required to be kept by the exporter, importer, 
manufacturer or producer under this subpart with respect to 
manufacturing drawback claims, and all records kept by others which 
complement the records of the importer, exporter, manufacturer or

[[Page 321]]

producer (see Sec. 191.5 of this chapter) shall be retained for at least 
three years after payment of such claims. However, any person who issues 
a drawback certificate that enables another person to make or perfect a 
drawback claim shall keep records in support of that certificate 
commencing on the date that the certificate is issued and shall retain 
those records for three years following the date of payment of the 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 181.50  Liquidation and payment of drawback claims.

     (a) General. When the drawback claim has been fully completed by 
the filing of all required documents, and exportation of the articles 
has been established and the amount of duties paid to Canada or Mexico 
has been established, the entry will be liquidated to determine the 
proper amount of drawback due either in accordance with the limitation 
on drawback set forth in Sec. 181.44 of this part or in accordance with 
the regular drawback calculation. The liquidation procedures of subpart 
G of part 191 of this chapter shall control for purposes of this 
subpart.
     (b) Time for liquidation. A drawback claim shall not be liquidated 
until either a written waiver of the right to protest under 19 U.S.C. 
1514 is filed with Customs or the liquidation of the import entry has 
become final under U.S. law. In addition, except in the case of goods 
covered by Sec. 181.45 of this part, a drawback claim shall not be 
liquidated for a period of 3 years after the date of entry of the goods 
in Canada or Mexico. A drawback claim may be adjusted pursuant to 19 
U.S.C. 1508(b)(2)(B)(iii) even after liquidation of the U.S. import 
entry has become final.
     (c) Accelerated payment. Accelerated drawback payment procedures 
shall apply as set forth in Sec. 191.72 of this chapter. However, a 
person who receives drawback of duties under this procedure shall repay 
the duties paid if a NAFTA drawback claim is adversely affected 
thereafter by administrative or court action.


<R05>
Sec. 181.51  Prevention of improper payment of claims.

     (a) Double payment of claim. The drawback claimant shall certify to 
Customs that he has not earlier received payment on the same import 
entry for the same designation of goods. If, notwithstanding such a 
certification, such an earlier payment was in fact made to the claimant, 
the claimant shall repay any amount paid on the second claim.
     (b) Preparation of Certificate of Origin. The drawback claimant 
shall, within 30 calendar days after the filing of the drawback claim 
under this subpart, submit to Customs a written statement as to whether 
he has prepared, or has knowledge that another person has prepared, a 
Certificate of Origin provided for under Sec. 181.11(a) of this part and 
pertaining to the goods which are covered by the claim. If, following 
such 30-day period, the claimant prepares, or otherwise learns of the 
existence of, any such Certificate of Origin, the claimant shall, within 
30 calendar days thereafter, disclose that fact to Customs.


<R05>
Sec. 181.52  Subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment.

     If a claim for a refund of duties is allowed by the Canadian or 
Mexican customs administration under Article 502(3) of the NAFTA (post-
importation claim) or under any other circumstance after drawback has 
been granted under this subpart, the appropriate Customs officer shall 
reliquidate the drawback claim and obtain a refund of the amount paid in 
drawback in excess of the amount permitted to be paid under Sec. 181.44 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 181.53  Collection and waiver or reduction of duty under duty-deferral programs.

    (a) General--(1) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply 
for purposes of this section:
    (i) Date of exportation. ``Date of exportation'' means the date of 
importation into Canada or Mexico as reflected on the applicable 
Canadian or Mexican entry document (see Sec. 181.47(c) (1) and (2)).
    (ii) Duty-deferral program. A ``duty-deferral program'' means any 
measure which postpones duty payment upon

[[Page 322]]

arrival of a good in the United States until withdrawn or removed for 
exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a Canadian or Mexican 
duty-deferral program. Such measures govern manipulation warehouses, 
manufacturing warehouses, smelting and refining warehouses, foreign 
trade zones, and those temporary importations under bond that are 
specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (2) Treatment as entered or withdrawn for consumption--(i) General. 
(A) Where a good is imported into the United States pursuant to a duty-
deferral program and is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral 
program for exportation to Canada or Mexico or is used as a material in 
the production of another good that is subsequently withdrawn from the 
duty-deferral program for exportation to Canada or Mexico, and provided 
that the good is a ``good subject to NAFTA drawback'' within the meaning 
of 19 U.S.C. 3333 and is not described in Sec. 181.45 of this part, the 
documentation required to be filed under this section in connection with 
the exportation of the good shall, for purposes of this chapter, 
constitute an entry or withdrawal for consumption and the exported good 
shall be subject to duty which shall be assessed in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) Where a good is imported into the United States pursuant to a 
duty-deferral program and is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-
deferral program and entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or 
Mexico or is used as a material in the production of another good that 
is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program and entered 
into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, and provided that the 
good is a ``good subject to NAFTA drawback'' within the meaning of 19 
U.S.C. 3333 and is not described in Sec. 181.45, the documentation 
required to be filed under this section in connection with the 
withdrawal of the good from the U.S. duty-deferral program shall, for 
purposes of this chapter, constitute an entry or withdrawal for 
consumption and the withdrawn good shall be subject to duty which shall 
be assessed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (C) Any assessment of duty under this section shall include the 
duties and fees referred to in Sec. 181.42 (a) through (c) and the fees 
provided for in Sec. 24.23 of this chapter; these inclusions shall not 
be subject to refund, waiver, reduction or drawback.
    (ii) Bond requirements. The provisions of Sec. 142.4 of this chapter 
shall apply to each withdrawal and exportation transaction described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. However, in applying the provisions 
of Sec. 142.4 of this chapter in the context of this section, any 
reference to release from Customs custody in Sec. 142.4 of this chapter 
shall be taken to mean exportation to Canada or Mexico.
    (iii) Documentation filing and duty payment procedures.
    (A) Persons required to file. In the circumstances described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the documentation described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section must be filed by one of the 
following persons:
    (1) In the case of a withdrawal of the goods from a warehouse, the 
person who has the right to withdraw the goods;
    (2) In the case of a temporary importation under bond (TIB) 
specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the TIB importer whether 
or not he sells the goods for export to Canada or Mexico unless 
Sec. 10.31(h) of this chapter applies; or
    (3) In the case of a withdrawal from a foreign trade zone, the 
person who has the right to make entry. However, if a zone operator is 
not the person with the right to make entry of the good, the zone 
operator shall be responsible for the payment of any duty due in the 
event the zone operator permits such other person to remove the goods 
from the zone and such other person fails to comply with Secs. 146.67 
and 146.68 of this chapter.
    (B) Documentation required to be filed and required filing date. The 
person required to file shall file Customs Form 7501 no later than 10 
working days after the date of exportation to Canada or Mexico or 10 
working days after being entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada 
or Mexico. Except where the context otherwise requires and except as 
otherwise specifically provided in

[[Page 323]]

this paragraph, the procedures for completing and filing Customs Form 
7501 in connection with the entry of merchandise under this chapter 
shall apply for purposes of this paragraph. For purposes of completing 
Customs Form 7501 under this paragraph, any reference on the form to the 
entry date shall be taken to refer to the date of exportation of the 
good or the date the goods are entered into a duty-deferral program in 
Canada or Mexico. The Customs Form 7501 required under this paragraph 
may be transmitted electronically.
    (C) Duty payment. The duty estimated to be due under paragraph (b) 
of this section shall be deposited with Customs 60 calendar days after 
the date of exportation of the good. If a good is entered into a duty-
deferral program in Canada or Mexico, the duty estimated to be due under 
paragraph (b) of this section, but without any waiver or reduction 
provided for in that paragraph, shall be deposited with Customs 60 
calendar days after the date the good is entered into such duty-deferral 
program. Nothing shall preclude the deposit of such estimated duty at 
the time of filing the Customs Form 7501 under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) 
of this section or at any other time within the 60-day period prescribed 
in this paragraph. However, any interest calculation shall run from the 
date the duties are required to be deposited.
    (3) Waiver or reduction of duties--(i) General. Except in the case 
of duties and fees referred to in Secs. 181.42(a) through (c) and fees 
provided for in Sec. 24.23 of this chapter, Customs shall waive or 
reduce the duties paid or owed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by 
the person who is required to file the Customs Form 7501 (see paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, provided that a claim for waiver or reduction of the duties is 
filed with Customs within the appropriate 60-day time frame. The claim 
shall be based on evidence of exportation or entry into a Canadian or 
Mexican duty-deferral program and satisfactory evidence of duties paid 
in Canada or Mexico (see Sec. 181.47(c)).
    (ii) Filing of claim and payment of reduced duties. A claim for a 
waiver or reduction of duties under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section 
shall be made on Customs Form 7501 which shall set forth, in addition to 
the information required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, 
a description of the good exported to Canada or Mexico and the Canadian 
or Mexican import entry number, date of importation, tariff 
classification number, rate of duty and amount of duty paid. If a claim 
for reduction of duties is filed under this paragraph, the reduced 
duties shall be deposited with Customs when the claim is filed.
    (iii) Drawback on goods entered into a duty-deferral program in 
Canada or Mexico. After goods in a duty-deferral program in the United 
States which have been sent from the United States and entered into a 
duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico are then withdrawn from that 
Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program either for entry into Canada 
or Mexico or for export to a non-NAFTA country, the person who filed the 
Customs Form 7501 (see paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section) may 
file a claim for drawback if the goods are withdrawn within 5 years from 
the date of the original importation of the good into the United States. 
If the goods are entered for consumption in Canada or Mexico, drawback 
will be calculated in accordance with Sec. 181.44 of this part.
    (4) Liquidation of entry--(i) If no claim is filed. If no claim for 
a waiver or reduction of duties is filed in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, Customs shall determine the final duties due 
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and shall post a bulletin 
notice of liquidation of the entry filed under this section in 
accordance with Sec. 159.9 of this chapter. Where no claim was filed in 
accordance with this section and Customs fails to liquidate, or extend 
liquidation of, the entry filed under this section within 1 year from 
the date of the entry, upon the date of expiration of that 1-year period 
the entry shall be deemed liquidated by operation of law in the amount 
asserted by the exporter on the Customs Form 7501 filed under paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. A protest under section 514, Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (19

[[Page 324]]

U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter shall be filed within 90 days 
from the date of posting of the notice of liquidation under this 
section.
    (ii) If a claim is filed. If a claim for a waiver or reduction of 
duties is filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, an 
extension of liquidation of the entry filed under this section shall 
take effect for a period not to exceed 3 years from the date the entry 
was filed. Before the close of the extension period, Customs shall 
liquidate the entry filed under this section and shall post a bulletin 
notice of liquidation in accordance with Sec. 159.9 of this chapter. If 
Customs fails to liquidate the entry filed under this section within 4 
years from the date of the entry, upon the date of expiration of that 4-
year period the entry shall be deemed liquidated by operation of law in 
the amount asserted by the exporter on the Customs Form 7501 filed under 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. A protest under section 514, 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this 
chapter shall be filed within 90 days from the date of posting of the 
notice of liquidation under this section.
    (b) Assessment and waiver or reduction of duty--(1) Manipulation in 
warehouse. Where a good subject to NAFTA drawback under this subpart is 
withdrawn from a bonded warehouse (19 U.S.C. 1562) after manipulation 
for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a duty-deferral 
program in Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the good in its 
condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time of such 
withdrawal from the warehouse and with such additions to, or deductions 
from, the final appraised value as may be necessary by reason of its 
change in condition. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar 
days after the date of exportation or of entry into the duty-deferral 
program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or 
reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount 
of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of 
customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.
    (2) Bonded manufacturing warehouse. Where a good is manufactured in 
a bonded warehouse (19 U.S.C. 1311) with imported materials and is then 
withdrawn for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a duty-
deferral program in Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the 
materials in their condition and quantity, and at their weight, at the 
time of their importation into the United States. Such duty shall be 
paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation 
or of entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except 
that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not 
exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the materials 
under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada 
or Mexico.

    Example. Company N imports tea into the United States and makes a 
Class 6 warehouse entry. Company N manufactures sweetened ice tea mix by 
combining the imported tea with refined cane sugar and other flavorings 
and packaging it in retail size canisters. Upon withdrawal of the ice 
tea mix from the warehouse for exportation to Canada, a Customs Form 
7501 is filed showing $900 in estimated U.S. duties on the basis of the 
unmanufactured tea. Upon entry into Canada, the equivalent of US$800 is 
assessed on the exported ice tea mix. Company N submits to Customs a 
proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section showing payment of 
the US$800 equivalent in duties to Canada. Company N will only be 
required to pay $100 in U.S. duties out of the $900 amount reflected on 
the Customs Form 7501.

    (3) Bonded smelting or refining warehouse. For any qualifying 
imported metal-bearing materials (19 U.S.C. 1312), duty shall be 
assessed on the imported materials and the charges against the bond 
canceled no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of 
exportation of the treated materials to Canada or Mexico or the date of 
entry of the treated materials into a duty-deferral program of Canada or 
Mexico, either from the bonded smelting or refining warehouse or from 
such other customs bonded warehouse after the transfer of the same 
quantity of material from a bonded smelting or refining warehouse. 
However, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph

[[Page 325]]

(a)(3) of this section, the duty on the imported materials shall be 
waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the 
total amount of duty payable on the imported materials under this 
section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

    Example. Company Z imports 47 million pounds of electrolytic zinc 
which is entered into a bonded smelting and refining warehouse (Class 7) 
for processing. Thereafter, Company Z withdraws the merchandise for 
exportation to Canada and files a Customs Form 7501 showing $90,000 in 
estimated U.S. duty on the dutiable quantity of metal contained in the 
imported metal-bearing materials. Upon entry of the processed zinc into 
Canada, the equivalent of US$50,000 in duties are assessed. Within 60 
days of exportation Company Z files a proper claim under paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section and Customs liquidates the entry with duty due in 
the amount of $40,000.

    (4) Foreign trade zone. For a good that is manufactured or otherwise 
changed in condition in a foreign trade zone (19 U.S.C. 81c(a)) and then 
withdrawn from the zone for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry 
into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program, the duty assessed, as 
calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (b)(4)(ii) of this section, 
shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of 
exportation of the good to Canada or Mexico or the date of entry of the 
good into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon 
filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the 
lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this 
section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.
    (i) Nonprivileged foreign status. In the case of a nonprivileged 
foreign status good, duty is assessed on the good in its condition and 
quantity, and at its weight, at the time of its exportation from the 
zone to Canada or Mexico or its entry into a duty-deferral program of 
Canada or Mexico.

    Example. CMG imports $1,000,000 worth of auto parts from Korea and 
admits them into Foreign-Trade Subzone number 00, claiming nonprivileged 
foreign status. (If the auto parts had been regularly entered they would 
have been dutiable at 4 percent, or $40,000.) CMG manufactures 
subcompact automobiles. Automobiles are dutiable at 2.5 percent 
($25,000) if entered for consumption in the United States. CMG withdraws 
the automobiles from the zone and exports them to Mexico. Upon entry of 
the automobiles in Mexico, CMG pays the equivalent of US$20,000 in duty. 
Before the expiration of 60 calendar days from the date of exportation, 
CMG files a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and pays 
$5,000 in duty to Customs representing the difference between the 
$25,000 which would have been paid if the automobiles had been entered 
for consumption from the zone and the US$20,000 equivalent paid to 
Mexico.

    (ii) Privileged foreign status. In the case of a privileged foreign 
status good, duty is assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, 
and at its weight, at the time privileged status is granted in the zone.

    Example. O&G, Inc. admits Kuwaiti crude petroleum into its zone and 
requests, one month later, privileged foreign status on the crude before 
refining the crude into motor gasoline and kerosene. Upon withdrawal of 
the refined goods from the zone by O&G, Inc. for exportation to Canada, 
a Customs Form 7501 is filed showing $700 in estimated duties on the 
imported crude petroleum (rather than on the refined goods which would 
have been assessed $1,200). D&O is the consignee in Canada and pays the 
Canadian customs duty assessment of the equivalent of US$1,500 on the 
goods. O&G, Inc. is entitled to a waiver of the full $700 in duties upon 
filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

    (5) Temporary importation under bond. Except in the case of a good 
imported from Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration, where a good, 
regardless of its origin, was imported temporarily free of duty for 
repair, alteration or processing (subheading 9813.00.05, Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States) and is subsequently exported to 
Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the good on the basis of its 
condition at the time of its importation into the United States. Such 
duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date 
of exportation or the date of entry into a duty-deferral program of 
Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in 
an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of

[[Page 326]]

duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of 
customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

    Example. Company A imports glassware under subheading 9813.00.05, 
HTSUS. The glassware is from France and would be dutiable under a 
regular consumption entry at $6,000. Company A alters the glassware by 
etching hotel logos on the glassware. Two weeks later, Company A sells 
the glassware to Company B, a Mexican company, and ships the glassware 
to Mexico. Company B enters the glassware and is assessed duties in an 
amount equivalent to US$6,200 and claims NAFTA preferential tariff 
treatment. Company B provides a copy of the Mexican landing certificate 
to Company A showing that the US$6,200 equivalent in duties was assessed 
but not yet paid to Mexico. If Mexico ultimately denies Company B's 
NAFTA claim and the Mexican duty payment becomes final, Company A, upon 
submission to Customs of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, is entitled to a waiver of the full $6,000 in U.S. duty.

    (c) Recordkeeping requirements. If a person intends to claim a 
waiver or reduction of duty on goods under this section, that person 
shall maintain records concerning the value of all involved goods or 
materials at the time of their importation into the United States and 
concerning the value of the goods at the time of their exportation to 
Canada or Mexico or entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or 
Mexico, and if a person files a claim under this section for a waiver or 
reduction of duty on goods exported to Canada or Mexico or entered into 
a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program, that person shall maintain 
evidence of exportation or entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-
deferral program and satisfactory evidence of the amount of any customs 
duties paid to Canada or Mexico on the good (see Sec. 181.47(c)). 
Failure to maintain adequate records will result in denial of the claim 
for waiver or reduction of duty.
    (d) Failure to file proper claim. If the person identified in 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section fails to file a proper claim 
within the 60-day period specified in this section, that person, or the 
FTZ operator pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A)(3) of this section, 
will be liable for payment of the full duties assessed under this 
section and without any waiver or reduction thereof.
    (e) Subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment. If a claim 
for a refund of duties is allowed by the Canadian or Mexican customs 
administration under Article 502(3) of the NAFTA or under any other 
circumstance after duties have been waived or reduced under this 
section, Customs may reliquidate the entry filed under this section 
pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(b)(2)(B)(iii) even after liquidation of the 
entry has become final.

[T.D. 96-14, 61 FR 2911, Jan. 30, 1996; T.D. 96-14, 61 FR 6111, Feb. 16, 
1996]


<R05>
Sec. 181.54  Verification of claim for drawback, waiver or reduction of duties.

    The allowance of a claim for drawback, waiver or reduction of duties 
submitted under this subpart shall be subject to such verification, 
including verification with the Canadian or Mexican customs 
administration of any documentation obtained in Canada or Mexico and 
submitted in connection with the claim, as Customs may deem necessary.


<R04>
    Subpart F--Commercial Samples and Goods Returned After Repair or 
                               Alteration


<R05>
Sec. 181.61  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the rules which apply for purposes of duty-
free entry of commercial samples of negligible value as provided for in 
Article 306 of the NAFTA and for purposes of the re-entry of goods after 
repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in Article 307 
of the NAFTA.


<R05>
Sec. 181.62  Commercial samples of negligible value.

    (a) General. Commercial samples of negligible value imported from 
Canada or Mexico may qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 
9811.00.60, HTSUS. For purposes of this section, ``commercial samples of 
negligible value'' means commercial samples which have a value, 
individually or in the aggregate as shipped, of not more than US$1, or 
the equivalent amount in the currency of Canada or Mexico, or which are 
so marked, torn, perforated,

[[Page 327]]

or otherwise treated that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except 
as commercial samples.
    (b) Qualification for duty-free entry. Commercial samples of 
negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico will qualify for duty-
free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS, only if:
    (1) The samples are imported solely for the purpose of soliciting 
orders for foreign goods; and
    (2) If valued over US$1, the samples are properly marked, torn, 
perforated or otherwise treated prior to arrival in the United States so 
that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial 
samples.


<R05>
Sec. 181.63  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 181.64  Goods re-entered after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico.

    (a) General. This section sets forth the rules which apply for 
purposes of obtaining duty-free or reduced-duty treatment on goods 
returned after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for 
in subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, HTSUS. Goods returned after 
having been repaired or altered in Mexico, whether or not pursuant to a 
warranty, and goods returned after having been repaired or altered in 
Canada pursuant to a warranty, are eligible for duty-free treatment, 
provided that the requirements of this section are met. Goods returned 
after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a 
warranty are subject to duty upon the value of the repairs or 
alterations using the applicable duty rate under the United States-
Canada Free-Trade Agreement (see Sec. 10.301 of this chapter), provided 
that the requirements of this section are met. For purposes of this 
section, ``repairs or alterations'' means restoration, addition, 
renovation, redyeing, cleaning, resterilizing, or other treatment which 
does not destroy the essential characteristics of, or create a new or 
commercially different good from, the good exported from the United 
States.

    Example. Glass mugs produced in the United States are exported to 
Canada for etching and tempering operations, after which they are 
returned to the United States for sale. The foreign operations exceed 
the scope of an alteration because they are manufacturing processes 
which create commercially different products with distinct new 
characteristics.

     (b) Goods not eligible for duty-free or reduced-duty treatment 
after repair or alteration. The duty-free or reduced-duty treatment 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to goods 
which, in their condition as exported from the United States to Canada 
or Mexico, are incomplete for their intended use and for which the 
processing operation performed in Canada or Mexico constitutes an 
operation that is performed as a matter of course in the preparation or 
manufacture of finished goods.

    Example. Unflanged metal wheel rims are exported to Canada for a 
flanging operation to strengthen them so as to conform to U.S. Army 
specifications for wheel rims; although the goods when exported from the 
United States are dedicated for use in the making of wheel rims, they 
cannot be used for that purpose until flanged. The flanging operation 
does not constitute a repair or alteration because that operation is 
necessary for the completion of the wheel rims.

    (c) Documentation--(1) Declarations required. Except as otherwise

           Subpart G--Origin Verifications and Determinations


<R05>
Sec. 181.71  Denial of preferential tariff treatment dependent on origin verification and determination.

    Except where a Certificate of Origin either is not submitted when 
requested under Sec. 181.22(b) of this part or is not acceptable and a 
corrected Certificate is not submitted or accepted as provided in 
Sec. 181.22(c) of this part and except as otherwise provided in 
Sec. 181.23 of this part and except in the case of a pattern of conduct 
provided for in Sec. 181.76(c) of this part, Customs shall deny 
preferential tariff treatment on an imported good, or shall deny a post-
importation claim for a refund filed under subpart D of this part, only 
after initiation of an origin verification

[[Page 329]]

under Sec. 181.72(a) of this part which results in a determination that 
the imported good does not qualify as an originating good or should not 
be accorded such treatment for any other reason as specifically provided 
for elsewhere in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 181.72  Verification scope and method.

    (a) General. Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, Customs may 
initiate a verification in order to determine whether a good imported 
into the United States qualifies as an originating good for purposes of 
preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA as stated on the 
Certificate of Origin pertaining to the good. Such a verification:
    (1) May also involve a verification of the origin of a material that 
is used in the production of a good that is the subject of a 
verification under this section;
    (2) May include verification of the applicable rate of duty applied 
to an originating good in accordance with Annex 302.2 of the NAFTA and 
may include a determination of whether a good is a qualifying good for 
purposes of Annex 703.2 of the NAFTA; and
    (3) Shall be conducted only by means of one or more of the 
following:
    (i) A verification letter which requests information from a Canadian 
or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican 
producer of a material, and which identifies the good or material that 
is the subject of the verification. The verification letter may be on 
Customs Form 28 or other appropriate format and may be sent:
    (A) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that 
produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer; or
    (B) By any other method, regardless of whether it produces proof of 
receipt by the exporter or producer;
    (ii) A written questionnaire sent to an exporter or a producer, 
including a producer of a material, in Canada or Mexico. The 
questionnaire:
    (A) May be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other 
method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or 
producer; or
    (B) May be sent by any other method, regardless of whether it 
produces proof of receipt by the exporter or producer; and
    (C) May be completed by the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer 
either in the English language or in the language of the country in 
which that exporter or producer is located;
    (iii) Visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer, including 
a producer of a material, in Canada or Mexico to review the types of 
records referred to in Sec. 181.12 of this part and observe the 
facilities used in the production of the good or material; and
    (iv) Any other method which results in information from a Canadian 
or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican 
producer of a material, that is relevant to the origin determination. 
The information so obtained may form a basis for a negative 
determination regarding a good (see Sec. 181.75(b) of this part) only if 
the information is in writing and is signed by the exporter or producer.
    (b) Applicable accounting principles. Any verification of a regional 
value-content requirement undertaken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be conducted in accordance with the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles applied in the country from which the good was 
exported to the United States.
    (c) Inquiries to importer not precluded. Nothing in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall preclude Customs from directing inquiries or requests 
to a U.S. importer for documents or other information regarding the 
imported good. If such an inquiry or request involves requesting the 
importer to obtain and provide written information from the exporter or 
producer of the good or from the producer of a material that is used in 
the production of the good, such information shall be requested by the 
importer and provided to the importer by the exporter or producer only 
on a voluntary basis, and a failure or refusal on the part of the 
importer to obtain and provide such information shall not be considered 
a failure of the exporter or producer to provide the information and 
shall not constitute a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment 
on the good.

[[Page 330]]

    (d) Failure to respond to letter or questionnaire.--(1) Nonresponse 
to initial letter or questionnaire. If the exporter or producer, 
including a producer of a material, fails to respond to a verification 
letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of 
this section within 30 calendar days from the date on which the letter 
or questionnaire was sent, or such longer period as may be specified in 
the letter or questionnaire, Customs shall send a follow-up verification 
letter or questionnaire to that exporter or producer. The follow-up 
letter or questionnaire:
    (i) Except where the verification letter or questionnaire only 
involved the origin of a material used in the production of a good and 
was sent to the producer of the material, may include the written 
determination referred to in Sec. 181.75 of this part, provided that the 
information specified in paragraph (b) of that section is also included; 
and
    (ii) Shall be sent:
    (A) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that 
produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer, if so 
requested by the customs administration of Canada or Mexico from which 
the good was exported; or
    (B) By any method, if no request under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section has been made by the Canadian or Mexican customs 
administration.
    (2) Nonresponse to follow-up letter or questionnaire--(i) Producer 
of a material. If a producer of a material fails to respond to a follow-
up verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, Customs may consider the material to be non-originating 
for purposes of determining whether the good to which that material 
relates is an originating good.
    (ii) Exporter or producer of a good. If the exporter or producer of 
a good fails to respond to a follow-up verification letter or 
questionnaire sent under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Customs may 
consider the good to be non-originating and consequently may deny 
preferential tariff treatment on the good as follows:
    (A) If the follow-up letter or questionnaire included a written 
determination as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and 
the exporter or producer fails to respond to the follow-up letter or 
questionnaire within 30 calendar days or such longer period as specified 
therein:
    (1) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire and 
written determination were received by the exporter or producer, if sent 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; or
    (2) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire and 
written determination were either received by the exporter or producer 
or sent by Customs, if sent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) 
of this section; or
    (B) Provided that the procedures set forth in Secs. 181.75 and 
181.76 of this part are followed, if the follow-up letter or 
questionnaire does not include a written determination as provided for 
in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the exporter or producer 
fails to respond to the follow-up letter or questionnaire within 30 
calendar days or such longer period as specified in the letter or 
questionnaire:
    (1) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire was 
received by the exporter or producer, if sent pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; or
    (2) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire was 
either received by the exporter or producer or sent by Customs, if sent 
in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (e) Calculation of regional value content under net cost method--(1) 
General. Where a Canadian or Mexican producer of a good elects to 
calculate the regional value content of a good under the net cost method 
as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this 
part, Customs may not, during the time period over which that net cost 
is calculated, conduct a verification under Sec. 181.72(a) of this part 
with respect to the regional value content of that good.
    (2) Cost submission for motor vehicles. Where, pursuant to General 
Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part, a Canadian or Mexican 
producer of a light duty vehicle or heavy duty vehicle, as defined in 
the appendix to this part, elects to average its regional

[[Page 331]]

value content calculation over its fiscal year, Customs may request, in 
writing, that the producer provide a cost submission reflecting the 
actual costs incurred in the production of the category of motor 
vehicles for which the election was made. Such a written request shall 
constitute a verification letter under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section, and the requested cost submission shall be submitted to Customs 
within 180 calendar days after the close of the producer's fiscal year 
or within 60 days from the date on which the request was made, whichever 
is later.


<R05>
Sec. 181.73  Notification of verification visit.

    (a) Written notification required. Prior to conducting a 
verification visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to 
Sec. 181.72(a)(2)(iii) of this part, Customs shall give written 
notification of the intention to conduct the visit. Such notification 
shall be delivered:
    (1) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that 
produces a confirmation of receipt, to the address of the Canadian or 
Mexican exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited;
    (2) To the customs administration of the country in which the visit 
is to occur; and
    (3) If requested by the country in which the visit is to occur, to 
the embassy of that country located in the United States.
    (b) Contents of notification. The notification referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall include:
    (1) The identity of the Customs office and officer issuing the 
notification;
    (2) The name of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the 
good, or producer of the material, whose premises are to be visited;
    (3) The date and place of the proposed verification visit;
    (4) The object and scope of the proposed verification visit, 
including specific reference to the good or material that is the subject 
of the verification;
    (5) The names and titles of the Customs officers performing the 
proposed verification visit;
    (6) The legal authority for the proposed verification visit; and
    (7) A request that the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of 
the good, or producer of the material, provide its written consent for 
the proposed verification visit.


<R05>
Sec. 181.74  Verification visit procedures.

    (a) Written consent required. Prior to conducting a verification 
visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to Sec. 181.72(a)(2)(iii) of this 
part, Customs shall obtain the written consent of the Canadian or 
Mexican exporter or producer of the good or producer of the material 
whose premises are to be visited.
    (b) Written consent procedures. The written consent provided for in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be delivered by certified or 
registered mail, or by any other method that generates a reliable 
receipt, to the Customs officer who gave the notification provided for 
in Sec. 181.73 of this part.
    (c) Failure to provide written consent or to cooperate or to 
maintain records. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, where a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or 
a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, has not given its written 
consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of notification pursuant to Sec. 181.73 of this part, Customs 
may deny preferential tariff treatment to that good, or for purposes of 
determining whether a good is an originating good may consider as non-
originating that material, that would have been the subject of the 
visit, provided that, as regards the good, notice of intent to deny such 
treatment is given to that exporter or producer of the good and to the 
U.S. importer thereof prior to taking such action. A failure on the part 
of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or on the 
part of the Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, to maintain 
records or provide access to such records or otherwise cooperate during 
the verification visit shall mean that the verification visit never took 
place and may be treated by Customs in the same manner as a failure to 
give written consent to a verification visit. However, in the case of a 
Canadian or Mexican producer

[[Page 332]]

of a good who is found during a verification visit to have not 
maintained records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles applied in the producer's country, Customs may deny 
preferential tariff treatment on the good based solely on a failure to 
so maintain those records only if the producer does not conform the 
records to those Principles within 60 calendar days after Customs 
informs the producer in writing of that failure.
    (d) Postponement of visit in Canada or Mexico. Following receipt of 
the notification provided for in Sec. 181.73 of this part, the Canadian 
or Mexican customs administration may, within 15 calendar days of 
receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit 
for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such 
receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the Customs 
officer who issued the notification of the verification visit, unless a 
longer period is requested and agreed to by Customs. Such a postponement 
shall not constitute a failure to provide written consent within the 
meaning of paragraph (c) of this section and shall not otherwise by 
itself constitute a valid basis upon which Customs may:
    (1) Consider a material that is used in the production of a good to 
be a non-originating material; or
    (2) Deny preferential tariff treatment to a good.
    (e) Verification visits within the United States--(1) Notification 
and consent procedure. When the Canadian or Mexican customs 
administration intends to conduct a verification visit in the United 
States, notification of such intent will be given, and consent will be 
required, as provided for under Article 506 of the NAFTA. For purposes 
of the required notification to Customs, such notification shall be sent 
to Project North Star Coordination Center, P.O. Box 400, Buffalo, New 
York 14225-0400.
    (2) Postponement of visit. Following receipt of notification from 
the Canadian or Mexican customs administration of its intention to 
conduct a verification visit in the United States, Customs may, within 
15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed 
verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the 
date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to 
the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.
    (3) Designation of observers. A U.S. exporter or producer, including 
a producer of a material, whose good or material is the subject of a 
verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration 
shall be allowed to designate two observers to be present during the 
visit, subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The U.S. exporter or producer shall not be required to designate 
observers;
    (ii) There shall be no restriction on the class of persons that may 
be designated as observers by the U.S. exporter or producer;
    (iii) The observers to be present are designated in the written 
consent to the proposed visit or subsequent thereto;
    (iv) The observers do not participate in the verification visit in a 
manner other than as passive observers;
    (v) The presence of observers shall in no way affect the right to 
have legal counsel or other advisors present during the visit;
    (vi) There shall be no obligation on the part of the United States 
government or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican government to 
designate observers from its staff, even when the U.S. exporter or 
producer fails to, or specifically declines to, designate observers; and
    (vii) The failure of the U.S. exporter or producer to designate 
observers shall not result in the postponement of the visit.


<R05>
Sec. 181.75  Issuance of origin determination.

    (a) General. Except in the case of a pattern of conduct within the 
meaning of Sec. 181.76(c) of this part, following receipt and analysis 
of the results of an origin verification initiated under Sec. 181.72(a) 
of this part in regard to a good imported into the United States and 
prior to denying preferential tariff treatment on the import transaction 
which gave rise to the origin verification, Customs shall provide the 
exporter or producer whose good is the

[[Page 333]]

subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the 
good qualifies as an originating good. Subject to paragraph (b) of this 
section, the written origin determination shall be sent within 60 
calendar days after conclusion of the origin verification process, 
unless circumstances require additional time, and shall set forth:
    (1) A description of the good that was the subject of the 
verification together with the identifying numbers and dates of the 
export and import documents pertaining to the good;
    (2) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 181.131 of this part and 
except in the case of a negative origin determination where specific 
findings of fact cannot be made because of a failure to respond to a 
follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under Sec. 181.72 of 
this part, a statement setting forth the findings of fact made in 
connection with the verification and upon which the determination is 
based; and
    (3) With specific reference to the rules applicable to originating 
goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to 
this part, the legal basis for the determination.
    (b) Negative origin determinations. If Customs determines, as a 
result of an origin verification initiated under Sec. 181.72(a) of this 
part, that the good which is the subject of the verification does not 
qualify as an originating good, the written determination required under 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Shall be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other 
method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or 
producer, if so requested by the customs administration of Canada or 
Mexico from which the good was exported; and
    (2) Shall, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, set forth the following:
    (i) A notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment on the 
good which is the subject of the determination;
    (ii) The specific date after which preferential tariff treatment 
will be denied, as established in accordance with Sec. 181.76(a)(1) of 
this part;
    (iii) The period, established in accordance with Sec. 181.76(a)(1) 
of this part, during which the exporter or producer of the good may 
provide written comments or additional information regarding the 
determination; and
    (iv) A statement advising the exporter or producer of the right to 
file a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 and part 174 of this chapter:
    (A) Within 90 days after notice of liquidation is provided pursuant 
to part 159 of this chapter; or
    (B) In cases where the negative origin determination does not result 
in a liquidation, within 90 days after the date of issuance of the 
written determination.


<R05>
Sec. 181.76  Application of origin determinations.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an origin 
determination may be applied upon issuance of the determination under 
Sec. 181.75 of this part.
    (b) Negative origin determinations. In the case of a negative origin 
determination issued under Sec. 181.75(b) of this part:
    (1) The date on which preferential tariff treatment may be denied 
shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days from the date on which:
    (i) Receipt of the written determination by the exporter or producer 
is confirmed, if a request under Sec. 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been 
made; or
    (ii) The written determination is sent by Customs, if no request 
under Sec. 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; and
    (2) Before denying preferential tariff treatment, Customs shall take 
into account any comments or additional information provided by the 
exporter or producer during the period established in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Cases involving a pattern of conduct. Where multiple origin 
verifications initiated under Sec. 181.72(a) of this part indicate a 
pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer involving false or 
unsupported representations on Certificates of Origin that a good 
imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good, 
Customs may deny subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment on 
identical goods exported or produced by such person

[[Page 334]]

until that person establishes compliance with the rules applicable to 
originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this 
part, provided that advance written notice of the intent to deny such 
claims is given to the importer. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
``pattern of conduct'' means repeated instances of false or unsupported 
representations by an exporter or producer as established by Customs on 
the basis of not fewer than two origin verifications of two or more 
importations of the good that result in the issuance of not fewer than 
two written determinations issued to that exporter or producer pursuant 
to Sec. 181.75 of this part which conclude, as a finding of fact, that 
Certificates of Origin completed and signed by that exporter or producer 
with respect to identical goods contain false or unsupported 
representations.
    (d) Differing determinations. Where Customs determines, either as a 
result of an origin verification initiated under Sec. 181.72(a) of this 
part or under any other circumstance, that a certain good imported into 
the United States does not qualify as an originating good based on a 
tariff classification or a value applied in the United States to one or 
more materials used in the production of the good, including a material 
used in the production of another material that is used in the 
production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or 
value applied to the materials by the country from which the good was 
exported, the Customs determination shall not become effective until 
Customs provides written notification thereof both to the U.S. importer 
of the good and to the person who completed and signed the Certificate 
of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the 
good was based.
    (e) Applicability of a determination to prior importations. Customs 
shall not apply a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section 
to an importation made before the effective date of the determination 
if, prior to notification of the determination, the customs 
administration of the country from which the good was exported either 
issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the NAFTA or any other 
ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, 
or gave consistent treatment to the entry of the materials under the 
tariff classification or value at issue, on which a person is entitled 
to rely and on which that person did in fact rely. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the person who received notification of the determination 
shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs, in writing within 30 
calendar days of receipt of the notification, that the conditions set 
forth herein have been met. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (1) A ``ruling'' on which a person is entitled to rely in the case 
of Canada must be issued pursuant to section 43.1(1) of the Customs Act 
(Advance Rulings) or in accordance with Departmental Memorandum 11-11-1 
(National Customs Rulings) and in the case of Mexico must be issued 
pursuant to Article 34 of the Codigo Fiscal de la Federacion and 
pursuant to Article 30 of the Ley Aduanera or the applicable provision 
of Mexican law related to advance rulings under Article 509 of the 
NAFTA; and
    (2) ``Consistent treatment'' means the established application by 
the Canadian or Mexican customs administration that can be substantiated 
by the continued acceptance by the customs administration of the tariff 
classification or value of identical materials on importations of the 
materials into Canada or Mexico by the same importer over a period of 
not less than two years immediately prior to the date of signature of 
the Certificate of Origin for the good that is the subject of the 
determination referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, provided 
that with regard to those importations:
    (i) The tariff classification or value of the materials was not the 
subject of a verification, review or appeal by that customs 
administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of 
this section; and
    (ii) The materials had not been accorded a different tariff 
classification or value by one or more district, regional or local 
offices of that customs administration on the date of the determination 
under paragraph (d) of this section.

[[Page 335]]

    (f) Detrimental reliance. If Customs proposes to deny preferential 
tariff treatment to a good pursuant to a determination made under 
paragraph (d) of this section, Customs shall postpone the application of 
the determination for a period not exceeding 90 calendar days from the 
date of issuance of the determination where the U.S. importer of the 
good, or the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin 
upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was 
based, demonstrates to the satisfaction of Customs that it has relied in 
good faith to its detriment on the tariff classification or value 
applied to such materials by the customs administration of the country 
from which the good was exported.

                          Subpart H--Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 181.81  Applicability to NAFTA transactions.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 181.82 of this part, all 
criminal, civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on U.S. 
importers, exporters and producers for violations of the Customs and 
related laws and regulations shall also apply to U.S. importers, 
exporters and producers for violations of the laws and regulations 
relating to the NAFTA.


<R05>
Sec. 181.82  Exceptions to application of penalties.

    (a) General. A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration under 
Sec. 181.21(b) of this part shall not be subject to civil or 
administrative penalties for having made an incorrect declaration, 
provided that the corrected declaration was voluntarily made. In 
addition, civil or administrative penalties provided for under the U.S. 
Customs laws and regulations shall not be imposed on an exporter or 
producer in the United States who voluntarily provides written 
notification pursuant to Sec. 181.11(d) of this part with respect to the 
making of an incorrect certification.
    (b) ``Voluntarily'' defined--(1) General. For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, the making of a corrected declaration or the 
providing of written notification of an incorrect certification will be 
deemed to have been done voluntarily if:
    (i) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation;
    (ii) Done before any of the events specified in Sec. 162.74(g) of 
this chapter have occurred;
    (iii) Done within 30 calendar days after either the U.S. importer 
with respect to a declaration that an imported good qualified as an 
originating good, or the U.S. exporter or producer with respect to a 
certification pertaining to a good exported to Canada or Mexico, had 
reason to believe that the declaration or certification was not correct;
    (iv) Accompanied by a written statement setting forth the 
information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and
    (v) In the case of a corrected declaration, accompanied or followed 
by a tender of any actual loss of duties in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section.
    (2) Cases involving fraud. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, a person who acted by means of fraud in making an incorrect 
declaration or certification may not make a voluntary correction 
thereof. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the term ``fraud'' shall 
have the meaning set forth in paragraph (B)(3) of appendix B to part 171 
of this chapter.
    (3) Written statement. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, each corrected declaration or notification of an incorrect 
certification shall be accompanied by a written statement which:
    (i) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect 
declaration or certification relates;
    (ii) Identifies each import or export transaction affected by the 
incorrect declaration or certification with reference to each port of 
importation or exportation and the approximate date of each importation 
or exportation. A U.S. producer who provides written notification that 
certain information in a Certificate of Origin is incorrect and who is 
unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph 
shall provide as much information concerning those transactions as the 
producer, by the exercise of good

[[Page 336]]

faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;
    (iii) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions 
regarding the declaration or certification; and
    (iv) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and 
accurate information or data which should have been covered by or 
provided in the declaration or certification, and states that the person 
will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the 
time of making the corrected declaration or certification within 30 
calendar days or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs 
may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.
    (4) Substantial compliance. For purposes of this section, a person 
shall be deemed to have voluntarily corrected a declaration or 
certification even though that person provides corrected information in 
a manner which does not conform to the requirements of the written 
statement specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provided that:
    (i) Customs is satisfied that the information was provided before 
the commencement of a formal investigation; and
    (ii) The information provided includes, orally or in writing, 
substantially the same information as that specified in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section.
    (5) Tender of actual loss of duties. A U.S. importer who makes a 
corrected declaration shall tender any actual loss of duties at the time 
of making the corrected declaration, or within 30 calendar days 
thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may 
allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data 
necessary to calculate the duties owed.
    (6) Applicability of prior disclosure provisions. Where a person 
fails to meet the requirements of this section because the correction of 
the declaration or the written notification of an incorrect 
certification is not considered to be done voluntarily as provided in 
this section, that person may nevertheless qualify for prior disclosure 
treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1592(c)(4) and the regulations issued 
thereunder.


<R04>
                  Subpart I--Advance Ruling Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 181.91  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the rules which govern the issuance and 
application of advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA and the 
procedures which apply for purposes of review of advance rulings under 
Article 510 of the NAFTA. Importers in the United States and exporters 
and producers located in Canada or Mexico may request and obtain an 
advance ruling on a NAFTA transaction only in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart whenever the requested ruling involves a 
subject matter specified in Sec. 181.92(b)(6) of this part. Accordingly, 
the provisions of this subpart shall apply in lieu of the administrative 
ruling provisions contained in subpart A of part 177 of this chapter 
except where the request for a ruling involves a subject matter not 
specified in Sec. 181.92(b)(6).


<R05>
Sec. 181.92  Definitions and general NAFTA advance ruling practice.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this subpart:
    (1) An advance ruling is a written statement issued by the 
Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by 
such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that 
interprets and applies the provisions of NAFTA to a specific set of 
facts involving any subject matter specified in Sec. 181.92(b)(6) of 
this part. An ``advance ruling letter'' is an advance ruling issued in 
response to a written request and set forth in a letter addressed to the 
person making the request or his designee. A ``published advance 
ruling'' is an advance ruling which has been published in full text in 
the Customs Bulletin.
    (2) An authorized agent is a person expressly authorized by a 
principal to act on his or her behalf. An advance ruling requested by an 
attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement 
describing the authority under which the request is made. With the 
exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person 
appearing before Customs as an agent in connection with an advance

[[Page 337]]

ruling request may be required to present evidence of his or her 
authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will 
not apply to an individual representing his or her full-time employer or 
to a bona-fide officer, director or other qualified representative of a 
corporation, association, or organized group.
    (3) The term Headquarters Office, means the Office of Regulations 
and Rulings at Headquarters, United States Customs Service, Washington, 
DC.
    (4) An information letter is a written statement issued by the 
Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by 
such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that does 
no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation of 
principles under the NAFTA, without applying it to a specific set of 
facts. If Customs believes that general information may be of some 
benefit to the person making the request, an information letter may be 
issued in response to a request for an advance ruling when:
    (i) The request suggests that general information, rather than an 
advance ruling, is actually being sought;
    (ii) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the 
requirements set forth in this subpart; or
    (iii) The requested advance ruling cannot be issued for any other 
reason.
    (5) A NAFTA transaction is an act or activity to which the NAFTA 
provisions apply. A ``prospective'' NAFTA transaction is one that is 
merely contemplated or is currently being undertaken but has not 
resulted in any arrival or in the filing of any entry or entry summary 
or other document or in any other act so as to bring the transaction, or 
any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs office. A 
``current'' NAFTA transaction is one which is presently under 
consideration by a field office of Customs. A ``completed'' NAFTA 
transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs field office 
and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which 
is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest 
or other review as provided in the applicable Customs laws and 
regulations. An ``ongoing'' NAFTA transaction is a series of identical, 
recurring transactions, consisting of current and completed transactions 
where future transactions are contemplated.
    (6) The term National Commodity Specialist Division means the 
National Commodity Specialist Division, United States Customs Service, 
New York, New York.
    (b) General advance ruling practice. An advance ruling may be 
requested under the provisions of this subpart with respect to 
prospective NAFTA transactions. An advance ruling will be based on the 
facts and circumstances presented by the requester.
    (1) Prospective NAFTA transactions. It is in the interest of the 
sound administration of the NAFTA that persons engaging in any 
transaction affected by NAFTA fully understand the consequences of that 
transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, Customs will 
give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers 
in the United States and exporters or producers in Canada or Mexico for 
advance rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a 
specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of 
applicable law or other appropriate information.
    (2) Current or ongoing NAFTA transactions. A question arising in 
connection with a NAFTA transaction already before a Customs field 
office by reason of arrival, entry or otherwise will be resolved by that 
office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously 
announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be 
resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in the 
NAFTA or the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury 
Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the 
Customs Bulletin, that field office may, if it believes it appropriate, 
forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration.
    (3) Completed NAFTA transactions. A question arising in connection 
with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection 
with any other completed NAFTA transaction, may not be the subject of an 
advance ruling request under this subpart.

[[Page 338]]

    (4) Oral advice. Customs will not issue an advance ruling in 
response to an oral request. Oral opinions or advice of Customs 
personnel are not binding on Customs. However, oral inquiries may be 
made to Customs offices regarding existing advance rulings, the scope of 
such advance rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which 
Customs will issue advance rulings, the scope of the advance rulings 
which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting 
advance ruling requests, as prescribed in this subpart.
    (5) Who may request an advance ruling. An advance ruling may be 
requested by any of the following persons (individuals, corporations, 
partnerships, associations, or other entities or groups) having a direct 
and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the 
advance ruling request, or by the authorized agent of any such person:
    (i) An importer in the United States;
    (ii) An exporter or a producer of a good in Canada or Mexico; or
    (iii) A Canadian or Mexican producer of a material that is used in 
the production of a good imported into the United States, but only with 
regard to that material and only in regard to a matter described in 
paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (v) and (vii) of this section.
    (6) Subject matter of advance rulings. Customs shall issue advance 
rulings under this subpart concerning the following:
    (i) Whether materials imported from a country other than the United 
States, Canada or Mexico and used in the production of a good undergo an 
applicable change in tariff classification set forth in General Note 12, 
HTSUS, as a result of production occurring entirely in the United 
States, Canada and/or Mexico;
    (ii) Whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement 
under the transaction value method or under the net cost method as 
provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part;
     (iii) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a 
regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and 
under this part, the appropriate basis or method for value to be applied 
by an exporter or a producer in Canada or Mexico, in accordance with the 
principles set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the 
transaction value of the good or of the materials used in the production 
of the good;
     (iv) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a 
regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and 
under this part, the appropriate basis or method for reasonably 
allocating costs, in accordance with the allocation methods set forth in 
the appendix to this part, for calculating the net cost of the good or 
the value of an intermediate material;
     (v) Whether a good qualifies as an originating good under General 
Note 12, HTSUS, and under the appendix to this part;
     (vi) Whether a good that re-enters the United States after having 
been exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico for repair or 
alteration qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with 
Sec. 181.64 of this part;
     (vii) Whether the proposed or actual marking of a good satisfies 
country of origin marking requirements under part 134 of this chapter 
and under the Marking Rules set forth in part 102 of this chapter;
     (viii) Whether an originating good qualifies as a good of Canada or 
Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 and Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; 
and
     (ix) Whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the 
NAFTA.


<R05>
Sec. 181.93  Submission of advance ruling requests.

     (a) Form. A request for an advance ruling should be written in the 
English language and in the form of a letter. For any subject matter 
specified in Sec. 181.92(b)(6) (i), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii) or (ix) of 
this part, the request may be directed either to the Commissioner of 
Customs, Attention: Office of Regulations and Rulings, Washington, DC 
20229, or to the National Commodity Specialist Division, United States 
Customs Service, 6 World Trade Center, New York, NY 10048. For any 
subject matter specified in Sec. 181.92(b)(6)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this 
part, the request must be

[[Page 339]]

directed to the Commissioner of Customs, Attention: Office of 
Regulations and Rulings, Washington, DC 20229.
     (b) Content--(1) General. Each request for an advance ruling must 
identify the specific subject matter under Sec. 181.92(b)(6) of this 
part to which the request relates, must contain a complete statement of 
all relevant facts relating to the NAFTA transaction and must state that 
the information presented is accurate and complete. The following facts 
must be included: the names, addresses, and other identifying 
information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port 
or place at which any good involved in the transaction will be imported 
or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or 
activity described in the transaction; and a description of the 
transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the subject matter of the 
requested advance ruling. Where the request for an advance ruling is 
submitted by or on behalf of the importer of the good involved in the 
transaction, the request must include the name and address of the 
exporter and, if known, producer of the good. Where the request for an 
advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the exporter of the good 
involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and 
address of the producer and importer of the good, if known. Where the 
request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the 
producer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must 
include the name and address of the exporter and importer of the good, 
if known. In addition, where relevant to the issue that is the subject 
of the request for an advance ruling, and regardless of the specific 
nature of the advance ruling requested, the request must include:
     (i) A copy of any advance ruling or other ruling with respect to 
the tariff classification of the good that has been issued by Customs to 
the person submitting the request; or
     (ii) Sufficient information to enable Customs to classify the good 
where no advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff 
classification of the good has been issued by Customs to the person 
submitting the request. Such information includes a full description of 
the good, including, where relevant, the composition of the good, a 
description of the process by which the good is manufactured, a 
description of the packaging in which the good is contained, the 
anticipated use of the good and its commercial, common or technical 
designation, and product literature, drawings, photographs or 
schematics.
     (2) Description of transaction--(i) General. The prospective 
Customs transaction to which the advance ruling request relates must be 
described in sufficient detail to permit proper application of the 
relevant NAFTA provisions.
     (ii) Tariff change rulings--(A) General. If the transaction 
involves the importation of a good or material for which a ruling is 
requested as to whether a change in tariff classification has occurred, 
the request should set forth: The principal or chief use of the good or 
material in the United States and the commercial, common, or technical 
designation of the good or material; if the good or material is composed 
of two or more substances, the relative quantity (by both weight and by 
volume) and value of each substance; any applicable special invoicing 
requirements set forth in part 141 of this chapter (if known); and any 
other information which may assist in determining the appropriate tariff 
classification of the good or material. The advance ruling request 
should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the good or 
material, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Each 
individual request for an advance ruling must be limited to five 
merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind. Only 
NAFTA tariff change rulings will be issued under this subpart. Tariff 
classification rulings which do not involve the application of the NAFTA 
shall be issued under part 177 of this chapter.
     (B) Issues involving a change in tariff classification of a 
material. Where the request for the advance ruling involves the 
application of a rule of origin that requires an assessment of whether 
materials used in the production of an imported good undergo an 
applicable change in tariff classification, the request must list each 
material used in the production of the good and must:

[[Page 340]]

     (1) Identify each material which is claimed to be an originating 
material and provide a complete description of each such material, 
including the basis for the claim as to originating status;
     (2) Identify each material which is a non-originating material, or 
for which the origin is unknown, and provide a complete description of 
each such material, including its tariff classification if known; and
     (3) Describe all processing operations employed in the production 
of the good, the location of each operation and the sequence in which 
the operations occur.
     (iii) NAFTA rulings on regional value content. NAFTA advance ruling 
requests, if involving the issue of whether a good satisfies a regional 
value content requirement under the transaction value method or under 
the net cost method, or under both methods, as provided for in General 
Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, must specify each 
method under which eligibility is sought. Where the transaction value 
method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: 
information sufficient to calculate the transaction value of the good in 
accordance with schedule II of the appendix to this part with respect to 
the transaction of the producer of the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. 
basis; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-
originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that 
is used by the producer in the production of the good in accordance with 
the provisions of section 7 and, where applicable, section 6(10) of the 
appendix to this part; a complete description of each material that is 
claimed to be an originating material and that is used in the production 
of the good, including the basis for the claim as to originating status; 
information sufficient to permit an examination of the factors 
enumerated in schedule III or VIII of the appendix to this part where 
the advance ruling request involves an issue of whether, with respect to 
the good or material under the applicable schedule, the transaction 
value is acceptable; and information sufficient for any other 
circumstance to make any determination relevant to the application of 
the regional value content requirement to the good. Where the net cost 
method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: a list of 
all product, period and other costs relevant to determining the total 
cost of the good as defined in the appendix to this part; a list of all 
excluded costs to be subtracted from the total cost of the good as 
provided in the appendix to this part; information sufficient to 
calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the 
origin of which is unknown, that is used in the production of the good, 
in accordance with section 7 of the appendix to this part; the basis for 
any allocation of costs in accordance with schedule VII of the appendix 
to this part; the period over which the net cost calculation is to be 
made; and any other information relevant to determining the appropriate 
value of any cost under this part. Where the advance ruling request 
concerns only the calculation of an element of a regional value content 
formula, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only contain the 
following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), other than the 
information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii); the 
information in paragraph (b)(5); and any information in this paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the 
request.
    (iv) NAFTA rulings on producer materials. Where the advance ruling 
request involves an issue with respect to an intermediate material under 
Article 402(10) of the NAFTA (see section 7(4) of the appendix to this 
part), the request must contain sufficient information to determine the 
origin and value of the material in accordance with Article 402(11) of 
the NAFTA (see section 7(6) of the appendix to this part). Where the 
advance ruling request is submitted by a Canadian or Mexican producer of 
a material under Sec. 181.92(b)(5)(iii) of this part and concerns only 
the origin of such material, and with regard to the information 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the 
request need only include the following: the information in paragraph 
(b)(1), including any information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or 
(b)(1)(ii) which is relevant to the issue that is

[[Page 341]]

the subject of the request; any information in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) 
which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; a 
sample as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) if relevant to the issue that 
is the subject of the request; and the information in paragraph (b)(5).
    (3) Samples. Each request for an advance ruling should be 
accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations 
of the good and, whenever possible, by a sample of the good unless a 
precise description of the good is not essential to the advance ruling 
requested. Any good consisting of materials in chemical or physical 
combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for 
the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis, flow charts, 
CAS number, and related information. A sample submitted in connection 
with a request for an advance ruling becomes a part of the Customs file 
in the matter and will be retained until the advance ruling is issued or 
the advance ruling request is otherwise disposed of. A sample should 
only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be 
damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or 
other actions undertaken in connection with the advance ruling request.
    (4) Related documents. If the question or questions presented in the 
advance ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any 
invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document 
must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be 
submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the 
advance ruling request become a part of the Customs file in the matter 
and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents 
submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or 
questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the advance ruling 
request.
    (5) Prior or current transactions.--(i) General. Each request for an 
advance ruling must state:
    (A) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, 
the same transaction or issue, or one identical to it, has ever been 
considered, or is currently being considered by any Customs office;
    (B) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, 
the issue involved has ever been, or is currently, the subject of:
    (1) Review by the United States Court of International Trade, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of 
appeal therefrom, or review by a judicial or quasi-judicial body in 
Canada or Mexico;
    (2) A verification of origin performed in the United States, Canada 
or Mexico;
    (3) An administrative appeal in the United States, Canada or Mexico; 
or
    (4) A request for an advance ruling under this subpart, or a request 
for an advance ruling in Canada or Mexico under an appropriate authority 
referred to in Sec. 181.76(d)(1) of this part;
    (C) The status or disposition of any matter on which an affirmative 
statement is made under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section; and
    (D) Whether the transaction described in the advance ruling request 
is but one of a series of similar and related transactions.
    (ii) Change in status of transaction. If a prospective transaction 
which is the subject of an advance ruling request becomes a current 
transaction, the person who submitted the request shall so notify the 
office processing the request.
    (6) Statement of position. If the request for an advance ruling asks 
that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the advance 
ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth 
the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation 
of all relevant supporting authority.
    (7) Privileged or confidential information. Information which is 
claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential 
commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions 
of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm 
to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of

[[Page 342]]

another interested party) must be identified clearly, and the reasons 
such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, 
the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the 
competitive position of the person making the request (or of another 
interested party), must be set forth. An advance ruling will not be 
issued until all trade secret, privilege or confidentiality issues are 
resolved (see Sec. 181.99(a)(3) of this part).
    (c) Signing; instruction as to reply. The request for an advance 
ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as 
described in Sec. 181.92(b)(5) of this part. An advance ruling requested 
by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the advance ruling 
letter be addressed to the other.
    (d) Requests for immediate consideration. Customs will normally 
process requests for advance rulings in the order they are received and 
as expeditiously as possible, as specified in Sec. 181.99 of this part. 
However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead 
of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is 
submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such 
treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances 
warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram 
or electronic transmission will be treated in the same manner as 
requests made by letter, but advance rulings will not be issued by 
telegram or electronic transmission. A telegram or electronic 
transmission must be followed up with a signed original within 14 
calendar days of the submission of the telegram or electronic 
transmission. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular 
request for an advance ruling will be acted upon by the time requested.


<R05>
Sec. 181.94  Nonconforming requests for advance rulings.

    A person submitting a request for an advance ruling that does not 
comply with all of the provisions of this subpart will be so notified in 
writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed 
out. Such person will be given a period of 30 calendar days from the 
date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to 
supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform 
the advance ruling request to the requirements referred to in the 
notice. The Customs file with respect to advance ruling requests which 
are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this subpart 
within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and 
the request removed from active consideration. A request for an advance 
ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failure to 
comply with the provisions of this subpart may be treated as withdrawn. 
A failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart will result in 
the rejection of the advance ruling request with the notice specifying 
the deficiencies.


<R05>
Sec. 181.95  Oral discussion of issues.

    (a) General. A person submitting a request for an advance ruling and 
desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved 
should indicate that desire in writing at the time the advance ruling 
request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the 
opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is 
under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue 
or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to 
that advocated in the advance ruling request is contemplated. 
Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an 
opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the 
advance ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by 
any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by 
implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently 
agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with 
the issuance of an advance ruling letter.
    (b) Time, place and number of conferences. If a request for a 
conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of 
the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with 
respect to the matters set forth in an advance ruling request will be 
scheduled, unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the

[[Page 343]]

advance ruling request is under consideration, additional conferences 
are necessary.
    (c) Representation. A person whose request for a conference has been 
granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other 
representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference 
in his or her place.
    (d) Additional information presented at conferences. It will be the 
responsibility of the person submitting the request for an advance 
ruling to provide for inclusion in the Customs file in the matter a 
written record setting forth any and all additional information, 
documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent 
that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the 
advance ruling request. Such information, documents and exhibits shall 
be given consideration only if received by Customs within 30 calendar 
days following the conference.


<R05>
Sec. 181.96   Change in status of transaction.

    Each person submitting a request for an advance ruling in connection 
with a NAFTA transaction must immediately advise Customs in writing of 
any change in the status of that transaction upon becoming aware of the 
change. In particular, Customs must be advised when any transaction 
described in the advance ruling request as prospective becomes current 
and under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office. In addition, any 
person engaged in a NAFTA transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a 
Customs field office who has previously requested a NAFTA advance ruling 
with respect to that transaction must advise the field office of that 
fact.


<R05>
Sec. 181.97  Withdrawal of NAFTA advance ruling requests.

    Any request for an advance ruling may be withdrawn by the person 
submitting it at any time before the issuance of an advance ruling 
letter or any other final disposition of the request. All 
correspondence, documents, and exhibits submitted in connection with the 
request will be retained in the Customs file and will not be returned. 
In addition, the Headquarters Office may forward, to Customs field 
offices which have or may have jurisdiction over the transaction to 
which the advance ruling request relates, its views in regard to the 
transaction or the issues involved therein, as well as appropriate 
information derived from materials in the Customs file.


<R05>
Sec. 181.98  Situations in which no NAFTA advance ruling may be issued.

    (a) General. No advance ruling letter will be issued in response to 
a request therefor which fails to comply with the provisions of this 
subpart. No advance ruling letter will be issued in regard to a 
completed transaction.
    (b) Pending matters. Where a request for an advance ruling involves 
an issue that is under review in connection with an origin verification 
under subpart G of this part or that is the subject of an administrative 
review procedure provided for in subpart J of this part or in part 174 
of this chapter, Customs may decline to issue the requested advance 
ruling. In addition, no NAFTA advance ruling letter will be issued with 
respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of 
International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other 
court will not preclude the issuance of an advance ruling letter, 
provided neither Customs nor any of its officers or agents is named as a 
party to the action.


<R05>
Sec. 181.99  Issuance of NAFTA advance rulings or other advice.

    (a) NAFTA advance ruling letters--(1) General. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Customs will, within 120 
calendar days of receipt of a request, including any required 
information supplemental thereto, issue an advance ruling letter in the 
English language setting forth the position of Customs and the reasons 
therefor with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction 
whenever a request for such an advance ruling is submitted in accordance 
with the provisions of this subpart and it is in the sound 
administration of the NAFTA provisions to do so. Otherwise, a request 
for an advance ruling will be

[[Page 344]]

answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which 
general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter 
stating that no advance ruling can be issued. In the course of 
evaluating the advance ruling request Customs may solicit supplemental 
information from the person requesting the advance ruling. The 
submission of supplemental information will extend the time for 
response. The time for response will also be extended if it is necessary 
to obtain information from other government agencies or in the form of a 
laboratory analysis.
    (2) Submission of NAFTA advance ruling letters to field offices. Any 
importer engaging in a NAFTA transaction with respect to which an 
advance ruling letter has been issued under this subpart either must 
ensure that a copy of the advance ruling letter is attached to the 
documents filed with the appropriate Customs office in connection with 
that transaction or must otherwise indicate with the information filed 
for that transaction that an advance ruling has been received. Any 
person receiving an advance ruling stating Customs determination must 
set forth such determination in the documents or information filed in 
connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; failure to do 
so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such 
penalties as may be appropriate. An advance ruling received after the 
filing of such documents or information must immediately be brought to 
the attention of the appropriate Customs field office.
    (3) Disclosure of NAFTA advance ruling letters. No part of the 
advance ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information 
relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be 
deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial 
information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and part 103 of 
this chapter, or shall be deemed to be subject to the confidentiality 
principle set forth in Sec. 181.121 of this part, unless, as provided in 
Sec. 181.93(b)(7) of this part, the information claimed to be exempt 
from disclosure is clearly identified and a valid basis for 
nondisclosure is set forth. Before the issuance of the advance ruling 
letter, the person submitting the advance ruling request will be 
notified of any decision adverse to his request for nondisclosure and 
will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date 
of notification, be permitted to withdraw the advance ruling request. If 
in the opinion of Customs an impasse exists on the issue of 
confidentiality and the person who submitted the advance ruling request 
does not withdraw the request, Customs will decline to issue the advance 
ruling. All advance ruling letters issued by Customs will be available, 
upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any 
portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).
    (4) Penalties for misrepresented or omitted material facts or for 
noncompliance. If Customs determines that an issued advance ruling was 
based on incorrect information, the person to whom the advance ruling 
was issued may be subject to appropriate penalties unless that person 
demonstrates that he used reasonable care and acted in good faith in 
presenting the facts and circumstances on which the advance ruling was 
based. In addition, Customs may apply such measures as the circumstances 
may warrant in a case where a person to whom an advance ruling was 
issued has failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
the advance ruling.
    (b) Other NAFTA advice and guidance. The Headquarters Office may on 
its own initiative from time to time issue other external advice and 
guidance with respect to issues or transactions arising under the NAFTA 
which come to its attention. Such NAFTA advice and guidance, which 
represent the official position of Customs and which are likely to be of 
widespread interest and application, are published in the Customs 
Bulletin, as described in Sec. 181.101 of this part. Nothing in this 
subpart shall preclude Customs from issuing advice and guidance to its 
field offices concerning the application of the NAFTA.

[[Page 345]]


<R05>
Sec. 181.100  Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters; modification and revocation.

    (a) Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters--(1) General. An advance 
ruling letter issued by Customs under the provisions of this subpart 
represents the official position of Customs with respect to the 
particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all 
Customs personnel in accordance with the provisions of this subpart 
until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or 
other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the 
advance ruling set forth in the advance ruling letter, that principle 
may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving 
the same circumstances. An advance ruling letter is generally effective 
on the date it is issued or such later date as may be specified in the 
advance ruling and, commencing on its effective date, may be applied to 
entries for consumption and warehouse withdrawals for consumption which 
are unliquidated, or to other transactions with respect to which Customs 
has not taken final action on that date. See, however, paragraph (b) of 
this section (ruling letters which modify previous advance ruling 
letters) and Sec. 181.101 of this part (advance ruling letters published 
in the Customs Bulletin).
    (2) Application of NAFTA rulings to transactions--(i) General. Each 
NAFTA ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the 
information furnished in connection with the ruling request and 
incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by 
implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The 
application of an advance ruling letter by a Customs field office to the 
transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the 
verification of the facts incorporated in the advance ruling letter, a 
comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual 
transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the advance 
ruling was based, and if the facts are materially different or a 
condition has not been satisfied, the treatment specified in the advance 
ruling will not be applied to the actual transaction. If, in the opinion 
of any Customs field office by whom the transaction is under 
consideration or review, the advance ruling letter should be modified or 
revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be 
forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, prior to any 
final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. If the 
transaction described in the NAFTA advance ruling letter and the actual 
transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the 
advance ruling letter have been satisfied, the advance ruling will be 
applied to the transaction.
    (ii) Tariff change rulings. Each advance ruling letter concerning 
whether a change in tariff classification has occurred will be applied 
only with respect to transactions involving either articles which are 
identical to the sample submitted with the advance ruling request and 
reflect the same processing or articles which conform to the description 
set forth in the advance ruling letter.
    (iii) Regional value content rulings. Each advance ruling letter 
concerning the application of a regional value content requirement will 
be applied only with respect to transactions involving the same 
merchandise and identical facts.
    (3) Reliance on NAFTA advance rulings by others. An advance ruling 
letter is subject to modification or revocation without notice to any 
person other than the person to whom the letter was addressed. 
Accordingly, no other person may rely on the advance ruling letter or 
assume that the principles of that advance ruling will be applied in 
connection with any transaction other than the one described in the 
letter. However, any person eligible to request an advance ruling under 
Sec. 181.92(b)(5) of this part may request information as to whether a 
previously-issued advance ruling letter has been modified or revoked by 
writing the Commissioner of Customs, Attention: Office of Regulations 
and Rulings, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the 
advance ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to 
permit the advance ruling letter in question to be identified.

[[Page 346]]

    (b) Modification or revocation of NAFTA advance ruling letters--(1) 
General. Any NAFTA advance ruling letter may be modified or revoked by 
Customs Headquarters in any of the following circumstances or for any of 
the following purposes, provided that written notice of the modification 
or revocation is given to the person to whom the advance ruling letter 
was addressed:
    (i) If the ruling letter reflects or is based on an error:
    (A) Of fact;
    (B) In the tariff classification of a good or material that is the 
subject of the ruling;
    (C) In the application of a regional value-content requirement under 
General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part;
    (D) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good 
qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 
or Chapter Seven of the NAFTA;
    (E) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good 
is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; or
    (F) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good 
qualifies for duty-free treatment under Sec. 181.64 of this part when 
the good re-enters the United States after having been exported to 
Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration;
    (ii) If the ruling letter is not in accordance with an 
interpretation agreed on by the United States, Canada and Mexico 
regarding Chapter Three or Chapter Four of the NAFTA;
    (iii) If there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on 
which the ruling is based;
    (iv) To conform to a modification of Chapter Three, Four, Five or 
Seven of the NAFTA, or of the Marking Rules, or of the regulations set 
forth in this part; or
    (v) To conform to a judicial decision or change in domestic law.
    (2) Application of modification or revocation of NAFTA advance 
ruling letters. The modification or revocation of a NAFTA advance ruling 
letter will not be applied to entries or warehouse withdrawals for 
consumption which were made prior to the effective date of such 
modification or revocation, except where the person to whom the advance 
ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and 
conditions.
    (3) Effective dates. Generally, a NAFTA letter modifying or revoking 
an earlier advance ruling will be effective on the date it is issued. 
However, Customs may, upon request or on its own initiative, delay the 
effective date of such a modification or revocation for a period of up 
to 90 calendar days from the date of issuance. Such a delay may be 
granted at the request of the party to whom the ruling letter was 
issued, provided such party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
Customs that it relied on the earlier advance ruling in good faith and 
to its detriment. The evidence of such reliance must cover the period 
from the date of the letter modifying or revoking the advance ruling 
back to the date of that advance ruling and must list all transactions 
claimed to be covered by the modified or revoked advance ruling by entry 
number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of 
merchandise covered by each such transaction (where applicable), the 
ports of entry, and the dates of final action by Customs. Such evidence 
must also include contracts, purchase orders, or other materials tending 
to establish that future transactions were arranged based on the earlier 
advance ruling. The request for delay must specifically identify the 
prior ruling on which reliance is claimed. All persons requesting a 
delay will be issued a separate letter setting forth the period, if any, 
of the delay to be provided. In appropriate circumstances, Customs may 
decide to make its decision, with respect to a delay, applicable to all 
persons, irrespective of demonstrated reliance; in this event, a notice 
announcing the delay will be published in the Customs Bulletin and 
individual ruling letters will not be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 181.101  Publication of decisions.

    Within 90 days after issuing any precedential decision relating to 
any NAFTA transaction, Customs shall publish the decision in the Customs 
Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. 
Disclosure is

[[Page 347]]

governed by 31 CFR part 1, part 103 of this chapter, and 
Sec. 181.99(a)(3) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 181.102  Administrative and judicial review of advance rulings.

    (a) Administrative review--(1) Submission of request for review. Any 
person who received an advance ruling issued under this subpart, or an 
authorized agent of such person, may request administrative review, at 
Customs Headquarters, of that advance ruling, including any modification 
or revocation thereof, by letter addressed to the Assistant 
Commissioner, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service, 
Washington, DC 20229. Such request shall be filed within 30 calendar 
days after issuance of the advance ruling and shall set forth the 
following information:
    (i) The name and address of the person seeking review and the name 
and address of his authorized agent if the request is signed by such an 
agent;
    (ii) The Customs identification number or employer identification 
number in the case of a U.S. importer and authorized agent thereof, the 
employer number or importer/exporter number assigned by Revenue Canada 
in the case of a Canadian exporter or producer and authorized agent 
thereof, and the federal taxpayer registry number (RFC) in the case of a 
Mexican exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof;
    (iii) The number and date of the advance ruling at issue;
    (iv) The numbers and dates of any involved entries for consumption 
or warehouse withdrawals for consumption;
    (v) The nature of, and justification for, the objection to the 
advance ruling set forth distinctly and specifically with respect to 
each aspect of the advance ruling for which administrative review is 
sought; and
    (vi) Whether an oral discussion of the issues, as provided in 
Sec. 181.95 of this part, is desired.
    (2) Issuance of review decision. Customs will normally issue a 
written decision within 120 days of receipt of the request for 
administrative review submitted under this section. However, Customs 
will, upon a reasonable showing of business necessity, issue a written 
decision within 60 days of receipt of the request for administrative 
review. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the 
request for administrative review shall be the date on which all 
information necessary to process the request, including any information 
provided after submission of the request in connection with a 
conference, is filed with Customs.
    (b) Judicial review. Any person whose claims with regard to a 
request for administrative review of an advance ruling have been denied 
in whole or in part under this section may seek judicial review by 
filing a civil action in the United States Court of International Trade 
in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 2632 within 180 days after the date of 
mailing of notice of the denial.


<R04>
        Subpart J--Review and Appeal of Adverse Marking Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 181.111  Applicability.

    This subpart sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which 
exporters and producers of merchandise imported into the United States 
may obtain information about, and administrative and judicial review of, 
an adverse marking decision, as provided for in Article 510 of the 
NAFTA. This subpart does not apply to the review of advance rulings 
issued under Article 509 of the NAFTA (see subpart I of this part) or to 
the review of determinations that a good is not an originating good 
under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part (see part 
174 of this chapter).


<R05>
Sec. 181.112  Definitions.

     For purposes of this subpart, the following words and phrases have 
the meanings indicated:
    (a) Adverse marking decision means a decision made by the port 
director which an exporter or producer of merchandise believes to be 
contrary to the provisions of Annex 311 of the NAFTA and which may be 
protested by the importer pursuant to Sec. 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter. Notification of 
an adverse marking decision is given to an importer in the form of a 
Customs

[[Page 348]]

Form 4647 (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver) and/or by 
assessing marking duties on improperly marked merchandise. Examples of 
adverse marking decisions include determinations by the port director: 
that an imported article is not a good of a NAFTA country, as determined 
under the Marking Rules, and that it therefore cannot be marked 
``Canada'' or ``Mexico''; that a good of a NAFTA country is not marked 
in a manner which is sufficiently permanent; and that a good of a NAFTA 
country does not qualify for an exception from marking specified in 
Annex 311 of the NAFTA. Adverse marking decisions do not include: 
decisions issued in response to requests for advance rulings under 
subpart I of this part or for internal advice under part 177 of this 
chapter; decisions on protests under part 174 of this chapter; and 
determinations that an article does not qualify as an originating good 
under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part.
    (b) An exporter of merchandise is an exporter located in Canada or 
Mexico who must maintain records in that country relating to the 
transaction to which the adverse marking decision relates. The records 
must be sufficient to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of the 
exporter's claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision.
    (c) A producer of merchandise is a person who grows, mines, 
harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes or assembles 
such merchandise in Canada or Mexico.


<R05>
Sec. 181.113  Request for basis of adverse marking decision.

    (a) Request; form and filing. The exporter or producer of the 
merchandise which is the subject of an adverse marking decision may 
request a statement concerning the basis for the decision by filing a 
typewritten request, in English, with the port director who issued the 
decision. The request should be on letterhead paper in the form of a 
letter and clearly designated as a ``Request for Basis of Adverse 
Marking Decision'' and shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his 
authorized agent. The provisions of Sec. 174.3 of this chapter shall 
apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.
    (b) Content. The Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision 
letter shall set forth the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the exporter or producer of the 
merchandise and the name and address of any authorized agent filing the 
request on behalf of such principal;
    (2) A statement that the inquirer is the exporter or producer of the 
merchandise that was the subject of the adverse marking decision;
    (3) In the case of a Canadian exporter or producer, the employer 
number assigned by Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise; in the case of a 
Mexican exporter or producer, the Federal taxpayer registry number 
(RFC); and the Customs identification number of an authorized agent 
filing the request on behalf of such principal;
    (4) The number and date of each entry involved in the request;
    (5) A specific description of the merchandise which is the subject 
of the adverse marking decision; and
    (6) A complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the 
adverse marking decision and the transaction to which it relates, 
including the date of the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 181.114  Customs response to request.

    (a) Time for response. The port director will issue a written 
response to the requestor within 30 days of receipt of a request 
containing the information specified in Sec. 181.113 of this part. If 
the request is incomplete, such that the transaction in question cannot 
be identified, the port director will notify the requestor in writing 
within 30 days of receipt of the request regarding what information is 
needed.
    (b) Content. The response by the port director shall include the 
following:
    (1) A statement concerning the basis for the adverse marking 
decision;
    (2) A copy of the relevant Customs Form 4647 (Notice to Mark and/or 
Notice to Redeliver), if one was issued to the importer and is 
available. If the basis for the adverse marking decision is indicated on 
the Customs Form 4647, no statement under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is required;

[[Page 349]]

    (3) A statement as to whether the importer has filed a protest 
regarding the adverse marking decision and, if so, where the protest was 
filed and the protest number; and
    (4) A statement concerning the exporter's or producer's right to 
either intervene in the importer's protest as provided in Sec. 181.115 
of this part or file a petition as provided in Sec. 181.116 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 181.115  Intervention in importer's protest.

    (a) Conditional right to intervene. An exporter or producer of 
merchandise does not have an independent right to protest an adverse 
marking decision. However, if an importer protests the adverse marking 
decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer 
of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision 
may intervene in the importer's protest. Such intervention shall not 
affect any time limits applicable to the protest or delay action on the 
protest.
    (b) Form and filing of intervention. In order to intervene in an 
importer's protest, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the exporter or producer of the merchandise shall file, in triplicate, a 
typewritten statement of intervention, in English, with the port 
director with whom the protest was filed. The statement should be on 
letterhead paper in the form of a letter and should be clearly 
designated ``NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest''. The 
statement shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized 
agent. The provisions of Sec. 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for 
purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.
    (c) Content. The NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest 
letter shall include the following:
    (1) The name and address of the exporter or producer of the 
merchandise and the name and address of any authorized agent filing the 
request on behalf of such principal;
    (2) In the case of a Canadian exporter or producer, the employer 
number assigned by Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise; in the case of a 
Mexican exporter or producer, the Federal taxpayer registry number 
(RFC); and the Customs identification number of an authorized agent 
filing the request on behalf of such principal;
    (3) The number and date of each entry involved in the adverse 
marking decision;
    (4) A specific description of the merchandise which is the subject 
of the adverse marking decision;
    (5) A complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the 
adverse marking decision and the transaction to which it relates, 
including the date of the decision;
    (6) A detailed statement of position regarding why the exporter or 
producer believes the adverse marking decision is contrary to the 
provision of Annex 311 of the NAFTA;
    (7) A statement as to whether a Request for Basis of Adverse Marking 
Decision was filed under Sec. 181.113 of this part, and if so, the date 
of such Request and of any Customs response thereto issued under 
Sec. 181.114 of this part. Copies of the Request and the Customs 
response shall be submitted, if available;
    (8) The number assigned to the importer's protest;
    (9) A statement that the intervenor is the exporter or producer of 
the merchandise that was the subject of the adverse marking decision 
being protested by the importer and, if the intervenor is the exporter, 
a statement that it maintains sufficient records to enable Customs to 
evaluate the merits of its claim(s) regarding the adverse marking 
decision; and
    (10) If the intervenor prefers that the principle of confidentiality 
set forth in Sec. 181.121 of this part be applied to the information 
submitted under this section, a statement to that effect. If no such 
statement is included in the letter, the intervention and information 
submitted in connection therewith shall be subject to the same treatment 
as that provided in the case of requests by all interested parties for 
consolidation of protests as set forth in Sec. 174.15(b)(1) of this 
chapter.
    (d) Effect of Intervention. The rights of the intervenor under this 
section are subordinate to the importer's protest rights. Accordingly, 
intervention by an

[[Page 350]]

exporter or producer of merchandise will not affect the procedures under 
part 174 of this chapter, and the importer's elections concerning 
accelerated disposition and application for further review of the 
protest will govern how the protest is handled and how the intervention 
is considered. If the importer withdraws or settles the protest, the 
exporter or producer has no right to continue the intervention action.
    (e) Action by port director. If final administrative action has 
already been taken with respect to the importer's protest at the time 
the intervention is filed, the port director shall so advise the 
exporter or producer and, if the importer has filed a civil action in

marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or 
producer of the merchandise which was the subject of the adverse marking 
decision may file a petition with Customs requesting reconsideration of 
the decision. The petition may not be filed until after the importer's 
time to protest the adverse marking decision has expired (see 
Sec. 174.12(e) of this chapter for the time limits for filing protests). 
If the importer filed a protest upon which final administrative action 
has been taken, the exporter or producer may file a petition under this 
section, provided that the exporter or producer was not given notice of 
the pending protest pursuant to Sec. 181.114 of this part. If the 
importer filed a protest on which final administrative action has not 
been taken and notice of the pending protest was not provided to the 
exporter or producer under Sec. 181.114 of this part, a petition filed 
under this section shall be treated by the port director as an 
intervention under Sec. 181.115 of this part.
    (b) Form and filing of petition. A petition under this section shall 
be typewritten, in English, and shall be filed, in triplicate, with the 
port director who issued the adverse marking decision. The petition 
under this subpart should be on letterhead paper in the form of a 
letter, clearly designated as a ``Petition for NAFTA Review of Adverse 
Marking Decision'' and shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his 
authorized agent. The provisions of Sec. 174.3 of this chapter shall 
apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.
    (c) Content. The Petition for NAFTA Review of Adverse Marking 
Decision letter shall contain all the information specified Sec. 181.115 
of this part, except for the protest number. It shall also include a 
statement that petitioner was not notified by Customs in writing of a 
pending protest.
    (d) Review of petition--(1) Review by port director. Within 60 days 
of the date of receipt of the petition, the port director shall 
determine if the petition is to be granted or denied, in whole or in 
part. If, after reviewing the petition, the port director agrees with 
all of the petitioner's claims and determines that the initial adverse 
marking decision was not correct, a written notice granting the petition 
shall be issued to the petitioner. A description of the merchandise, a 
brief summary of the issue(s) and the port director's findings shall be 
forwarded to the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, 
Customs Headquarters, for publication in the Customs Bulletin. If, after 
reviewing the petition, the port director determines that the initial 
adverse marking decision was correct in its entirety, a written notice 
shall be issued to the petitioner advising that the matter has

[[Page 351]]

been forwarded to the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, 
Customs Headquarters, for further review and decision. All relevant 
background information, including available samples, a description of 
the adverse marking decision and the reasons for the decision, and the 
port director's recommendation shall be furnished to Headquarters.
    (2) Review by Headquarters. Within 120 days of the date the petition 
and background information are received at Customs Headquarters, the 
Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, shall determine if the 
petition is to be granted or denied, in whole or in part, and the 
petitioner shall be notified in writing of the determination. If the 
petition is granted in whole or in part, a description of the 
merchandise, a brief summary of the issue(s) and the director's findings 
will be published in the Customs Bulletin.
    (3) Effect of granting the petition. The decision on the petition, 
if contrary to the initial adverse marking decision, will be implemented 
with respect to merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption after 30 days from the date on which the notice of 
determination is published in the Customs Bulletin.
    (e) Pending litigation. No decision on a petition will be issued 
under this section with respect to any issue which is pending before the 
United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. 
Litigation before any other court will not preclude the issuance of a 
decision on a petition under this section, provided neither Customs nor 
any of its officers or agents is named as a party to the action.
    (f) Judicial review of denial of petition.
    Any person whose petition under this section has been denied, in 
whole or in part, may contest the denial by filing a civil action in the 
United States Court of International Trade within 30 days after the date 
of mailing of the notice of denial.

(4) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country where         
  (a) except in the case of a good provided for in any of Chapters 61   
   through 63,

    (vi) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this   
     appendix, including any applicable, higher regional value-content  
     requirement provided for in section 13 or Schedule I.              
                                                                        
Interpretation: heading or subheading which provides for both a good and
                            parts of the good                           
                                                                        
(5) For purposes of subsection (4)(b),                                  
  (a) the determination of whether a heading or subheading provides for 
   a good and its parts shall be made on the basis of the nomenclature  
   of the heading or subheading and the relevant Section or Chapter     
   Notes, in accordance with the General Rules for the Interpretation of
   the Harmonized System; and                                           
  (b) where, in accordance with the Harmonized System, a heading        
   includes parts of goods by application of a Section Note or Chapter  
   Note of the Harmonized System and the subheadings under that heading 
   do not include a subheading designated ``Parts'', a subheading       
   designated ``Other'' under that heading shall be considered to cover 
   only the goods and parts of the goods that are themselves classified 
   under that subheading.                                               
(6) For purposes of subsection (2), where Schedule I sets out two or    
 more alternative rules for the tariff provision under which a good is  
 classified, if the good satisfies the requirements of one of those     
 rules, it need not satisfy the requirements of another of the rules in 
 order to qualify as an originating good.                               
                                                                        
                     Special rule for certain goods                     
                                                                        
(7) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country if the good is
 referred to in Table 308.1.1 of Section B of Annex 308.1 to Chapter    
 Three of the Agreement and is imported from the territory of a NAFTA   
 country at a time when the NAFTA countries' most-favored-nation rate of
 duty for that good is in accordance with paragraph 1 of Section A of   
 that Annex.                                                            
                                                                        
 Self-produced material may be a material for determining applicability 
                           of rules of origin                           
                                                                        
(8) For purposes of determining whether non-originating materials       
 undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, a self-produced 
 material may, at the choice of the producer of a good into which the   
 self-produced material is incorporated, be considered as an originating
 material or non-originating material, as the case may be, used in the  
 production of that good.                                               
(9) The following example is an ``Example'' as referred to in section   
 2(4).                                                                  
                                                                        
                                                                        


Example: section 4(8), Self-produced Materials as Materials for Purposes
 of Determining Whether Non-originating Materials Undergo an Applicable 
 Change in Tariff Classification                                        
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A. In the     
 production process, Producer A uses originating Material X and non-    
 originating Material Y to produce Material Z. Material Z is a self-    
 produced material that will be used to produce Good A.                 
    The rule set out in Schedule I for the heading under which Good A is
 classified specifies a change in tariff classification from any other  
 heading. In this case, both Good A and the non-originating Material Y  
 are of the same heading. However, the self-produced Material Z is of a 
 heading different than that of Good A.                                 
    For purposes of determining whether the non-originating materials   
 that are used in the production of Good A undergo the applicable change
 in tariff classification, Producer A has the option to consider the    
 self-produced Material Z as the material that must undergo a change in 
 tariff classification. As Material Z is of a heading different than    
 that of Good A, Material Z satisfies the applicable change in tariff   
 classification and Good A would qualify as an originating good.

    De minimis rule for non-originating materials that do not undergo   
           subject to authorization, a required tariff change           
                                                                        
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), a good shall be     
 considered to originate in the territory of a NAFTA country where the  
 value of all non-originating materials that are used in the production 
 of the good and that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff     
 classification as a result of production occurring entirely in the     
 territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries is not more than seven 
 percent                                                                
  (a) of the transaction value of the good determined in accordance with
   Schedule II with respect to the transaction in which the producer of 
   the good sold the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis, or              
  (b) of the total cost of the good, where there is no transaction value
   for the good under section 2(1) of Schedule III or the transaction   
   value of the good is unacceptable under section 2(2) of that         
   Schedule,                                                            
provided that,                                                          
  (c) if, under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff       
   classification is specified, the good is also subject to a regional  
   value-content requirement, the value of those non-originating        
   materials shall be taken into account in calculating the regional    
   value content of the good in accordance with the method set out for  
   that good, and                                                       
  (d) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this      
   appendix.                                                            
(2) For purposes of subsection (1), where                               
  (a) Schedule I sets out two or more alternative rules for the tariff  
   provision under which the good is classified, and                    
  (b) the good, in accordance with subsection (1), is considered to     
   originate under one of those rules,                                  
the good is not required to satisfy the requirements specified in any   
 alternative rule referred to in paragraph (a).                         
(3) For purposes of subsection (1), in the case of a good that is       
 provided for in heading 2402, the percentage shall be nine percent     
 instead of seven percent.                                              
                                                                        
                               Exceptions

                    De minimis rule for textile goods                   
                                                                        
(6) A good provided for in any of Chapters 50 through 63, that does not 
 originate in the territory of a NAFTA country because certain fibers or
 yarns that are used in the production of the component of the good that
 determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an     
 applicable change in tariff classification as a result of production   
 occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA        
 countries, shall be considered to originate in the territory of a NAFTA
 country if

  (a) the total weight of all those fibers or yarns is not more than    
   seven percent of the total weight of that component; and             
  (b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this      
   appendix.                                                            
(7) For purposes of subsection (6),                                     
  (a) the component of a good that determines the tariff classification 
   of that good shall be identified in accordance with the first of the 
   following General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized     
   System under which the identification can be determined, namely, Rule
   3(b), Rule 3(c) and Rule 4; and                                      
  (b) where the component of the good that determines the tariff        
   classification of the good is a blend of two or more yarns or fibers,
   all yarns and fibers used in the production of the component shall be
   taken into account in determining the weight of fibers and yarns in  
   that component.                                                      
(8) For purposes of subsections (1) and (5), the value of non-          
 originating materials shall be determined in accordance with sections  
 7(1) through (4).                                                      
                                                                        
  Calculation of ``total cost'' for de minimis rules: choice of methods 
                                                                        
(9) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) and subsection (5)(a)(ii), the    
 total cost of a good shall be, at the choice of the producer of the    
 good,                                                                  
  (a) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the 
   producer that can be reasonably allocated to that good in accordance 
   with Schedule VII; or                                                
  (b) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost      
   incurred with respect to that good that can be reasonably allocated  
   to that good in accordance with Schedule VII.                        
                                                                        
    Calculation of total cost; application of Schedules IX and X for    
             determining value of non-originating materials             
                                                                        
(10) Total cost under subsection (9) consists of the costs referred to  
 in section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection  
 and section 2(7).                                                      
(11) For purposes of determining the value under subsection (1) of non- 
 originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in      
 tariff classification, where Schedule X is not being used to determine 
 the value of those non-originating materials,                          
  (a) if the value of those non-originating materials is being          
   determined as a percentage of the transaction value of the good and  
   the producer chooses under section 6(10) that one of the methods set 
   out in Schedule IX be used to determine the value of those non-      
   originating materials for purposes of calculating the regional value 
   content of the good, the value of those non-originating materials    
   shall be determined in accordance with that method;                  
  (b) if                                                                
    (i) the value of those non-originating materials is being determined
     as a percentage of the total cost of the good,                     
    (ii) under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff        
     classification is specified, the good is also subject to a regional
     value-content requirement and subsection (5)(a) does not apply with
     respect to that good,                                              
    (iii) the regional value content of the good is calculated on the   
     basis of the net cost method, and                                  
    (iv) the producer chooses under section 6(15), 11(1), (3) or (6),   
     12(1) or 13(4) that the regional value content of the good be      
     calculated over a period,                                          
  the value of those non-originating materials shall be the sum of the  
   values of non-originating materials determined in accordance with    
   that choice, divided by the number of units of the goods with respect
   to which the choice is made;                                         
  (c) if                                                                
    (i) the value of those non-originating materials is being determined
     as a percentage of the total cost of the good,                     
    (ii) under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff        
     classification is specified, the good is not also subject to a     
     regional value-content requirement or subsection (5)(a) applies    
     with respect to that good, and

    (iii) the producer chooses under section 2(7)(b) that, for purposes 
     of section 5(9), the total cost of the good be calculated over a   
     period,                                                            
  the value of those non-originating materials shall be the sum of the  
   values of non-originating materials divided by the number of units   
   produced during that period; and                                     
  (d) in any other case, the value of those non-originating materials   
   may, at the choice of the producer, be determined in accordance with 
   one of the methods set out in Schedule IX.                           
(12) For purposes of subsection (5), the value of the non-originating   
 materials used in the production of the good may, at the choice of the 
 producer, be determined in accordance with one of the methods set out  
 in Schedule IX.                                                        
                                                                        
                 Examples illustrating de minimis rules                 
                                                                        
(13) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in 
 section 2(4).                                                          
                                                                        
                                                                        


Example 1: section 5(1)                                                 
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials  
 and non-originating materials in the production of copper anodes       
 provided for in heading 7402. The rule set out in Schedule I for       
 heading 7402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other
 chapter. There is no applicable regional value-content requirement for 
 this heading. Therefore, in order for the copper anode to qualify as an
 originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may  
 not use in the production of the copper anode any non-originating      
 material provided for in Chapter 74.                                   
    All of the materials used in the production of the copper anode are 
 originating materials, with the exception of a small amount of copper  
 scrap provided for in heading 7404, that is in the same chapter as the 
 copper anode. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating  
 copper scrap does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of 
 the copper anode or the total cost of the copper anode, whichever is   
 applicable, the copper anode would be considered an originating good.  
Example 2: section 5(2)                                                 
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials  
 and non-originating materials in the production of ceiling fans        
 provided for in subheading 8414.51. There are two alternative rules set
 out in Schedule I for subheading 8414.51, one of which specifies a     
 change in tariff classification from any other heading. The other rule 
 specifies both a change in tariff classification from the subheading   
 under which parts of the ceiling fans are classified and a regional    
 value-content requirement. Therefore, in order for the ceiling fan to  
 qualify as an originating good under the first of the alternative      
 rules, all of the materials that are classified under the subheading   
 for parts of ceiling fans and used in the production of the completed  
 ceiling fan must be originating materials.                             
    In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the      
 production of the ceiling fan satisfy the change in tariff             
 classification set out in the rule that specifies a change in tariff   
 classification from any other heading, with the exception of one non-  
 originating material that is classified under the subheading for parts 
 of ceiling fans. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-          
 originating material that does not satisfy the change in tariff        
 classification specified in the first rule does not exceed seven       
 percent of the transaction value of the ceiling fan or the total cost  
 of the ceiling fan, whichever is applicable, the ceiling fan would be  
 considered an originating good. Therefore, under section 5(2), the     
 ceiling fan would not be required to satisfy the alternative rule that 
 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value- 
 content requirement.                                                   
Example 3: section 5(2)

    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials  
 and non-originating materials in the production of plastic bags        
 provided for in subheading 3923.29. The rule set out in Schedule I for 
 subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification    
 from any other heading, except from subheadings 3920.20 or 3920.71,    
 under which certain plastic materials are classified, and a regional   
 value-content requirement. Therefore, with respect to that part of the 
 rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the
 plastic bag to qualify as an originating good, any plastic materials   
 that are classified under subheading 3920.20 or 3920.71 and that are   
 used in the production of the plastic bag must be originating          
 materials.                                                             
    In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the      
 production of the plastic bag satisfy the specified change in tariff   
 classification, with the exception of a small amount of plastic        
 materials classified under subheading 3920.71. Section 5(1) provides   
 that the plastic bag can be considered an originating good if the value
 of the non-originating plastic materials that do not satisfy the       
 specified change in tariff classification does not exceed seven percent
 of the transaction value of the plastic bag or the total cost of the   
 plastic bag, whichever is applicable. In this case, the value of those 
 non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in  
 tariff classification does not exceed the seven percent limit.         
    However, the rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29      
 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value- 
 content requirement. Therefore, under section 5(1)(c), in order to be  
 considered an originating good, the plastic bag must also, except as   
 otherwise provided in section 5(5), satisfy the regional value-content 
 requirement specified in that rule. As provided in section 5(1)(c), the
 value of the non-originating materials that do not satisfy the         
 specified change in tariff classification, together with the value of  
 all other non-originating materials used in the production of the      
 plastic bag, will be taken into account in calculating the regional    
 value content of the plastic bag.                                      
Example 4: section 5(5)                                                 
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, primarily uses originating  
 materials in the production of shoes provided for in heading 6405. The 
 rule set out in Schedule I for heading 6405 specifies both a change in 
 tariff classification from any subheading other than subheadings       
 6401.10 through 6406.10 and a regional value-content requirement.      
    With the exception of a small amount of materials provided for in   
 Chapter 39, all of the materials used in the production of the shoes   
 are originating materials.                                             
    Under section 5(5), if the value of all of the non-originating      
 materials used in the production of the shoes does not exceed seven    
 percent of the transaction value of the shoes or the total cost of the 
 shoes, whichever is applicable, the shoes are not required to satisfy  
 the regional value-content requirement specified in the rule set out in
 Schedule I in order to be considered originating goods.                
Example 5: section 5(5)                                                 

[[Page 369]]

                                                                        
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces barbers' chairs    
 provided for in subheading 9402.10. The rule set out in Schedule I for 
 goods provided for in heading 9402 specifies a change in tariff        
 classification from any other chapter. All of the materials used in the
 production of these chairs are originating materials, with the         
 exception of a small quantity of non-originating materials that are    
 classified as parts of barbers' chairs. These parts undergo no change  
 in tariff classification because subheading 9402.10 provides for both  
 barbers' chairs and their parts.                                       
    Although Producer A's barbers' chairs do not qualify as originating 
 goods under the rule set out in Schedule I, section 4(4)(b) provides,  
 among other things, that, where there is no change in tariff           
 classification from the non-originating materials to the goods because 
 the subheading under which the goods are classified provides for both  
 the goods and their parts, the goods shall qualify as originating goods
 if they satisfy a specified regional value-content requirement.        
    However, under section 5(5), if the value of the non-originating    
 materials does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the
 barbers' chairs or the total cost of the barbers' chairs, whichever is 
 applicable, the barbers' chairs will be considered originating goods   
 and are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement 
 set out in section 4(4)(b)(v).                                         
Example 6: sections 5 (6) and (7)                                       
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces women's dresses    
 provided for in subheading 6204.41 from fine wool fabric of heading    
 5112. This fine wool fabric, also produced by Producer A, is the       
 component of the dress that determines its tariff classification under 
 subheading 6204.41.                                                    
    The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 6204.41, under which  
 the dress is classified, specifies both a change in tariff             
 classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and  
 chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including combed wool  
 yarn and wool fabric, are classified, and a requirement that the good  
 be cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more 
 of the NAFTA countries.                                                
    Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a   
 change in tariff classification, in order for the dress to qualify as  
 an originating good, the combed wool yarn and the fine wool fabric made
 therefrom that are used by Producer A in the production of the dress   
 must be originating materials.                                         
    At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating    
 combed wool yarn in the production of the fine wool fabric. Under      
 section 5(6), if the total weight of the non-originating combed wool   
 yarn does not exceed seven percent of the total weight of all the yarn 
 used in the production of the component of the dress that determines   
 its tariff classification, that is, the wool fabric, the dress would be
 considered an originating good.                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        


                                PART III                                
                    SECTION 6. REGIONAL VALUE CONTENT                   
                                                                        
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), the regional value  
 content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the exporter or
 producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value     
 method or the net cost method.

(7) If the exporter or producer of a good calculates the regional value 
 content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method and   
 the customs administration of a NAFTA country subsequently notifies    
 that exporter or producer in writing, during the course of a           
 verification of origin, that                                           
  (a) the transaction value of the good, as determined by the exporter  
   or producer, is required to be adjusted under section 4 of Schedule  
   II or is unacceptable under section 2(2) of Schedule III, there is no
   transaction value for the good under section 2(1) of Schedule III or 
   the transaction value method may not be used because of the          
   application of subsection (6)(c), or                                 
  (b) the value of any material used in the production of the good, as  
   determined by the exporter or producer, is required to be adjusted   
   under section 5 of Schedule VIII or is unacceptable under section    
   2(3) of Schedule VIII, or there is no transaction value for the      
   material under section 2(2) of Schedule VIII or the transaction value
   method may not be used to calculate the regional value content of the
   material because of the application of subsection (6)(c),            
the exporter or producer may choose that the regional value content of  
 the good be calculated on the basis of the net cost method, in which   
 case the calculation must be made within 60 days after the producer    
 receives the notification, or such longer period as that customs       
 administration specifies.

(8) If the exporter or producer of a good chooses that the regional     
 value content of the good be calculated on the basis of the net cost   
 method and the customs administration of a NAFTA country subsequently  
 notifies that exporter or producer in writing, during the course of a  
 verification of origin, that the good does not satisfy the applicable  
 regional value-content requirement, the exporter or producer of the    
 good may not recalculate the regional value content on the basis of the
 transaction value method.                                              
(9) Nothing in subsection (7) shall be construed as preventing any      
 review and appeal under Article 510 of the Agreement, as implemented in
 each NAFTA country, of an adjustment to or a rejection of              
  (a) the transaction value of the good; or                             
  (b) the value of any material used in the production of the good.

                     originating materials under TVM                    
                                                                        
(10) For purposes of the transaction value method, where non-originating
 materials that are the same as one another in all respects, including  
 physical characteristics, quality and reputation but excluding minor   
 differences in appearance, are used in the production of a good, the   
 value of those non-originating materials may, at the choice of the     
 producer of the good, be determined in accordance with one of the      
 methods set out in Schedule IX.

(11) For purposes of subsection (3), the net cost of a good may be      
 calculated, at the choice of the producer of the good, by              
  (a) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods     
   produced by that producer, subtracting any excluded costs that are   
   included in that total cost, and reasonably allocating, in accordance
   with Schedule VII, the remainder to the good;                        
  (b) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods     
   produced by that producer, reasonably allocating, in accordance with 
   Schedule VII, that total cost to the good, and subtracting any       
   excluded costs that are included in the amount allocated to that     
   good; or                                                             
  (c) reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule VII, each cost 
   that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good  
   so that the aggregate of those costs does not include any excluded   
   costs.                                                               
                                                                        
                        Calculation of total cost                       
                                                                        
(12) Total cost under subsection (11) consists of the costs referred to 
 in section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection. 
                                                                        
                 Calculation of net cost; excluded costs                
                                                                        
(13) For purposes of calculating net cost under subsection (11),        
  (a) excluded costs shall be the excluded costs that are recorded on   
   the books of the producer of the good;                               
  (b) excluded costs that are included in the value of a material that  
   is used in the production of the good shall not be subtracted from or
   otherwise excluded from the total cost; and                          
  (c) excluded costs do not include any amount paid for research and    
   development services performed in the territory of a NAFTA country.  
                                                                        
         Non-allowable interest; determination under Schedule XI        
                                                                        
(14) For purposes of calculating non-allowable interest costs, the      
 determination of whether interest costs incurred by a producer are more
 than 700 basis points above the yield on debt obligations of comparable
 maturities issued by the federal government of the country in which the
 producer is located shall be made in accordance with Schedule XI.      
                                                                        
  Use of ``averaging'' over a period to calculate RVC under NCM; period 
                            cannot be changed                           
                                                                        
(15) For purposes of the net cost method, the regional value content of 
 the good, other than a good with respect to which a choice to average  
 may be made under section 11(1), (3) or (6), 12(1) or 13(4), may be    
 calculated, where the producer chooses to do so, by                    
  (a) calculating the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the  
   values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good 
   with respect to the good and identical goods or similar goods, or any
   combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer over 
    (i) a month,                                                        
    (ii) any consecutive three month or six month period that falls     
     within and is evenly divisible into the number of months of the    
     producer's fiscal year remaining at the beginning of that period,  
     or                                                                 
    (iii) the producer's fiscal year; and                               
  (b) using the sums referred to in paragraph (a) as the net cost and   
   the value of non-originating materials, respectively.                
(16) The calculation made under subsection (15) shall apply with respect
 to all units of the good produced during the period chosen by the      
 producer under subsection (15)(a).                                     
(17) A choice made under subsection (15) may not be rescinded or        
 modified with respect to the goods or the period with respect to which 
 the choice is made.

(20) Except as otherwise provided in sections 11(10), 12(11) and 13(10),
 where the producer of a good has calculated the regional value content 
 of the good under the net cost method on the basis of estimated costs, 
 including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar          
 estimating procedures, before or during the period chosen in subsection
 (15)(a), the producer shall conduct an analysis at the end of the      
 producer's fiscal year of the actual costs incurred over the period    
 with respect to the production of the good and, if the good does not   
 satisfy the regional value-content requirement on the basis of the     
 actual costs during that period, immediately inform any person to whom 
 the producer has provided a Certificate of Origin for the good, or a   
 written statement that the good is an originating good, that the good  
 is a non-originating good.

(21) For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good,  
 the producer of that good may choose to treat any material used in the 
 production of that good as a non-originating material.

(22) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in 
 section 2(4).                                                          
                                                                        



Example 1: example of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted
 to an F.O.B. basis)                                                    
    A producer has only one factory, at which the producer manufactures 
 finished office chairs. Because the factory is located close to        
 transportation facilities, all units of the finished good are stored in
 a factory warehouse 200 meters from the end of the production line.    
 Goods are shipped worldwide from this warehouse. The point of direct   
 shipment is the warehouse.                                             
Example 2: examples of point of direct shipment (with respect to        
 adjusted to an F.O.B. basis)                                           
    A producer has six factories, all located within the territory of   
 one of the NAFTA countries, at which the producer produces garden tools
 of various types. These tools are shipped worldwide, and orders usually
 consist of bulk orders of various types of tools. Because different    
 tools are manufactured at different factories, the producer decided to 
 consolidate storage and shipping facilities and ships all finished     
 products to a large warehouse located near the seaport, from which all 
 orders are shipped. The distance from the factories to the warehouse   
 varies from 3 km to 130 km. The point of direct shipment for each of   
 the goods is the warehouse.                                            
Example 3: examples of point of direct shipment (with respect to        
 adjusted to an F.O.B. basis)

    A producer has only one factory, located near the center of one of  
 the NAFTA countries, at which the producer manufactures finished office
 chairs. The office chairs are shipped from that factory to three       
 warehouses leased by the producer, one on the west coast, one near the 
 factory and one on the east coast. The office chairs are shipped to    
 buyers from these warehouses, the shipping location depending on the   
 shipping distance from the buyer. Buyers closest to the west coast     
 warehouse are normally supplied by the west coast warehouse, buyers    
 closest to the east coast are normally supplied by the warehouse       
 located on the east coast and buyers closest to the warehouse near the 
 factory are normally supplied by that warehouse. In this case, the     
 point of direct shipment is the location of the warehouse from which   
 the office chairs are normally shipped to customers in the location in 
 which the buyer is located.                                            
Example 4: section 6(3), net cost method                                
    A producer located in NAFTA country A sells Good A that is subject  
 to a regional value-content requirement to a buyer located in NAFTA    
 country B. The producer of Good A chooses that the regional value      
 content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. All      
 applicable requirements of this appendix, other than the regional value-
 content requirement, have been met. The applicable regional value-     
 content requirement is 50 percent.                                     
    In order to calculate the regional value-content of Good A, the     
 producer first calculates the net cost of Good A. Under section        
 6(11)(a), the net cost is the total cost of Good A (the aggregate of   
 the product costs, period costs and other costs) per unit, minus the   
 excluded costs (the aggregate of the sales promotion, marketing and    
 after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs and   
 non-allowable interest costs) per unit. The producer uses the following
 figures to calculate the net cost:                                     
                                                                        


                                                                        
                                                                        
Product costs:                                                          
    Value of originating materials.........................       $30.00
    Value of non-originating materials.....................        40.00
    Other product costs....................................        20.00
Period costs...............................................        10.00
Other costs................................................         0.00
                                                            ------------
Total cost of Good A, per unit.............................      $100.00
Excluded costs:                                                         
    Sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service cost        $5.00
    Royalties..............................................         2.50
    Shipping and packing costs.............................         3.00
    Non-allowable interest costs...........................         1.50
                                                            ------------
Total excluded costs.......................................       $12.00


    The net cost is the total cost of Good A, per unit, minus the       
 excluded costs.                                                        
                                                                        


                                                                        
                                                                        
Total cost of Good A, per unit:............................      $100.00
Excluded costs.............................................       -12.00
                                                            ------------
Net cost of Good A, per unit...............................       $88.00



    The value for net cost ($88) and the value of non-originating       
 materials ($40) are needed in order to calculate the regional value    
 content. The producer calculates the regional value content of Good A  
 under the net cost method in the following manner:

    Therefore, under the net cost method, Good A qualifies as an        
 originating good, with a regional value-content of 54.5 percent.       
Example 5: section 6(6)(c), net cost method required for certain sales  
 to related persons                                                     
    On January 15, 1994, a producer located in NAFTA country A sells    
 1,000 units of Good A to a related person, located in NAFTA country B. 
 During the six month period beginning on July 1, 1993 and ending on    
 December 31, 1993, the producer sold 90,000 units of identical goods   
 and similar goods to related persons from various countries, including 
 that buyer. The producer's total sales of those identical goods and    
 similar goods to all persons from all countries during that six month  
 period were 100,000 units.                                             
    The total quantity of identical goods and similar goods sold by the 
 producer to related persons during that six month period was 90 percent
 of the producer's total sales of those identical goods and similar     
 goods to all persons. Under section 6(6)(c), the producer must use the 
 net cost method to calculate the regional value content of Good A sold 
 in January 1994, because the 85 percent limit was exceeded.            
Example 6: section 6(11)(a)                                             
    A producer in a NAFTA country produces Good A and Good B during the 
 producer's fiscal year.                                                
    The producer uses the following figures, which are recorded on the  
 producer's books and represent all of the costs incurred with respect  
 to both Good A and Good B, to calculate the net cost of those goods:

    Value of non-originating materials.....................        1,000
    Other product costs....................................        2,400
Period costs: (including $1,200 in excluded costs).........        3,200
 Other costs...............................................          400
                                                            ------------
Total cost of Good A and Good B............................       $9,000
The net cost is the total cost of Good A and Good B, minus              
 the excluded costs incurred with respect to those goods.               
Total cost of Good A and Good B............................       $9,000
 Excluded costs............................................       -1,200

Net cost of Good A and Good B..............................       $7,800



    The net cost must then be reasonably allocated, in accordance with  
 Schedule VII, to Good A and Good B.                                    
Example 7: section 6(11)(b)                                             
    A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good A and Good B    
 during the producer's fiscal year. In order to calculate the regional  
 value content of Good A and Good B, the producer uses the following    
 figures that are recorded on the producer's books and incurred with    
 respect to those goods:                                                
                                                                        


                                                                        
                                                                        
Product costs:

Total cost of Good A and Good B............................       $9,000



    Under section 6(11)(b), the total cost of Good A and Good B is then 
 reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to those goods. 
 The costs are allocated in the following manner:

Example 9: section 6(12)                                                
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses  
 that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the   
 net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in
 a NAFTA country. Material X is a non-originating material and is used  
 in the production of Good A. Producer A provides Producer B, at no     
 charge, with tools to be used in the production of Material X. The cost
 of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A has been      
 expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5(1)(b)(ii) of       
 Schedule VIII, the value of the tools is included in the value of      
 Material X. Therefore, the cost of the tools that is recorded on the   
 books of Producer A and that has been expensed in the current year     
 cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because
 it has already been included in the value of Material X.               
Example 10: section 6(12)                                               
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses  
 that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the   
 net cost method and averages the calculation over the producer's fiscal
 year under section 6(15). Producer A determines that during that fiscal
 year Producer A incurred a gain on foreign currency conversion of      
 $10,000 and a loss on foreign currency conversion of $8,000, resulting 
 in a net gain of $2,000. Producer A also determines that $7,000 of the 
 gain on foreign currency conversion and $6,000 of the loss on foreign  
 currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating      
 materials used in the production of Good A, and $3,000 of the gain on  
 foreign currency conversion and $2,000 of the loss on foreign currency 
 conversion is not related to the production of Good A. The producer    
 determines that the total cost of Good A is $45,000 before deducting   
 the $1,000 net gain on foreign currency conversion related to the      
 production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is therefore $44,000.   
 That $1,000 net gain is not included in the value of non-originating   
 materials under section 7(1).                                          
Example 11: section 6(12)                                               
    Given the same facts as in example 10, except that Producer A       
 determines that $6,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and  
 $7,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the    
 purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A.
 The total cost of Good A is $45,000, which includes the $1,000 net loss
 on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A.    
 That $1,000 net loss is not included in the value of non-originating   
 materials under section 7(1).

  (d) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the material in  
   the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, other than      
   duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise  
   recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable,

 material referred to in that paragraph was not determined in a manner  
 consistent with Schedule VIII, the value of the material shall be      
 determined in accordance with Schedule VIII with respect to the        
 importation of that material and, where the costs referred to in       
 subsections (1)(c) through (f) are not included in that value, those   
 costs be added to that value.

(4) Except for purposes of determining the value of non-originating     
 materials used in the production of a light-duty automotive good and   
 except in the case of an automotive component assembly, automotive     
 component or sub-component for use as original equipment in the        
 production of a heavy-duty vehicle, for purposes of calculating the    
 regional value content of a good the producer of the good may designate
 as an intermediate material any self-produced material that is used in 
 the production of the good, provided that where an intermediate        
 material is subject to a regional value-content requirement, no other  
 self-produced material that is subject to a regional value-content     
 requirement and is incorporated into that intermediate material is also
 designated by the producer as an intermediate material.                
(5) For purposes of subsection (4),                                     
  (a) in order to qualify as an originating material, a self-produced   
   material that is designated as an intermediate material must qualify 
   as an originating material under these Regulations;                  
  (b) the designation of a self-produced material as an intermediate    
   material shall be made solely at the choice of the producer of that  
   self-produced material; and                                          
  (c) except as otherwise provided in section 14(4), the proviso set out
   in subsection (4) does not apply with respect to an intermediate     
   material used by another producer in the production of a material    
   that is subsequently acquired and used in the production of a good by
   the producer referred to in subsection (4).

(6) The value of an intermediate material shall be, at the choice of the
 producer of the good,                                                  
  (a) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the 
   producer that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate       
   material in accordance with Schedule VII; or                         
  (b) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost      
   incurred with respect to that intermediate material that can be      
   reasonably allocated to that intermediate material in accordance with
   Schedule VII.                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
                        Calculation of total cost                       
                                                                        
(7) Total cost under subsection (6) consists of the costs referred to in
 section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that section and    
 section 2(7).                                                          
                                                                        
                                                                        
  Rescission of a designation during course of verification; option to  
                 designate another intermediate material                
                                                                        
(8) Where a producer of a good designates a self-produced material as an
 intermediate material under subsection (4) and the customs             
 administration of a NAFTA country into which the good is imported      
 determines during a verification of origin of the good that the        
 intermediate material is a non-originating material and notifies the   
 producer of this in writing before the written determination of whether
 the good qualifies as an originating good, the producer may rescind the
 designation, and the regional value content of the good shall be       
 calculated as though the self-produced material were not so designated.
(9) A producer of a good who rescinds a designation under subsection (8)
  (a) shall retain any rights of review and appeal under Article 510 of 
   the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, with respect to 
   the determination of the origin of the intermediate material as      
   though the producer did not rescind the designation; and             
  (b) may, not later than 30 days after the customs administration      
   referred to in subsection (8) notifies the producer in writing that  
   the self-produced material referred to in paragraph (a) is a non-    
   originating material, designate as an intermediate material another  
   self-produced material that is incorporated into the good, subject to
   the proviso set out in subsection (4).

(10) Where a producer of a good designates another self-produced        
 material as an intermediate material under subsection (9)(b) and the   
 customs administration referred to in subsection (8) determines during 
 the verification of origin of the good that that self-produced material
 is a non-originating material,                                         
  (a) the producer may rescind the designation, and the regional value  
   content of the good shall be calculated as though the self-produced  
   material were not so designated;                                     
  (b) the producer shall retain any rights of review and appeal under   
   Article 510 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country,  
   with respect to the determination of the origin of the intermediate  
   material as though the producer did not rescind the designation; and 
  (c) the producer may not designate another self-produced material that
   is incorporated into the good as an intermediate material.

(11) For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, 
 an indirect material that is used in the production of the good        
  (a) shall be considered to be an originating material, regardless of  
   where that indirect material is produced; and                        
  (b) if the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement,   
   for purposes of calculating the net cost under the net cost method,  
   the value of the indirect material shall be the costs of that        
   material that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good.

(12) Packaging materials and containers, if classified under the        
 Harmonized System with the good that is packaged therein, shall be     
 disregarded for purposes of                                            
  (a) determining whether all of the non-originating materials used in  
   the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff    
   classification; and

 is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of those 
 packaging materials and containers shall be taken into account as      
 originating materials or non-originating materials, as the case may be,
 for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good.    
(14) For purposes of subsection (13), where packaging materials and     
 containers are self-produced materials, the producer may choose to     
 designate those materials as intermediate materials under subsection   
 (4).

(15) For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, 
 packing materials and containers in which the good is packed           
  (a) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether          
    (i) the non-originating materials used in the production of the good
     undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, and         
    (ii) the good satisfies a regional value-content requirement; and   
  (b) if the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement,

  (a) where originating materials and non-originating materials that are
   fungible materials are used in the production of the good, the       
   determination of whether the materials are originating materials may,
   at the choice of the producer of the good or the person from whom the
   producer acquired the materials, be made on the basis of any of the  
   applicable inventory management methods set out in Schedule X; and   
  (b) where originating goods and non-originating goods that are        
   fungible goods are physically combined or mixed in inventory and     
   prior to exportation do not undergo production or any other operation
   in the territory of the NAFTA country in which they were physically  
   combined or mixed in inventory, other than unloading, reloading or   
   any other operation necessary to preserve the goods in good condition
   or to transport the goods for exportation to the territory of another
   NAFTA country, the determination of whether the good is an           
   originating good may, at the choice of the exporter of the good or   
   the person from whom the exporter acquired the good, be made on the  
   basis of any of the applicable inventory management methods set out  
   in Schedule X.

(17) Accessories, spare parts or tools that are delivered with a good   
 and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts or tools 
 are originating materials if the good is an originating good, and shall
 be disregarded for purposes of determining whether all the non-        
 originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an    
 applicable change in tariff classification or determining under section
 5(1) the value of non-originating materials that do not undergo an     
 applicable change in tariff classification, provided that              
  (a) the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately 
   from the good; and                                                   
  (b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools 
   are customary for the good, within the industry that produces the    
   good.                                                                
(18) Where a good is subject to a regional value-content requirement,   
 the value of accessories, spare parts and tools that are delivered with
 that good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts
 or tools shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating 
 materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value       
 content of the good.                                                   
(19) For purposes of subsection (18), where accessories, spare parts and
 tools are self-produced materials, the producer may choose to designate
 those materials as intermediate materials under subsection (4).

(20) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in 
 section 2(4).                                                          
                                                                        



Example 1: section 7(2), Customs Value not Determined in a Manner       
 Consistent with Schedule VIII

    Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports material A into     
 NAFTA country A. Producer A purchased material A from a middleman      
 located in country B. The middleman purchased the material from a      
 manufacturer located in country B. Under the laws in NAFTA country A   
 that implement the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the   
 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the customs value of material A
 was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the
 manufacturer. Producer A uses material A to produce Good C, and exports
 Good C to NAFTA country D. Good C is subject to a regional value-      
 content requirement.                                                   
    Under section 4(1) of Schedule VIII, the price actually paid or     
 payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or  
 for the benefit of the seller of the material. Section 1 of that       
 Schedule defines producer and seller for purposes of the Schedule. A   
 producer is the person who uses the material in the production of a    
 good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. A seller 
 is the person who sells the material being valued to the producer.     
    The customs value of material A was not determined in a manner      
 consistent with Schedule VIII because it was based on the price        
 actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer, rather  
 than on the price actually paid or payable by Producer A to the        
 middleman. Thus, section 7(2) applies and material A is valued in      
 accordance with Schedule VIII.                                         
Example 2: section 7(5), Value of Intermediate Materials                
    A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement under section 4(2)(b). 
 The producer also produces Material A, which is used in the production 
 of Good B. Both originating materials and non-originating materials are
 used in the production of Material A. Material A is subject to a change
 in tariff classification requirement under section 4(2)(a). The costs  
 to produce Material A are the following:

    The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material and  
 determines that, because all of the non-originating materials that are 
 used in the production of Material A undergo an applicable change in   
 tariff classification set out in Schedule I, Material A would, under   
 paragraph 4(2)(a) qualify as an originating material. The cost of the  
 non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is      
 therefore not included in the value of non-originating materials that  
 are used in the production of Good B for the purpose of determining the
 regional value content of Good B. Because Material A has been          
 designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of Material A,  
 which is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for   
 the purpose of calculating the regional value content of Good B. The   
 total cost of Good B is determined in accordance with the following    
 figures:

Example 3: section 7(5), Effects of the Designation of Self-produced    
 Materials on Net Cost                                                  
    The ability to designate intermediate materials helps to put the    
 vertically integrated producer who is self-producing materials that are
 used in the production of a good on par with a producer who is         
 purchasing materials and valuing those materials in accordance with    
 subsection 7(1). The following situations demonstrate how this is      
 achieved:                                                              
    Situation 1                                                         
    A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the
 net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of 
 these Regulations. The producer purchases Material A, which is used in 
 the production of Good B, from a supplier located in a NAFTA country.  
 The value of Material A determined in accordance with subsection 7(1)  
 is $11.00. Material A is an originating material. All other materials  
 used in the production of Good B are non-originating materials. The net
 cost of Good B is determined as follows:

Net cost of Good B.........................................       $23.40


    The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows:      
                                                                        
                                                                        

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06SE95.003


    The regional value content of Good B is 76.5 percent, and Good B,   
 therefore, qualifies as an originating good.                           
    Situation 2                                                         
    A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the
 net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of 
 these Regulations. The producer self-produces Material A which is used 
 in the production of Good B. The costs to produce Material A are the   
 following:

    The regional value content of Good B is 42.9 percent, and Good B,   
 therefore, does not qualify as an originating good.                    
    Situation 3                                                         
    A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the
 net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of 
 these Regulations. The producer self-produces Material A, which is used
 in the production of Good B. The costs to produce Material A are the   
 following:

    The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material under
 subsection 7(4). Material A qualifies as an originating material under 
 paragraph 4(2)(a). Therefore, the value of non-originating materials   
 used in the production of Material A is not included in the value of   
 non-originating materials for the purposes of calculating the regional 
 value content of Good B. The net cost of Good B is calculated as       
 follows:

    The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows:      
                                                                        
                                                                        

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06SE95.005


    The regional value content of Good B is 76.1 percent, and Good B,   
 therefore, qualifies as an originating good.                           
Example 4: Originating Materials Acquired from a Producer Who Produced  
 Them Using Intermediate Materials                                      
    Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, produces switches. In order 
 for the switches to qualify as originating goods, Producer A designates
 subassemblies of the switches as intermediate materials. The           
 subassemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. They
 satisfy that requirement, and qualify as originating materials. The    
 switches are also subject to a regional value-content requirement, and,
 with the subassemblies designated as intermediate materials, are       
 determined to have a regional value content of 65 percent.             
    Producer A sells the switches to Producer B, located in NAFTA       
 country B, who uses them to produce switch assemblies that are used in 
 the production of Good B. The switch assemblies are subject to a       
 regional value-content requirement. Producers A and B are not          
 accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14.        
 Producer B is therefore able, under section 7(4), to designate the     
 switch assemblies as intermediate materials.                           
    If Producers A and B were accumulating their production within the  
 meaning of section 14, Producer B would be unable to designate the     
 switch assemblies as intermediate materials, because the production of 
 both producers would be considered to be the production of one         
 producer.

    Producer A, located in NAFTA country, produces Material X and uses  
 Material X in the production of Good B. Material X qualifies as an     
 originating material because it satisfies the applicable regional value-
 content requirement. Producer A designates Material A as an            
 intermediate material.                                                 
    Producer A uses Material X in the production of Material Y, which is
 also used in the production of Good B. Material Y is also subject to a 
 regional value-content requirement. Under the proviso set out in       
 section 7(4), Producer A cannot designate Material Y as an intermediate
 material, even if Material Y satisfies the applicable regional value-  
 content requirement, because Material X was already designated by      
 Producer A as an intermediate material.                                
Example 6: Single Producer and Multiple Designations of Materials as    
 Intermediate Materials                                                 
    Producer X, who is located in NAFTA country X, uses non-originating 
 materials in the production of self-produced materials A, B, and C.    
 None of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any  
 of the other self-produced materials.                                  
    Producer X uses the self-produced materials in the production of    
 Good O, which is exported to NAFTA country Y. Materials A, B and C     
 qualify as originating materials because they satisfy the applicable   
 regional value-content requirements.                                   
    Because none of the self-produced materials are used in the         
 production of any of the other self-produced materials, then even      
 though each self-produced material is subject to a regional value-     
 content requirement, Producer X may, under section 7(4), designate all 
 of the self-produced materials as intermediate materials. The proviso  
 set out in section 7(4) only applies where self-produced materials are 
 used in the production of other self-produced materials and both are   
 subject to a regional value-content requirement.                       
Example 7: section 7(17)                                                
    The following are examples of accessories, spare parts or tools that
 are delivered with a good and form part of the good's standard         
 accessories, spare parts or tools:                                     
  (a) consumables that must be replaced at regular intervals, such as   
   dust collectors for an air-conditioning system,                      
  (b) a carrying case for equipment,                                    
  (c) a dust cover for a machine,                                       
  (d) an operational manual for a vehicle,                              
  (e) brackets to attach equipment to a wall,                           
  (f) a bicycle tool kit or a car jack,                                 
  (g) a set of wrenches to change the bit on a chuck,                   
  (h) a brush or other tool to clean out a machine, and                 
  (i) electrical cords and power bars for use with electronic goods.    
Example 8: Value of Indirect Materials that are Assists                 

[[Page 390]]

                                                                        
    Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is     
 subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses  
 that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the   
 net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in
 a NAFTA country, and uses it in the production of Good A. Producer A   
 provides to Producer B, at no charge, tools to be used in the          
 production of Material X. The tools have a value of $100 which is      
 expensed in the current year by Producer A.                            
    Material X is subject to a regional value-content requirement which 
 Producer B chooses to calculate using the net cost method. For purposes
 of determining the value of non-originating materials in order to      
 calculate the regional value content of Material X, the tools are      
 considered to be an originating material because they are an indirect  
 material. However, pursuant to section 7(11) they have a value of nil  
 because the cost of the tools with respect to Material X is not        
 recorded on the books of Producer B.                                   
    It is determined that Material X is a non-originating material. The 
 cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of producer A is       
 expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5 of Schedule VIII,  
 the value of the tools (see section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII) must 
 be included in the value of Material X by Producer A when calculating  
 the regional value content of Good A. The cost of the tools, although  
 recorded on the books of producer A, cannot be included as a separate  
 cost in the net cost of Good A because it is already included in the   
 value of Material X. The entire cost of Material X, which includes the 
 cost of the tools, is included in the value of non-originating         
 materials for purposes of the regional value content of Good A.

   whom the producer acquired that material that states that amount, the
   amount as determined in accordance with paragraph (f) or (g), as the 
   case may be; and                                                     
  (i) where a person other than the producer imports the traced material
   from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and the producer 
   does not have a statement described in any of paragraphs (c) through 
   (h), the value of the traced material or any material that           
   incorporates it, determined in accordance with subsection (5) with   
   respect to the transaction in which the producer acquires the traced 
   material or any material that incorporates it.                       
                                                                        
   Value of traced material if customs value is not in accordance with  
                              Schedule VIII                             
                                                                        
(3) For purposes of subsections (2) (a) through (d), where the customs  
 value of the traced material referred to in those paragraphs was not   
 determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VIII, the value of the 
 material shall be the sum of                                           
  (a) the value of the material determined in accordance with Schedule  
   VIII with respect to the transaction in which the person who imported
   the material from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries     
   acquired it; and                                                     
  (b) where not included in that value, the costs referred to in        
   subsections (2)(a) (ii) and (iii), subsections (2)(b) (ii) and (iii),
   subsections (2)(c)(ii) (B) and (C) or subsections (2)(d)(ii) (B) and 
   (C), as the case may be.                                             
                                                                        
  Additional costs included in traced value if not already included in  
                              customs value                             
                                                                        
(4) The costs referred to in subsections (2) (a) through (d) and        
 subsection (3) are the following:                                      
  (a) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the material in  
   the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, other than      
   duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise  
   recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable;   
   and

  (b) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs    
   brokerage services, incurred with respect to the material in the     
   territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries.                     
                                                                        
 Value of traced material determined under Schedule VIII if value is not
                              customs value                             
                                                                        
(5) For purposes of subsections (2) (e) through (g) and (i) and         
 subsections (6) and (7), the value of a material                       
  (a) shall be the transaction value of the material, determined in     
   accordance with section 2(1) of Schedule VIII with respect to the    
   transaction referred to in that paragraph or subsection, or          
  (b) shall be determined in accordance with sections 6 through 11 of   
   Schedule VIII, where, with respect to the transaction referred to in 
   that paragraph or subsection, there is no transaction value for the  
   material under section 2(2) of that Schedule, or the transaction     
   value of the material is unacceptable under section 2(3) of that     
   Schedule,                                                            
and, where not included under paragraph (a) or (b), shall include taxes,
 other than duties paid on an importation of a material from a NAFTA    
 country, paid or payable with respect to the material in the territory 
 of one or more of the NAFTA countries, other than taxes that are       
 waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit
 against tax paid or payable.                                           
(6) Where it is determined, during the course of a verification of      
 origin of a light-duty automotive good with respect to which the       
 producer of that good has a statement referred to in subsection (2) (f)
 or (g), that the acquired material referred to in that statement is not
 an originating material, the value of the acquired material shall, for 
 purposes of subsection (2), be determined in accordance with subsection
 (5) with respect to the transaction in which that producer acquired it.
                                                                        
  Effect on value of traced material if value on a statement cannot be  
                                verified                                
                                                                        
(7) Where any person who has information with respect to a statement    
 referred to in any of subsections (2)(c) through (h) does not allow a  
 customs administration to verify that information during a verification
 of origin, the value of the material with respect to which that person 
 did not allow the customs administration to verify the information may 
 be determined by that customs administration in accordance with        
 subsection (5) with respect to the transaction in which that person    
 sells, or otherwise transfers to another person, that material or a    
 material that incorporates that material.                              
                                                                        
    Use of value of VNM as determined under section 12(3) for traced    
               material incorporated into another material              
                                                                        
(8) Where a traced material is incorporated into a material produced in 
 the territory of a NAFTA country and that material is incorporated into
 a light-duty automotive good, the statement referred to in subsection  
 (2)(c), (d) or (e) may state the value of non-originating materials,   
 determined in accordance with section 12(3), with respect to the       
 material that incorporates the traced material.                        
                                                                        
 Interpretations and clarifications for provisions applicable to tracing
                  rules for light-duty automotive goods                 
                                                                        
(9) For purposes of this section,                                       
  (a) where a producer, in accordance with section 7(4), designates as  
   an intermediate material any self-produced material used in the      
   production of a light-duty automotive good,                          
    (i) the designation applies solely to the calculation of the net    
     cost of that good, and                                             
    (ii) the value of a traced material that is incorporated into that  
     good shall be determined as though the designation had not been    
     made;                                                              
  (b) the value of a material not listed in Schedule IV, when imported  
   from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries,                 

[[Page 396]]

                                                                        
    (i) shall not be included in the value of non-originating materials 
     that are used in the production of a light-duty automotive good,   
     and                                                                
    (ii) shall be included in calculating the net cost of a light-duty  
     automotive good that incorporates that material;                   
  (c) except as otherwise provided in section 12(10), this section does 
   not apply with respect to after-market parts;                        
  (d) the costs referred to in subsections (2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii),      
   subsections (2)(c)(ii)(B) and (d)(ii)(B) and subsections (4) and (5) 
   shall be the costs referred to in those paragraphs that are recorded 
   on the books of the producer of the light-duty automotive good;      
  (e) for purposes of calculating the regional value content of a light-
   duty automotive good, the producer of that good may choose to treat  
   any material used in the production of that good as a non-originating
   material, and the value of that material shall be determined in      
   accordance with subsection (5) with respect to the transaction in    
   which the producer acquired it; and                                  
  (f) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsection  
   (2) that concerns the value of materials or costs shall be in the    
   same currency as the currency of the country in which the person who 
   provided the statement is located.                                   
                                                                        
   Examples of application of tracing for light-duty automotive goods   
                                                                        
(10) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in 
 section 2(4).                                                          
                                                                        


Example 1:                                                              
    Nuts and bolts provided for in heading 7318 are imported from       
 outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and are used in the     
 territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a light-duty         
 automotive good referred to in section 9(1). Heading 7318 is not listed
 in Schedule IV so the nuts and bolts are not traced materials.         
    Because the nuts and bolts are not traced materials the value, under
 section 9(1), of the nuts and bolts is not included in the value of non-
 originating materials used in the light-duty automotive good even      
 though the nuts and bolts are imported from outside the territories of 
 the NAFTA countries.                                                   
    The value, under section 9(9)(b), of the nuts and bolts is included 
 in the net cost of the light-duty automotive good for the purposes of  
 calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the motor   
 vehicle.                                                               
Example 2:                                                              
    A rear view mirror provided for in subheading 7009.10 is imported   
 from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the 
 territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of
 a light-duty vehicle.                                                  
    Subheading 7009.10 is listed in Schedule IV. The rear view mirror is
 a traced material. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1),    
 regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the     
 mirror is included in the value of non-originating materials in        
 accordance with sections 9(2) through (9).                             
Example 3:                                                              

[[Page 397]]

                                                                        
    Glass provided for in heading 7005 is imported from outside the     
 territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of     
 NAFTA country A in the production of a rear view mirror. The rear view 
 mirror is a non-originating good because it fails to satisfy the       
 applicable change in tariff classification.                            
    That rear view mirror is exported to NAFTA country B where it is    
 used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.  
 Even though the rear view mirror is a non-originating material and is  
 provided for in a tariff item listed in Schedule IV, it is not a traced
 material because it was not imported from outside the territories of   
 the NAFTA countries.                                                   
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of a light-duty vehicle in which the rear view mirror is       
 incorporated, the value of the rear view mirror, under section 9(1), is
 not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the     
 production of the light-duty vehicle.                                  
    Even though the glass provided for in heading 7005 that was used in 
 the production of the rear view mirror and incorporated into the light-
 duty vehicle was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA    
 countries, the glass is not a traced material because heading 7005 is  
 not listed in Schedule IV. For purposes of calculating, under section  
 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that        
 incorporates the glass, the value of the glass is not included in the  
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-
 duty vehicle. The value of the rear view mirror would be included in   
 the net cost of the light-duty vehicle, but the value of the imported  
 glass would not be separately included in the value of non-originating 
 materials of the light-duty vehicle.                                   
Example 4:                                                              
    An electric motor provided for in subheading 8501.10 is imported    
 from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the 
 territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a seat frame provided
 for in subheading 9401.90. The seat frame, with the electric motor     
 attached, is sold to a producer of seats provided for in subheading    
 9401.20. The seat producer sells the seat to a producer of light-duty  
 vehicles. The seat is to be used as original equipment in the          
 production of that light-duty vehicle.                                 
    Subheadings 8501.10 and 9401.20 are listed in Schedule IV;          
 subheading 9401.90 is not. The electric motor is a traced material; the
 seat is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside 
 the territories of the NAFTA countries.                                
    The seat is a light-duty automotive good referred to in section     
 9(1). For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional    
 value content of the seat, the value of traced materials incorporated  
 into it is included in the value of non-originating materials used in  
 the production of the seat. The value of the electric motor is included
 in that value. (However, the value of the motor would not be included  
 separately in the net cost of the seat because the value of the motor  
 is included as part of the cost of the seat frame.)                    
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the electric motor is  
 included in the value of non-originating materials used in the         
 production of the light-duty vehicle, even if the seat is an           
 originating material.                                                  
Example 5:                                                              

[[Page 398]]

                                                                        
    Cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies provided for  
 in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA 
 countries by an engine producer, who has title to them at the time of  
 importation, and are used by the producer in the territory of NAFTA    
 country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. 
 After the regional value content of the engine is calculated, the      
 engine is an originating good. It is not a traced material because it  
 was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.  
 The engine is exported to NAFTA country B, to be used as original      
 equipment by a producer of light-duty vehicles.                        
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine, because
 heading 8409 is listed in Schedule IV and because the cast blocks, cast
 heads and connecting rod assemblies were imported into the territory of
 a NAFTA country and are incorporated into the light-duty vehicle, the  
 value of those materials, which are traced materials, is included in   
 the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the   
 light-duty vehicle, even though the engine is an originating material. 
    The producer of the light-duty vehicle did not import the traced    
 materials. However, because that producer has a statement referred to  
 in section 9(2)(c) and that statement states the value of non-         
 originating materials of the traced materials in accordance with       
 section 12(2), the producer of the light-duty vehicle may, in          
 accordance with section 9(8), use that value as the value of non-      
 originating materials of the light-duty vehicle with respect to that   
 engine.                                                                
Example 6:                                                              
    Aluminum ingots provided for in subheading 7601.10 and piston       
 assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the  
 territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer and are used  
 by that producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production 
 of an engine provided for in heading 8407. The aluminum ingots are used
 by the producer to produce an engine block; the piston assembly is then
 incorporated into the engine block and the producer designates, in     
 accordance with section 7(4), a short block provided for in heading    
 8409 as an intermediate material. The intermediate material qualifies  
 as an originating material. The engine that incorporates the short     
 block is exported to NAFTA country B and used as original equipment in 
 the production of a light-duty vehicle. The piston assemblies provided 
 for in heading 8409 are traced materials; neither the engine nor the   
 short block are traced materials because they were not imported from   
 outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.                        
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the engine, the value of the piston assemblies is included, 
 under section 9(9)(a)(ii), in the value of non-originating materials,  
 even if the intermediate material is an originating material. However, 
 the value of the aluminum ingots is not included in the value of non-  
 originating materials because subheading 7601.10 is not listed in      
 Schedule IV. The value of the aluminum ingots does not need to be      
 included separately in the net cost of the engine because that value is
 included in the value of the intermediate material, and the total cost 
 of the intermediate material is included in the net cost of the engine.
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine (and the
 piston assemblies), the value of the piston assemblies incorporated    
 into that light-duty vehicle is included in the value of non-          
 originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.                       
Example 7:

    An engine provided for in heading 8407 is imported from outside the 
 territories of the NAFTA countries. The producer of the engine, located
 in the country from which the engine is imported, used in the          
 production of the engine a piston assembly provided for in heading 8409
 that was produced in a NAFTA country and is an originating good. The   
 engine is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original         
 equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The engine is a   
 traced material.                                                       
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of a light-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine, the     
 value of the engine is included in the value of non-originating        
 materials of that light-duty vehicle. The value of the piston assembly,
 which was, before its exportation to outside the territories of the    
 NAFTA countries, an originating good, shall not be deducted from the   
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-
 duty vehicle. Under section 18 (transshipment), the piston assembly is 
 no longer considered to be an originating good because it was used in  
 the production of a good outside the territories of the NAFTA          
 countries.                                                             
Example 8:                                                              
    A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country,
 imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber     
 hoses provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV. The
 wholesaler takes title to the goods at the wholesaler's place of       
 business in City A. The customs value of the imported goods is $500.   
 All freight, taxes and duties associated with the good to the          
 wholesaler's place of business total $100; the cost of the freight,    
 included in that $100, from the place where it was received in the     
 territory of a NAFTA country to the location of the wholesaler's place 
 of business in City A is $25. The wholesaler sells the rubber hoses for
 $650 to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses the goods in the    
 territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of
 a light-duty vehicle. The light-duty vehicle producer pays $50 to have 
 the goods shipped from the location of the wholesaler's place of       
 business in City A to the location at which the light-duty vehicle is  
 produced.                                                              
    The rubber hoses are traced materials and they are incorporated into
 a light-duty automotive good. For purposes of calculating, under       
 section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle,    
  (1) if the wholesaler takes title to the goods before the first place 
   at which they were received in the territory of a NAFTA country, then
   the value of non-originating materials, where the light-duty vehicle 
   producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c), would not   
   include the cost of freight from the place where they were received  
   in the territory of a NAFTA country to the location of the           
   wholesaler's place of business: in this situation, the value of non- 
   originating materials would be $575;                                 
  (2) if the producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(d)    
   that states the customs value of the traced material and, where not  
   included in that price, the cost of taxes, duties, fees and          
   transporting the goods to the place where title is taken, the light- 
   duty vehicle producer may use those values as the value of non-      
   originating materials with respect to the goods: in this situation,  
   the value of non-originating materials would be $600; or             
  (3) if the wholesaler is unwilling to provide the light-duty vehicle  
   producer with such a statement, the value of non-originating         
   materials with respect to the traced materials will be the value of  
   the materials with respect to the transaction in which the producer  
   acquired them, as provided for in section 9(2)(i), in this instance  
   $650; the costs of transporting the goods from the location of the   
   wholesaler's place of business to the location of the producer will  
   be included in the net cost of the goods, but not in the value of non-
   originating materials.                                               
Example 9:

    A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country,
 imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hose
 provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV. The      
 wholesaler sells the good to a producer located in the territory of the
 NAFTA country who uses the hose to produce a power steering hose       
 assembly, also provided for in heading 4009. The power steering hose   
 assembly is then sold to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses    
 that good in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The rubber hose is
 a traced material; the power steering hose assembly is not a traced    
 material because it was not imported from outside the territories of   
 the NAFTA countries.                                                   
    The wholesaler who imported the rubber hose from outside the        
 territories of the NAFTA countries has title to it at the time of      
 importation. The customs value of the good is $3, including freight and
 insurance and all other costs incurred in transporting the good to the 
 first place at which it was received in the territory of the NAFTA     
 country. Duties and fees and all other costs referred to in section    
 9(4), paid by the wholesaler with respect to the good, total an        
 additional $1. The wholesaler sells the good to the producer of the    
 power steering hose assemblies for $5, not including freight to the    
 location of that producer. The power steering hose producer pays $2 to 
 have the good delivered to the location of production. The value of the
 power steering hose assembly sold to the light-duty vehicle producer is
 $10, including freight for delivery of the goods to the location of the
 light-duty vehicle producer.                                           
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the light-duty vehicle:                                     
  (1) if the motor vehicle producer has a statement referred to in      
   section 9(2)(c) from the producer of the power steering hose assembly
   that states the customs value of the imported rubber hose            
   incorporated in the power steering hose assembly, and the value of   
   the duties, fees and other costs referred to in section 9(4), the    
   producer may use those values as the value of non-originating        
   materials with respect to that traced good: in this situation, that  
   value would be the customs value of $3 and the cost of duties and    
   fees of $1, provided that the wholesaler has provided the producer of
   the power steering hose assembly with the information regarding the  
   customs value of the imported good and the other costs;              
  (2) if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement from the       
   producer of the power steering hose assembly that states the value of
   the imported hose, with respect to the transaction in which the power
   steering hose assembly producer acquires the imported hose from the  
   wholesaler, the light-duty vehicle producer may include that value as
   the value of non-originating materials, in accordance with section   
   9(2)(e): in this situation, that value is $5; and the $2 cost of     
   transporting the good from the location of the wholesaler to the     
   location of the producer, because that cost is separately identified,
   would not be included in the value of non-originating materials of   
   the light-duty vehicle;                                              
  (3) if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in 
   section 9(2)(f) signed by the producer of the power steering hose    
   assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer may use the formula set out
   in section 9(2)(f) to calculate the value of non-originating         
   materials with respect to that acquired material: in this situation, 
   assuming the regional value content is 55 per cent, the value of non-
   originating materials would be $4.50; and because the cost of        
   transportation from the location of the producer of the power        
   steering hose assembly to the location of the light-duty vehicle     
   producer is included in the purchase price and not separately        
   identified, it may not be deducted from the purchase price, because  
   the formula referred to in section 9(2)(f) does not allow for the    
   deduction of transportation costs that would otherwise not be non-   
   originating;                                                         

[[Page 401]]

                                                                        
  (4) if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in 
   section 9(2)(g) signed by the producer of the power steering hose    
   assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer may use the formula set out
   in section 9(2)(g) to calculate the value of non-originating         
   materials with respect to that acquired material: in this situation, 
   assuming the regional value-content requirement is 50 per cent, the  
   value of non-originating materials would be $5; and because the cost 
   of transportation from the location of the producer of the power     
   steering hose assembly to the location of the light-duty vehicle     
   producer is included in the purchase price and not separately        
   identified, it may not be deducted from the purchase price, because  
   the formula referred to in section 9(2)(g) does not allow for the    
   deduction of transportation costs that would otherwise not be non-   
   originating; or                                                      
  (5) if the light-duty vehicle producer does not have a statement      
   referred to in any of sections 9(2)(c) through (h) from the producer 
   of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer 
   includes in the value of non-originating materials of the vehicles   
   the value, determined in accordance with section 9(2)(i), of the     
   power steering hose assembly: in this situation, that amount would be
   $10, the cost to the producer of acquiring that material.            
Example 10:                                                             
    A producer of light-duty vehicles located in City C in the territory
 of a NAFTA country imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA   
 countries rubber hose provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in 
 Schedule IV, and uses that good as original equipment in the production
 of a light-duty vehicle.                                               
    The rubber hose arrives at City A in the NAFTA country, but the     
 producer of the light-duty vehicle does not have title to the good; it 
 is transported under bond to City B, and on its arrival in City B, the 
 producer of the light-duty vehicle takes title to it and the good is   
 received in the territory of a NAFTA country. The good is then         
 transported to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer in City 
 C.                                                                     
    The customs value of the imported good is $4, the transportation and
 other costs referred to in subparagraph 9(2)(b)(ii) to City A are $3   
 and to City B are $2, and the cost of duties, taxes and other fees     
 referred to in section 9(4) is $1. The cost of transporting the good   
 from City B to the location of the producer in City C is $1. The rubber
 hose is traced material.                                               
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the light-duty vehicle, the value, under section 9(2)(b), of
 non-originating materials of that vehicle is the customs value of the  
 traced material and, where not included in that value, the cost of     
 taxes, duties, fees and the cost of transporting the traced material to
 the place where title is taken. In this situation, the value of non-   
 originating materials would be the customs value of the traced         
 material, $4, the cost of duties taxes and other fees, $1, the cost of 
 transporting the material to City A, $3, and the cost of transporting  
 that material from City A to City B, $2, for a total of $10. The $1    
 cost of transporting the good from City B to the location of the       
 producer in City C would not be included in the value of non-          
 originating materials of the light-duty vehicle because a person of a  
 NAFTA country has taken title to the traced material.                  
Example 11:

    A radiator provided for in subheading 8708.91 is imported from      
 outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by a producer of light- 
 duty vehicles and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as       
 original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.          
    The radiator is transported by ship from outside the territories of 
 the NAFTA countries and arrives in the territory of the NAFTA country  
 at City A. The radiator is not, however, unloaded at City A and        
 although the radiator is physically present in the territory of the    
 NAFTA country, it has not been received in the territory of a NAFTA    
 country.                                                               
    The ship sails in territorial waters from City A to City B and the  
 radiator is unloaded there. The light-duty vehicle producer files, from
 City C in the same country, the entry for the radiator; the radiator   
 enters the territory of the NAFTA country at City B.                   
    Subheading 8708.91 is listed in Schedule IV. The radiator is a      
 traced material.                                                       
    For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value 
 content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the radiator is        
 included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty   
 vehicle. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs  
 incurred in transporting the radiator to City B are included in the    
 value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle, including
 the cost of transporting the radiator from City A to City B. The costs 
 of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs that were incurred  
 in transporting the radiator from City B to the location of the        
 producer are not included in the value of non-originating materials of 
 the light-duty vehicle.                                                
Example 12:                                                             
    Producer X, located in NAFTA country A, produces a car seat of      
 subheading No. 9401.20 that is used in the production of a light-duty  
 vehicle. The only non-originating material used in the production of   
 the car seat is an electric motor of subheading No. 8501.20 that was   
 imported by Producer X from outside the territories of the NAFTA       
 countries. The electric motor is a material of a tariff provision      
 listed in Schedule IV and thus is a traced material.                   
    Producer X sells the car seat as original equipment to Producer Y, a
 light-duty vehicle producer, located in NAFTA country B. The car seat  
 is an originating good because the non-originating material in the car 
 seat (the electric motor) undergoes the applicable change in tariff    
 classification set out in a rule that specifies only a change in tariff
 classification. Consequently, Producer X does not choose to calculate  
 the regional value content of the car seat in accordance with section  
 12(1).                                                                 
    For purposes of determining, under section 9(1), the value of non-  
 originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle 
 that incorporates the car seat, the value of the electric motor is     
 included even though the car seat qualifies as an originating material.
    Producer X provides Producer Y with a statement described in section
 9(2)(c), with the value of non-originating material used in the        
 production of the car seat determined in accordance with section 12(3),
 as is permitted by section 9(8). Producer Y uses that value as the     
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-
 duty vehicle with respect to the car seat.                             
Example 13:                                                             
    This example has the same facts as in Example 12, except that the   
 car seat does not qualify as an originating good under the rule that   
 specifies only a change in tariff classification. Instead, it qualifies
 as an originating good under a rule that specifies a regional value-   
 content requirement and a change in tariff classification. For purposes
 of that rule, Producer X chose to calculate the regional value content 
 of the car seat in accordance with section 12(1) over a period set out 
 in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(a).  
    For purposes of the statement described in section 9(2)(c), Producer
 X determined, as is permitted under section 9(8), the value of non-    
 originating material used in the production of the car seat in         
 accordance with section 12(3) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a)
 and using a category set out in section 12(4)(e).

                 SECTION 10. HEAVY-DUTY AUTOMOTIVE GOODS                
Determining VNM for the calculation of the RVC for heavy-duty automotive
                                  goods                                 
                                                                        
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (3) through (8) and     
 section 12(10)(a), for purposes of calculating the regional value      
 content of a heavy-duty automotive good under the net cost method, the 
 value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good in 
 the production of the good shall be the sum of                         
  (a) for each listed material that is a non-originating material, is a 
   self-produced material and is used by the producer in the production 
   of the good, at the choice of the producer, either                   
    (i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by   
     the producer that can be reasonably allocated to that listed       
     material in accordance with Schedule VII,                          
    (ii) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost   
     incurred with respect to that listed material that can be          
     reasonably allocated to that listed material in accordance with    
     Schedule VII, or                                                   
    (iii) the sum of                                                    
      (A) the customs value of each non-originating material imported by
       the producer and used in the production of the listed material,  
       and, where not included in that customs value, the costs referred
       to in subsections (2)(c) through (f), and                        
      (B) the value of each non-originating material that is not        
       imported by the producer of the listed material and is used in   
       the production of the listed material, determined in accordance  
       with subsection (2) with respect to the transaction in which the 
       producer of the listed material acquired it;                     
  (b) for each listed material that is a non-originating material, is   
   produced in the territory of a NAFTA country and is acquired and used
   by the producer in the production of the good, at the choice of the  
   producer, either                                                     
    (i) the value of that non-originating listed material, determined in
     accordance with subsection (2), with respect to the transaction in 
     which the producer acquired the listed material, or                
    (ii) where the producer of the good has a statement described in    
     clause (A) or (B) with respect to each material that is a non-     
     originating material used in the production of that listed         
     material, the sum of                                               
      (A) the customs value of each non-originating material imported by

   not apply with respect to after-market parts;                        
  (c) this section does not apply to a sub-component for purposes of    
   calculating its regional value content before it is incorporated into
   a heavy-duty automotive good;                                        
  (d) for purposes of calculating the regional value content of a heavy-
   duty automotive good, the producer of that good may choose to treat  
   any material used in the production of that good as a non-originating
   material, and the value of that material shall be determined in      
   accordance with subsection (2) with respect to the transaction in    
   which the producer acquired it;                                      
  (e) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsections 
   (1)(b)(ii), (d)(i) through (iii) or (e)(i) that concerns the value of
   materials or costs shall be in the same currency as the currency of  
   the country in which the person who provided the statement is        
   located; and                                                         
  (f) total cost under subsections (1)(a)(i) and (ii) consists of the

(10) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in 
 section 2(4).                                                          
                                                                        



Example 1: A listed material is imported from outside the territories of
 the NAFTA countries                                                    
    A cast head, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA          
 countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used  
 in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as    
 original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other 
 non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The
 cast head is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component.

    Situation 1: Use of the listed material in an automotive component  
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the       
 engine, the value of listed materials imported from outside the        
 territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-    
 originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the
 cast head was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, 
 its value, under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-    
 originating materials used in the production of the engine.            
    Situation 2: Use of an originating automotive component             
 incorporating the listed material                                      
    The engine is an originating material acquired by the producer of   
 the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value 
 content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and   
 incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials    
 used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under   
 section 10(1)(d) with respect to that engine. The producer may choose  
 to include in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty 
 vehicle                                                                
  (a) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(i), of the non-      
   originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is
   the value, determined under sections 10(1) (a) through (c) and       
   paragraph (e)(ii), of the non-originating materials;                 
  (b) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii), which is an     
   amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv)     
   multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value content, 
   expressed as a decimal, of the engine;                               
  (c) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii), which is an    
   amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv)     
   multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value-content  
   requirement, expressed as a decimal, for the engine; or              
  (d) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv), of the engine.  
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if 
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(i), from
 the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the   
 value, determined under section 10(1)(c), of the cast head, is included
 in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle,   
 with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-
 duty vehicle.                                                          
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the second option if
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(ii),    
 from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation,  
 because of the application of the equation, the value of the cast head 
 will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii)   
 and is, consequently, included in the value of non-originating         
 materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.            
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the third option if 
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(iii),   
 from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation,  
 because of the application of the equation, the value of the cast head 
 will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii)  
 and is, consequently, included in the value of non-originating         
 materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.            
    Situation 3: Use of a non-originating automotive component          
 incorporating the listed material                                      
    The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of
 the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value 
 content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and   
 incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials    
 used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under   
 section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-
 duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating     
 materials either                                                       

[[Page 409]]

                                                                        
  (a) the value, as determined under section 10(1)(e)(i), of the non-   
   originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is
   the value of the non-originating materials as determined under       
   sections 10(1)(a) through (d) and (f), or                            
  (b) the value of the engine, determined under section 10(1)(e)(ii).   
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if 
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from
 the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the   
 value of the cast head, as determined under section 10(1)(c), is       
 included in the value of non-originating materials used in the         
 production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that  
 is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.                   
Example 2: A material is imported from outside the territories of the   
 NAFTA countries                                                        
    A rocker arm assembly, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA
 countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used  
 in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as    
 original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other 
 non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The
 rocker arm assembly is neither a listed material nor a sub-component;  
 the engine is an automotive component.                                 
    Situation 1: Use of the material in an automotive component         
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the       
 engine, the value of non-originating materials that are not listed     
 materials is included in the value of non-originating materials used in
 the production of the engine. Because the rocker arm assembly was      
 produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it is a non-  
 originating material and its value, under section 10(1)(f), is included
 in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the
 engine.                                                                
    Situation 2: Use of an originating automotive component             
 incorporating the material                                             
    The engine is an originating material acquired by the producer of   
 the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value 
 content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and   
 incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating    
 materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is          
 determined under section 10(1)(d) with respect to that engine. The     
 producer may choose to include in the value of non-originating         
 materials of the heavy-duty vehicle                                    
  (a) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(i), of the non-      
   originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is
   the value, determined under sections 10(1) (a) through (c) and       
   paragraph (e)(ii), of the non-originating materials;                 
  (b) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii), which is an     
   amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv)     
   multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value content, 
   expressed as a decimal, of the engine;                               
  (c) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii), which is an    
   amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv)     
   multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value-content  
   requirement, expressed as a decimal, for the engine; or              
  (d) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv), of the engine.  

[[Page 410]]

                                                                        
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if 
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(i), from
 the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the   
 value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f),
 is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-
 duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production
 of the heavy-duty vehicle.                                             
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the second option if
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(ii),    
 from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation,  
 because of the application of the equation, the value of the rocker arm
 assembly will be included in the amount determined under section       
 10(1)(d)(ii) and will, consequently, be included in the value of non-  
 originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the third option if 
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(iii),   
 from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation,  
 because of the application of the equation, the value of the rocker arm
 assembly will be included in the amount determined under section       
 10(1)(d)(iii) and will, consequently, be included in the value of non- 
 originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
    Situation 3: Use of a non-originating automotive component          
 incorporating the material                                             
    The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of
 the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value 
 content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and   
 incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating    
 materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is          
 determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The     
 producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value  
 of non-originating materials either                                    
  (a) the value, as determined under section 10(1)(e)(i), of the non-   
   originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is
   the value of the non-originating materials as determined under       
   sections 10(1) (a) through (d) and (f), or                           
  (b) the value of the engine, determined under section 10(1)(e)(ii).   
    The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if 
 that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from
 the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the   
 value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f),
 is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the      
 production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that  
 is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.                   
    Situation 4: Use of the material in a self-produced automotive      
 component                                                              
    If the engine is a self-produced material rather than an acquired   
 material, the heavy-duty vehicle producer is using the rocker arm      
 assembly in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle rather than in the
 production of the engine, because, under section 7(4), the engine      
 cannot be designated as an intermediate material. For purposes of      
 calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the  
 value, under section 10(1)(f), of the rocker arm assembly is included  
 in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the
 heavy-duty vehicle.                                                    
Example 3: An automotive component is imported from outside the         
 territories of the NAFTA countries                                     

[[Page 411]]

                                                                        
    A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA       
 countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used  
 in that country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty
 vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component.                  
    Situation: Use of the automotive component                          
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-
 duty vehicle in which the transmission is used, the value of the       
 transmission is included in the value of the non-originating materials 
 under section 10(1)(c), regardless of whether the producer imported the
 transmission or acquired it from someone else in the territory of a    
 NAFTA country.                                                         
Example 4: An automotive component is imported from outside the         
 territories of the NAFTA countries                                     
    A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA       
 countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and       
 combined with an engine to produce an engine-transmission assembly that
 will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty   
 vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component; the engine-      
 transmission assembly is an automotive component assembly.             
    Situation: Use of the automotive component assembly                 
    The automotive component assembly is acquired by a producer who uses
 it in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. If the automotive        
 component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is an   
 originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in   
 the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at  
 the choice of the producer, under any of section 10(1)(d) (i), (ii),   
 (iii) and (iv). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these 
 provisions.) If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the
 imported transmission is a non-originating material, the value of non- 
 originating materials used in the production of the automotive         
 component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under 
 section 10(1)(e) (i) or (ii). (See example 1 for more detailed         
 explanations of these provisions.)                                     
    Regardless of whether the automotive component assembly is an       
 originating material or a non-originating material, the value of the   
 automotive component that was imported from outside the territories of 
 the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating        
 materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. The        
 transmission is a non-originating material, and, for purposes of       
 calculating the regional value content of an automotive component      
 assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that transmission, the
 value of the transmission is included in the value of non-originating  
 materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly  
 or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates it.                            
Example 5: A material is imported from outside the territories of the   
 NAFTA countries                                                        

[[Page 412]]

                                                                        
    An aluminum ingot, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA    
 countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used  
 in that country in the production of cast block that will be used in an
 engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a  
 heavy-duty vehicle. The aluminum ingot is not a listed material; the   
 cast block is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component.
    Situation 1: Use of the material in an intermediate material that is
 a listed material                                                      
    The engine producer designates the cast block as an intermediate    
 material under section 7(4). For purposes of determining the origin of 
 that cast block, because the aluminum ingot is classified under a      
 different heading than the cast block, the cast block satisfies the    
 applicable change in tariff classification and is an originating       
 material.                                                              
    Situation 2: Use of the listed material incorporating the material  
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine
 that incorporates that cast block (and thus incorporates the aluminum  
 ingot), the value of non-originating materials is determined under     
 section 10(1). Because none of sections 10(1) (a) through (f) require  
 that a listed material that is an originating material be included in  
 the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a     
 good, the value of the cast block is not included in the value of non- 
 originating materials used in the production of the engine or in the   
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of an        
 automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates  
 the engine.                                                            
    Because section 10(1)(d) does not refer to a listed material that is
 an originating material, the value of the non-originating aluminum     
 ingot used in the production of the originating cast block is not      
 included in the value of non-originating materials used in the         
 production of any good or material that incorporates the originating   
 cast block.                                                            
Example 6: A non-originating listed material is used to produce a sub-  
 component that is used to produce another sub-component                

[[Page 413]]

                                                                        
    A crankshaft, produced in the territory of NAFTA country A from a   
 forging imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries,  
 is a non-originating material. The crankshaft is sold to another       
 producer, located in the same country, who uses it to produce an       
 originating block assembly. That block assembly is sold to another     
 producer, also located in the same country, who uses it to produce a   
 finished block. The finished block is sold to a producer of engines,   
 who is located in NAFTA country B, for use in the production of a heavy-
 duty vehicle. The crankshaft is a listed material; the block assembly  
 is a sub-component, as is the finished block.                          
    Situation 1: Calculating the regional value content of the finished 
 block                                                                  
    A sub-component is not a heavy-duty automotive good. As referred to 
 in section 10(9)(c), for purposes of calculating the regional value    
 content of the sub-component before it is incorporated into a heavy-   
 duty automotive good, such as when the sub-component is exported from  
 the territory of one NAFTA country to the territory of another NAFTA   
 country, the value of non-originating materials of the sub-component   
 includes only the value of non-originating materials used in the       
 production of that sub-component. Because the block assembly is an     
 originating material, its value is not included in the value of non-   
 originating materials of the finished block, nor is the value of the   
 non-originating crankshaft included in the value of non-originating    
 materials used in the production of the finished block because the     
 crankshaft was used in the production of the block assembly and was not
 used in the production of the finished block.                          
    Situation 2: Calculating the regional value content of the component
 that incorporates the finished block                                   
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-
 duty vehicle that incorporates a sub-component, the value of non-      
 originating materials used in the production of the sub-component is   
 determined under section 10(1) (d) or (e) with respect to that sub-    
 component. In this situation, the value, under section 10(1)(b), of the
 non-originating crankshaft is included in the value of non-originating 
 materials used in the production of the engine. (See examples 1 and 2  
 for more detailed explanations of sections 10(1) (d) and (e).)         
Example 7: A non-listed material is imported from outside the           
 territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the production of    
 another non-listed material                                            
    A bumper part, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA        
 countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and is    
 used in the production of a bumper. The bumper is used in the territory
 of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a heavy- 
 duty vehicle. Neither a bumper part nor a bumper is a listed material, 
 sub-component, automotive component or automotive component assembly.  
    Situation 1: The non-listed material is an originating material     
    The bumper is an originating material. For purposes of calculating  
 the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, neither the value
 of the imported bumper part nor the value of the bumper is included in 
 the value of the non-originating materials.                            
    Situation 2: The non-listed material is a non-originating material  
    The bumper is a non-originating material. For purposes of           
 calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the  
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-
 duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(f) with respect to the  
 bumper. In this situation, the value of the bumper is included in the  
 value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle. Because a
 bumper is not a listed material, the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle
 does not have the option, under section 10(1)(b)(ii), to include only  
 the value of the imported bumper part in the value of non-originating  
 materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.            
Example 8:

    Situation: Transhipment of a listed material                        
    A producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, produces,  
 in that country, a cast head that is an originating good. The producer 
 exports the cast head to outside the territories of the NAFTA          
 territories, where valves, springs, valve lifters, a camshaft and gears
 are added to it to create a cast head assembly. An engine producer,    
 located in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports the cast head     
 assembly into that country and uses it in the production of an engine  
 that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-  
 duty vehicle. A cast head is a listed material; a cast head assembly is
 a sub-component.                                                       
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the       
 engine, the value of the imported cast head assembly is included in the
 value of non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c). The value of
 the cast head cannot be deducted from the value determined under       
 section 10(1)(c). Although the cast head was once an originating good, 
 under section 18 when further production was performed with respect to 
 the cast head outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it was no
 longer an originating good.                                            
Example 9: A material is imported from outside the territories of the   
 NAFTA countries and a heavy-duty vehicle producer self-produces a non- 
 originating listed material                                            
    A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries,
 is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that     
 country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original
 equipment by the same producer in the production of a heavy-duty       
 vehicle. Although the producer, under section 7(4), designates the     
 water pump as an intermediate material it is a non-originating material
 because it fails to satisfy the regional value-content requirement. A  
 water pump is a listed material.                                       
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-
 duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials includes, at the  
 choice of the producer, either the total cost, determined under section
 10(1)(a)(i), of the water pump or the value, determined under section  
 10(1)(a)(iii)(A), of the material imported from outside the territories
 of the NAFTA countries.                                                
Example 10: A material is acquired and used to produce a non-originating
 listed material                                                        
    A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries,
 is acquired in the territory of a NAFTA country and is used in that    
 country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original
 equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The producer of   
 the water pump and the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle are separate,
 unrelated producers, located in the same country. A water pump is a    
 listed material. The producer of the water pump chose to calculate the 
 regional value content of the water pump in accordance with section    
 12(1) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category   
 set out in section 12(4)(b). The water pump is a non-originating       
 material because it fails to satisfy the regional value-content        
 requirement.                                                           
    For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-
 duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials includes, at the  
 choice of the producer, either the value, determined under section     
 10(1)(b)(i), of the water pump or, if the producer has a statement     
 referred to in section 10(1)(b)(ii)(B), the value, determined under    
 that section, of the material imported from outside the territories of 
 the NAFTA countries.                                                   
    The producer has a statement referred to in section 10(1)(b)(ii)(B) 
 and chooses to use the value of non-originating material determined    
 under that section. The statement states, as is permitted under section
 10(8), the value of non-originating material used in the production of 
 the water pump in accordance with section 12(3) over a period set out  
 in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(e).

(1) For purposes of calculating the regional value content of light-duty
 vehicles or heavy-duty vehicles, the producer of those motor vehicles  
 may choose that                                                        
  (a) the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-
   originating materials used by the producer be calculated over the    
   producer's fiscal year with respect to the motor vehicles that are in
   any one of the categories set out in subsection (5) that is chosen by
   the producer; and                                                    
  (b) the sums referred to in paragraph (a) be used in the calculation  
   referred to in section 6(3) as the net cost and the value of non-    
   originating materials, respectively.

   administration may accept.                                           
                                                                        
                            Averaging period                            
                                                                        
(3) Where the fiscal year of a producer begins after the date of the    
 entry into force of the Agreement but before one year after that date, 
 the producer may choose that the calculation of regional value content 
 referred to in subsection (1) or (6) be made under that subsection over
 the period beginning on the date of the entry into force of the        
 Agreement and ending at the end of that fiscal year, in which case the 
 choice shall be filed with the customs administration of each NAFTA    
 country to which vehicles are to be exported during the period covered 
 by the choice not later than 10 days after the entry into force of the 
 Agreement, or such longer period as that customs administration may    
 accept.                                                                
(4) Where the fiscal year of a producer begins on the date of the entry 
 into force of the Agreement, the producer may make the choice referred 
 to in subsection (1) not later than 10 days after the entry into force 
 of the Agreement, or such longer period as the customs administration  
 referred to in subsection (2)(g) may accept.

  (b) the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same plant in the
   territory of a NAFTA country; and                                    
  (c) the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of
   a NAFTA country.                                                     
(6) Where applicable, a producer may choose that the calculation of the 
 regional value content of motor vehicles referred to in Schedule VI be 
 made in accordance with that schedule.                                 
                                                                        
                   Timely filing of choice to average                   
                                                                        
(7) Subject to section 5(4) of Schedule VI, the choice referred to in   
 subsection (6) shall be filed with the customs administration of the   
 NAFTA country to which vehicles referred to in that schedule are to be 
 exported, at least 10 days before the first day of the producer's      
 fiscal year with respect to which that choice is to apply or such      
 shorter period as the customs administration may accept.               
                                                                        
                  Choice to average cannot be rescinded                 
                                                                        
(8) A choice filed for the period referred to in subsection (1) or (3)  
 may not be                                                             
  (a) rescinded; or                                                     
  (b) modified with respect to the category or basis of calculation.    
                                                                        
Averaged net cost and VNM included in calculation of RVC on the basis of
  producer's option to include all vehicles of category or only certain 
                      exported vehicles of category                     
                                                                        
(9) For purposes of this section, where a producer files a choice under 
 subsection (1), (3) or (4), including a choice referred to in section  
 13(9), the net cost incurred and the values of non-originating         
 materials used by the producer, with respect to                        
  (a) all motor vehicles that fall within the category chosen by the    
   producer and that are produced during the fiscal year or, in the case
   of a choice filed under subsection (3), during the period with       
   respect to which the choice is made, or                              
  (b) those motor vehicles to be exported to the territory of one or    
   more of the NAFTA countries that fall within the category chosen by  
   the producer and that are produced during the fiscal year or, in the 
   case of a choice filed under subsection (3), during the period with  
   respect to which the choice is made,                                 
shall be included in the calculation of the regional value content under
 any of the categories set out in subsection (5).                       
                                                                        
    Year-end analysis required if averaging based on estimated costs;   
                obligation to notify of change in status                
                                                                        
(10) Where the producer of a motor vehicle has calculated the regional  
 value content of the motor vehicle on the basis of estimated costs,    
 including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar          
 estimating procedures, before or during the producer's fiscal year, the
 producer shall conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal 
 year of the actual costs incurred over the period with respect to the  
 production of the motor vehicle, and, if the motor vehicle does not    
 satisfy the regional value content requirement on the basis of the     
 actual costs, immediately inform any person to whom the producer has   
 provided a Certificate of Origin for the motor vehicle, or a written   
 statement that the motor vehicle is an originating good, that the motor
 vehicle is a non-originating good.                                     
(11) The following example is an ``Example'' as referred to in section  
 2(4).                                                                  
                                                                        




Example:

    A motor vehicle producer located in NAFTA country A produces        
 vehicles that fall within a category set out in section 11(5) that is  
 chosen by the producer. The motor vehicles are to be sold in NAFTA     
 countries A, B and C, as well as in country D, which is not a NAFTA    
 country. Under section 11(1), the motor vehicle producer may choose    
 that the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-
 originating materials used by the producer be calculated over the      
 producer's fiscal year. The producer may state in the choice the basis 
 of the calculation as described in section 11(9)(a), in which case the 
 calculation would be on the basis of all the motor vehicles produced   
 regardless of where they are destined. Alternatively, the producer may 
 state in the choice the basis of the calculation as described in       
 section 11(9)(b). In this case, the producer would also need to state  
 that the calculation is on the basis of                                
  (a) the motor vehicles produced that are for export to NAFTA countries
   B and C;                                                             
  (b) the motor vehicles produced that are for export to only NAFTA     
   country B; or

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4), for purposes of determining     
 whether a good is an originating good, an exporter or producer of a    
 good may choose to accumulate the production, by one or more producers 
 in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, of materials   
 that are incorporated into that good so that the production of the     
 materials shall be considered to have been performed by that exporter  
 or producer.

    (i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect  
     to the material shall be the net cost incurred by the producer of  
     the material plus, where not included in the net cost incurred by  
     the producer of the material, the costs referred to in sections    
     7(1)(c) through (e), and                                           
    (ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of 
     the good with respect to the material shall be the value of non-   
     originating materials used by the producer of the material; or     
  (b) states any amount, other than an amount that includes any of the  
   value of non-originating materials, that is part of the net cost     
   incurred by the producer of the material in the production of that   
   material,                                                            
    (i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect  
     to the material shall be the value of the material, determined in  
     accordance with section 7(1), and                                  
    (ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of 
     the good with respect to the material shall be the value of the    
     material, determined in accordance with section 7(1), minus the    
     amount stated in the statement.

   materials, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by 
   the producer of the material over a month or any consecutive three,  
   six or twelve month period that falls within the fiscal year of the  
   producer of the good, divided by the number of units of materials    
   with respect to which the statement is made,                         
    (i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect  
     to the material shall be the sum of the net costs incurred by the  
     producer of the material with respect to that material and the     
     identical materials or similar materials, divided by the number of 
     units of materials with respect to which the statement is made,    
     plus, where not included in the net costs incurred by the producer 
     of the material, the costs referred to in sections 7(1) (c) through

   combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer of   
   the material over a month or any consecutive three, six or twelve    
   month period that falls within the fiscal year of the producer of the
   good, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to    
   which the statement is made,

(4) For purposes of section 7(4), where a producer of the good chooses  
 to accumulate the production of materials under subsection (1), that   
 production shall be considered to be the production of the producer of 
 the good.

    (ii) where an applicable change in tariff classification is applied 
     to determine whether the good is an originating good, the producer 
     of the good must have a statement signed by the producer of the    
     material that states the tariff classification of all non-         
     originating materials used by that producer in the production of   
     that material and that the production of the material took place   
     entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries;   
  (b) a producer of a good who chooses to accumulate is not required to 
   accumulate the production of all materials that are incorporated into
   the good; and                                                        
  (c) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsection  
   (2) or (3) that concerns the value of materials or costs shall be in 
   the same currency as the currency of the country in which the person 
   who provided the statement is located.                               
                                                                        
                 Examples of accumulation of production                 
                                                                        
(6) Each of the following examples is an ``Example'' as referred to in  
 section 2(4).                                                          
                                                                        
                                                                        


Example 1: section 14(1)                                                
    Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports unfinished bearing  
 rings provided for in subheading 8482.99 into NAFTA country A from a   
 non-NAFTA territory. Producer A further processes the unfinished       
 bearing rings into finished bearing rings, which are of the same       
 subheading. The finished bearing rings of Producer A do not satisfy an 
 applicable change in tariff classification and therefore do not qualify
 as originating goods. The net cost of the finished bearing rings (per  
 unit) is calculated as follows:

Total cost of the finished bearing rings, per unit.........        $1.45
Excluded costs: (included in period costs).................         0.05

Net cost of the finished bearing rings, per unit...........        $1.40
------------------------------------------------------------------------



    Producer A sells the finished bearing rings to Producer B who is    
 located in NAFTA country A for $1.50 each. Producer B further processes
 them into bearings, and intends to export the bearings to NAFTA country
 B. Although the bearings satisfy the applicable change in tariff       
 classification, the bearings are subject to a regional value-content   
 requirement.                                                           
    Situation A:                                                        
    Producer B does not choose to accumulate costs incurred by Producer

    Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.                      
Example 2: section 14(1)                                                
    Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports non-originating     
 cotton, carded or combed, provided for in heading 5203 for use in the  
 production of cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205. Because the    
 change from cotton, carded or combed, to cotton yarn is a change within
 the same chapter, the cotton does not satisfy the applicable change in 
 tariff classification for heading 5205, which is a change from any     
 other chapter, with certain exceptions. Therefore, the cotton yarn that
 Producer A produces from non-originating cotton is a non-originating   
 good.                                                                  
    Producer A then sells the non-originating cotton yarn to Producer B,
 also located in NAFTA country A, who uses the cotton yarn in the       
 production of woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208. The 
 change from non-originating cotton yarn to woven fabric of cotton is   
 insufficient to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification 
 for heading 5208, which is a change from any heading outside headings  
 5208 through 5212, except from certain headings, under which various   
 yarns, including cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205, are         
 classified. Therefore, the woven fabric of cotton that Producer B      
 produces from non-originating cotton yarn produced by Producer A is a  
 non-originating good.                                                  
    However, under section 14(1), if Producer B chooses to accumulate   
 the production of Producer A, the production of Producer A would be    
 considered to have been performed by Producer B. The rule for heading  
 5208, under which the cotton fabric is classified, does not exclude a  
 change from heading 5203, under which carded or combed cotton is       
 classified. Therefore, under section 15(1), the change from carded or  
 combed cotton provided for in heading 5203 to the woven fabric of      
 cotton provided for in heading 5208 would satisfy the applicable change
 of tariff classification for heading 5208. The woven fabric of cotton  
 would be considered as an originating good.                            
    Producer B, in order to choose to accumulate Producer A's           
 production, must have a statement described in section 14(4)(a)(ii).   
                                                                        


         SECTION 15. INABILITY TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION        
  Supplier of material unable to provide information; beyond control of 
              supplier; procedure to be followed by Customs             
                                                                        
(1) Where, during a verification of origin of a good, the person from   
 whom a producer of the good acquired a material used in the production 
 of that good is unable to provide the customs administration that is   
 conducting the verification with sufficient information to substantiate
 that the material is an originating material or that the value of the  
 material declared for purpose of calculating the regional value content
 of the good is accurate, and the inability of that person to provide   
 the information is due to reasons beyond the control of that person,   
 the customs administration shall, before making a determination as to  
 the origin or value of the material, consider, where relevant, the     
 following:                                                             
  (a) whether the customs administration of the NAFTA country into the  
   territory of which the good was imported issued an advance ruling    
   under Article 509 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA     
   country, with respect to that material that concluded that the       
   material is an originating material or that the value of the material
   declared for purposes of calculating the regional value content of   
   the good is accurate;

  (b) whether an independent auditor has confirmed the accuracy of      
    (i) any signed statement referred to in this appendix with respect  
     to the material,                                                   
    (ii) the information that was used by the person from whom the      
     producer acquired the material to substantiate whether the material
     is an originating material, or                                     
    (iii) the information submitted by the producer of the material with
     an application for an advance ruling where, on the basis of that   
     information, the customs administration concluded that the material
     is an originating material or that the value declared for the      
     purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good is   
     accurate;                                                          
  (c) whether the customs administration has, before the start of the   
   origin verification of the good, conducted a verification of origin  
   of identical materials or similar materials produced by the producer 
   of the material and determined that                                  
    (i) the identical materials or similar materials are originating    
     materials, or                                                      
    (ii) any signed statement referred to in this appendix with respect 
     to those identical materials or similar materials is accurate;     
  (d) whether the producer of the good has exercised due diligence to   
   ensure that any signed statement that is referred to in this appendix
   with respect to the material and that was provided by the person from
   whom the producer acquired the material is accurate;                 
  (e) where the customs administration has access only to partial       
   records of the person from whom the producer acquired the material,  
   whether the records provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that 
   the material is an originating material or that the value of the     
   material declared for purposes of calculating the regional value     
   content of the good is accurate;                                     
  (f) whether the customs administration can obtain, subject to Article 
   507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, by means 
   other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) through (e), relevant 
   information regarding the determination of the origin or value of the
   material from the customs administration of the NAFTA country in the 
   territory of which the person from whom the producer acquired the    
   material was located; and                                            
  (g) whether the producer of the good, the person from whom the        
   producer acquired the material or a representative of that person or 
   producer agrees to bear the expenses incurred in providing the       
   customs administration with the assistance that it may require for   
   determining the origin or value of the material.

(2) For purposes of subsection (1), ``reasons beyond the control'' of   
 the person from whom the producer of the good acquired the material    
 includes                                                               
  (a) the bankruptcy of the person from whom the producer acquired the  
   material or any other financial distress situation or business       
   reorganization that resulted in that person or a related person      
   having lost control of the records containing the information that   
   substantiate that the material is an originating material or the     
   value of the material declared for the purpose of calculating the    
   regional value content of the good;                                  
  (b) any other reason that results in partial or complete loss of      
   records of that producer that the producer could not reasonably have 
   been expected to foresee, including loss of records due to fire,     
   flooding or other natural cause.

                                 Customs                                
                                                                        
(3) Where, during a verification of origin of a good, the exporter or   
 producer of the good is unable to provide the customs administration   
 conducting the verification with sufficient information to substantiate
 that the good is an originating good, and the inability of that person 
 to provide the information is due to reasons beyond the control of that
 person, the customs administration shall, before making a determination
 as to the origin of the good, consider, where relevant, the following: 
  (a) whether the customs administration of the NAFTA country into the  
   territory of which the good was imported issued an advance ruling    
   under Article 509 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA     
   country, with respect to that good that concluded that the good is an
   originating good;                                                    
  (b) whether an independent auditor has confirmed the accuracy of an   
   origin statement with respect to the good;                           
  (c) whether the customs administration has, before the start of the   
   origin verification of the good, conducted a verification of origin  
   of identical goods or similar goods produced by the producer of the  
   good and determined that the identical goods or similar goods are    
   originating goods;                                                   
  (d) whether the exporter or producer of the good has exercised due    
   diligence to ensure that the information provided to substantiate    
   that the good is an originating good is sufficient; and              
  (e) where the customs administration has access only to partial       
   records of the exporter or producer of the good, whether the records 
   provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that the good is an      
   originating good;                                                    
  (f) whether the customs administration can obtain, subject to Article 
   507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, by means 
   other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) through (e), relevant 
   information regarding the determination of the origin of the good    
   from the customs administration of the NAFTA country in the territory
   of which the exporter or producer of the good was located; and       
  (g) whether the exporter or producer of the good or a representative  
   of that person agrees to bear the expenses incurred in providing the 
   customs administration with the assistance that it may require for   
   determining the origin or value of the good.                         
                                                                        
                       ``Reasons beyond control''                       
                                                                        
(4) For purposes of subsection (3), ``reasons beyond the control'' of   
 the exporter or producer of the good includes                          
  (a) the bankruptcy of the exporter or producer or any other financial 
   distress situation or business reorganization that resulted in that  
   person or a related person having lost control of the records        
   containing the information that substantiate that the good is an     
   originating good;                                                    
  (b) any other reason that results in partial or complete loss of      
   records of that exporter or producer that that person could not      
   reasonably have been expected to foresee, including loss of records  
   due to fire, flooding or other natural cause.                        
                                                                        
                        SECTION 16. TRANSSHIPMENT                       
    Effect of subsequent processing outside the territory of a NAFTA    
                country; loss of originating good status                
                                                                        
(1) A good is not an originating good by reason of having undergone     
 production that occurs entirely in the territory of one or more of the 
 NAFTA countries that would enable the good to qualify as an originating
 good if subsequent to that production                                  
  (a) the good is withdrawn from customs control outside the territories
   of the NAFTA countries; or

  (b) the good undergoes further production or any other operation      
   outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, other than unloading,
   reloading or any other operation necessary to preserve the good in   
   good condition, such as inspection, removal of dust that accumulates 
   during shipment, ventilation, spreading out or drying, chilling,     
   replacing salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, replacing
   damaged packing materials and containers and removal of units of the 
   good that are spoiled or damaged and present a danger to the         
   remaining units of the good, or to transport the good to the         
   territory of a NAFTA country.                                        
                                                                        
         Transshipped good considered entirely non-originating          
                                                                        
(2) A good that is a non-originating good by application of subsection  
 (1) is considered to be entirely non-originating for purposes of this  
 appendix.                                                              
                                                                        
                      Exceptions for certain goods                      
                                                                        
(3) Subsection (1) does not apply with respect to a good provided for in
 any of subheadings 8541.10 through 8541.60 and 8542.11 through 8542.80 
 where any further production or other operation that that good         
 undergoes outside the territories of the NAFTA countries does not      
 result in a change in the tariff classification of the good to a       
 subheading outside subheadings 8541.10 through 8542.90.                
                                                                        
                  SECTION 17. NON-QUALIFYING OPERATIONS                 
     Mere dilution; production or pricing practice to circumvent the    
                       provisions of this appendix                      
                                                                        
17. A good is not an originating good merely by reason of               
  (a) mere dilution with water or another substance that does not       
   materially alter the characteristics of the good; or                 
  (b) any production or pricing practice with respect to which it may be
   demonstrated, on the basis of a preponderance of evidence, that the  
   object was to circumvent this appendix.                              
                                                                        
                               SCHEDULE I                               
                                                                        
Schedule I shall be the text of Annex 401 to the Agreement as           
 implemented in General Note 12 of the HTSUS.                           
                                                                        
                               SCHEDULE II                              
                             VALUE OF GOODS                             
                                                                        
SECTION 1. Definitions.                                                 
    For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated:             
``buyer'' refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;    

[[Page 431]]

                                                                        
``buying commissions'' means fees paid by a buyer to that buyer's agent 
 for the agent's services in representing the buyer in the purchase of a
 good;                                                                  
``producer'' refers to the producer of the good being valued.           
SECTION 2.                                                              
    For purposes of Article 402(2) of the Agreement, as implemented by  
 section 6(2) of this appendix, the transaction value of a good shall be
 the price actually paid or payable for the good, determined in         
 accordance with section 3 and adjusted in accordance with section 4.   
SECTION 3.                                                              
(1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to  
 be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the producer. The payment
 need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money; it may be   
 made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. The payment may be
 made directly or indirectly to the producer. For an illustration of    
 this, the settlement by the buyer, whether in whole or in part, of a   
 debt owed by the producer is an indirect payment.                      
(2) Activities undertaken by the buyer on the buyer's own account, other
 than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 4, shall not 
 be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities    
 might be regarded as being for the benefit of the producer. For an     
 illustration of this, the buyer, by agreement with the producer,       
 undertakes activities relating to the marketing of the good. The costs 
 of such activities shall not be added to the price actually paid or    
 payable.                                                               
(3) The transaction value shall not include the following charges or    
 costs, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually    
 paid or payable:                                                       
  (a) charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or      
   technical assistance related to the good undertaken after the good   
   has been sold to the buyer; or                                       
  (b) duties and taxes paid in the country in which the buyer is located
   with respect to the good.                                            
(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the buyer to the       
 producer that do not relate to the purchase of the good are not part of
 the transaction value.                                                 
SECTION 4.                                                              
(1) In determining the transaction value of a good, the following shall 
 be added to the price actually paid or payable:                        
  (a) to the extent that they are incurred by the buyer, or by a related
   person on behalf of the buyer, with respect to the good being valued 
   and are not included in the price actually paid or payable           
    (i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions,      
    (ii) the costs of transporting the good to the producer's point of  
     direct shipment and the costs of loading, unloading, handling and  
     insurance that are associated with that transportation, and        
    (iii) where the packaging materials and containers in which the good
     is packaged for retail sale are classified with the good under the 
     Harmonized System, the value of the packaging materials and        
     containers;                                                        
  (b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection     
   (12), of the following elements where they are supplied directly or  
   indirectly to the producer by the buyer, free of charge or at reduced
   cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the good, 
   to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually   
   paid or payable:                                                     
    (i) a material, other than an indirect material, used in the        
     production of the good,                                            
    (ii) tools, dies, molds and similar indirect materials used in the  
     production of the good,                                            
    (iii) an indirect material, other than those referred to in         
     subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the          
     definition ``indirect material'' set out in Article 415 of the     
     Agreement, as implemented by section 2(1) of this appendix, used in
     the production of the good, and                                    

[[Page 432]]

                                                                        
    (iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and  
     sketches necessary for the production of the good, regardless of   
     where performed;                                                   
  (c) the royalties related to the good, other than charges with respect
   to the right to reproduce the good in the territory of one or more of
   the NAFTA countries, that the buyer must pay directly or indirectly  
   as a condition of sale of the good, to the extent that such royalties
   are not included in the price actually paid or payable; and          
  (d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale,   
   disposal or use of the good that accrues directly or indirectly to   
   the producer.                                                        
(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) shall be made to the    
 price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of 
 objective and quantifiable data.                                       
(3) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to   
 the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable
 under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under 
 section 2.                                                             
(4) No additions shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for
 the purpose of determining the transaction value except as provided in 
 this section.                                                          
(5) The amounts to be added under subsections (1)(a) (i) and (ii) shall 
 be                                                                     
  (a) those amounts that are recorded on the books of the buyer, or     
  (b) where those amounts are costs incurred by a related person on     
   behalf of the buyer and are not recorded on the books of the buyer,  
   those amounts that are recorded on the books of that related person. 
(6) The value of the packaging materials and containers referred to in  
 subsection (1)(a)(iii) and the value of the elements referred to in    
 subsection (1)(b)(i) shall be                                          
  (a) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are  
   imported from outside the territory of the NAFTA country in which the
   producer is located, the customs value of the packaging materials and
   containers or the elements,                                          
  (b) where the buyer, or a related person on behalf of the buyer,

   an unrelated person in the territory of the NAFTA country in which   
   the producer is located, the price actually paid or payable for the  
   packaging materials and containers or the elements,                  
  (c) where the buyer, or a related person on behalf of the buyer,      
   acquires the packaging materials and containers or the elements from 
   an unrelated person in the territory of the NAFTA country in which   
   the producer is located other than through a purchase, the value of  
   the consideration related to the acquisition of the packaging        
   materials and containers or the elements, based on the cost of the   
   consideration that is recorded on the books of the buyer or the      
   related person, or                                                   
  (d) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are  
   produced by the buyer, or by a related person, in the territory of   
   the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, the total cost of

     on the books of the buyer, that can be reasonably allocated to the 
     packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance   
     with Schedule VII, or                                              
    (ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by the buyer that forms    
     part of the total cost incurred with respect to the packaging      
     materials and containers or the elements, calculated on the basis  
     of the costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer, that can 
     be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers  
     or the elements in accordance with Schedule VII; and               
  (b) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are  
   produced by a person who is related to the buyer, at the choice of   
   the buyer,                                                           
    (i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by   
     that related person, calculated on the basis of the costs that are 
     recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably       
     allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements
     in accordance with Schedule VII, or                                
    (ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by that related person that
     forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the packaging
     materials and containers or the elements, calculated on the basis  
     of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that   
     can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and         
     containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule VII.        
(8) Except as provided in subsections (10) and (11), the value of the   
 elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) shall be   
  (a) the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of the   
   buyer, or                                                            
  (b) where such elements are provided by another person on behalf of   
   the buyer and the cost is not recorded on the books of the buyer, the
   cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of that other   
   person.                                                              
(9) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through    
 (iv) were previously used by or on behalf of the buyer, the value of   
 the elements shall be adjusted downward to reflect that use.           
(10) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) 
 were leased by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, the value of
 the elements shall be the cost of the lease as recorded on the books of
 the buyer or that related person.                                      
(11) No addition shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for
 the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that are available in
 the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.

(12) The producer shall choose the method of allocating to the good the 
 value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through    
 (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated to the good in a 
 manner appropriate to the circumstances. The methods the producer may  
 choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the     
 number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or       
 allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where      
 contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an        
 illustration of this, a buyer provides the producer with a mold to be  
 used in the production of the good and contracts with the producer to  
 buy 10,000 units of that good. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 
 units arrives, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. In these 
 circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the    
 mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate 
 the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The    
 producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a  
 single shipment of a good only where that single shipment comprises all
 of the units of the good acquired by the buyer under the contract or   
 commitment for that number of units of the good between the producer   
 and the buyer.                                                         
(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c)    
 shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of
 the buyer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the   
 books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded
 on the books of that other person.                                     
(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be
 the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the buyer
 or the producer.

                     UNACCEPTABLE TRANSACTION VALUE                     
                                                                        
SECTION 1. Definitions.                                                 
    For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated              
``buyer'' refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;    
``customs administration'' refers to the customs administration of the  
 NAFTA country into whose territory the good being valued is imported;  
``producer'' refers to the producer of the good being valued.           
SECTION 2.                                                              
(1) There is no transaction value for a good where the good is not the  
 subject of a sale.                                                     
(2) The transaction value of a good is unacceptable where               
  (a) there are restrictions on the disposition or use of the good by   
   the buyer, other than restrictions that                              
    (i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in  
     the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located,  
    (ii) limit the geographical area in which the good may be resold, or
    (iii) do not substantially affect the value of the good;            
  (b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a        
   condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined    
   with respect to the good;                                            
  (c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of 
   the good by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the      
   producer, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or  
   payable cannot be made in accordance with section 4(1)(d) of Schedule
   II; or                                                               
  (d) except as provided in section 3, the producer and the buyer are   
   related persons and the relationship between them influenced the     
   price actually paid or payable for the good.                         
(3) The conditions or considerations referred to in subsection (2)(b)   
 include the following circumstances:                                   
  (a) the producer establishes the price actually paid or payable for   
   the good on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in    
   specified quantities;                                                
  (b) the price actually paid or payable for the good is dependent on   
   the price or prices at which the buyer sells other goods to the      
   producer of the good; and                                            

[[Page 435]]

                                                                        
  (c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of 
   a form of payment extraneous to the good, such as where the good is a
   semi-finished good that has been provided by the producer to the     
   buyer on condition that the producer will receive a specified        
   quantity of the finished good from the buyer.                        
(4) For purposes of subsection (2)(b), conditions or considerations     
 relating to the production or marketing of the good shall not render   
 the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the buyer undertakes 
 on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the producer,
 activities relating to the marketing of the good.                      
(5) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to   
 the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable
 under section 4(1) of Schedule II, the transaction value cannot be     
 determined under the provisions of section 2 of that Schedule. For an  
 illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price      
 actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that
 was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the      
 royalty is based partially on the purchased good and partially on other
 factors that have nothing to do with that good, such as when the       
 purchased good is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer        
 separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished   
 from special financial arrangements between the producer and the buyer,
 it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value 
 of the good could not be determined. However, if the amount of the     
 royalty is based only on the purchased good and can be readily         
 quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be   
 made and the transaction value can be determined.                      
SECTION 3.                                                              
(1) In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under  
 section 2(2)(d), the fact that the producer and the buyer are related  
 persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration  
 to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the       
 circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the           
 transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship     
 between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually
 paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable       
 grounds for considering that the relationship between the producer and 
 the buyer influenced the price, the customs administration shall       
 communicate the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be    
 given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated  
 by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the       
 customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on     
 which it considers that the relationship between the producer and the  
 buyer influenced the price actually paid or payable.                   
(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the producer and the buyer are  
 related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be       
 examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value      
 provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did  
 not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended   
 under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the        
 circumstances in all cases where the producer and the buyer are related
 persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs   
 administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is   
 acceptable because of the relationship between the producer and the    
 buyer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the  
 price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that     
 price without requesting further information. For an illustration of   
 this, the customs administration may have previously examined the      
 relationship between the producer and the buyer, or it may already have
 detailed information concerning the relationship between the producer  
 and the buyer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or   
 information that the relationship between them did not influence the   
 price actually paid or payable.                                        

[[Page 436]]

                                                                        
(3) In applying subsection (1), where the producer and the buyer are    
 related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the     
 transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs   
 administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such   
 further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the    
 circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs        
 administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale,         
 including the way in which the producer and the buyer organize their   
 commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or   
 payable for the good being valued was arrived at, in order to determine
 whether the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced 
 that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the    
 producer and the buyer buy from and sell to each other as if they were 
 not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be       
 considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between   
 them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or       
 payable for the good had been settled in a manner consistent with the  
 normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way in
 which the producer settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the   
 price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been  
 influenced by the relationship between the buyer and the producer. As  
 another illustration, where it is shown that the price actually paid or
 payable for the good is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost  
 of producing the good plus a profit that is representative of the      
 producer's overall profit realized over a representative period of     
 time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of goods of the same class  
 or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not 
 having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the
 buyer.                                                                 
(4) In a sale between a producer and a buyer who are related persons,   
 the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance   
 with section 2 of Schedule II wherever the producer demonstrates that  
 the transaction value of the good in that sale closely approximates a  
 test value referred to in subsection (5).                              
(5) The value to be used as a test value shall be the transaction value 
 of identical goods or similar goods sold at or about the same time as  
 the good being valued is sold to an unrelated buyer who is located in  
 the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located.      
(6) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account 
 shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels,       
 quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 4(1)(b)
 of Schedule II and the costs incurred by the producer in sales to      
 unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the producer in sales to a   
 related person.                                                        
(7) The application of the test value referred to in subsection (4)     
 shall be used at the initiative of the producer and shall be used only 
 for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of  
 the good is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the        
 transaction value of that good.                                        
(8) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the producer to          
 demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test     
 value previously accepted by the customs administration, and is        
 therefore acceptable under subsections (1) and (4). Where the          
 application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the 
 transaction value of the good being valued is acceptable, the customs  
 administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to
 the relationship between the producer and the buyer under subsection   
 (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient           
 information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction 
 value closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (4), 
 the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that 
 the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.             

[[Page 437]]

                                                                        
(9) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose
 of determining whether the transaction value of the identical goods or 
 similar goods closely approximates the transaction value of the good   
 being valued. These factors include the nature of the good, the nature 
 of the industry itself, the season in which the good is sold, and      
 whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since    
 these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to    
 apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or  
 fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, 
 a small difference in value in a case involving one type of good could 
 be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another  
 type of good might be acceptable for the purposes of determining       
 whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out
 in subsection (4).

SECTION 4.                                                              
    Where GM does not satisfy the requirement set out in section 2(d),  
 the producer may choose that the regional value content be calculated  
 in accordance with section 2 only for those motor vehicles that are    
 acquired by GM for distribution under the GEO marque or another GM     
 marque.

(1) The producer may choose that the calculation referred to in section 
 2 be made over a period of two fiscal years where                      
  (a) any plant operated by the producer or by General Motors of Canada 
   Limited is closed for more than two consecutive months; and          
  (b) the motor vehicles of a category referred to in section 3, with   
   respect to which the producer chooses that the regional value content
   be calculated in accordance with section 2, are produced in that     
   plant.                                                               
(2) Subject to subsection (3), the period of two fiscal years referred  
 to in subsection (1) corresponds to the fiscal year in which the plant 
 is closed and, at the choice of the producer, the preceding or the     
 subsequent fiscal year.                                                
(3) Where the plant is closed for a period that spans two fiscal years, 
 the calculation referred to in section 2 may be made only over those   
 two fiscal years.                                                      
(4) Where the producer has chosen that the regional value content be    
 calculated over two fiscal years under this section, the choice        
 referred to in section 11(6) of this appendix shall be filed not later 
 than 10 days after the end of the period during which the plant is     
 closed, or at such later time as the customs administration may accept.
SECTION 6.                                                              
    For purposes of this Schedule, a motor vehicle producer shall be    
 deemed to be GM where, as a result of an amalgamation, reorganization, 
 division or similar transaction, that motor vehicle producer           
  (a) acquires all or substantially all of the assets used by GM, and   
  (b) directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, GM, or both 
   that motor vehicle producer and GM are controlled by the same person.

(1) Where a producer of a good is using, for an internal management     
 purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good direct       
 material costs, or part thereof, and that method reasonably reflects   
 the direct material used in the production of the good based on the    
 criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method shall be   
 used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.                     
(2) Where a producer of a good is using, for an internal management     
 purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good direct labor 
 costs, or part thereof, and that method reasonably reflects the direct 
 labor used in the production of the good based on the criterion of     
 benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method shall be used to        
 reasonably allocate the costs to the good.                             
(3) Where a producer of a good is using, for an internal management     
 purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good overhead, or 
 part thereof, and that method is based on the criterion of benefit,    
 cause or ability to bear, that method shall be used to reasonably      
 allocate the costs to the good.                                        
SECTION 4.                                                              
    Where costs are not reasonably allocated to a good under section 3, 
 those costs are reasonably allocated to the good if they are allocated,
  (a) with respect to direct material costs, on the basis of any method 
   that reasonably reflects the direct material used in the production  
   of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to   
   bear;                                                                
  (b) with respect to direct labor costs, on the basis of any method

    Any cost allocation method referred to in section 3 or 4 that is    
 used by a producer for the purposes of this appendix shall be used     
 throughout the producer's fiscal year.                                 
                                                                        
                     Costs Not Reasonably Allocated

    The allocation to a good of any of the following is considered not  
 to be reasonably allocated to the good:                                
  (a) costs of a service provided by a producer of a good to another    
   person where the service is not related to the good;                 
  (b) gains or losses resulting from the disposition of a discontinued  
   operation;                                                           
  (c) cumulative effects of accounting changes reported in accordance   
   with a specific requirement of the applicable Generally Accepted     
   Accounting Principles; and''.                                        
  (d) gains or losses resulting from the sale of a capital asset of the 
   producer.                                                            
SECTION 7.                                                              
    Any costs allocated under section 3 on the basis of a cost          
 allocation method that is used for an internal management purpose that 
 is solely for the purpose of qualifying a good as an originating good  
 are considered not to be reasonably allocated.                         
                                                                        
                               ADDENDUM A                               
                            COST RATIO METHOD                           
                                                                        
Calculation of Cost Ratio                                               
                                                                        
    For the overhead to be allocated, the producer may choose one or    
 more allocation bases that reflect a relationship between the overhead 
 and the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to    
 bear.                                                                  
    With respect to each allocation base that is chosen by the producer 
 for allocating overhead, a cost ratio is calculated for each good      
 produced by the producer in accordance with the following formula:

  CR is the cost ratio with respect to the good;
  AB is the allocation base for the good; and
  TAB is the total allocation base for all the goods produced by the 
        producer.


Allocation to a Good of Costs Included in Overhead                      
                                                                        
    The costs with respect to which an allocation base is chosen are    
 allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:

where                                                                   
  CAG is the costs allocated to the good;                               
  CA is the costs to be allocated; and                                  
  CR is the cost ratio with respect to the good.                        
                                                                        
Excluded Costs                                                          
                                                                        
    Under section 6(11)(b) of this appendix, where excluded costs are   
 included in costs to be allocated to a good, the cost ratio used to    
 allocate that cost to the good is used to determine the amount of      
 excluded costs to be subtracted from the costs allocated to the good.

    The following examples illustrate the application of the cost ratio 
 method to costs included in overhead.                                  
                                                                        


Example 1: Direct Labor Hours                                           
    A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on  
 the basis of direct labor hours spent to produce Good A and Good B. A  
 total of 8,000 direct labor hours have been spent to produce Good A and
 Good B: 5,000 hours with respect to Good A and 3,000 hours with respect
 to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.       
  Calculation of the Ratios:                                            
  Good A: 5,000 hours/8,000 hours = .625

    The following example illustrates the application of the direct cost
 ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate indirect overhead
 where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in    
 accordance with section 6(11)(a) of this appendix.                     
    A producer produces Good A and Good B. Indirect overhead (IO) minus 
 excluded costs (EC) is $30. The other relevant costs are set out in the
 following table:

    The following example illustrates the application of the direct cost
 ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate indirect overhead
 where the producer has chosen to calculate the net cost of the good in 
 accordance with section 6(11)(b) of this appendix and where excluded   
 costs are included in indirect overhead.                               
    A producer produces Good A and Good B. The indirect overhead (IO) is
 $50 (including excluded costs (EC) of $20). The other relevant costs

                              SCHEDULE VIII                             
                           VALUE OF MATERIALS                           
                                                                        
SECTION 1. Definitions.                                                 
(1) For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated,             
``buying commissions'' means fees paid by a producer to that producer's 
 agent for the agent's services in representing the producer in the     
 purchase of a material;                                                
``customs administration'' refers to the customs administration of the  
 NAFTA country into whose territory the good, in the production of which
 the material being valued is used, is imported;

``materials of the same class or kind'' means, with respect to materials
 being valued, materials that are within a group or range of materials  
 that                                                                   
  (a) is produced by a particular industry or industry sector, and      
  (b) includes identical materials or similar materials;                
``producer'' refers to                                                  
  (a) in the case of section 10(1)(b)(i) of these Regulations, the      
   producer of the listed material, and                                 
  (b) in any other case, the producer who used the material in the      
   production of a good that is subject to a regional value-content     
   requirement;                                                         
``seller'' refers to a person who sells the material being valued to the
 producer.                                                              
                                                                        
                             Interpretation                             
                                                                        
(2) Where it is to be determined under section 9(3) of these Regulations
 whether the customs value of a material was determined in a manner     
 consistent with this Schedule for purposes of section 9(2) (c) or (d)  
 of these Regulations, a reference in this Schedule to ``producer''     
 shall be read as a reference to ``person other than the producer who   
 imports the traced material from outside the territories of the NAFTA  
 countries.                                                             
SECTION 2.                                                              
(1) Except as provided under subsections (2) and (3), the transaction   
 value of a material under Article 402(9)(a) of the Agreement, as       
 implemented by section 7(1)(b) and sections 9(5) and 10(2) of this     
 appendix, shall be the price actually paid or payable for the material 
 determined in accordance with section 4 and adjusted in accordance with
 section 5.                                                             
(2) There is no transaction value for a material where the material is  
 not the subject of a sale.                                             
(3) The transaction value of a material is unacceptable where           
  (a) there are restrictions on the disposition or use of the material  
   by the producer, other than restrictions that                        
    (i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in  
     the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer of the    
     good or the seller of the material is located,                     
    (ii) limit the geographical area in which the material may be used, 
     or                                                                 
    (iii) do not substantially affect the value of the material;        
  (b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a        
   condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined    
   with respect to the material;                                        
  (c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the     
   material by the producer will accrue directly or indirectly to the   
   seller, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or    
   payable cannot be made in accordance with section 5(1)(d); and       
  (d) except as provided in section 3, the producer and the seller are  
   related persons and the relationship between them influenced the     
   price actually paid or payable for the material.                     
(4) The conditions or considerations referred to in subsection (3)(b)   
 include the following circumstances:                                   
  (a) the seller establishes the price actually paid or payable for the 
   material on condition that the producer will also buy other materials
   or goods in specified quantities;                                    
  (b) the price actually paid or payable for the material is dependent  
   on the price or prices at which the producer sells other materials or
   goods to the seller of the material; and                             
  (c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of 
   a form of payment extraneous to the material, such as where the      
   material is a semi-finished material that has been provided by the   
   seller to the producer on condition that the seller will receive a   
   specified quantity of the finished material from the producer.       

[[Page 448]]

                                                                        
(5) For purposes of subsection (3)(b), conditions or considerations     
 relating to the use of the material shall not render the transaction   
 value unacceptable, such as where the producer undertakes on the       
 producer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller,      
 activities relating to the warranty of the material used in the        
 production of a good.                                                  
(6) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to   
 the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable
 under section 5(1), the transaction value cannot be determined under   
 the provisions of section 2(1). For an illustration of this, a royalty 
 is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of
 a liter of a particular good that is produced by using a material that 
 was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the      
 royalty is based partially on the purchased material and partially on  
 other factors that have nothing to do with that material, such as when 
 the purchased material is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer
 separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished   
 from special financial arrangements between the seller and the         
 producer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the         
 transaction value of the material could not be determined. However, if 
 the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased material and  
 can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or   
 payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.       
SECTION 3.                                                              
(1) In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under  
 section 2(3)(d), the fact that the seller and the producer are related 
 persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration  
 to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the       
 circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the           
 transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship     
 between the seller and the producer did not influence the price        
 actually paid or payable. Where the customs administration has         
 reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the   
 seller and the producer influenced the price, the customs              
 administration shall communicate the grounds to the producer, and that 
 producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the     
 grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so
 requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the  
 grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the seller 
 and the producer influenced the price actually paid or payable.        
(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the seller and the producer are 
 related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be       
 examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value      
 provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did 
 not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended   
 under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the        
 circumstances in all cases where the seller and the producer are       
 related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the   
 customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or      
 payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the seller   
 and the producer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts
 that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept 
 that price without requesting further information. For an illustration 
 of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the   
 relationship between the seller and the producer, or it may already    
 have detailed information concerning the relationship between the      
 seller and the producer, and may already be satisfied from that        
 examination or information that the relationship between them did not  
 influence the price actually paid or payable.                          

[[Page 449]]

                                                                        
(3) In applying subsection (1), where the seller and the producer are   
 related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the     
 transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs   
 administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such   
 further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the    
 circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs        
 administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale,         
 including the way in which the seller and the producer organize their  
 commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or   
 payable by that producer for the material being valued was arrived at, 
 in order to determine whether the relationship between the seller and  
 the producer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it  
 can be shown that the seller and the producer buy from and sell to each
 other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or  
 payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the       
 relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price   
 actually paid or payable for the material had been settled in a manner 
 consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in        
 question or with the way in which the seller settles prices for sales  
 to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be       
 considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between   
 the producer and the seller. For another illustration of this, where it
 is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the material is   
 adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the material
 plus a profit that is representative of the seller's overall profit    
 realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual    
 basis, in sales of materials of the same class or kind, the price      
 actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been        
 influenced by the relationship between the seller and the producer.    
(4) In a sale between a seller and a producer who are related persons,  
 the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance   
 with section 2(1), wherever the seller or the producer demonstrates    
 that the transaction value of the material in that sale closely        
 approximates one of the following test values that occurs at or about  
 the same time as the sale and is chosen by the seller or the producer: 
  (a) the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical   
   materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with     
   section 2(1);                                                        
  (b) the value of identical materials or similar materials, as         
   determined in accordance with section 9; or                          
  (c) the value of identical materials or similar materials, as         
   determined in accordance with section 10.                            
(5) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account 
 shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels,       
 quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 5(1)(b)
 and the costs incurred by the seller in sales to unrelated buyers that 
 are not incurred by the seller in sales by the seller to a related     
 person.                                                                
(6) The application of a test value referred to in subsection (4) shall 
 be used at the initiative of the seller, or at the initiative of the   
 producer with the consent of the seller, and shall be used only for    
 comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the  
 material is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the        
 transaction value of that material.                                    

[[Page 450]]

                                                                        
(7) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the seller or the        
 producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates
 a test value previously accepted by the customs administration of the  
 NAFTA country in which the producer is located, and is therefore       
 acceptable under subsection (1). Where the application of a test value 
 under subsection (4) demonstrates that the transaction value of the    
 material being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall  
 not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship    
 between the seller and the producer under subsection (1). Where the    
 customs administration already has sufficient information available,   
 without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely          
 approximates one of the test values determined under subsection (4),   
 the seller or the producer is not required to apply a test value to    
 demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that        
 subsection.                                                            
(8) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose
 of determining whether the transaction value of the identical materials
 or similar materials closely approximates the transaction value of the 
 material being valued. These factors include the nature of the         
 material, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the   
 material is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially 
 significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would  
 be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a 
 fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an       
 illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving  
 one type of material could be unacceptable, while a large difference in
 a case involving another type of material might be acceptable for the  
 purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely          
 approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).                   
SECTION 4.                                                              
(1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to  
 be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the     
 material. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer 
 of money: it may be made by letters of credit or negotiable            
 instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly to the seller. 
 For an illustration of this, the settlement by the producer, whether in
 whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, is an indirect payment.
(2) Activities undertaken by the producer on the producer's own account,
 other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 5,     
 shall not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the     
 activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the seller.   
(3) The transaction value shall not include charges for construction,   
 erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the 
 use of the material by the producer, provided that they are            
 distinguished from the price actually paid or payable.                 
(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the producer to the    
 seller that do not relate to the purchase of the material are not part 
 of the transaction value.                                              
SECTION 5.                                                              
(1) In determining the transaction value of the material, the following 
 shall be added to the price actually paid or payable:                  
  (a) to the extent that they are incurred by the producer with respect 
   to the material being valued and are not included in the price       
   actually paid or payable,                                            
    (i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions, and  
    (ii) the costs of containers which, for customs purposes, are       
     classified with the material under the Harmonized System;          
  (b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection     
   (12), of the following elements where they are supplied directly or  
   indirectly to the seller by the producer free of charge or at reduced
   cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the       
   material, to the extent that the value is not included in the price  
   actually paid or payable:

    (i) a material, other than an indirect material, used in the        
     production of the material being valued,                           
    (ii) tools, dies, molds and similar indirect materials used in the  
     production of the material being valued,                           
    (iii) an indirect material, other than those referred to in         
     subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the          
     definition ``indirect material'' set out in Article 415 of the     
     Agreement, as implemented by section 2(1) of this appendix, used in
     the production of the material being valued, and                   
    (iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and  
     sketches performed outside the territory of the NAFTA country in   
     which the producer is located that are necessary for the production
     of the material being valued;                                      
  (c) the royalties related to the material, other than charges with    
   respect to the right to reproduce the material in the territory of   
   the NAFTA country in which the producer is located that the producer 
   must pay directly or indirectly as a condition of sale of the        
   material, to the extent that such royalties are not included in the  
   price actually paid or payable; and                                  
  (d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal  
   or use of the material that accrues directly or indirectly to the    
   seller.                                                              
(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) shall be made to the    
 price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of 
 objective and quantifiable data.                                       
(3) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to   
 the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable
 under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under 
 section 2(1).                                                          
(4) No additions shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for
 the purpose of determining the transaction value except as provided in 
 this section.                                                          
(5) The amounts to be added under subsection (1)(a) shall be those      
 amounts that are recorded on the books of the producer.                
(6) The value of the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) shall 
 be                                                                     
  (a) where the elements are imported from outside the territory of the 
   NAFTA country in which the seller is located, the customs value of   
   the elements,                                                        
  (b) where the producer, or a related person on behalf of the producer,
   purchases the elements from an unrelated person in the territory of  
   the NAFTA country in which the seller is located, the price actually 
   paid or payable for the elements,                                    
  (c) where the producer, or a related person on behalf of the producer,
   acquires the elements from an unrelated person in the territory of   
   the NAFTA country in which the seller is located other than through a
   purchase, the value of the consideration related to the acquisition  
   of the elements, based on the cost of the consideration that is      
   recorded on the books of the producer or the related person, or      
  (d) where the elements are produced by the producer, or by a related  
   person, in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the seller is 
   located, the total cost of the elements, determined in accordance    
   with subsection (7),                                                 
and shall include the following costs, that are recorded on the books of
 the producer or the related person supplying the elements on behalf of 
 the producer, to the extent that such costs are not included under     
 paragraph (a) through (d):                                             
  (e) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs     
   incurred in transporting the elements to the location of the seller,

   other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or 
   otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or  
   payable,                                                             
  (g) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs    
   brokerage services, incurred with respect to the elements, and       
  (h) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the      
   elements in the production of the material, minus the value of       
   reusable scrap or by-product.

(7) For the purposes of subsection (6)(d), the total cost of the        
 elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) shall be                  
  (a) where the elements are produced by the producer, at the choice of 
   the producer,                                                        
    (i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by   
     the producer, calculated on the basis of the costs that are        
     recorded on the books of the producer, that can be reasonably      
     allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule VII, or      
    (ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by the producer that forms 
     part of the total cost incurred with respect to the elements,      
     calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books
     of the producer, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements  
     in accordance with Schedule VII; and                               
  (b) where the elements are produced by a person who is related to the 
   producer, at the choice of the producer,                             
    (i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by   
     that related person, calculated on the basis of the costs that are 
     recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably       
     allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule VII, or      
    (ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by that related person that
     forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the elements,
     calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books
     of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in
     accordance with Schedule VII.                                      
(8) Except as provided in subsections (10) and (11), the value of the   
 elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) shall be   
  (a) the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of the   
   producer; or                                                         
  (b) where such elements are provided by another person on behalf of   
   the producer and the cost is not recorded on the books of the        
   producer, the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of
   that other person.                                                   
(9) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through    
 (iv) were previously used by or on behalf of the producer, the value of
 the elements shall be adjusted downward to reflect that use.           
(10) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) 
 were leased by the producer or a person related to the producer, the   
 value of the elements shall be the cost of the lease that is recorded  
 on the books of the producer or that related person.                   
(11) No addition shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for
 the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that are available in
 the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.    
(12) The producer shall choose the method of allocating to the material 
 the value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through
 (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated to the material  
 in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The methods the producer 
 may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the 
 number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or       
 allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where      
 contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an        
 illustration of this, a producer provides the seller with a mold to be 
 used in the production of the material and contracts with the seller to
 buy 10,000 units of that material. By the time the first shipment of   
 1,000 units arrives, the seller has already produced 4,000 units. In   
 these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of  
 the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to      
 allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000      
 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the     
 elements to a single shipment of material only where that single       
 shipment comprises all of the units of the material acquired by the    
 producer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of  
 the material between the seller and the producer.

(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c)    
 shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of
 the producer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the
 books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded
 on the books of that other person.                                     
(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be
 the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the      
 producer or the seller.                                                
SECTION 6.                                                              
(1) If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the          
 transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), the value of the 
 material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as        
 implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall  
 be the transaction value of identical materials sold, at or about the  
 same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to 
 a buyer located in the same country as the producer.                   
(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of identical        
 materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially  
 the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be   
 used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is     
 found, the transaction value of identical materials sold at a different
 commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into     
 account the differences attributable to the commercial level or        
 quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on 
 the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is  
 reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or
 a decrease in the value.                                               
(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different
 commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be   
 made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an    
 adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a  
 bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the  
 material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only  
 identical materials for which a transaction value exists involved a    
 sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity
 discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to 
 the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a  
 sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been    
 made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established
 as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of
 such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under 
 this section is not appropriate.                                       
(4) If more than one transaction value of identical materials is found, 
 the lowest such value shall be used to determine the value of the      
 material under this section.                                           
SECTION 7.                                                              
(1) If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the          
 transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of 
 the material cannot be determined under section 6, the value of the    
 material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as        
 implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall  
 be the transaction value of similar materials sold, at or about the    
 same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to 
 a buyer located in the same country as the producer.                   
(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of similar materials
 in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same   
 quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to    
 determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the  
 transaction value of similar materials sold at a different commercial  
 level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the    
 differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be 
 used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of       
 evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and
 accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in 
 the value.

(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different
 commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be   
 made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an    
 adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a  
 bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the  
 material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only  
 similar materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale 
 of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity     
 discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to 
 the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a  
 sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been    
 made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established
 as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of
 such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under 
 this section is not appropriate.                                       
(4) If more than one transaction value of similar materials is found,   
 the lowest such value shall be used to determine the value of the      
 material under this section.                                           
SECTION 8.                                                              
    If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the          
 transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of 
 the material cannot be determined under section 6 or 7, the value of   
 the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as    
 implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall  
 be determined under section 9 or, when the value cannot be determined  
 under that section, under section 10 except that, at the request of the
 producer, the order of application of sections 9 and 10 shall be       
 reversed.                                                              
SECTION 9.                                                              
(1) Under this section, if identical materials or similar materials are 
 sold in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is    
 located, in the same condition as the material was in when received by 
 the producer, the value of the material, referred to in Article        
 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of   
 part IV of this appendix, shall be based on the unit price at which    
 those identical materials or similar materials are sold, in the        
 greatest aggregate quantity by the producer or, where the producer does
 not sell those identical materials or similar materials, by a person at
 the same trade level as the producer, at or about the same time as the 
 material being valued is received by the producer, to persons located  
 in that territory who are not related to the seller, subject to        
 deductions for the following:                                          
  (a) either the amount of commissions usually earned or the amount     
   generally reflected for profit and general expenses, in connection   
   with sales, in the territory of that NAFTA country, of materials of  
   the same class or kind as the material being valued; and             
  (b) taxes, if included in the unit price, payable in the territory of 
   that NAFTA country, which are either waived, refunded or recoverable 
   by way of credit against taxes actually paid or payable.             
(2) If neither identical materials nor similar materials are sold at or 
 about the same time the material being valued is received by the       
 producer, the value shall, subject to the deductions provided for under
 subsection (1), be based on the unit price at which identical materials
 or similar materials are sold in the territory of the NAFTA country in 
 which the producer is located, in the same condition as the material   
 was in when received by the producer, at the earliest date within 90   
 days after the date the material being valued was received by the      
 producer.                                                              
(3) The expression ``unit price at which those identical materials or   
 similar materials are sold, in the greatest aggregate quantity'' in    
 subsection (1) means the price at which the greatest number of units is
 sold in sales between unrelated persons. For an illustration of this,  
 materials are sold from a price list which grants favorable unit prices
 for purchases made in larger quantities.

    The greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 80;      
 therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90.    
    As another illustration of this, two sales occur. In the first sale 
 500 units are sold at a price of 95 currency units each. In the second 
 sale 400 units are sold at a price of 90 currency units each. In this  
 illustration, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price  
 is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is
 95.                                                                    
(4) Any sale to a person who supplies, directly or indirectly, free of  
 charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production of 
 the material, any of the elements specified in section 5(1)(b), shall  
 not be taken into account in establishing the unit price for the       
 purposes of this section.                                              
(5) The amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses      
 referred to in subsection (1)(a) shall be taken as a whole. The figure 
 for the purposes of deducting an amount for profit and general expenses
 shall be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on      
 behalf of the producer unless the figures provided by the producer are 
 inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales, in the country in  
 which the producer is located, of materials of the same class or kind  
 as the material being valued. Where the figures provided by the        
 producer are inconsistent with those figures, the amount for profit and
 general expenses shall be based on relevant information other than that
 supplied by or on behalf of the producer.                              
(6) For the purposes of this section, general expenses are the direct   
 and indirect costs of marketing the material in question.              
(7) In determining either the commissions usually earned or the amount  
 generally reflected for profit and general expenses under this section,
 the question as to whether certain materials are materials of the same 
 class or kind as the material being valued shall be determined on a    
 case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. Sales 
 in the country in which the producer is located of the narrowest group 
 or range of materials of the same class or kind as the material being  
 valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be  
 examined. For the purposes of this section, ``materials of the same    
 class or kind'' includes materials imported from the same country as   
 the material being valued as well as materials imported from other     
 countries or acquired within the territory of the NAFTA country in     
 which the producer is located.                                         
(8) For the purposes of subsection (2), the earliest date shall be the  
 date by which sales of identical materials or similar materials are    
 made, in sufficient quantity to establish the unit price, to other     
 persons in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is 
 located.                                                               
SECTION 10.                                                             
(1) Under this section, the value of a material, referred to in Article 
 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of   
 part IV of this appendix, shall be the sum of                          
  (a) the cost or value of the materials used in the production of the  
   material being valued, as determined on the basis of the costs that  
   are recorded on the books of the producer of the material,           
  (b) the cost of producing the material being valued, as determined on 
   the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer
   of the material, and                                                 
  (c) an amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually   
   reflected in sales

    (i) where the material being valued is imported by the producer into
     the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is        
     located, to persons located in the territory of the NAFTA country  
     in which the producer is located by producers of materials of the  
     same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in 
     the country in which the material is produced, and                 
    (ii) where the material being valued is acquired by the producer    
     from another person located in the territory of the NAFTA country  
     in which the producer is located, to persons located in the        
     territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located by 
     producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material   
     being valued who are located in the country in which the producer  
     is located,                                                        
  (d) the value of elements referred to in section 5(1)(b)(i),          
   determined in accordance with section 5(6), and                      
  (e) the value of elements referred to in sections 5(1)(b)(ii) through 
   (iv), determined in accordance with section 5(8) and reasonably      
   allocated to the material in accordance with section 5(12).          
(2) For purposes of subsections (1)(a) and (b), where the costs recorded
 on the books of the producer of the material relate to the production  
 of other goods and materials as well as to the production of the       
 material being valued, the costs referred to in subsections (1)(a) and 
 (b) with respect to the material being valued shall be those costs     
 recorded on the books of the producer of the material that can be      
 reasonably allocated to that material in accordance with Schedule VII. 
(3) The amount for profit and general expenses referred to in subsection
 (1)(c) shall be determined on the basis of information supplied by or  
 on behalf of the producer of the material being valued unless the      
 profit and general expenses figures that are supplied with that        
 information are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales by  
 producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being 
 valued who are located in the country in which the material is produced
 or the producer is located, as the case may be. The information        
 supplied shall be prepared in a manner consistent with generally       
 accepted accounting principles of the country in which the material    
 being valued is produced. Where the material is produced in the        
 territory of a NAFTA country, the information shall be prepared in     
 accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set out in
 the authorities listed for that NAFTA country in Schedule XII.         
(4) For purposes of subsection (1)(c) and subsection (3), general       
 expenses means the direct and indirect costs of producing and selling  
 the material that are not included under subsections (1)(a) and (b).   
(5) For purposes of subsection (3), the amount for profit and general   
 expenses shall be taken as a whole. Where, in the information supplied 
 by or on behalf of the producer of a material, the profit figure is low
 and the general expenses figure is high, the profit and general expense
 figures taken together may nevertheless be consistent with those       
 usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as   
 the material being valued. Where the producer of a material can        
 demonstrate that it is taking a nil or low profit on its sales of the  
 material because of particular commercial circumstances, its actual    
 profit and general expense figures shall be taken into account,        
 provided that the producer of the material has valid commercial reasons
 to justify them and its pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies 
 in the branch of industry concerned. For an illustration of this, such 
 a situation might occur where producers have been forced to lower      
 prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or where
 the producers sell the material to complement a range of materials and 
 goods being produced in the country in which the material is sold and  
 accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. A further illustration
 is where a material was being launched and the producer accepted a nil 
 or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the      
 launch.

(6) Where the figures for the profit and general expenses supplied by or
 on behalf of the producer of the material are not consistent with those
 usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as   
 the material being valued that are made by other producers in the      
 country in which that material is sold, the amount for profit and      
 general expenses may be based on relevant information other than that  
 supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material.              
(7) Where a customs administration uses information other than that     
 supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material for the       
 purposes of determining the value of a material under this section, the
 customs administration shall communicate to the producer, if that      
 producer so requests, the source of such information, the data used and
 the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions on    
 confidentiality under Article 507 of the Agreement, as implemented in  
 each NAFTA country.                                                    
(8) Whether certain materials are of the same class or kind as the      
 material being valued shall be determined on a case-by-case basis with 
 reference to the circumstances involved. For purposes of determining   
 the amount for profit and general expenses usually reflected under the 
 provisions of this section, sales of the narrowest group or range of   
 materials of the same class or kind, which includes the material being 
 valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be  
 examined. For the purposes of this section, the materials of the same  
 class or kind must be from the same country as the material being      
 valued.                                                                
SECTION 11.                                                             
(1) Where there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the       
 transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of 
 the materials cannot be determined under sections 6 through 10, the    
 value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the         
 Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this    
 appendix, shall be determined under this section using reasonable means
 consistent with the principles and general provisions of this Schedule 
 and on the basis of data available in the country in which the producer
 is located.                                                            
(2) The value of the material determined under this section shall not be
 determined on the basis of                                             
  (a) a valuation system which provides for the acceptance of the higher
   of two alternative values;                                           
  (b) a cost of production other than the value determined in accordance
   with section 10;                                                     
  (c) minimum values;                                                   
  (d) arbitrary or fictitious values;                                   
  (e) where the material is produced in the territory of the NAFTA      
   country in which the producer is located, the price of the material  
   for export from that territory; or                                   
  (f) where the material is imported, the price of the material for     
   export to a country other than to the territory of the NAFTA country 
   in which the producer is located.

(3) To the greatest extent possible, the value of the material          
 determined under this section shall be based on the methods of         
 valuation set out in sections 2 through 10, but a reasonable           
 flexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity  
 with the aims and provisions of this section. For an illustration of   
 this, under section 6, the requirement that the identical materials    
 should be sold at or about the same time as the time the material being
 valued is shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted.       
 Similarly, identical materials produced in a country other than the    
 country in which the material is produced could be the basis for       
 determining the value of the material, or the value of identical       
 materials already determined under section 9 could be used. For another
 illustration, under section 7, the requirement that the similar        
 materials should be sold at or about the same time as the material     
 being valued are shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted.
 Likewise, similar materials produced in a country other than the       
 country in which the material is produced could be the basis for       
 determining the value of the material, or the value of similar         
 materials already determined under the provisions of section 9 could be
 used. For a further illustration, under section 9, the ninety days     
 requirement could be administered flexibly.                            
                                                                        
                               SCHEDULE IX                              
 METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS THAT ARE
    IDENTICAL MATERIALS AND THAT ARE USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF A GOOD   
                     Definitions and Interpretation                     
                                                                        
SECTION 1. Definitions.                                                 
    For purposes of this Schedule,                                      
``FIFO method'' means the method by which the value of non-originating  
 materials first received in materials inventory, determined in         
 accordance with section 7 of this appendix, is considered to be the    
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good  
 first shipped to the buyer of the good;                                
``identical materials'' means, with respect to a material, materials    
 that are the same as that material in all respects, including physical 
 characteristics, quality and reputation but excluding minor differences
 in appearance;                                                         
``LIFO method'' means the method by which the value of non-originating  
 materials last received in materials inventory, determined in          
 accordance with section 7 of this appendix, is considered to be the    
 value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good  
 first shipped to the buyer of the good;                                
``materials inventory'' means, with respect to a single plant of the    
 producer of a good, an inventory of non-originating materials that are 
 identical materials and that are used in the production of the good;   
 and                                                                    
``rolling average method'' means the method by which the value of non-  
 originating materials used in the production of a good that is shipped 
 to the buyer of the good is based on the average value, calculated in  
 accordance with section 4, of the non-originating materials in         
 materials inventory.                                                   
                                                                        
                                 General                                
                                                                        
SECTION 2.                                                              
    For purposes of sections 5(11) and (12) and 6(10) of this appendix, 
 the following are the methods for determining the value of non-        
 originating materials that are identical materials and are used in the 
 production of a good:                                                  
  (a) FIFO method;                                                      
  (b) LIFO method; and                                                  
  (c) rolling average method.                                           
SECTION 3.                                                              
(1) Where a producer of a good chooses, with respect to non-originating 
 materials that are identical materials, any of the methods referred to 
 in section 2, the producer may not use another of those methods with   
 respect to any other non-originating materials that are identical      
 materials and that are used in the production of that good or in the   
 production of any other good.

(2) Where a producer of a good produces the good in more than one plant,
 the method chosen by the producer shall be used with respect to all    
 plants of the producer in which the good is produced.                  
(3) The method chosen by the producer to determine the value of non-    
 originating materials may be chosen at any time during the producer's  
 fiscal year and may not be changed during that fiscal year.            
                                                                        
                Average Value for Rolling Average Method                
                                                                        
SECTION 4.                                                              
(1) The average value of non-originating materials that are identical   
 materials and that are used in the production of a good that is shipped
 to the buyer of the good is calculated by dividing                     
  (a) the total value of non-originating materials that are identical   
   materials in materials inventory prior to the shipment of the good,  
   determined in accordance with section 7 of this appendix,            
by                                                                      
  (b) the total units of those non-originating materials in materials   
   inventory prior to the shipment of the good.                         
(2) The average value calculated under subsection (1) is applied to the 
 remaining units of non-originating materials in materials inventory.

``EXAMPLES'' ILLUSTRATING THE APPLICATION OF THE METHODS FOR DETERMINING
 THE VALUE OF NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS THAT ARE IDENTICAL MATERIALS AND
                THAT ARE USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF A GOOD               
                                                                        
    The following ``examples'' are based on the figures set out in the  
 table below and on the following assumptions:                          
  (a) Materials A are non-originating materials that are identical      
   materials that are used in the production of Good A;                 
  (b) one unit of Materials A is used to produce one unit of Good A;    
  (c) all other materials used in the production of Good A are          
   originating materials; and                                           
  (d) Good A is produced in a single plant.

Example 1: FIFO method                                                  
    By applying the FIFO method:                                        
(1) the 200 units of Materials A received on 01/01/94 and valued at     
 $1.05 per unit and 300 units of the 1,000 units of Material A received 
 on 01/03/94 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been   
 used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/08/94; 
 therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the      
 production of those goods is considered to be $510 [(200 unit  x       
 $1.05) + ($300 units  x  $1.00)];

(2) 500 units of the remaining 700 units of Materials A received on 01/ 
 03/94 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been used in 
 the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/09/94;         
 therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the      
 production of those goods is considered to be $500 (500 units  x       
 $1.00);

 03/94 and valued at $1.00 per unit, the 1,000 units of Materials A     
 received on 01/05/94 and valued at $1.10 per unit, and 300 units of the
 1,000 Materials A received on 01/10/94 and valued at $1.05 per unit are
 considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of   
 Good A shipped on 01/14/94; therefore, the value of non-originating    
 materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be    
 $1,615 [(200 units  x  $1.00) + (1,000 units  x  $1.10) + (300 units  x
  $1.05)]; and

 units of Materials A received on 01/16/94 and valued at $1.10 per unit 
 are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units  
 of Good A shipped on 01/18/94; therefore, the value of non-originating 
 materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be    
 $1,615 [(700  x  $1.05) + (800  x  $1.10)].                            
Example 2: LIFO method                                                  
    By applying the LIFO method:                                        
(1) 500 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/05/94 and
 valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the       
 production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/08/94; therefore,  
 the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of   
 those goods is considered to be $550 (500 units  x  $1.10);            
(2) the remaining 500 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received  
 on 01/05/94 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been

 $1.05 per unit and 500 units of the 1,000 units of Material A received 
 on 01/03/94 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been   
 used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/14/  
 94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the      
 production of those goods is considered to be $1,550 [(1,000 units  x  
 $1.05) + (500 units  x  $1.00)]; and                                   
(4) 1,500 units of the 2,000 units of Materials A received on 01/16/94  
 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the   
 production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/18/94; therefore,
 the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those 
 goods is considered to be $1,650 (1,500 units  x  $1.10).              
Example 3: Rolling average method                                       
    The following table identifies the average value of non-originating 
 Materials A as determined under the rolling average method. For        
 purposes of this example, a new average value of non-originating       
 Materials A is calculated after each receipt.

SECTION 1. Definitions.                                                 
    For purposes of this part,                                          
``average method'' means the method by which the origin of fungible     
 materials withdrawn from materials inventory is based on the ratio,    
 calculated under section 5, of originating materials and non-          
 originating materials in materials inventory;                          
``FIFO method'' means the method by which the origin of fungible        
 materials first received in materials inventory is considered to be the
 origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory; 
``LIFO method'' means the method by which the origin of fungible        
 materials last received in materials inventory is considered to be the 
 origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory; 
``materials inventory'' means,                                          
  (a) with respect to a producer of a good, an inventory of fungible    
   materials that are used in the production of the good, and           
  (b) with respect to a person from whom the producer of the good       
   acquired those fungible materials, an inventory from which fungible  
   materials are sold or otherwise transferred to the producer of the   
   good;                                                                
``opening inventory'' means the materials inventory at the time an      
 inventory management method is chosen;                                 
``origin identifier'' means any mark that identifies fungible materials 
 as originating materials or non-originating materials.                 
                                                                        
                                 General

    The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible   
 materials referred to in section 7(16)(a) of this appendix are         
 originating materials are the following:                               
  (a) specific identification method;                                   
  (b) FIFO method;                                                      
  (c) LIFO method; and                                                  
  (d) average method.                                                   
SECTION 3.                                                              
    Where a producer of a good or a person from whom the producer       
 acquired the materials that are used in the production of the good     
 chooses an inventory management method referred to in section 2, that  
 method, including the averaging period chosen in the case of the       
 average method, shall be used from the time the choice is made until   
 the end of the fiscal year of the producer or person.                  
                                                                        
                     Specific Identification Method                     
                                                                        
SECTION 4.

(1) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (2), where the        
 producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the specific       
 identification method, the producer or person shall physically         
 segregate, in materials inventory, originating materials that are      
 fungible materials from non-originating materials that are fungible    
 materials.                                                             
(2) Where originating materials or non-originating materials that are   
 fungible materials are marked with an origin identifier, the producer  
 or person need not physically segregate those materials under          
 subsection (1) if the origin identifier remains visible throughout the 
 production of the good.                                                
                                                                        
                             Average Method

    Where the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the   
 average method, the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from        
 materials inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of         
 originating materials and non-originating materials in materials       
 inventory that is calculated under sections 6 through 8.               
SECTION 6.                                                              
(1) Except as otherwise provided in sections 7 and 8, the ratio is      
 calculated with respect to a month or three-month period, at the choice
 of the producer or person, by dividing                                 
  (a) the sum of                                                        
    (i) the total units of originating materials or non-originating     
     materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials   
     inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-    
     month period, and                                                  
    (ii) the total units of originating materials or non-originating    
     materials that are fungible materials and that were received in    
     materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month 
     period,                                                            
by                                                                      
  (b) the sum of                                                        
    (i) the total units of originating materials and non-originating    
     materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials   
     inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-    
     month period, and                                                  
    (ii) the total units of originating materials and non-originating   
     materials that are fungible materials and that were received in    
     materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month 
     period.                                                            
(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding month or three-    
 month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials 
 remaining in materials inventory at the end of the preceding month or  
 three-month period.

(1) Where the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement   
 and the regional value content is calculated under the net cost method 
 and the producer or person chooses to average over a period under      
 sections 6(15), 11(1), (3) or (6), 12(1) or 13(4) of this appendix, the
 ratio is calculated with respect to that period by dividing            
  (a) the sum of                                                        
    (i) the total units of originating materials or non-originating     
     materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials   
     inventory at the beginning of the period, and                      
    (ii) the total units of originating materials or non-originating    
     materials that are fungible materials and that were received in    
     materials inventory during that period,                            
by

(1) Where the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement   
 and the regional value content of that good is calculated under the    
 transaction value method or the net cost method, the ratio is          
 calculated with respect to each shipment of the good by dividing       
  (a) the total units of originating materials or non-originating       
   materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials     
   inventory prior to the shipment,

(1) Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), where   
 the producer or person referred to in section 3 has fungible materials 
 in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible materials is        
 determined by                                                          
  (a) identifying, in the books of the producer or person, the latest   
   receipts of fungible materials that add up to the amount of fungible 
   materials in opening inventory;                                      
  (b) determining the origin of the fungible materials that make up     
   those receipts; and                                                  
  (c) considering the origin of those fungible materials to be the      
   origin of the fungible materials in opening inventory.               
(2) Where the producer or person chooses the specific identification    
 method and has, in opening inventory, originating materials or non-    
 originating materials that are fungible materials and that are marked  
 with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible materials is   
 determined on the basis of the origin identifier.                      
(3) The producer or person may consider all fungible materials in       
 opening inventory to be non-originating materials.

    The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible   
 goods referred to in section 7(16)(b) of this appendix are originating 
 goods are the following:                                               
  (a) specific identification method;                                   
  (b) FIFO method;

  (d) average method.                                                   
SECTION 12.                                                             
    Where an exporter of a good or a person from whom the exporter      
 acquired the good chooses an inventory management method referred to in
 section 11, that method, including the averaging period chosen in the  
 case of the average method, shall be used from the time the choice is  
 made until the end of the fiscal year of the exporter or person.       
                                                                        
                     Specific Identification Method                     
                                                                        
SECTION 13.                                                             
(1) Except as provided under subsection (2), where the exporter or      
 person referred to in section 12 chooses the specific identification   
 method, the exporter or person shall physically segregate, in finished 
 goods inventory, originating goods that are fungible goods from non-   
 originating goods that are fungible goods.                             
(2) Where originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible  
 goods are marked with an origin identifier, the exporter or person need
 not physically segregate those goods under subsection (1) if the origin
 identifier is visible on the fungible goods.                           
                                                                        
                             Average Method

(1) Where the exporter or person referred to in section 12 chooses the  
 average method, the origin of each shipment of fungible goods withdrawn
 from finished goods inventory during a month or three-month period, at 
 the choice of the exporter or person, is determined on the basis of the
 ratio of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods 
 inventory for the preceding one-month or three-month period that is    
 calculated by dividing                                                 
  (a) the sum of                                                        
    (i) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods   
     that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory  
     at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, 
     and                                                                
    (ii) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods  
     that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods   
     inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period,   
by                                                                      
  (b) the sum of                                                        
    (i) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods  
     that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory  
     at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, 
     and                                                                
    (ii) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods 
     that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods   
     inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.   
(2) The calculation with respect to a preceding month or three-month    
 period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible goods remaining 
 in finished goods inventory at the end of the preceding month or three-
 month period.

(1) Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), where   
 the exporter or person referred to in section 12 has fungible goods in 
 opening inventory, the origin of those fungible goods is determined by 
  (a) identifying, in the books of the exporter or person, the latest   
   receipts of fungible goods that add up to the amount of fungible     
   goods in opening inventory;                                          
  (b) determining the origin of the fungible goods that make up those   
   receipts; and                                                        
  (c) considering the origin of those fungible goods to be the origin of
   the fungible goods in opening inventory.                             
(2) Where the exporter or person chooses the specific identification    
 method and has, in opening inventory, originating goods or non-        
 originating goods that are fungible goods and that are marked with an  
 origin identifier, the origin of those fungible goods is determined on 
 the basis of the origin identifier.                                    
(3) The exporter or person may consider all fungible goods in opening   
 inventory to be non-originating goods.

\1\ ``O'' denotes originating materials.                                                                        
\2\ ``N'' denotes non-originating materials.                                                                    
\3\ ``OI'' denotes opening inventory.                                                                           


Example 1: FIFO method                                                  
    Good A is subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producer 
 A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value
 content of Good A.                                                     
    By applying the FIFO method:                                        
(1) the 100 units of originating Material A in opening inventory that   
 were received in materials inventory on 12/18/93 are considered to have
 been used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/
 94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the      
 production of those goods is considered to be $0;

(2) the 100 units of non-originating Material A in opening inventory    
 that were received in materials inventory on 12/27/93 and 600 units of 
 the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in        
 materials inventory on 01/01/94 are considered to have been used in the
 production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94; therefore,  
 the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those 
 goods is considered to be $110 (100 units x $1.10);                    
(3) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A
 that were received in materials inventory on 01/01/94 and 600 units of 
 the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in    
 materials inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to have been used in the
 production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; therefore,
 the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those 
 goods is considered to be $660 (600 units x $1.10); and                
(4) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating       
 Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/94 and   
 500 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were       
 received in materials inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to have been
 used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94; 
 therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the          
 production of those goods is considered to be $440 (400 units x $1.10).
Example 2: LIFO method                                                  
    Good A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement  
 and the non-originating Material A used in the production of Good A    
 does not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification.       
 Therefore, where originating Material A is used in the production of   
 Good A, Good A is an originating good and, where non-originating       
 Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is a non-       
 originating good.                                                      
    By applying the LIFO method:                                        
(1) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were
 received in materials inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to have been
 used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94; 
(2) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were    
 received in materials inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to have been
 used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94; 
(3) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Material A that   
 were received in materials inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to have
 been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/
 20/94; and                                                             
(4) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Material A
 that were received in materials inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to
 have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 
 01/23/94.                                                              
Example 3: Average method                                               
    Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content           
 requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to       
 determine the regional value content of Good A. Producer A determines  
 the average value of non-originating Material A and the ratio of       
 originating Material A to total value of originating Material A and non-
 originating Material A in the following table.

(1) before the shipment of the 100 units of Material A on 01/10/94, the 
 ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A  
 in materials inventory was .50 (1,100 units/2,200 units) and the ratio 
 of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in 
 materials inventory was .50 (1,100 units/2,200 units); based on those  
 ratios, 50 units (100 units  x  .50) of originating Material A and 50  
 units (100 units  x  .50) of non-originating Material A are considered 
 to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped 
 on 01/10/94; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in
 the production of those goods is considered to be $52.50 [100 units  x 
 $1.05 (average unit value)  x  .50]; the ratios are applied to the     
 units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the         
 shipment: 1,050 units (2,100 units  x  .50) are considered to be       
 originating materials and 1,050 units (2,100 units  x  .50) are        
 considered to be non-originating materials;                            
(2) before the shipment of the 700 units of Good A on 01/15/94, the     
 ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A  
 in materials inventory was 66% (2,050 units/3,100 units) and the ratio 
 of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in 
 materials inventory was 34% (1,050 units/3,100 units); based on those  
 ratios, 462 units (700 units  x  .66) of originating Material A and 238
 units (700 units  x  .34) of non-originating Material A are considered 
 to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped

 A in materials inventory was 36% (1,584 units/4,400 units) and the     
 ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material
 A in materials inventory was 64% (2,816 units/4,400 units); based on   
 those ratios, 360 units (1,000 units  x  .36) of originating Material A
 and 640 units (1,000 units  x  .64) of non-originating Material A are  
 considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of   
 Good A shipped on 01/20/94; therefore, the value of non-originating    
 Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be   
 $684.80 [1,000 units  x  $1.07 (average unit value)  x  64%]; those    
 ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials   
 inventory after the shipment: 1,224 units (3,400 units  x  .36) are    
 considered to be originating materials and 2,176 units (3,400 units  x 
 .64) are considered to be non-originating materials;                   
(4) before the shipment of the 900 units of Good A on 01/23/94, the     
 ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A  
 in materials inventory was 36% (1,224 units/3,400 units) and the ratio 
 of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in 
 materials inventory was 64% (2,176 units/3,400 units; based on those   
 ratios, 324 units (900 units  x  .36) of originating Material A and 576
 units (900 units  x  .64) of non-originating Material A are considered 
 to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped 
 on 01/23/94; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in
 the production of those goods is considered to be $616.32 [900 units  x
  $1.07 (average unit value)  x  64%]; those ratios are applied to the  
 units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the         
 shipment: 900 units (2,500 units  x  .36) are considered to be         
 originating materials and 1,600 units (2,500 units  x  .64) are        
 considered to be non-originating materials.                            
Example 4: Average method                                               
    Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content           
 requirement. Producer A is using the net cost method and is averaging  
 over a period of one month under section 6(15)(a) of this appendix to  
 determine the regional value content of Good A.                        
    By applying the average method:                                     
  the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of        
   Material A in materials inventory for January 1994 is 40.4% (2,100

  based on that ratio, 1,091 units (2,700 units  x  .404) of originating
   Material A and 1,609 units (2,700 units-1,091 units) of non-         
   originating Material A are considered to have been used in the       
   production of the 2,700 units of Good A shipped in January 1994;     
   therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the        
   production of those goods is considered to be $0.64 per unit [$5,560 
   (total value of Material A in materials inventory)/ $5,200 (units of 
   Material A in materials inventory) = $1.07 (average unit value)  x   
   (1-.404)] or $1,728 ($0.64  x  2,700 units); and                     
  that ratio is applied to the units of Material A remaining in         
   materials inventory on January 31, 1994: 1,010 units (2,500 units  x 
   .404) are considered to be originating materials and 1,490 units     
   (2,500 units-1,010 units) are considered to be non-originating       
   materials.                                                           
                                                                        
                                                                        


                               ADDENDUM B

    The following ``examples'' are based on the figures set out in the  
 table below and on the assumption that Exporter A acquires originating 
 Good A and non-originating Good A that are fungible goods and          
 physically combines or mixes Good A before exporting those goods to the
 buyer of those goods.

<SUP>3 ``OI'' denotes opening inventory.                                                                             


Example 1: FIFO method                                                  
    By applying the FIFO method:                                        
(1) the 100 units of originating Good A in opening inventory that were  
 received in finished goods inventory on 12/18/93 are considered to be  
 the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94;                           
(2) the 100 units of non-originating Good A in opening inventory that   
 were received in finished goods inventory on 12/27/93 and 600 units of 
 the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished   
 goods inventory on 01/01/94 are considered to be the 700 units of Good 
 A shipped on 01/15/94;                                                 
(3) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A    
 that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/01/94 and 600     
 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received  
 in finished goods inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to be the 1,000 
 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; and                               
(4) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A
 that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/94 and 500     
 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in   
 finished goods inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to be the 900 units
 of Good A shipped on 01/23/94.                                         
Example 2: LIFO method                                                  
    By applying the LIFO method:                                        
(1) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were    
 received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to be  
 the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94;                           
(2) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were        
 received in finished goods inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to be  
 the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94;                           
(3) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Good A that were  
 received in finished goods inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to be  
 the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; and                     
(4) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Good A    
 that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/16/94 are         
 considered to be the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94.          
Example 3: Average method                                               
    Exporter A chooses to determine the origin of Good A on a monthly   
 basis. Exporter A exported 3,000 units of Good A during the month of   
 February 1994. The origin of the units of Good A exported during that  
 month is determined on the basis of the preceding month, that is       
 January 1994.                                                          
    By applying the average method:                                     
  the ratio of originating goods to all goods in finished goods         
   inventory for the month of January 1994 is 40.4% (2,100 units/5,200  
   units);                                                              
  based on that ratio, 1,212 units (3,000 units  x  .404) of Good A     
   shipped in February 1994 are considered to be originating goods and  
   1,788 units (3,000 units - 1,212 units) of Good A are considered to  
   be non-originating goods; and

  that ratio is applied to the units of Good A remaining in finished    
   goods inventory on January 31, 1994: 1,010 units (2,500 units  x     
   .404) are considered to be originating goods and 1,490 units (2,500  
   units - 1,010 units) are considered to be non-originating goods.

     weighted principal payments were calculated, and                   
  (b) rounding the amount determined under paragraph (a) to the nearest 
   single decimal place and, where that amount is the midpoint between  
   two such numbers, to the greater of those two numbers;               
``weighted principal payment'' means,

\1\ The principal balance represents the loan balance at the end of each full year the loan is in effect and is calculated by subtracting the current   
  year's principal payment from the prior year's ending loan balance.                                                                                   
\2\ Interest payments are calculated by multiplying the prior year's ending loan balance by the contract interest rate of 6 percent.                    
\3\ Principal payments are calculated by subtracting the current year's interest payments from the annual payment schedule amount.                      
\4\ The weighted principal payment is determined by, for each year of the loan, multiplying that year's principal payment by the number of years the    
  loan had been in effect at the end of that year.                                                                                                      
\5\ The weighted average principal maturity of the contract is calculated by dividing the sum of the weighted principal payments by the original loan   
  amount and rounding the amount determined to the nearest decimal place.

    $5,977,993.19/$1,000,000=5.977993 or 6 years \5\                    
By applying the above method:                                           
  (1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule   
   under the 6 percent contract is 6 years;                             
  (2) the yields on the closest maturities for comparable federal       
   government debt obligations of 5 years and 7 years are 4.7 percent   
   and 5.0 percent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation,
   the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity
   equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract is  
   4.85 percent. This number is calculated as follows:

  (3) the producer's contract interest rate of 6 percent is within 700  
   basis points of the 4.85 percent yield on the comparable federal     
   government debt obligation; therefore, none of the producer's        
   interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for 
   purposes of the definition ``non-allowable interest costs.''

    The following example is based on the figures set out in the tables 
 below and on the following assumptions:                                
  (a) a producer in a NAFTA country borrows $1,000,000 from a person of 
   the same NAFTA country under a variable-rate contract;               
  (b) under the terms of the contract, the loan is payable in 10 years  
   with interest paid at the rate of 6 percent per year for the first   
   two years and 8 percent per year for the next two years on the       
   principal balance, with rates adjusted each two years after that;    
  (c) the payment schedule calculated by the lender based on the terms  
   of the contract requires the producer to make annual payments of     
   principal and interest of $135,867.96 for the first two years of the 
   loan, and of $146,818.34 for the next two years of the loan;         
  (d) there are no federal government debt obligations that have        
   maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity 
   of the first two years of the contract;                              
  (e) there are no federal government debt obligations that have        
   maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity 
   of the third and fourth years of the contract; and                   
  (f) the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in       
   maturity to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract  
   are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 percent 
   and 3.5 percent respectively.

By applying the above method:                                           
  (1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of
   the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;                    
  (2) the yield on the closest maturities of federal government debt    
   obligations of 1 year and 2 years are 3.0 and 3.5 percent,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Weighted Average Principal Maturity                                     
    $1,608,102.62/$843,712.01=1.905985 or 1.9 years                     
By applying the above method:                                           
  (1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule   
   under the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;              
  (2) the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in       
   maturities to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract
   are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 and 3.5 
   percent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the    
   yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity    
   equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment      
   schedule of the first two years of the contract is 3.45 percent. This
   amount is calculated as follows:                                     
                                                                        
    3.0+[((3.5-3.0) x (1.9-1.0))/(2.0-1.0)]                             
    =3.0+0.45                                                           
    =3.45%                                                              
                                                                        
  (3) the producer's contract interest rate, for the third and fourth   
   years of the loan, of 8 percent is within 700 basis points of the    
   3.45 percent yield on federal government debt obligations that have  
   maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity 
   of the payment schedule under the third and fourth years of the      
   producer's loan contract; therefore, none of the producer's interest 
   costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes 
   of the definition ``non-allowable interest costs''.

    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles means the recognized       
 consensus or substantial authoritative support in the territory of a   
 NAFTA country with respect to the recording of revenues, expenses,     
 costs, assets and liabilities, disclosure of information and

merchandise.
    (2) Valuable waste. When waste has a value and the manufacturer or

paid merchandise or drawback products appearing in the articles, it 
shall keep records to show the factory value of the imported duty-paid 
merchandise or drawback products used and the factory value of the 
waste. In liquidating the drawback entry, the quantity of imported duty-

result from the use of merchandise, records shall show the value of each 
product at the time of separation.
    (ii) Claim covering a manufacturing period. Where the operation 
results in two or more products and a claim covers a manufacturing 
period rather than a manufacturing lot, the time of separation of the 
products shall be considered the entire period covered by the claim, and

value for the period. Manufacturing periods in excess of one month may 
not be used without specific approval of Customs.
    (b) Storage and identification. The merchandise and articles to be 
exported shall be stored in a manner which will enable the manufacturer, 
producer, or claimant (1) to determine, and the Customs officials to 
verify, the applicable import entry, certificate of delivery, or 
certificate of manufacture and delivery number or numbers; and (2) to

procedure approved by Customs.
    (d) Complementary records. When Customs Headquarters or the drawback 
office, in appropriate cases, determines that a manufacturer or producer 
is unable to record all the information required for drawback, 
complementary records covering the information not available to the 
manufacturer or producer may be kept by the person(s) in the United

Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)).

letter. General drawback contracts covering substitution will be revised 
to provide for tradeoff.

331. The drawback claimant shall file with the appropriate drawback 
office the manufacturing drawback entry and/or certificate in duplicate 
on Customs Form 331, if claiming under 19 U.S.C. 1313 (a) or (b). The 
drawback office may require an additional copy for administrative use.
    (2) Customs Form 331--Additional uses. The drawback claimant shall 
file with the appropriate drawback office the original drawback entry on 
Customs Form 331 in the two instances listed below. The drawback office 
may require an additional copy for administrative use.
    (i) Certificates of manufacture filed prior to entry. When the 
drawback claimant files a certificate of manufacture prior to the filing 
of the entry, he shall file the entry on Customs Form 331 and refer to 
the certificate of manufacture in the entry by the official number 
instead of describing the particulars of importation and manufacture.
    (ii) Purchase of manufactured articles for exportation. A purchaser 
of a completely manufactured article who exports it and claims drawback 
shall file an entry on Customs Form 331.
    (3) Filing in two or more drawback offices. If the drawback entry is 
filed at a drawback office other than where the certificate of 
manufacture is on file, the drawback office where the certificate is on 
file, after liquidation and at the request of the person filing the 
certificate or to whom such merchandise was delivered, shall transmit to 
the drawback office where the entry is filed an extract on Customs Form 
4537. The extract shall be considered an original certificate for 
liquidation purposes.
    (4) Two or more shipments. One entry may cover several shipments.
    (b) Evidence of exportation--(1) Notice of exportation. When the 
entry covers exports under Sec. 191.52(c)(2) of this part, the claimant 
shall file with the entry one copy of the notice of exportation and the 
original or a certified copy of the supporting document. For an entry 
under Secs. 191.52(c)(1) and 191.54, the claimant shall file with the 
entry one copy of the notice of exportation.
    (2) Evidence of right to drawback. The notice of exportation shall 
show that the merchandise was shipped by the person filing the drawback 
entry, or shall be endorsed by the person in whose name the merchandise 
was shipped showing that the person filing the entry is authorized to 
claim drawback and receive payment.

of this part, the claimant shall file with the entry one copy of the 
chronological summary of exports.
    (c) Multiple claimants--(1) Notice of Exportation. Where more than 
one party claims drawback (e.g., a chemical manufactured under drawback 
regulations is exported in a container also manufactured under drawback 
regulations), each drawback claimant shall file a separate notice of 
exportation describing the component product to which its claim will 
relate. Each notice shall show the name of the claimant and bear a 
statement that the claim shall be limited to its respective component 
product. The exporter shall endorse the

[[Page 490]]

notices, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants. 
The notice of exportation shall be numbered in accordance with 
Sec. 191.52(d) of this part.
    (2) Exporter's summary procedure. Where more than one party claims 
the drawback (e.g., a chemical manufactured under drawback regulations 
is exported in a container also manufactured under drawback 
regulations), and the parties elect to use the exporter's summary 
procedure, each drawback claimant shall complete and file a 
chronological summary of exports for the respective component product to 
which its claim will relate. Each claimant shall identify in the 
chronological summary the name of the other claimant or claimants and 
the component product for which each will claim drawback independently.
    (d) Vessels or aircraft. For drawback under section 313(g), Tariff 
Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(g)), the claimant shall file 
with the drawback entry a copy of the part of the construction contract 
showing that the vessel or aircraft was built for foreign account and 
ownership. In the case of a vessel, except a warship, the claimant also 
shall file a certificate of clearance for a foreign port and a certified 
copy of the registry certificate or, in its place, a certificate of the 
consul of the foreign nation to which the vessel belongs, showing that 
the vessel has been documented under the flag of that country. No 
certificates of clearance or foreign documentation shall be required for 
a warship.

<R05>
Sec. 191.63  Summary of papers filed.

    The claimant may file with the drawback entry a summary, in 
duplicate, of the papers filed showing the date of application for 
official documents. When verified, one copy of the summary shall be 
receipted and returned to the claimant, and the other copy attached to 
the drawback entry.


<R05>
Sec. 191.64  Supplementary filing.

may amend or correct a drawback entry or file a timely supplemental 
entry. Corrections or amendments permitted shall be certified by the

<R05>
Sec. 191.65  Certification of delivery.

    (a) When required. If the merchandise used in the manufacture of the 
exported articles was not imported by the manufacturer of the articles, 
no drawback shall be allowed until the drawback claimant files with the 
drawback office where the claim is to be liquidated a manufacturing 
drawback entry and/or certificate in duplicate on Customs Form 331, or 
official evidence of the existence of the form filed at another place. 
The form must describe the merchandise delivered, tracing it from the 
custody of the importer to the custody of the manufacturer.
    (b) Intermediate transfer. If the merchandise was not delivered 
directly from the importer to the manufacturer, each intermediate 
transfer shall be described on the manufacturing drawback entry and/or 
certificate (Customs Form 331), certified by the person through whose 
possession the merchandise passed.
    (c) Consignee as importer. When the consignee named in an entry 
summary declares another person to be the actual owner, the consignee 
shall be considered the importer for drawback purposes, even though the 
consignee files an owner's declaration under section 485(d), Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)). The drawback claimant shall 
file a manufacturing drawback entry and/or certificate (Customs Form 
331), showing the initial transfer from the consignee to the person to 
whom delivery was made.
    (d) Warehouse transfer and withdrawals. The person in whose name 
merchandise is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse shall be considered the 
importer for drawback purposes. No manufacturing drawback entry and/or 
certificate (Customs Form 331) is required covering prior transfers of 
merchandise while in a bonded warehouse.

Sec. 191.66  Certificates of manufacture and delivery.

    (a) When required. If the imported merchandise has undergone some 
process of manufacture before delivery, and the wholly or partially 
manufactured article thereafter is used in the manufacture of some other

purchased for exportation without further manipulation, the drawback 
claimant, whether the manufacturer or the exporter, shall file a 
manufacturing drawback entry and/or certificate on Customs Form 331.
    (b) Subcontractors. If a subcontractor performs work, which for 
drawback purposes does not constitute a manufacture or production, with

drawback claim, and if there is a problem in identifying the merchandise 
the subcontractor returns to the principal from the merchandise received 
from the principal, the subcontractor shall complete a manufacturing 
drawback entry and/or certificate (Customs Form 331). If there is no 
problem of identification, the subcontractor shall complete only the 
delivery section of the form. If complementary records are maintained by 
a subcontractor's principal (see Sec. 191.22(d)), and Customs determines 
no problems of identification exist, it may waive the filing of Customs 
Form 331 for transfers between principal and subcontractor, whether the 
subcontractor's operation involves manufacture or not.
    (c) Identifying manufacturing drawback entry and/or certificates. 
Drawback claimants may identify the relevant manufacturing drawback 
entry and/or certificates on drawback entries covering the exported

merchandise exported in the same condition as when imported, or 
destroyed under Customs supervision and not used within the United 
States before such exportation or destruction (see Sec. 191.4(a)(9)).
    (2) Time of exportation or destruction. Drawback shall be allowed on 
imported merchandise if exported or destroyed under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section before the close of the 3-year period beginning on the date 
of importation.
    (3) Use. The performing of incidental operations (including, but not 
limited to, testing, cleaning, repacking, and inspecting) on the 
imported merchandise itself, not amounting to manufacture or production 
for drawback purposes shall not be treated as a use of that merchandise 
for purposes of applying paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Filing and documentation prior to exportation--(1) Filing. An 
exporter-claimant who desires to export merchandise with drawback under 
19 U.S.C. 1313(j) shall file with the drawback office a completed 
Customs Form 7539. The exporter-claimant also shall furnish a copy of 
the import entry or identify the import entry, date of entry, and port 
of entry under which the merchandise was imported into the United 
States. It shall certify that the merchandise is in the same condition 
as when imported and not used within the United States before such 
exportation. Transfers shall be documented by certificates of delivery 
(see Sec. 191.65).
    (2)(i) Time of filing. The completed Customs Form 7539 shall be 
filed with the drawback office at least 5 working days prior to the date 
of intended exportation of the merchandise, unless the Customs officer 
approves a shorter filing period.

[[Page 501]]

    (ii) Waiver of prior notice of intent to export. A request for a 
waiver of prior notice by an exporter-claimant shall be in writing to 
the drawback office. The appropriate Customs officer may waive prior 
notice at any time for any exporter-claimant. An exporter-claimant shall 
be granted this waiver after filing with the appropriate Customs 
official six consecutive claims free of substantial error, provided that 
such exporter-claimant has operated under the same condition program for 
a minimum of six months. An exporter-claimant who repeatedly files 
inaccurate claims may have the privilege (of filing without prior 
notice) revoked. Customs will so notify the exporter-claimant in writing 
of the revocation as soon as possible.
    (3) Examination--(i) Decision to examine. Within 3 working days 
after Customs Form 7539 is filed, the exporter-claimant shall be 
notified whether Customs will examine the merchandise. If the exporter-
claimant is not notified within the 3-day period, the exporter-claimant 
shall export the merchandise without delay.
    (ii) Time and place of examination. If the appropriate Customs 
officer determines to examine the merchandise, he shall notify the 
exporter-claimant of the time and place of the examination. The 
examination shall be completed within 5 working days after the filing of 
Customs Form 7539, unless failure to examine during this period is 
caused by the exporter-claimant. If the examination is completed at a 
port other than the port of intended exportation, the exporter-claimant 
shall transport the merchandise in-bond to the port of exportation.
    (iii) Extent of examination. The appropriate Customs officer may 
permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine 
routinely (to the extent he determined necessary) items exported, 
provided such examinations do not exceed 10 percent of the total items 
exported (i.e., merchandise in one of ten claims could be examined). If 
the Customs officer believes it is necessary to examine more than 10 
percent of the exported items, he shall present the reasons to 
Headquarters and obtain approval for such other examination.
    (c) Completion of drawback entry for exported merchandise. Within 3 
years after exportation of merchandise under Sec. 191.141(b), an 
exporter-claimant shall complete his drawback claim by filing with the 
same Customs officer who received Customs Form 7539 evidence of 
exportation under the procedures described in Sec. 191.52 (notice of 
exportation) or Sec. 191.54 (certified notice of exportation by mail) of 
this part.
    (d) Alternative procedure for exported merchandise. In place of the 
procedures set forth in Secs. 191.141 (b) and (c), an exporter-claimant 
may apply with the drawback office for permission to use the exporter's 
summary procedure (see Sec. 191.53). If the request is approved, the 
exporter-claimant shall complete a drawback claim no later than 3 years 
after exportation. When this alternative procedure is used, no prior 
notice of intent to export or examination is necessary for purposes of 
obtaining drawback.
    (e) General. The provisions relating to direct identification 
drawback shall apply to claims for drawback under this subpart insofar 
as applicable to and not inconsistent with the provisions of this 
subpart. Specifically, Secs. 191.22 (b) and (c), and 191.65 are 
applicable to drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j).
    (f) Drawback on destroyed merchandise--(1) Procedure. A claimant 
desiring to destroy merchandise to collect drawback under same condition 
drawback shall file with the drawback office a completed Customs Form 
7539. At least 7 working days prior to the intended date of destruction, 
the exporter-claimant shall notify the appropriate Customs officer of 
the time and place of destruction, by submitting Customs Form 3499 with 
Customs Form 7539 at the location wherein the destruction is to occur. 
It shall certify that the merchandise is in the same condition as when 
imported and not used within the United States before such destruction. 
Destruction of merchandise after such notification on Customs Form 3499 
shall be deemed to have occurred under Customs supervision.
    (2) Completion of drawback entry. After destruction, the claimant 
and any Customs officer who witnessed destruction

[[Page 502]]

shall certify on Customs Form 7539 or an attachment thereto the time and 
place of destruction.

liquidated or reliquidated by the applicable drawback office.
    (2) Upon review of a drawback claim by the liquidator, if the claim 
is determined to be incomplete, the liquidator shall notify promptly the 
claimant, who shall then have the opportunity to amend the claim prior 
to its denial. The claimant shall respond in writing within 20 days of 
Customs notice.
    (3) If the claim is denied, the claimant shall be notified in 
accordance with Secs. 159.9 and 159.10 of this chapter.

possesses imported merchandise (the designated merchandise) during some 
time interval in period A (defined below) and also possesses other 
merchandise fungible with it (the substituted merchandise) during the 
same or different time interval in period A, then 99 percent of the duty 
paid on the designated merchandise will be refunded as drawback, 
provided that:

either at the time of substitution, the time X used it in manufacturing, 
or at the time X transferred it to another person, whichever occurs 
first;
    (2) The substituted merchandise is in the same condition when 
exported or destroyed under Customs supervision as was the designated 
merchandise when imported;
    (3) X does not issue a certificate of delivery covering the

    The following are general definitions for the purposes of this 
subpart A.
    Export. ``Export'' refers to the transportation of merchandise out 
of the U.S. for the purpose of being entered into the commerce of a 
foreign country.
    Self-propelled vehicle. ``Self-propelled vehicle'' includes any 
automobile, truck, tractor, bus, motorcycle, motor home, self-propelled 
agricultural machinery, self-propelled construction equipment, self-
propelled special use equipment, and any other self-propelled vehicle 
used or designed for running on land but not on rail.
    Ultimate purchaser. ``Ultimate purchaser'' means the first person, 
other than a dealer purchasing in his capacity as a dealer, who in good 
faith purchases a self-propelled vehicle for purposes other than resale.
    Used. ``Used'' refers to any self-propelled vehicle the equitable or 
legal title to which has been transferred by a manufacturer, 
distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser.


<R05>
Sec. 192.2  Requirements for exportation.

    (a) Basic requirements. A person attempting to export a used self-
propelled vehicle shall present to Customs, at the port of exportation, 
both the vehicle and a document describing the vehicle, which includes 
the Vehicle Identification Number or, if the vehicle does not have a 
Vehicle Identification Number, the product identification number. 
Exportation of a vehicle will be permitted only upon compliance

[[Page 507]]

with these requirements, unless the vehicle was entered into the United 
States under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary 
Importation Bond; a vehicle entered under an in-bond procedure, or under 
a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond is exempt from these 
requirements. The person attempting to export the vehicle may employ an 
agent for the exportation of the vehicle.
    (b) Documentation required. In the case of automobiles, trucks, 
motorcycles and buses, original or certified copies of Certificate of 
Title (or other document if a Certificate of Title is not available as a 
result of state statutory requirements), and 2 facsimiles of the 
original or certified copy, shall be presented. In other cases, a 
certificate of title, memorandum of ownership, or right of possession, 
or any other document sufficient to prove lawful ownership, such as a 
bill of sale or a sales invoice, or a certified copy of any of these 
documents, as well as 2 facsimiles of the original or certified copy, 
shall be presented.
    (c) When presented. If the vehicle is to be transported by vessel or 
aircraft, the documentation and vehicle must be presented at least 3 
days prior to lading. If the vehicle is to be transported by rail, 
highway, or under its own power, the documentation must be presented 3 
days prior to exportation of the vehicle, and the vehicle must be 
presented on the day of exportation.
    (d) Authentication of documentation. Customs shall authenticate both 
facsimile documents, one of which shall remain in the possession of the 
exporter and one of which shall be collected by Customs. Authentication 
will include the stamping of the facsimile documents with the date of 
presentation of the documents. The authenticated facsimile document will 
be the only acceptable evidence from the exporter of compliance with the 
requirements of this section.
